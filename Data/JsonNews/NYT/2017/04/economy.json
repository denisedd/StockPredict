{"Headline": "Australian Rules Would Make So-Called 457 Visa Harder for Migrants", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Saying he was \u201cputting Australians first,\u201d Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced plans on Tuesday to replace a special visa category that allows some temporary foreign workers to enter Australia.The rules would make it harder for skilled migrants to work in the country. Mr. Turnbull said that the special category, the so-called 457 visa, would be abolished in favor of two new temporary visas requiring more work experience and, in some cases, greater English skills. Current holders of the visa, who number about 95,000, would not be affected.\u201cWe will no longer allow 457 visas to be passports to jobs that could and should go to Australians,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said. \u201cWe\u2019re putting jobs first, and we\u2019re putting Australians first.\u201dThe prime minister said the changes would attract better-skilled workers and encourage the hiring of Australians instead of cheaper foreign labor.Joanna Howe, an associate professor of law at the University of Adelaide, said that Australia was hewing to a similar argument.\u201cThat rhetoric is very consistent with the rhetoric from Donald Trump around protecting American jobs and also from Theresa May\u2019s government in the United Kingdom post-\u2018Brexit,\u2019 ensuring that U.K. workers get first access to jobs,\u201d she said.The 457 visa in Australia was expected to bolster the country\u2019s economy by enlisting foreign workers to fill skill shortages. \u201cThe scheme has blown out significantly from its original numbers,\u201d Dr. Howe said. \u201cIt\u2019s being used in occupations where Australian graduates are struggling to find work \u2014 occupations like accounting and teaching and nursing. There have been concerns around exploitation of the 457 visa holders but also around whether Australian workers are getting first access to jobs.\u201dFar-right parties like One Nation and left-leaning labor unions have expressed concerns about the number of temporary migrant workers in Australia. But Dean McEvoy, chief executive of the technology industry group TechSydney, said he was worried about the abolition of the program.\u201cAny plans to cut back on the tech industry\u2019s ability to bring in expertise from overseas before more Australians have been adequately trained in I.T. will only harm the industry and the future of jobs in this country,\u201d Mr. McEvoy said.Workers in about 650 occupations can qualify under the 457 program in Australia. That will be reduced to no more than 435 under the new system.The new visas will be available in two-year and four-year versions, with the longer one being targeted to higher-skilled positions and requiring greater English proficiency.\u201cAustralia is the most successful multicultural nation in the world \u2014 we are an immigrant nation,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said. \u201cBut the fact remains, Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Is Expected to Pare Investment Holdings, Officials Signal", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve expects to start reducing its huge investment holdings later this year, unwinding a giant program undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis to revive the economy.The holdings \u2014 which amount to more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage securities \u2014 are a legacy of the Fed\u2019s campaign to help the economy recover from the depths of a recession. The Fed, increasingly confident that the American economy is \u201cat or near maximum employment,\u201d is beginning to loosen its grip on the economy, according to an official account that the Fed published Wednesday.Both the low rates and the investments were intended to support growth by encouraging risk-taking and borrowing by consumers and businesses. Now the Fed is gradually reducing that support.No decision was made about the timing or the details of any move to reduce the Fed\u2019s holdings.The markets took the news with relative calm, suggesting that investors share the central bank\u2019s assessment that the economy is getting closer to walking without crutches. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has traded in a narrow range since December, even as the Fed has raised rates twice.Indeed, some analysts said the Fed might need to take stronger steps to end its stimulus campaign.\u201cFinancial conditions remain very accommodative, and in our view the central bank has more work to do to minimize the risks of financial imbalances building up in worrisome ways,\u201d said Bob Miller, the head of BlackRock\u2019s U.S. multi-sector fixed income team.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dipped after the Fed\u2019s account was published at 2 p.m., closing at 2,352.95, down 0.31 percent on the day. But the index has still climbed more than 5 percent so far this year.Some Fed officials also are nervous about the stock market\u2019s climb, the account said. It noted that stock prices are \u201cquite high relative to standard valuation measures,\u201d and that some Fed officials saw a risk to the economy \u201cif, for example, financial markets were to experience a significant correction.\u201dThe Fed accumulated trillions in Treasuries and mortgage securities in a series of campaigns after the 2008 financial crisis as part of its effort to put downward pressure on borrowing costs. It has maintained the size of those holdings by reinvesting the proceeds from maturing securities; it can shrink the portfolio by doing nothing \u2014 simply refraining from investing in replacement securities.Accumulating the bonds forced other investors to compete for the remaining stock by accepting lower interest rates from borrowers. That amplifies the effect of the Fed\u2019s primary tool, its direct suppression of short-term rates. Shrinking the portfolio would gradually reduce the force of that effect, easing downward pressure on rates.Mr. Dudley said the Fed might take a break from raising short-term interest rates as it begins to reduce the balance sheet, to appraise the consequences.The meeting account said that Fed must decide whether to end reinvestment abruptly or gradually, and whether to deal with Treasuries and mortgage bonds on the same timetable. The account said the discussion would continue at the Fed\u2019s next policy meeting, on May 2 and 3.The meeting account also emphasized that the Fed\u2019s economic outlook has held steady in recent months. Fed officials have said they do not see evidence of an improvement in the nation\u2019s economic trajectory since the election of President Trump. But growth has remained strong enough to move forward with rate increases.The Fed account said \u201cnearly all participants\u201d have concluded that the American economy is \u201cat or near maximum employment.\u201d The unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in February, a level consistent with the normal churn of hiring and firing.Inflation, sluggish since the crisis, had also perked. Though, most Fed officials were not yet satisfied with this count. \u201cNearly all members judged that the committee has not yet achieved its objective for headline inflation on a sustained basis,\u201d the account said. The Fed wanted prices to rise about 2 percent a year.The Fed, which predicted a continued improvement in economic conditions at the start of the year, has said that it expects to raise rates three times in 2017. It now appears the Fed may take the additional step of beginning to shrink its investment holdings by the end of the year, somewhat earlier than expected.The Fed has said its forecasts do not incorporate the potential impact of policy changes proposed by Mr. Trump. The central bank has adopted a wait-and-see posture. The account said most officials do not expect any impact before 2018.\u201cMembers continued to judge that there was significant uncertainty about the effects of possible changes in fiscal and other government policies,\u201d the account said, \u201cbut that near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly balanced.\u201d\u201cThe perception seems to be that the outcome of each FOMC meeting depends on nuances of incoming data, with the base case being no change in rates,\u201d Mr. Rosengren said of the Fed\u2019s policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. \u201cMy own view is that an increase at every other FOMC meeting over the course of this year could and should be the committee\u2019s default.\u201dBill Miller was incorrectly identified in an earlier version as head of BlackRock\u2019s fixed income team. He is the head of the U.S. multi-sector fixed income team.Advertisement"}

About 54,000 coal jobs were in mining.It's important to note that power creation isn\u2019t the only source of energy employment. The Energy Department report found another 2.3 million jobs in energy transmission, storage and distribution, a number that includes powerline and pipeline workers and more than 900,000 retail jobs, such as gas station workers and fuel dealers. If non-traditional energy workers are included in the mix \u2013 those involved in manufacturing and installing energy-efficient products \u2013 the total number of energy-related jobs swells to 6.4 million.Employees in industry per 10,000 workers52050100200SolarCoalWindHydroelectricNatural gasOil and other fossil fuelsEmployees in industry per 10,000 workers52050100200SolarCoalWindHydroelectricNatural gasOil and other fossil fuelsEmployees in industry per 10,000 workers52050100200SolarCoalWindHydroelectricNatural gasOil and other fossil fuelsEmployees in industry per 10,000 workers52050100200SolarCoalWindHydroelectricOil and other fossil fuelsNatural gasOf course, energy jobs aren\u2019t equally distributed throughout the country.California, a state with robust renewable energy standards and installation incentives, had the highest rate of solar power jobs per capita last year.

{"Headline": "The Little-Known Officials on Whom Trump\u2019s Agenda May Rely", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byFilling the RanksWASHINGTON \u2014 By most accounts, the Trump administration is running behind many of its predecessors in filling out its ranks. Under secretaries still need confirmation, staff members need to be hired and advisers named.And yet, across the federal government, the middle tiers of the executive branch\u2019s agencies, departments and White House offices \u2014 the people who will ultimately shape President Trump\u2019s agenda \u2014 are beginning to come to life.Here are a few of the less-than-boldface names among them who are likely to play an outsize role in accomplishing Mr. Trump\u2019s highest-priority items.Chief of staff to the Environmental Protection Agency administrator Since he started in politics at 18, Ryan T. Jackson had more or less worked for one man: James M. Inhofe, the powerful Oklahoma Republican who is one of the Senate\u2019s most ardent skeptics of climate change.It took another Oklahoma conservative who is set on rolling back climate regulations \u2014 Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump\u2019s new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 to lure him away.As Mr. Pruitt\u2019s chief of staff, Mr. Jackson will be asked to help orchestrate a near complete turnaround of many of the agency\u2019s highest-profile regulations \u2014 efforts that environmentalists are poised to fight aggressively.And as the administrator\u2019s gatekeeper and one of the agency\u2019s chief liaisons to the White House and Congress, he is likely to play a central role in slashing the agency\u2019s 15,000-person staff and more than $8 billion budget.Mr. Jackson did not agree to an interview for this article, but his predecessor did.\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult job, and it will be even more difficult, I think, to try to reverse course in certain instances,\u201d said Matt Fritz, who served as the agency\u2019s chief of staff from 2015 through January, when Democrats were in charge. \u201cYou are asking the same staff who defended a rule or an approach to reverse back.\u201dMr. Jackson was educated in Oklahoma, where he earned a law degree. Before joining Mr. Inhofe\u2019s staff, he was an assistant district attorney and then counsel to the Senate\u2019s Committee on the Environment and Public Works, of which Mr. Inhofe is a member.With that background, Mr. Jackson has long been enmeshed in a policy area he will now seek to remake. He has known Mr. Pruitt for more than a decade and helped prepare him for his Senate confirmation hearing this year.Mr. Inhofe said that he expected that Mr. Jackson, a Washington veteran, would do the same to help smooth the way for Mr. Pruitt\u2019s chosen deputies.\u201cHe\u2019s going to definitely be the one who is going to explain the ways of Washington and how to get things done and how to make these conversions,\u201d Mr. Inhofe said.Deputy assistant to the president and House deputy director of legislative affairsThe repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. Tax reform legislation. A trillion-dollar infrastructure bill. The Trump administration\u2019s first-year legislative agenda is anything but modest, and it has already faltered.To salvage it, the White House first has to win over the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, who controls the legislative process. Few administration figures will play a bigger role in doing so than Joyce Meyer.The White House\u2019s deputy director of legislative affairs in charge of relations with the House, Ms. Meyer, 45, is serving as both sounding board and communicator between two prominent addresses on Pennsylvania Avenue. But she has an asset: a decades-long working relationship with Mr. Ryan.Both Wisconsin natives, Ms. Meyer and Mr. Ryan first served alongside each other as Senate staff members in the 1990s. Their careers have been intertwined ever since.When Mr. Ryan was elected to the House in 1998, Ms. Meyer was one of his first hires. When he ran for vice president, she followed him onto the campaign trail. And when he reluctantly became speaker in 2015, she was there, as a deputy chief of staff and a member of Mr. Ryan\u2019s inner circle.Mr. Ryan, in a statement released in February after the announcement of her new position, said that though the loss was \u201cpersonal for me,\u201d Ms. Meyer\u2019s move to the White House was \u201cthe country\u2019s gain.\u201d He called her \u201cmore than a close confidante, more than a friend, she is family.\u201dThe White House hopes that familiarity can help smooth what has been at times a less than harmonious relationship between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump, who have tried to put aside personal and ideological differences since the election to set the direction for the Republican Party.\u201cIt\u2019s basically just real-time dialogue both internally here with the team at the White House and also with the House,\u201d Ms. Meyer said, while describing her role in an interview.In the administration\u2019s earliest days, that largely meant helping to shepherd legislation that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act. Ms. Meyer spent weeks meeting with members of Congress and their staffs to try to build support and iron out differences for legislation that was backed by both the White House and the speaker\u2019s office.The effort ultimately failed, but Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan stayed in close contact and maintained a united front in public.As attention turns to tax reform legislation, the divisions that emerged among House Republicans during the health care push are only likely to become more pronounced. And it remains unclear if Ms. Meyer\u2019s old boss and her new one are in agreement on how to proceed.Special assistant to the president for tax and retirement policyAs a member of the House Ways and Means Committee tax staff in the early 2000s, Shahira Knight was on the front line to watch the fight to secure the Bush-era tax cuts. Almost two decades later, with a businessman in the White House and his party plotting a true overhaul to the nation\u2019s tax code for the first time in a generation, she was not about to sit this one out.\u201cThis is a rare window,\u201d Ms. Knight said in a telephone interview. \u201cTo make it happen you do need a willing Congress and a willing president, and that hasn\u2019t happened in a long time.\u201dMs. Knight, 46, knows firsthand. An economist by training, she has worked on financial policy in one way or another for two decades. She has been a staff member for Congress\u2019s Joint Economic Committee, an aide and then senior adviser to the Ways and Means Committee, and a top executive at an industry trade group and, most recently, at Fidelity Investments.Now, Ms. Knight is a special assistant for tax and retirement policy to a president whose pledges for tax and regulatory reform have sent markets soaring with expectation. The stakes were only raised further in recent weeks, when intraparty fissures helped sink Republicans\u2019 hopes of repealing the Affordable Care Act and shifted attention squarely to taxes.Ms. Knight\u2019s task is to try to harmonize a cacophony of competing interests so that the White House can speak with a single voice in what is sure to be a prolonged legislative fight.\u201cOur role in the N.E.C. is to be coordinators of White House policy,\u201d Ms. Knight said, referring to the National Economic Council. \u201cWe take all different internal views and put them on the table.\u201dMs. Knight reports directly to Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser. But on tax reform, those \u201cinternal views\u201d are coming from many of the administration\u2019s most important figures, including the Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, and the president himself.That work had largely played out behind the scenes in the administration\u2019s earliest days, as Washington focused on health care. But now that Mr. Trump has declared he is ready to move on to tax reform, the economic council\u2019s work has lurched to the forefront.Where the White House will come down on several main points, like a so-called border adjustment tax on imported goods that is favored by House Republicans, remains uncertain. The outcome could be significant in determining their legislative success.But the broadest goals guiding the effort should be clear, Ms. Knight said: significantly lowering the corporate tax rate and the rates paid by middle-class Americans.\u201cJobs, jobs, and more jobs \u2014 and then some more jobs after that,\u201d Ms. Knight said. \u201cWe kind of view tax reform completely through a job lens.\u201dAssistant to the president and director of trade and industrial policyFor much of his academic career, Peter Navarro had protectionist views on international trade and economics considered so far outside the mainstream that few economists found grounds to agree with him.Then he met Mr. Trump.Now, after a stint advising Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the unconventional economist is leading a new national council on trade and manufacturing, placing him at the center of the policy-making world, even as his views remain outside the academic mainstream.His mandate, according to a White House announcement, is to help \u201cdevelop trade policies that shrink our trade deficit, expand our growth and help stop the exodus of jobs from our shores.\u201dBy Mr. Navarro\u2019s account, that means working on two fronts. First, he leads a small \u201cSWAT team\u201d intended to help American companies, manufacturers, farmers and ranchers navigate the federal bureaucracy and conflicts with foreign trading partners. Mr. Navarro said in an interview that he is focused on \u201cputting people to work and keeping them at work in our manufacturing base.\u201dAt the same time, he will play a supporting role to the commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross, and eventually to Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, to renegotiate the country\u2019s trade pacts, beginning with the North American Free Trade Agreement.\u201cThe one lesson I have learned and brought to Washington is to just focus on the mission,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cAnd the mission is to create jobs for the American people and defend our manufacturing base.\u201dFar from a cloistered academic, Mr. Navarro, 67, is no stranger to politics. In the 1990s, running as a Democrat or independent, he went on a series of unsuccessful campaigns for mayor of San Diego, the United States House of Representatives and then the City Council. He has spent most of his career, though, teaching courses in economics and public policy at the University of California at Irvine.It was Mr. Navarro\u2019s sharp \u2014 and contrarian \u2014 views on global trade that first caught Mr. Trump\u2019s attention several years ago. Mr. Navarro has argued that foreign trading partners systematically cheat the rules and harm the American worker \u2014 positions that meshed well with Mr. Trump\u2019s own views. Most economists view foreign trade as broadly beneficial.And like Mr. Trump, he has held little back over the years in arguing that position or remedies to narrow trade deficits. In his 2012 documentary, \u201cDeath by China,\u201d a knife labeled \u201cMade in China\u201d slowly stabs a bleeding map of the United States.How influential Mr. Navarro\u2019s worldview will be in a White House with competing interests remains to be seen, but his seat at the table is well placed.\u201cWe are really small,\u201d Mr. Navarro said of the trade council. \u201cBut the point is that in the Trump business model, when you are at the White House, you are able to leverage the rest of the bureaucracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Budget Leaves New York-Area Transit Projects Up in the Air", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byWhen the new president is a lifelong New Yorker promising a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, many believed New York would be first in line to benefit from the spending spree.But only two months into President Trump\u2019s administration, elected leaders in New York and New Jersey are alarmed that some of the most high-profile and crucial transit projects in the region are already on the chopping block.That project is considered essential to helping alleviate congestion on the subway system, especially on the nearby Lexington Avenue line, the nation\u2019s most crowded subway. A new Hudson River tunnel is needed to remedy a deteriorating bottleneck and improve rail service throughout the Northeast.\u201cThis is a dagger to the heart of the Gateway project that is so vital to our economy,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a vocal critic of Mr. Trump on many issues, said in an interview.Mr. Schumer, a Democrat and the Senate minority leader, said he would fight the cuts to New Starts, a program that has benefited large cities with ambitious projects.\u201cNew York is No. 1 on the list because we\u2019re the biggest city, and we\u2019re by far and away the biggest mass-transit city,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed cuts have reverberated across the country with transit agencies worried that an array of projects could be halted or delayed, including a subway extension in Los Angeles, a light rail plan in Maryland and a rapid transit bus line in Kansas City, Mo. Over all, the Department of Transportation\u2019s budget would be cut by 13 percent, or $2.4 billion.Mr. Trump\u2019s budget suggested that new transit projects should rely on local financing \u2014 a major shift in how such projects have been financed in recent decades. Still, it is early in the budget process, and Congress will weigh in on the cuts in the coming months.\u201cThese agencies count on a strong federal partner,\u201d said Andrew Brady, senior director for government affairs at the American Public Transportation Association. \u201cThere has been a federal role in public transportation since Ronald Reagan put it there.\"President Reagan signed a law in 1983 that raised the federal gas tax and reserved some of the money for public transit projects. The New Starts grant program was created in 1991 under the Federal Transit Administration, though conservative voices like the Heritage Foundation want to see it eliminated. Under Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, only New Starts projects that have already secured full financing agreements would receive money.Officials are moving forward with a $4.8 billion proposal to extend a train line west through San Jose, Calif., to the city of Santa Clara, said Stacey Hendler Ross, a spokeswoman for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority. The agency is not \u201cpanicking yet,\u201d she said, since it is early in the budget process. Officials plan to request $1.5 billion in federal funding.\u201cIt\u2019s such a strong project for the economic vitality of this region,\u201d she said.The trillion-dollar question is how Mr. Trump\u2019s broader infrastructure proposal could affect public transit and how it would be paid for. The new transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said recently that the initiative would be unveiled this year and that, in addition to transportation, it could focus on energy, water, broadband and veterans hospitals.As the Trump administration develops the plan, it is possible that major transit expansion projects could be part of the initiative, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak about the plan while it was still under discussion. The official said a key component would be partnerships with the private sector to complete infrastructure projects.In New York, Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats, have criticized the transportation cuts and other budget proposals that could hurt the city. The next phase of the Second Avenue subway is expected to cost about $6 billion, and officials planned to rely on $2 billion in New Starts funding. It is unclear if the project could proceed without federal funding.\u201cDefunding all of New Starts has a very big impact on us, and we hope that won\u2019t happen,\u201d said Fernando Ferrer, the acting chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that runs New York\u2019s subway, buses and commuter railroads.The first three stations of the Second Avenue subway finally opened on the Upper East Side this year after nearly a century of planning and debate. The second phase would extend the line to 125th Street \u2014 an expansion officials say is critical during a period of booming subway ridership.The saga surrounding a new train tunnel under the Hudson River has also been tumultuous. Mr. Christie, a Republican who once led Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, has thrown his support behind the Gateway project. But nearly seven years ago, Mr. Christie canceled an earlier plan because of cost concerns.Since then, officials have grown increasingly anxious about the century-old tunnel currently used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains. It was damaged by Hurricane Sandy and needs major repairs.\u201cWhether it ultimately comes from New Starts money or from a new infrastructure program that\u2019s passed sometime this year is really of no moment to me,\u201d Mr. Christie told reporters. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to, you know, go jumping off the cliff quite yet.\u201d\u201cNew York has the most ambitious building plan in the nation, and it\u2019s absurd the federal government claimed these projects were a priority one day and then cut funding for them the next,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.Mr. Schumer had even harsher words for the Trump administration.\u201cHow can you say you believe in dramatically increasing infrastructure and submit a budget this way?\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a total contradiction. It\u2019s schizophrenic.\u201dCommuters have recently received a preview of how traveling between the two states could become a nightmare if the current tunnel is closed for emergency repairs. Last month, an Amtrak train derailed near the tunnel, closing half of Pennsylvania Station\u2019s tracks and leading to widespread train cancellations and delays. Then on Monday, a New Jersey Transit train derailed in the same area, setting off another round of delays.\u201cWithout this project and this tunnel, that becomes the day-to-day existence for commuters, and I don\u2019t think anybody wants that to happen,\u201d said Carlo A. Scissura, the president of the New York Building Congress, a group that represents the city\u2019s construction industry.\u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent designed,\u201d Mr. Porcari said. \u201cThe permits are in hand.

Democrats have seized on that decision, uniting around a pledge not to cooperate on any rewriting of the tax code unless they know specifically how that revision would benefit the billionaire president and his family.And a growing roster of more than a dozen Republican lawmakers now say Mr. Trump should release them.\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t release his returns, it is going to make it much more difficult to get tax reform done,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, pointing out that the president has significant conflicts of interest on issues such as taxation of the real estate industry and elimination of the estate tax. \u201cIt\u2019s in his own self-interest.\u201dWith Republicans sharply divided on a path forward and the administration unable to come up with a plan of its own, the Democratic resistance is only the newest impediment.A tax overhaul could be the next expansive Trump campaign promise that falters before it even gathered much steam.\u201cIf they have no plan, they can\u2019t negotiate,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the economist who helped Mr. Trump devise his campaign tax plan. \u201cIn that case, tax reform is dead.\u201dRepublican leaders in Congress also failed to create momentum. Speaker Paul D. Ryan built a tax blueprint around a \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax that would have imposed a steep levy on imports, hoping to encourage domestic manufacturing while raising revenue that could be used to lower overall tax rates. But it has been assailed by retailers, oil companies and the billionaire Koch brothers. With no palpable support in the Senate, its prospects appear to be nearly dead. Heading into a congressional recess, Mr. Ryan admitted that Republicans in the House, Senate and White House were not on the same page.The president\u2019s own vision for a new tax system is muddled at best. In the past few months, he has called for taxing companies that move operations abroad, waffled on the border tax and, last week, called for a \u201creciprocal\u201d tax that would match the import taxes other countries impose on the United States.But it is Mr. Trump\u2019s own taxes that have provided the crucial leverage for his opponents. More than 100,000 of his critics took to the streets over the weekend in marches around the country, demanding that the president release his returns. Tax legislation, they say, could be a plot by Mr. Trump to get even richer.\u201cWhen they talk about tax reform, are they talking about cutting Donald Trump\u2019s taxes by millions of dollars a year?\u201d asked Ezra Levin, a member of the Tax March executive committee. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201dBeyond the politics of Mr. Trump\u2019s returns, lawmakers do not want to pass an overhaul of the tax code that unwittingly enriches the commander in chief and his progeny. Those who are worried about conflicts of interest point to the potential repeal of the estate tax or elimination of the alternative minimum tax as provisions that would enrich Mr. Trump.Perhaps the most consequential concern relates to a House Republican proposal to get rid of a rule that lets companies write off the interest they pay on loans \u2014 a move real estate developers and Mr. Trump vehemently oppose. Doing so would raise $1 trillion in revenue and reduce the appeal of one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite business tools: debt.In the halls of Congress, Democrats are employing procedural maneuvers to drive home their point on the tax returns and possibly compel Republican lawmakers to join their effort to force Mr. Trump to release them. And Democratic aides say more tricks are coming.More than a dozen Republicans \u2014 from recognizable names like Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa and Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina to backbenchers like Representatives David Young of Iowa, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, Ted Yoho of Florida, Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey and Justin Amash of Michigan \u2014 have agreed that Mr. Trump should release his returns.That list grows almost daily. On Monday, former Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois, a conservative firebrand and Trump loyalist, said the president should release his tax returns. \u201cI do think this issue will come back and bite him on the butt,\u201d he said on MSNBC.Republicans argue that Democrats are putting politics ahead of an opportunity to fix a broken tax system. Mr. Trump shot back at his critics on Twitter on Sunday, suggesting that the protesters had been paid and that they were sore losers. On Monday, Mr. Spicer said that Mr. Trump remained under audit and that, breaking with 40 years of presidential tradition, his tax returns would not be made public.\u201cI think the president\u2019s view on this has been very clear from the campaign, and the American people understood it when they elected him in November,\u201d Mr. Spicer said.Polls show that a majority of Americans, including most Republicans, would like Mr. Trump to release his tax returns, according to the Republican pollster Frank Luntz. However, the issue is a low priority for voters.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to change someone\u2019s opinion of Trump merely by what\u2019s in his tax returns,\u201d Mr. Luntz said.It remains unclear what impact the emphasis on Mr. Trump\u2019s taxes will have on his aspirations of tackling the tax code.Mr. Schumer said he had had no communication with the president about tax legislation and only minimal outreach from his economic advisers. While Mr. Trump signaled that he would like to reach a bipartisan tax deal, potentially including an infrastructure plan, the focus on his tax returns suggests that any legislation will happen along party lines. That would mean that a more limited bill, requiring a simple majority, would need to pass the Senate through complicated budget rules that create a new set of problems.With little appetite for bipartisanship, many veterans of tax fights and lobbyists in Washington expect that Mr. Trump will ultimately embrace straight tax cuts, with some cleaning up of deductions, and call it a victory. Even that would be difficult, with a narrow Republican majority in the Senate and a widening budget deficit.Former Representative Dave Camp of Michigan \u2014 a Republican who, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, released a tax plan in 2014 \u2014 said that if they wanted to get something done, lawmakers needed to brace for a more intense series of battles over the details of tax legislation than they faced during the failed health care effort.\u201cObviously, there is a lot at stake here,\u201d Mr. Camp said. \u201cHealth care is 20 percent of the economy, but tax reform is 100 percent of the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Middle Class Contracted in U.S. Over 2 Decades, Study Finds", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byMike McCabe\u2019s neighbors in rural Gillespie, Ill., consider him lucky. After being out of work for a year, he landed a job in January making cardboard boxes at a nearby Georgia-Pacific plant for $19.60 an hour.He would agree with them, were it not for the fact that his previous job in a steel mill near St. Louis paid $28 an hour. \u201cI\u2019ve had to rethink my whole life to make ends meet on what I\u2019m now making,\u201d Mr. McCabe said. \u201cThe middle class is struggling for sure, and almost anybody in my position will tell you that.\u201dWhat is more, as Mr. McCabe\u2019s experience suggests, the authors of the Pew study found a broader contraction of the American middle class, even as the ranks of the poor and the rich have grown.For example, between 1991 and 2010, the proportion of adults in middle-income households fell to 59 percent from 62 percent, while it rose to 67 percent from 61 percent over the same period in Britain and to 74 percent from 72 percent in France.Households that earned from two-thirds to double the national median income were defined as middle income in the Pew study; in the United States that translated into annual income of $35,294 to $105,881, after taxes, in 2010.A shrinking middle class is not necessarily cause for alarm, if the reason for the contraction is that more people are moving up the income ladder, said David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The proportion at the top did rise, but so did the proportion at the bottom, rising to 26 percent from 25 percent. That is much more worrisome, said Mr. Autor, who was not involved with the Pew study.Moreover, the middle-income group was smaller \u2014 and the groups at either extreme larger \u2014 in the United States than in any of the 11 Western European countries studied.And incomes in the middle rose faster in Europe than they did in the United States, according to Pew. Median incomes in the middle tier grew by 9 percent in the United States between 1991 and 2010, compared with a 25 percent gain in Denmark and a 35 percent increase in Britain.The United States, including the middle class, has a higher median income than nearly all of Europe, even if the Continent is catching up. The median household income in the United States was $52,941 after taxes in 2010, compared with $41,047 in Germany and $41,076 in France.And while inequality may be widening, the proportion of households in the upper-income strata rose to 15 percent from 13 percent.\u201cFinancially, the U.S. remains well ahead of the countries in Europe,\u201d Mr. Kochhar said. \u201cThe difference is how incomes have evolved, and they are catching up.\u201dAlthough the cutoff of the study, 2010, may have highlighted weak income gains because it was in the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession, he said that was not enough to alter the study\u2019s findings.\u201cIt\u2019s a clear trend that the middle class in the U.S. is shrinking and not keeping up financially with the upper-income group,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an aura of redistribution of income from middle income to upper income.\u201dWhether in Europe or the United States, technological change and globalization mean that people who can adapt and learn new skills can reap bigger rewards, Mr. Kochhar said.Since founding LaSalle Network, a staffing company based in Chicago, with two employees nearly 20 years ago, Tom Gimbel has watched revenues grow to a projected $70 million this year.\u201cI know a lot of people who have done much better in the last five years,\u201d he said. \u201cI have people working for me who made $35,000 to $60,000 a few years ago and are earning $60,000 to $150,000 now.\u201dMr. Gimbel, who grew up in a comfortable Chicago suburb, has seen his own fortunes improve as well. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want for anything, but my dad wasn\u2019t rolling in money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve succeeded beyond where my parents were.\u201dOn both sides of the Atlantic, the pressure on the middle class is translating into frustration with the political establishment and distrust of the elites.Like his father and uncle, Mr. McCabe worked at the U.S. Steel mill in Granite City, Ill. But after the plant was idled in late 2015, he looked for a new job rather than waiting to be called back if the economy improved.As a result, Mr. McCabe voted for Donald J. Trump in the presidential election last year, even though he grew up in what he calls a staunchly Democratic home. \u201cMy dad is probably rolling over in his grave,\u201d he said.\u201cBut I liked Trump\u2019s message that he was going to help the middle class and get the jobs back,\u201d Mr. McCabe said. \u201cI was amazed that he won, and sat up all night watching.\u201d\u201cYou can only wait so long, and your unemployment runs out and you run out of choices,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m divorced with no kids.

{"Headline": "How Soviet Dissidents Ended 70 Years of Fake News", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byRed CenturyIn the summer of 1990, at a fulcrum moment when his country was tipping from reform to dissolution, Mikhail S. Gorbachev spoke to Time magazine and declared, \u201cI detest lies.\u201d It was a revolutionary statement only because it came from the mouth of a Soviet leader.On the surface, he was simply embracing his own policy of glasnost, the new openness introduced alongside perestroika, the restructuring of the Soviet Union\u2019s command economy that was meant to rescue the country from geopolitical free-fall. Mr. Gorbachev was wagering that truthful and unfettered expression \u2014 a press able to criticize and investigate, history books without redacted names, and honest, accountable government \u2014 just might save the creaking edifice of Communist rule.For the Soviet leader, glasnost was \u201ca blowtorch that could strip the layers of old and peeling paint from Soviet society,\u201d wrote the Baltimore Sun\u2019s Moscow correspondent (and now Times reporter) Scott Shane in \u201cDismantling Utopia: How Information Ended the Soviet Union.\u201d \u201cBut the Communist system proved dry tinder.\u201dWe in the West have always praised Mr. Gorbachev for his courage in taking this gamble \u2014 even though he lost an empire in the process \u2014 but he did it under pressure. The idea that a better relationship with facts might be liberating for a corrupt and ailing Soviet Union was not new. Mr. Gorbachev was echoing and appropriating the arguments of a dissident movement that, for decades, had made an insistence on truth its essential form of resistance.If the Soviet Union was the 20th century\u2019s greatest example of a regime that used propaganda and information to control and contain its citizens \u2014 70 years of fake news! \u2014 the centenary of the Bolshevik Revolution is an important moment to appreciate how it also produced a powerful countercurrent in the civil society undergrounds of Moscow and Leningrad.True internal pushback against the Soviet regime began to emerge only in the 1960s, at the moment when the political temperature inside Russia was moving from post-Stalinist thaw back to chilly. The suppressions began with the trial of the satirical writers Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky in early 1966. As protests and further trials followed, the dissidents were faced with an interesting dilemma: how to fight back most effectively in light of the information that was coming their way. Almost daily, they would hear the details of interrogations, stories passed around about life in the labor camps, and the drumbeat of searches and arrests.The dissidents could have presented their own form of propaganda, hyping the persecution and turning that rich Soviet lexicon of \u201chooligans\u201d and \u201cantisocial elements\u201d into bitter screeds against the state itself. But they didn\u2019t. They chose instead to communicate it all as dispassionately and clinically as possible. They reached for what we might call objectivity.Generations of Soviet citizens had trained themselves to think of factuality as a highly relative concept. The newspapers were read as a narrative meant to glorify the state and not as a reflection of reality. And people likewise felt split into authentic private selves that often had nothing to do with their public faces and utterances.Given how much of Soviet society was built on this decadeslong duplicity, it is remarkable and reassuring that speaking truly and plainly still held such power for the dissidents by the 1960s. But it did. To hear Lyudmila Alexeyeva, one of the early organizers of a key underground journal engaged in this fact-gathering, A Chronicle of Current Events, describe it, the attraction was almost religious:\u201cFor each of us who worked for the Chronicle, it meant to pledge oneself to be faithful to the truth, it meant to cleanse oneself of the filth of double-think, which has pervaded every phase of Soviet life,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe effect of the Chronicle is irreversible. Each one of us went through this alone, but each of us knows others who went through this moral rebirth.\u201dIn its meticulous commitment to holding the Soviet Union accountable to its own laws and international treaties, A Chronicle of Current Events represented also a rebirth of civil society. It was a small community, and one that existed entirely on the onion-skin-thin pages of samizdat, the illegal, self-published writing of the dissidents, but this was where they could act as citizens, witnessing and reporting on violations of human and civil rights.Over some 65 issues, from 1968 to 1983, the Chronicle became a catalog of abuses, noted in the most sparse, neutral tone possible. It was a painstaking effort to publish information that could never be obtained through the official Soviet media. Here, a citizen could read the details of closed political trials and the stories of what the Chronicle called \u201cextrajudicial persecution,\u201d understand what a K.G.B. search entailed, read secret documents meant only for those in power, learn about the constant religious and cultural persecution and get updates on political prisoners in the East.The Moscow Helsinki Watch Group, as the monitoring organization became known, followed the style of the Chronicle, producing a range of reports, all scrupulously researched and running sometimes to hundreds of pages. Among the first were investigations of the persecution of Crimean Tatars and the poor caloric intake of prisoners. The reports were delivered to Western embassies, as well as circulated in samizdat form. Soon, copycat watchdog groups popped up in other Eastern bloc countries, and even in the United States. The one based in New York, Helsinki Watch, became the organization we know today as Human Rights Watch.Did this underground quest for truth based on scrupulous, objective reporting hasten the downfall of the Soviet Union?The dissidents had created an expectation that a different kind of language was possible, one that expressed a reality not filtered through Soviet imperatives. They craved honesty and transparency in a country where even the suicide rate was considered a state secret. Samizdat provided the outlet.And facts, relentlessly stacked one on top of another, became the dissidents\u2019 way of building the different Russia they hoped might one day emerge and overcome all the lying.Gal Beckerman is the author of \u201cWhen They Come for Us, We\u2019ll Be Gone,\u201d a history of the Soviet Jewry movement, and a forthcoming book on social media before the internet.This is an essay in the series Red Century, about the history and legacy of communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biggest Threat to Job Growth", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byTaking NoteThe slowdown, however, is no cause for worry \u2014 yet. Even with relatively weak growth in March, job creation has averaged 178,000 a month over the past three months, about even with the 182,000 average over the past year, indicating a steady job market.There were also signs of improving conditions last month. The unemployment rate fell, from 4.7 percent in February to 4.5 percent, as did the underemployment rate, which fell from 9.2 percent in February to 8.9 percent. Those improvements suggest that the economy is still en route to full employment \u2014 and that policy makers, including President Trump, have a nice tailwind.Federal Reserve policy makers, for their part, have indicated their intention to raise interest rates gradually this year to keep inflation at bay as the economy continues to recover. But they would do well to err on the side of caution. Unemployment is falling, but history indicates that it could fall further still before sparking wage increases and higher prices. In fact, recent wage growth \u2014 even in the face of falling unemployment \u2014 has generally only kept up with inflation, rather than outpacing it in the way that leads to an overheating economy.Here\u2019s the sliver of hope: Mr. Trump\u2019s wrongheaded ideas do not appear headed to fruition anytime soon. The Fed may yet curb its eagerness to raise rates and, in any event, could reverse rate increases if they proved untimely. Left to its own devices, the economy might simply forge ahead on its path toward full employment. In the current political moment, doing no harm would be an achievement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making a Living With Airbnb", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byThe first paying guest Evelyn Badia invited into her home was Ted, a professor from Amsterdam. Ted was a coffee drinker, but Evelyn didn\u2019t own a coffee maker. \u201cMy first mistake as a host,\u201d Ms. Badia said. \u201cI don\u2019t drink coffee. Why would I get a coffee maker?\u201d She promptly went out and bought one.Ted, it turned out, didn\u2019t mind the oversight. When he traveled again to New York a few months later, this time with his wife, the couple stayed with Ms. Badia, whose guests have given her a five-star rating. \u201cAs an Airbnb host you have to remember, it\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about them.\u201dJosh Meltzer, the head of New York public policy for Airbnb, disagrees. \u201cAirbnb helps thousands of New Yorkers get by in an increasingly expensive city,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the current law groups responsible New Yorkers, who occasionally share their own home, with illegal hotels that remove permanent housing from the market.\u201dMr. Meltzer hopes a state law will be passed to distinguish between Airbnb hosts who follow housing regulations and those who don\u2019t, and that would allow Airbnb to collect hotel taxes on behalf of the state. To that end, Airbnb so far has made agreements with 11 rural New York counties to collect a hotel tax from hosts. The counties of New York City have yet to reach such an agreement with the company.For people who need extra income, Airbnb offers a self-regulating (via guest and host reviews), free-market solution for collecting short-term market-rate rents.\u201cI was very nervous the first time,\u201d Ms. Badia said. \u201cBut like I said, Ted was wonderful.\u201d Her house is on a quiet street in Park Slope, Brooklyn, not far from the restaurants and bars on Fifth Avenue. The two-family home, a duplex topped by a private apartment, is an ideal situation for a host. Through Airbnb, she rents out the upstairs two-bedroom, which she used to rent to a long-term tenant, and she also rents out a room in the downstairs duplex that she calls home. It\u2019s so ideal that Ms. Badia, 50, says she grosses nearly $100,000 each year from hosting. But her financial life was not always so lucrative.In 2010, Ms. Badia\u2019s career as a freelance commercial producer cratered. Undercut by younger producers willing to work for less, her income dropped more than 50 percent. When she did her taxes for the year, she discovered that she had worked a mere 20 days. \u201cThat was a big reality check,\u201d she said. \u201cHosting on Airbnb wasn\u2019t a choice. It was decided for me.\u201d\u201cThis is the sad part,\u201d she added. \u201cI tear up because I get emotional about it, but you\u2019re lost in your house, saying to yourself, how am I going to keep my home?\u201d\u201cSometimes I hear people having sex in the other room,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. I have earplugs.\u201d\u201cHosting is a journey,\u201d she added. \u201cFirst, the host is nervous to start, then they\u2019re excited, then they see the money.\u201d But when the host comes across a bad guest or feels taken for granted, she said, \u201cthey say, \u2018Oh my God, I hate these people.\u2019\u201dDespite the good income she earns through Airbnb each year, Ms. Badia does not feel financially secure. Much of the money she earns goes back into the house for upkeep. She also needs a financial strategy to make it through the slow months of January, February and March.\u201cAnd you have to deal with the fact that you\u2019re going to live with strangers for the rest of your life,\u201d she said.\u201cI always thought I was going to work,\u201d she said. \u201cI was never going to retire. Only old people retire.\u201d But now Ms. Deans, who sells furniture on commission for a retailer in Brooklyn, has decided she wants to retire at 66.A self-described introvert, and a one-time \u201cJeopardy!\u201d champion, Ms. Deans earns enough from her commissions to meet monthly expenses but not much more. In a busy week, she can make up to $560 from renting out her extra room. Her first guests were a couple from Belgium. Ms. Deans was so nervous, unsure of what level of hospitality the guests would expect when they arrived, that she went out and bought too much food. \u201cI overdid it, but they were so nice and chill,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky I never had bad people.\u201dNever? \u201cWell, the weirdest thing that happened was the father-son duo from Italy,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThey sat around in their underwear watching soccer. I was like, O.K., I guess it\u2019s all right. After they left, the house smelled like feet for two days.\u201dHosts rely in part on Airbnb\u2019s guest reviews to decide whom to allow into their homes. Ms. Deans spends a lot of time emailing with guests, largely trusting her gut to screen out potential bad actors before she lets them book.She turned down \u201ca bunch of college party guys\u201d and was suspicious of \u201ctwo girls who were almost 18 and their mothers said they could come to New York.\u201d She also says no to people who have \u201cridiculous requests, like \u2018Can I smoke weed in the room?\u2019\u201dWhen she retires, Ms. Deans would like to move to Florida and rent or buy a house near Orlando, where she could host families headed to Walt Disney World. \u201cAirbnb is my retirement plan,\u201d she said, \u201cuntil I go to the nursing home or I hit the lottery or, you know, meet the maker, one of the three.\u201dMs. Cames had recently advertised five rentals on Airbnb in the four-unit, mixed-use building in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, that she bought with her ex-husband through a limited liability company in 2015 for $2.15 million. While Ms. Cames\u2019s primary residence is in nearby Clinton Hill, her ex-husband and daughter lived in the building, each in a newly subdivided unit where they hosted tourists. Ms. Cames hosted three more rentals among the other two units, for a total of five listings.Ms. Cames said that inspectors had arrived with badges and told the occupants that \u201cthey just wanted to talk to tenants and make sure everyone was safe.\u201d At the time, she was hosting a family of French tourists with a baby. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for the tourists to travel to such an expensive city like New York and feed their family at restaurants three times a day,\u201d she said. \u201cThey like the convenience of an apartment and the ability to spread out a little bit and not be in a generic hotel room.\u201dThe inspectors issued partial vacate orders for two units that they believed had been illegally subdivided and lacked proper egress. They also issued citations for converting permanent housing into transient use, working without a permit for the construction of additional units, failing to provide adequate fire alarms and sprinklers for transient use, and violating the building\u2019s certificate of occupancy. Additionally, Ms. Cames was fined $5,000 \u2014 $1,000 for each of her five Airbnb listings in a building where she did not live. Had Ms. Cames offered the spaces in a one- or two-family house where she was also a permanent resident, she would have been in compliance with the listing law.Ms. Cames said she had paid the fines and stopped listing on Airbnb. She estimated that her listings accounted for 30 percent of her annual income.\u201cThe city will continue enforcement efforts against bad actors who take permanent housing off the market,\u201d said Melissa Grace, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cWe use these tools to protect New Yorkers and visitors alike.\u201dIt would seem that as a landlord who is aware of the city\u2019s regulations against transient rentals, Ms. Cames could have played it safe and rented only to long-term tenants. But she said she saw too much supply in the Brooklyn market to make that option viable, mainly because of all the recent development in Downtown Brooklyn, which has increased inventory. At her primary residence, the two-family house in Clinton Hill, Ms. Cames said an apartment she offered for rent sat vacant for months before she listed it on Airbnb, because she could not find a long-term tenant.\u201cAll these high-rises that went up recently made a total glut,\u201d she said. \u201cOwner concessions are increasing every month, offering four months, five months free\u201d and making it harder for small-time landlords like her to compete.While the debate continues over how Airbnb might affect housing availability and rental prices in the city, the incentive to host is clear. Why rent out the average New York one-bedroom for $2,700 a month when there is potential to make $200 every night, or $6,000 a month, during peak tourist seasons? Some housing advocates believe that if transient rentals like those on Airbnb were no longer available, the available long-term rental housing stock could be as much as 10 percent higher citywide.Back in Park Slope, Ms. Badia contemplated what made her a successful host. \u201cYou know, older women are the fastest growing Airbnb demographic,\u201d she said, citing data released by the company. \u201cYou know why? Because we have the asset, we have the home. We know how to host. We\u2019re the nurturers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And after we slow the education process down, they embrace it.\u201dAs she eyed a Volvo XC90, Maria Teich of Seattle said it had been eight years since she last bought a vehicle.\u201cTechnology is massively different,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are bells and whistles everywhere in the car. Auto braking is something I am looking for in a car because humans are error-prone.\u201dMr. Schroeder said it was hard to sell a car without a convenience package that included Pilot Assist, a semiautonomous feature that can take control for short distances. \u201cMost want it, especially now that it works at up to 80 mile an hour.\u201dAt Gilchrist, Jeff Brese of North Tacoma arrived in a 2000 Ford F-150. His new ride is a Silverado Crew Cab pickup. He has mixed feelings about its advanced technology.He tows a boat, so he is most excited about the hauling power. With cylinder deactivation that shuts down half the 6.2-liter V-8 engine while cruising, the Silverado should give him better fuel economy than the less-powerful Ford. The backup camera will help him attach a trailer solo.He\u2019s ambivalent about the Silverado\u2019s automatic braking system but understands its value. \u201cThe friend buying my Ford owns a Volvo S.U.V.,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was driving around a blind corner near my house when a pedestrian ran out in front of him. The car automatically stopped, missing him. You have to respect that.\u201dJacob Hinton, an Army private first class stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord south of Tacoma, was taking delivery of a 2017 Chevy Malibu, trading in a 2011 Kia Optima. He said he was unimpressed with advanced technology.\u201cDrivers should pay attention to the road and not depend on robot braking or steering,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust them.\u201dHe was most impressed with the Malibu\u2019s touch-screen display and the good sound system. Although he is an iPhone owner, the standard Apple CarPlay did not influence his decision. \u201cI got a good deal and I like my car to be a car,\u201d he said.At the Volvo showroom, Greg Conklin of Seattle was also mostly interested in the car as an automobile. \u201cThe superironic thing is that I\u2019m in tech, in start-ups in Seattle,\u201d he said. \u201cSelf-parking and -driving makes the experience cool, but I\u2019m far more interested in what happens when I push the pedals.\u201dMr. Conklin said he was impressed that \u201calmost all cars have excellent safety ratings.\u201d Nowadays, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s actually surprising not to see five stars across those rows.\u201d He also noted that cameras were ubiquitous. \u201cThe 360-degree surround-view systems are pretty amazing,\u201d he said. But then he came back down to earth: \u201cThey might just be eye candy.\u201dCar buyers now have much more to learn about their new purchases. Bob Cornett, service manager at Gilchrist Chevrolet, said all the additional features were bringing customers back for tutorials. \u201cOlder buyers have trouble grasping it, but once they understand it, they love it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe provide ongoing education. It\u2019s the new normal.\u201dBut advancements can discourage potential buyers. Mr. Brese went with the Silverado because of Ford\u2019s F-150 aluminum body. Many drivers see the lighter material as an advantage, but not Mr. Brese: \u201cI work around boats and find that paint doesn\u2019t last on aluminum. I worry about that.\u201d He also lamented the price: His pickup topped $60,000.Ms. Teich, the Volvo shopper, said: \u201cAn internet hot spot in the car isn\u2019t useful to me; it\u2019s something I don\u2019t want to pay for.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt Declares State of Emergency, as Attacks Undercut Promise of Security", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byTANTA, Egypt \u2014 Rattling a country already wrestling with a faltering economy and deepening political malaise, two suicide bombings that killed 44 people at Coptic churches in Egypt on Palm Sunday raised the specter of increased sectarian bloodshed led by Islamic State militants.The attacks constituted one of the deadliest days of violence against Christians in Egypt in decades and presented a challenge to the authority of the country\u2019s leader, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who promptly declared a three-month state of emergency.On Sunday, Mr. Sisi found himself back on the defensive, deploying troops to protect churches across the country weeks before a planned visit by Pope Francis. Mr. Sisi rushed to assure Christians, who have traditionally been among his most vocal supporters and now fear that he cannot protect them against extremists.\u201cI won\u2019t say those who fell are Christian or Muslim,\u201d Mr. Sisi said in a speech shown on state television on Sunday night. \u201cI will say that they\u2019re Egyptian.\u201dOne attack on Sunday struck at St. Mark\u2019s Cathedral, the seat of the Coptic Church in Alexandria, where the bomber blew himself up at the church gates as the Coptic patriarch, Pope Tawadros II, led a Palm Sunday service inside.The other struck in the Nile Delta city of Tanta, where the attacker slipped past security to the front pews of the church and blew himself up, turning a religious celebration of joy into a ghastly scene of bloodshed and death.Although Mr. Sisi had already stepped up security at churches, Sunday\u2019s bloodshed underscores the difficulty of stopping suicide attacks. More starkly, it highlighted the failure of Egypt\u2019s powerful intelligence agencies to anticipate a coordinated wave of devastating attacks.Children, their parents and deacons \u2014 lay Christians who help with the service \u2014 accounted for many of the dead.Hours later, victims\u2019 relatives stood silently outside the city morgue, waiting to identify and collect the remains of their loved ones. The Rev. Daniel Maher, a priest who had been leading the Mass, was still wearing his bloodstained white vestments. The priest said he had not been harmed in the attack, but he lost his son, Bishoy, who was to get married later this year.\u201cWhat can I say? Thank God,\u201d he said in a cracking voice.Next to the priest, a young woman sat on the sidewalk, sobbing as a group of women tried to comfort her. \u201cGod, what did he do to deserve this?\u201d she asked, bemoaning the loss of her own loved one.The second attack occurred just over two hours later in the coastal city of Alexandria, where a suicide bomber tried to enter St. Mark\u2019s Cathedral.Pope Tawadros, who is due to meet with Pope Francis during his visit to Egypt at the end of this month, was not injured in the blast. He later issued a statement saying that \u201cthese acts will not harm the unity and cohesion of the people.\u201dChristians make up about 10 percent of Egypt\u2019s 90 million people, who are mostly Sunni Muslim, and have long complained of discrimination and sporadic violence at the hands of extremists. Christian leaders were vocal supporters of Mr. Sisi after he came to power in 2013 when the military ousted the elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood.Many Christians see Mr. Sisi as their defender, but Sunday\u2019s events underscored how difficult it is for him to deliver on that promise, and raised pressing questions about security arrangements for Pope Francis\u2019 visit on April 28 and 29.As forensics specialists combed through bloodstained wreckage at the site of the two church bombings, security officials found and defused explosive devices at other locations in Alexandria and Tanta, the state news media reported. Two devices were found at the Sidi Abdel Rahim Mosque in Tanta, home to one of the most famous Sufi Muslim shrines in the city, and another was found at the Coll\u00e8ge St. Marc, an all-boys school in downtown Alexandria.Hours later, Mr. Sisi convened a meeting of the National Defense Council, which includes the prime minister and commanders of the Egyptian armed forces, in response to the bombings. He then declared a three-month state of emergency, though it was not immediately clear what extra powers he required, given that his government enjoys largely unfettered powers, has already imprisoned or exiled thousands of political opponents, and oversees a Parliament that is dominated by his supporters.In his televised speech, Mr. Sisi indicated that news media coverage of attacks that embarrass his authority could be restricted. \u201cThe media discourse has to be responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable to have the incident aired repeatedly on television stations all day.\u201dEgyptians are used to such moves. The country was officially under a state of emergency for all of Hosni Mubarak\u2019s 30-year rule, and again for three months in 2013.When Pope Francis arrives in Egypt, he will find a country where the Islamic State is intent on driving a wedge between Islam and Christianity.The pontiff offered his condolences to the Copts and all Egyptians, and in his statement from Rome he referred to the Coptic patriarch as his \u201cbrother.\u201d Francis\u2019 scheduled visit to Egypt has been billed as the latest step in a long-running effort to forge stronger ties between the Roman Catholic Church and Muslim leaders.Relations became strained in 2011 when Francis\u2019s predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, denounced what he called \u201ca strategy of violence that has Christians as a target\u201d after a bombing at a church in Alexandria killed at least 23 people.Francis has sought to rebuild ties with Muslim clerics since becoming pope in 2013. And last year he welcomed to the Vatican Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand imam of Al Azhar, a 1,000-year-old mosque and university that is revered by Sunni MuslimsIn Egypt, the pontiff is to visit with Mr. Sisi; the leadership of the Coptic Orthodox Church; and the grand imam.The grand imam condemned Sunday\u2019s attacks as a \u201cdespicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents.\u201dFor many Christians, though, the attacks at the start of the Holy Week before Easter are a harbinger of worse to come.\u201cI think people will not only be too scared to be inside a church, they will be too scared to pass by one now,\u201d said Mina Mansy, a prominent Christian rights activist. \u201cThis will continue to happen because the state is not interested in protecting Christians, or anyone else for that matter. The police\u2019s only job is to crush political opponents. They don\u2019t care about the real terrorists.\u201dMagdy Samaan reported from Tanta, and Declan Walsh from London.

{"Headline": "5 Hurdles to the Adoption of Trump\u2019s Tax Plan This Year", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byThe introduction of President Trump\u2019s tax plan has left many lawmakers, policy analysts and tax accounting experts with more questions than answers. There were no details on individual tax brackets, the tax rate at which overseas cash would be repatriated or how cutting the corporate tax rate won\u2019t encourage more tax avoidance schemes, so there are few real numbers to crunch. \u201cThis was all ponies and no manure,\u201d said Michael Graetz, a Columbia University tax law professor and a former Treasury Department official.But now that Mr. Trump has revealed his hand, the obstacles he faces for getting tax overhaul done this year are even more apparent.White House officials expressed tepid optimism that Democrats might get behind their tax plan for the good of the country. But there was no palpable support for anything that Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team proposed. In fact, Democrats quickly took a page from the Republican Party\u2019s playbook, accusing Mr. Trump of crippling the economy with debt. The difficulty of repealing the Affordable Care Act without the help of any Democrats is a good indicator that tax reform will be at least as challenging.Technically, Republicans do not need Democrats to sign on to their plan if they are willing to use the Senate\u2019s budget reconciliation process to push the legislation through Congress. But they will need their own party to be united. Some deficit hawks appear ready to shed their feathers in the name of cutting taxes, spurring economic growth and giving Mr. Trump a victory. However, enough are likely to cling to their fiscal rectitude to cause a problem for the president.The White House killed the notion of the \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax by excluding it from its plan, a victory for retailers, oil companies and other importers who have railed against the idea of taxing imports. But with the Trump administration preparing to ax all individual deductions except for mortgage interest and charities, not everyone is happy. The National Association of Realtors has already expressed its displeasure with the doubling of the standard deduction, arguing that it waters down the tax benefits of owning a home. Other trade groups and special interests will find other parts of the tax plan to attack or support.As a candidate, Mr. Trump suggested that rich people like him should actually pay more taxes. But nothing in his tax outline suggested that would be the case. The repeal of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax and the extraordinarily low business tax rates suggest that the rich will do quite well under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan. What is more, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers could not offer any insights into how middle-income Americans would fare under his plan. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was asked on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d whether the middle class wouldn\u2019t be paying more taxes. \u201cI can\u2019t make any guarantees,\u201d he said.Since Mr. Trump insists on breaking tradition and keeping his tax returns private, they become a potent issue. From what is known about Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth and the bits of his tax information that have been made public, he would have quite a lot to gain from his proposal. The repeal of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax would be a boon for Mr. Trump, as would a lower corporate tax rate and a territorial system that would let foreign profits go untaxed. As each detail of his plan becomes clearer, critics of Mr. Trump will muddy the policy debates by using his taxes as a rallying cry of opposition.Advertisement"}

One man has been rising rapidly in polls, threatening the front-runners a week before the first round in France\u2019s presidential election. One man has suddenly turned the French contest, locked for months between two favorites, into a four-man race.The formula, delivered in fiery anticapitalist phrases, and peppered with learned philosophical abstractions, has put him within spitting distance of earning a spot in the election\u2019s decisive second round on May 7.\u201cM\u00e9lenchon: The Insane Program of the French Ch\u00e1vez,\u201d the right-leaning newspaper Figaro blared in a front-page headline last week. The candidate was delighted by this jittery jab.\u201cWhat is the liberty of the employee who is fired for not working on Sunday?\u201d he asked the crowd, delivering repeated thrusts at capitalism. \u201cWhat is the liberty of 120,000 families whose water is cut off because they can\u2019t pay the bill?\u201d His advisers depict him as a kind of French Bernie Sanders. Unlike Mr. Sanders, though, he has no vigorous party establishment to block his way.\u201cMasters of the earth, you have good reason to be uneasy!\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon yelled at the festive, youthful crowd on Sunday, some wearing revolutionary Phrygian caps, as he stabbed the air with his fist and paced back and forth on the stage. \u201cGive it up! Give it up!\u201d the crowd yelled, a message clearly intended for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s opponents.\u201cThere must be decent salaries,\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon shouted into the microphone. \u201cThat\u2019s why the minimum wage will have to go up!\u201dIf this veteran of French politics \u2014 he started as a young Socialist senator in 1986 \u2014 pulls it off, France\u2019s election could end up a contest between two radical outliers. Both Mr. M\u00e9lenchon and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front gleefully promise a top-to-bottom shake-up, rejecting the country\u2019s European Union membership, blasting its budgetary and deficit rules, and injecting France with huge doses of public spending.The prospect of a M\u00e9lenchon-Le Pen runoff, written off several weeks ago, no longer seems impossible. In a poll published in Le Monde on Friday, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon had pulled to within two points of both Ms. Le Pen and her nearest challenger, the centrist Emmanuel Macron, a former economy minister.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s advisers speak admiringly of Mr. Sanders. Their candidate\u2019s score among 18- to 24-year-olds has shot to 44 percent from 12 percent in one month, according to Le Monde. Among 25- to 34-year-olds it has almost doubled, to 27 percent. Analysts say Mr. M\u00e9lenchon has the momentum at a time when others, like the mainstream right candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, stagnate or fall in the polls. \u201cHe\u2019s a total campaign warrior,\u201d the political scientist Pascal Perrineau said.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon has come so far so fast that the other candidates spent part of the last week attacking him for the first time. Even the widely unpopular incumbent, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, called him \u201csimplistic.\u201dBut as Mr. Hollande\u2019s mainstream Socialist Party has collapsed, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, an ex-Trotskyist, has been the big beneficiary, making the Socialists look like pallid imitators of his own robust promises to cut back the workweek, lower the official retirement age to 60, raise taxes on the rich and hire many more civil servants.What remains of the once-powerful French Communist Party backs him; Mr. M\u00e9lenchon is not unhappy. \u201cMr. Fillon reproaches me for being a Communist,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s a reproach I find totally tolerable,\u201d he said, mockingly promising the right-wing Mr. Fillon a \u201chandmade electoral jacket\u201d in a reference to a recent scandal over his opponent\u2019s expensive clothing habits.In a country winded by 10 percent unemployment, a plethora of unstable part-time job contracts for the young, a frozen job market and rising inequality, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s message has powerful resonance. His supporters \u2014 the campaign said 70,000 turned out Sunday \u2014 speak of him with a fervor that surpasses that of all the other candidates, with the exception of Ms. Le Pen.Yet the racially diverse crowd at Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s rally is nothing like the all-white, all-French one that comes to hear Ms. Le Pen.\u201cI work a lot and I\u2019m badly paid,\u201d said Inti Gomez, 40, who said he was a night receptionist in a Toulouse hotel, existing below the poverty line as he supports three on a salary of about $2,100 a month.Although he works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. every night, he had come out to hear Mr. M\u00e9lenchon. \u201cWhat\u2019s really hard is this inequality that I\u2019m forced to submit to,\u201d Mr. Gomez said, bemoaning the fact that his education had gone for naught. \u201cChange is possible,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just taking advantage of this collective joy.\u201dRen\u00e9 Amando, 60, said he had spent a lifetime working in chemical factories but retired early because his health had been damaged. \u201cIt\u2019s his attitude of refusal,\u201d Mr. Amando said, waiting for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon to appear. \u201cThere is such a huge split between the big financiers and the people, who get poorer and poorer,\u201d Mr. Amando added. \u201cHe gives us hope for a new kind of society, a more socialized and humane society.\u201dWhen Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said that the \u201cpresidential monarchy must be abolished,\u201d he was tapping into an old French revolutionary tradition, one that sees revolution itself as an inherent good. The revolutionaries of 1789 France created a kind of civic religion around their revolution; Mr. M\u00e9lenchon tries to do something similar. Even so, the crowd on Sunday appeared a little bewildered by his abstruse references to heretics who had suffered for their beliefs, his advocacy of an obscure Latin-American alliance he is keen on and his admonition to \u201cnot let anybody exercise police power over thought.\u201dIt roared though when he attacked President Trump over the missile attack on Syria. \u201cNo Frenchman can accept a global gendarme who decided all by himself the good and the bad,\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tells Foreign Leaders That Nafta Can Stay for Now", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump told the leaders of Mexico and Canada on Wednesday that he would not immediately move to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, only hours after an administration official said he was likely to sign an order that would begin the process of pulling the United States out of the deal.In what the White House described as \u201cpleasant and productive\u201d evening phone calls with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, Mr. Trump said he would quickly start the process of renegotiating Nafta \u2014 not abandon it, as he said he would do during the 2016 presidential campaign if he could not rework the deal to his satisfaction.\u201cIt is my privilege to bring NAFTA up-to-date through renegotiation,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement issued by the White House at 10:33 p.m. \u201cI believe that the end result will make all three countries stronger and better.\u201dThe announcement appeared to be an example of Mr. Trump\u2019s deal-making in real time. It followed a day in which officials signaled that he was laying the groundwork to pull out of Nafta \u2014 a move intended to increase pressure on Congress to authorize new negotiations, and on Canada and Mexico to accede to American demands.It was not clear whether the president would still sign an executive action to authorize renegotiation of Nafta, which he once called the worst trade deal ever signed by the United States. Washington must give Canada and Mexico six months\u2019 notice before exiting the trade agreement, which came into force in 1994. Any action to that effect would start the clock.But the prospect of the United States\u2019 pulling out obviously alarmed the Canadian and Mexican leaders and prompted their calls to the White House.The Mexican peso plummeted in trading after news broke at midday on Wednesday that the White House had drafted an executive order withdrawing the United States from Nafta. Mr. Trudeau called Mr. Trump twice, on Tuesday and Wednesday, to discuss the sudden rupture in the trade relationship between the United States and Canada.The president has repeatedly derided Nafta, describing it last week as \u201cvery, very bad\u201d for the country, companies and workers, and he promised during his campaign that he would remove the United States from it if he could not negotiate improvements.The White House wants Congress to authorize those negotiations under legislation that would allow expedited approval of the reworked agreement, but talks between administration officials and congressional Republicans have moved slowly.While some of Mr. Trump\u2019s senior advisers, notably Stephen K. Bannon and the economist Peter Navarro, are eager to take strong steps on trade policy, another group \u2014 which includes Gary D. Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council \u2014 has argued for a more cautious approach, concerned that larger steps could cause economic disruptions.Lately, Mr. Trump has taken the stronger line, moving to reshape America\u2019s economic relationships with foreign nations. The Nafta order would come on the heels of the announcement of the new tariffs on Canadian lumber and reviews of whether steel and aluminum imports are undermining national security.Walking away from Nafta would disrupt the economies of the United States, Canada and Mexico, and strain broader relations among the countries. Over the last two decades, their economies have become increasingly intertwined. The volume of trade has multiplied, and the manufacture of many goods, notably cars, involves multiple border crossings and factories in all three nations.If the United States actually pulled out, experts said, trade with Canada would probably still be subject to a similar agreement between the two countries that took effect in the late 1980s and served as a model for Nafta. The Trump administration, however, could seek to withdraw from that agreement as well.Trade has contributed to economic growth, but changing dynamics have also prompted concerns about lost jobs and the trade deficit. But when something is manufactured in the United States, it is often made up of parts from around the world.The shift in the rules governing trade with Mexico would be more significant. The two countries both take part in the World Trade Organization, but that allows much higher tariffs. Mexico, for instance, could impose a 37 percent tariff on American corn. The disruptions to manufacturing could also come at a hefty cost to consumers: Caroline Freund, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has estimated that the cost of a pickup truck might increase by $3,000.Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, said: \u201cIt would be a very disruptive shock that would impact everybody. It would impact growth; it would impact companies and supply chains; it would impact workers; it would impact voters in Trump states. It\u2019s just crazy to imagine that they would go that route.\u201d\u201cScrapping Nafta would be a disastrously bad idea,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said in a statement. \u201cYes, there are places where our agreements could be modernized, but here\u2019s the bottom line: Trade lowers prices for American consumers, and it expands markets for American goods. Risking trade wars is reckless, not wise.\u201dBoth Mexican and Canadian officials have said repeatedly that they are ready to negotiate changes to the trade agreement. Written in the early 1990s, it is outdated in key respects: Its drafters, for example, did not foresee the rise of the internet.\u201cCanada is ready to come to the table at any time,\u201d Alex Lawrence, a spokesman for the Canadian foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, told Reuters on Wednesday.The administration must send a final version of that letter to Congress to start another clock: a 90-day waiting period before negotiations. Starting both clocks would allow the White House to begin negotiations with Mexico and Canada while holding in hand the threat of walking away from the table.It is not clear whom that would hurt most. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced trade deficits as a major contributor to what he sees as the nation\u2019s broken economy.But trade among the three North American nations is relatively balanced, particularly in comparison with trade between the United States and China.The United States does run a monthly deficit of about $4 billion with Mexico, but even that is a small fraction of the roughly $28 billion monthly deficit with China.Michael D.

Like almost all of the 950 or so residents of Grassy Narrows, Mr. Fobister suffers from the effects of mercury poisoning. For much of our conversation, he had to support his jaw with his fingers because of the joint weakness and pain mercury can cause.\u201cI have memory loss,\u201d said Mr. Fobister, a former chief of Grassy Narrows. \u201cI have no feeling in my feet. My legs and skin feel like they\u2019re burning. My hearing is going. I\u2019m a walking drugstore: I take about 16 pills a day to control seizures, pain, depression.\u201dMercury poisoning among the people of Grassy Narrows was first discovered in the early 1970s by Japanese researchers. From 1962 to 1970, a paper mill owned by Reed Paper, a company in nearby Dryden, dumped more than 20,000 pounds of raw mercury into the English-Wabigoon River system. Fish from those waters provided the main source of protein downstream in Grassy Narrows. By the time the contamination was discovered \u2014 and the community\u2019s commercial fishing industry shuttered \u2014 residents had consumed dangerous quantities of fish.The revelation caused an outcry in Canada and focused international attention on Grassy Narrows, a rural community near the Manitoba border. But despite repeated studies and calls for action \u2014 a government panel recommended specific remediation measures as early as 1983 \u2014 no efforts have been made to clean up the river.And it remained a mystery why the mercury levels remained so persistently high, years after the initial contamination. According to the Center for Minamata Studies in Japan, which has been chronicling the disease in Grassy Narrows since the 1970s, an estimated 90 percent of the residents have symptoms of mercury poisoning \u2014 numbness in the extremities, tremors, memory loss, tunnel vision, birth defects \u2014 including those born long after the initial discovery of mercury poisoning.Mercury in pregnant women inhibits fetal brain development, which can result in reductions in cognitive and motor abilities, as well as behavioral changes, in children. But more precise research is required to explain the prevalence of symptoms in younger children. \u201cI cannot say exactly why,\u201d Dr. Hanada said. \u201cMaybe there is mercury in their diet, or there is an aftereffect of 20 or 30 years. But it is not normal to find this sign in the younger generation.\u201dA possible answer came to light in July 2015 when a former employee of the Dryden paper mill claimed that he was part of a small crew that in 1972 dumped approximately 50 drums containing liquid mercury and salt \u2014 industrial waste from the mill \u2014 into a large pit upstream of Grassy Narrows. The employee, Kas Glowacki, now 65 and living in Alberta, sent an email to the community\u2019s chief detailing his job as a 21-year-old, shoveling mercury into the drums.If this account of dumping is true, it could confirm suspicions that a continuing mercury leak is one of the reasons for the toxicity that plagues the community more than 40 years after its discovery.Sarah Bollard was born in Grassy Narrows but sent to live with a white family in suburban Toronto. She returned to the community in August with her two younger children, Gabrielle, 3, and Tristan, 5.Now she is showing symptoms. \u201cI have tremors,\u201d she said, holding out her shaking hands. \u201cAnd Tristan \u2014 he doesn\u2019t really speak.\u201dThe little boy clearly understands what\u2019s said to him. But while his younger sister chatters away nonstop, Tristan is nearly silent, nodding yes and no to questions, pointing to what he wants. His few words are indistinct: \u201cNana\u201d for \u201cbanana,\u201d and \u201cFo! Fo! Fo!\u201d to get his mother\u2019s cellphone.\u201cHis hearing is fine,\u201d Ms. Bollard said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken him to speech pathologists everywhere we\u2019ve lived, and nobody can figure out why he\u2019s not talking.\u201dBizarrely, however, Canadian government health agencies have never confirmed a single diagnosis of mercury poisoning. That job has been taken up by the volunteer team of Japanese researchers.In 1975, on its first of more than half a dozen visits to Grassy Narrows, the Japanese team confirmed at least 60 cases of what has come to be known as Minamata disease after an environmental disaster in Minamata, Japan.The government didn\u2019t initially act on the claim in the 2015 Glowacki email that additional mercury had been stored in drums. Volunteers from the environmental organization Earthroots and reporters from The Toronto Star in the fall of 2016 took a dozen samples from the site identified by Mr. Glowacki; three came back with levels of mercury up to nearly 80 times expected levels for soil in the region.On Feb. 13, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change released a statement committing to identifying potentially contaminated sites and to carrying out a comprehensive remediation action plan for the English-Wabigoon River system, in partnership with the people of Grassy Narrows and the neighboring Wabaseemoong (Whitedog) Independent Nations.The provincial and federal governments have also pledged to reform the current system of compensating people for the disaster, as many band members have demanded.In the mid-1980s, the Mercury Disability Board was set up as part of a settlement between Reed Paper and the provincial and federal governments. Its aim was to compensate people with symptoms consistent with mercury poisoning.The two oldest daughters of April Fobister (the surname is a common one in Grassy Narrows) require round-the-clock care because of severe mercury poisoning. The two women \u2014 Betty, 25, and Melissa, 23 \u2014 have lived for 13 years in Fort Frances, Ontario, a four-hour drive from their parents. Neither can speak; Betty is wheelchair-bound and has seizures every day. Both sisters were assessed by the board; they are among the 27 percent of applicants whose claims have been approved. Both receive the maximum monthly compensation of roughly $800.\u201cI think everybody should be compensated,\u201d their mother said. \u201cI think everybody\u2019s sick.\u201dBefore the river was contaminated, fishing had been the reserve\u2019s main livelihood. That work, in turn, had displaced trapping and hunting. When the mercury was discovered, the fishing industry collapsed; today Grassy Narrows has high unemployment and little in the way of its traditional economy to fall back on. Rates of teenage and child suicide are soaring, and addiction is rampant.As a worker with the Native Alcohol Drug Abuse Program, Gabriel Fobister Jr. deals daily with these effects of poverty and disenfranchisement. At home, the effects of mercury poisoning are more direct: Like Tristan, Mr. Fobister\u2019s 4-year-old son, Nolan, doesn\u2019t speak much. The youngest of six, Nolan can walk and run, but he trips and falls. He\u2019s missing a kidney and is delayed cognitively. Mr. Fobister, 40, and his wife, Sherry Ackabee, have learned to do their son\u2019s physiotherapy at home. The disability board has awarded Nolan $600 per month in compensation, but the funds are being held in trust for the boy until he turns 18, leaving his parents with scant resources to cover the costs related to his care.\u201cMedically, we can\u2019t receive services here,\u201d Mr. Fobister said. \u201cWe need to be doing things to help him now, but we can\u2019t.\u201dIn the meantime, the people of Grassy Narrows continue to eat fish from the English-Wabigoon River system.\u201cI laugh when people are shocked to hear that we still eat the fish,\u201d said Chrissy Swain, 37, who helped set up the community\u2019s long-running blockade against logging and clear-cutting in the forests around the reserve. She too is noticing the symptoms of mercury poisoning: tingling fingers, numb patches on her hands, her shaking left leg and an involuntary twitching of her lip.\u201cBut it\u2019s our way of life,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes people run out of food and have no other choice but to eat it. Or maybe they think, \u2018I already have mercury poisoning, so who cares?\u2019 Maybe we\u2019ve adapted to this lifestyle, so we think, \u2018It\u2019s not that bad.\u2019 But in reality, it really is. People are sick.\u201dSusan Goldberg is the co-editor of \u201cAnd Baby Makes More: Known Donors, Queer Parents and Our Unexpected Families.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bureau of Resistance", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyDon\u2019t expect President Trump to boast about any of these good deeds, which were all undertaken by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Nor is he likely to tweet with gusto if the bureau issues more rules in the coming months. These might include regulations on debt collectors, payday lenders and all those brand-name financial institutions that keep unhappy customers out of court through \u201cmandatory arbitration\u201d clauses buried in consumer contracts, voiding the option of filing lawsuits. In early February, a group of business leaders visited Trump at the White House, where the president promised to roll back many of the regulations imposed after 2008, when the financial industry\u2019s recklessness nearly sank the world economy. \u201cI have so many people, friends of mine that had nice businesses, they can\u2019t borrow money,\u201d Trump told his audience. That same day, he signed an executive order that gave the secretary of the Treasury (a position that would soon be filled by a Goldman Sachs alumnus) 120 days to provide a hit list of rules the administration could eliminate.The independent C.F.P.B. emerged as a part of Dodd-Frank, the sweeping financial-regulation legislation passed in 2010 that Trump has repeatedly promised to dismantle. The idea, first proposed in a 2007 article by Elizabeth Warren, then a Harvard Law professor, was to create something like the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which develops standards and can recall items that pose unreasonable safety risks. Why not a commission to monitor financial products and services \u2014 and what Warren, as a senator from Massachusetts, continues to call the \u201ctricks and traps\u201d of the industry? Congress invested this new government watchdog with the authority to write and enforce rules to prevent \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.\u201d To insulate the C.F.P.B. from political meddling, it is funded not by Congress directly but by the Federal Reserve, which, under Dodd-Frank, is required to set aside a portion of its yearly budget to pay for the bureau\u2019s operations.It doesn\u2019t seem likely to slow down in response to a hostile White House. \u201cIt really shouldn\u2019t change the job at all,\u201d Richard Cordray said, just days after Trump was inaugurated. Cordray is the bureau\u2019s director, a position President Obama first nominated him to in 2011. But as a result of some congressional infighting, Cordray\u2019s five-year term in office does not include his time running the agency before his confirmation in mid-2013 \u2014 which means that at least until a few months before the midterm elections, in 2018, the deregulator in chief will be confronted with this small bastion of progressivism inside his own government.Mortgage lenders were an early target of the bureau. It outlawed \u201cno-doc,\u201d or no-documentation, loans and deceptive teaser rates that lured borrowers into thinking they could afford a home loan. The C.F.P.B. also prohibited lenders from paying mortgage brokers to steer borrowers to loans with higher interest rates, a common practice in the lead-up to the subprime meltdown. Some of the big banks also came under scrutiny for pushing their customers to buy expensive, often unnecessary products. In 2014, for instance, the C.F.P.B. ordered Bank of America to return $727 million to customers duped by \u201cdeceptive marketing\u201d and unfair billing into paying for relatively worthless credit-card \u201cadd-ons\u201d like credit protection in the event of disability or a lost job. A year later, Citibank had to repay customers $700 million for similar transgressions. Since 2011, the agency has returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million consumers.The C.F.P.B. has also set up a public database for consumer complaints. Other than big-dollar fines, nothing seems to irritate lenders large and small more than the public shaming that comes with showing up on this forum meant for all those customers who have spent countless hours on the phone fighting with giant student-loan servicers or credit-card companies. Businesses have 15 days to respond before a complaint is posted; to date, the C.F.P.B. has published more than 750,000 grievances on its website, along with a business\u2019s response, if one is made public.Trump\u2019s \u201cforgotten men and women\u201d living on the economic fringes might be the bureau\u2019s greatest beneficiaries. Millions of Americans rely on reloadable, prepaid cards because they\u2019ve bounced too many checks or otherwise have no relationship with a bank. Last fall, the C.F.P.B. finalized regulations that would grant users some of the same protections enjoyed by credit-card customers, including liability limits on lost or stolen cards and easy access to account information. The bureau has also proposed restrictions on debt collectors and payday lenders, who can sometimes legally charge interest rates exceeding what would be 400 percent annually for the two-week loans they provide to the working poor. A trade association representing the payday-lending industry declared that these proposed rules, which would require lenders to either determine a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan or set a limit of no more than three two-week loans in a row, would put thousands of lenders out of business.Can the C.F.P.B. survive the Trump years? His election certainly gives hope to all those big banks and fringe lenders that feel themselves under attack by Cordray. In mid-February, Ted Cruz in the Senate and John Ratcliffe in the House introduced bills that would simply abolish the bureau. Yet a recent poll showed that Trump voters, by a 2-to-1 margin, want the bureau left alone, if not strengthened. The C.F.P.B. seems too popular to simply shut down.So the strategy in Washington has been to defang it rather than eliminate it altogether. Industry groups and their Republican allies in Congress have proposed replacing the position of a single director with a bipartisan, five-person commission that would typically require at least three yes votes before any significant actions could be taken. If this came to pass, the bureau could join all those other dysfunctional bodies \u2014 just look at the Securities and Exchange and Federal Election Commissions \u2014 whose structure waylays all but the mildest of rule changes. Another bill would switch the C.F.P.B.\u2019s funding model, forcing it to go hat-in-hand to Congress every year.Still, the Democrats have Elizabeth Warren, who has shifted the center of gravity within Democratic politics, at least on issues of fairness and economic reform. Democrats who waver in their support of the C.F.P.B. \u2014 or Dodd-Frank generally \u2014 can expect to hear from Warren. \u201cDemocrats who used to work with us are scared to death of crossing Warren,\u201d one Republican congressional staff member told me back in February. The populist right has the RINO, a Republican in Name Only. The populist left seems to be developing a new counter-species: the Democrat in Name Only, or DINO. You\u2019re either a staunch defender of the C.F.P.B. and Dodd-Frank or you\u2019re a tool of Wall Street. \u201cI\u2019d be more worried about the C.F.P.B.,\u201d says Dennis Kelleher, the president of Better Markets, which pushes for tighter regulation of financial institutions, \u201cif there wasn\u2019t a Black Hawk helicopter circling it manned by Elizabeth Warren.\u201dFor the moment, the C.F.P.B. seems to be a full-throated expression of resistance: a government watchdog doing its job, despite a chief executive who resents its mission. But even if Warren and her allies repel legislative attempts to weaken the C.F.P.B., Trump will still get to name Cordray\u2019s replacement. What will be good news for big banks and fringe lenders will be sad news for the forgotten who thought they were sending a champion to the White House.Gary Rivlin, a former Times reporter, is an Investigative Fund fellow at the Nation Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Uber Uses Psychological Tricks to Push Its Drivers\u2019 Buttons", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "The secretive ride-hailing giant Uber rarely discusses internal matters in public. But in March, facing crises on multiple fronts, top officials convened a call for reporters to insist that Uber was changing its culture and would no longer tolerate \u201cbrilliant jerks.\u201dNotably, the company also announced that it would fix its troubled relationship with drivers, who have complained for years about falling pay and arbitrary treatment.And yet even as Uber talks up its determination to treat drivers more humanely, it is engaged in an extraordinary behind-the-scenes experiment in behavioral science to manipulate them in the service of its corporate growth \u2014 an effort whose dimensions became evident in interviews with several dozen current and former Uber officials, drivers and social scientists, as well as a review of behavioral research.Uber\u2019s innovations reflect the changing ways companies are managing workers amid the rise of the freelance-based \u201cgig economy.\u201d Its drivers are officially independent business owners rather than traditional employees with set schedules. This allows Uber to minimize labor costs, but means it cannot compel drivers to show up at a specific place and time. And this lack of control can wreak havoc on a service whose goal is to seamlessly transport passengers whenever and wherever they want.Uber helps solve this fundamental problem by using psychological inducements and other techniques unearthed by social science to influence when, where and how long drivers work. It\u2019s a quest for a perfectly efficient system: a balance between rider demand and driver supply at the lowest cost to passengers and the company.Employing hundreds of social scientists and data scientists, Uber has experimented with video game techniques, graphics and noncash rewards of little value that can prod drivers into working longer and harder \u2014 and sometimes at hours and locations that are less lucrative for them.To keep drivers on the road, the company has exploited some people\u2019s tendency to set earnings goals \u2014 alerting them that they are ever so close to hitting a precious target when they try to log off. It has even concocted an algorithm similar to a Netflix feature that automatically loads the next program, which many experts believe encourages binge-watching. In Uber\u2019s case, this means sending drivers their next fare opportunity before their current ride is even over.And most of this happens without giving off a whiff of coercion.\u201cWe show drivers areas of high demand or incentivize them to drive more,\u201d said Michael Amodeo, an Uber spokesman. \u201cBut any driver can stop work literally at the tap of a button \u2014 the decision whether or not to drive is 100 percent theirs.\u201dBut an examination by The New York Times found that Uber is continuing apace in its struggle to wield the upper hand with drivers. And as so-called platform-mediated work like driving for Uber increasingly becomes the way people make a living, the company\u2019s example illustrates that pulling psychological levers may eventually become the reigning approach to managing the American worker.Of course, many companies try to nudge consumers into buying their products and services using psychological tricks. But extending these efforts to the work force is potentially transformative.Uber exists in a kind of legal and ethical purgatory, however. Because its drivers are independent contractors, they lack most of the protections associated with employment. By mastering their workers\u2019 mental circuitry, Uber and the like may be taking the economy back toward a pre-New Deal era when businesses had enormous power over workers and few checks on their ability to exploit it.In early 2016, a group of roughly 100 Uber employees responsible for signing up drivers and getting them to drive more voted to change its name \u2014 from \u201csupply growth\u201d to \u201cdriver growth.\u201dThe vote was not unprompted. For much of the previous year, Uber executives had agonized over how to lower the rate at which drivers were deserting the platform.Alongside Uber\u2019s already daunting targets for expanding its pool of drivers to meet mounting demand, the high turnover threatened to cap the company\u2019s growth and throw it into crisis.Uber conducted interviews and focus groups while executives peppered employees with questions like, \u201cWhat are we doing to have more empathy for the driver side of the equation?\u201dThis is particularly true of shortages so pronounced as to create a \u201csurge\u201d \u2014 that is, a higher fare than normal. While surges do mitigate shortages, they do so in part by repelling passengers, something directly at odds with Uber\u2019s long-term goal of dominating the industry. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s better not to surge,\u201d said Daniel Graf, Uber\u2019s vice president of product. \u201cIf we don\u2019t surge, we can produce more rides.\u201dAs a result, much of Uber\u2019s communication with drivers over the years has aimed at combating shortages by advising drivers to move to areas where they exist, or where they might arise. Uber encouraged its local managers to experiment with ways of achieving this.\u201cIt was all day long, every day \u2014 texts, emails, pop-ups: \u2018Hey, the morning rush has started. Get to this area, that\u2019s where demand is biggest,\u2019\u201d said Ed Frantzen, a veteran Uber driver in the Chicago area. \u201cIt was always, constantly, trying to get you into a certain direction.\u201dSome local managers who were men went so far as to adopt a female persona for texting drivers, having found that the uptake was higher when they did.\u201c\u2018Laura\u2019 would tell drivers: \u2018Hey, the concert\u2019s about to let out. You should head over there,\u2019\u201d said John P. Parker, a manager in Uber\u2019s Dallas office in 2014 and 2015, referring to one of the personas. \u201cWe have an overwhelmingly male driver population.\u201dUber acknowledged that it had experimented with female personas to increase engagement with drivers.The friction over meeting demand was compounded by complaints about arrangements like aggressive car leases that required many drivers to work upward of 50 or 60 hours each week to eke out a profit. Uber officials began to worry that a driver backlash was putting them at a strategic disadvantage in their competition with Lyft, which had cultivated a reputation for being more driver-friendly.Now Uber began a process of, in effect, becoming a little less like Mr. Kalanick, and a little more like Lyft.It rethought a lease program, softened the hectoring tone of its messages and limited their volume. At times it became positively cheery.During roughly the same period, Uber was increasingly concerned that many new drivers were leaving the platform before completing the 25 rides that would earn them a signing bonus. To stem that tide, Uber officials in some cities began experimenting with simple encouragement: You\u2019re almost halfway there, congratulations!While the experiment seemed warm and innocuous, it had in fact been exquisitely calibrated. The company\u2019s data scientists had previously discovered that once drivers reached the 25-ride threshold, their rate of attrition fell sharply.And psychologists and video game designers have long known that encouragement toward a concrete goal can motivate people to complete a task.\u201cIt\u2019s getting you to internalize the company\u2019s goals,\u201d said Chelsea Howe, a prominent video game designer who has spoken out against coercive psychological techniques deployed in games. \u201cInternalized motivation is the most powerful kind.\u201dMr. Amodeo, the Uber spokesman, defended the practice. \u201cWe try to make the early experience as good as possible, but also as realistic as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to decide for themselves if driving is right for them.\u201dThat making drivers feel good could be compatible with treating them as lab subjects was no surprise. None other than Lyft itself had shown as much several years earlier.In 2013, the company hired a consulting firm to figure out how to encourage more driving during the platform\u2019s busiest hours.At the time, Lyft drivers could voluntarily sign up in advance for shifts. The consultants devised an experiment in which the company showed one group of inexperienced drivers how much more they would make by moving from a slow period like Tuesday morning to a busy time like Friday night \u2014 about $15 more per hour.For another group, Lyft reversed the calculation, displaying how much drivers were losing by sticking with Tuesdays.The latter had a more significant effect on increasing the hours drivers scheduled during busy periods.Still, Ms. Berman disclosed in an interview, Lyft eventually decided against using the loss-aversion approach, suggesting that the company has drawn brighter lines when it comes to potential manipulation.As he tried to log off at 7:13 a.m. on New Year\u2019s Day last year, Josh Streeter, then an Uber driver in the Tampa, Fla., area, received a message on the company\u2019s driver app with the headline \u201cMake it to $330.\u201d The text then explained: \u201cYou\u2019re $10 away from making $330 in net earnings. Are you sure you want to go offline?\u201d Below were two prompts: \u201cGo offline\u201d and \u201cKeep driving.\u201d The latter was already highlighted.\u201cI\u2019ve got screen shots with dozens of these messages,\u201d said Mr. Streeter, who began driving full time for Lyft and then Uber in 2014 but quit last year to invest in real estate.Mr. Streeter was not alone. For months, when drivers tried to log out, the app would frequently tell them they were only a certain amount away from making a seemingly arbitrary sum for the day, or from matching their earnings from that point one week earlier.The messages were intended to exploit another relatively widespread behavioral tic \u2014 people\u2019s preoccupation with goals \u2014 to nudge them into driving longer.Uber, for its part, appears to be aware of the ludic loop. In its messages to drivers, it included a graphic of an engine gauge with a needle that came tantalizingly close to, but was still short of, a dollar sign.And the ludic loop is far from the only video game feature that Uber has adapted as a way of keeping drivers on the road.At any moment, the app shows drivers how many trips they have taken in the current week, how much money they have made, how much time they have spent logged on and what their overall rating from passengers is. All of these metrics can stimulate the competitive juices that drive compulsive game-playing.\u201cThe whole thing is like a video game,\u201d said Eli Solomon, a veteran Uber and Lyft driver in the Chicago area, who said he sometimes had to fight the urge to work more after glancing at his data.Sometimes the so-called gamification is quite literal. Like players on video game platforms such as Xbox, PlayStation and Pogo, Uber drivers can earn badges for achievements like Above and Beyond (denoted on the app by a cartoon of a rocket blasting off), Excellent Service (marked by a picture of a sparkling diamond) and Entertaining Drive (a pair of Groucho Marx glasses with nose and eyebrows).Of course, managers have been borrowing from the logic of games for generations, as when they set up contests and competition among workers. More overt forms of gamification have proliferated during the past decade. For example, Microsoft has used the approach to entice workers to perform the otherwise sleep-inducing task of software debugging.But Uber can go much further. Because it mediates its drivers\u2019 entire work experience through an app, there are few limits to the elements it can gamify. Uber collects staggering amounts of data that allow it to discard game features that do not work and refine those that do. And because its workers are contractors, the gamification strategies are not hemmed in by employment law.Kevin Werbach, a business professor who has written extensively on the subject, said that while gamification could be a force for good in the gig economy \u2014 for example, by creating bonds among workers who do not share a physical space \u2014 there was a danger of abuse. \u201cIf what you\u2019re doing is basically saying, \u2018We\u2019ve found a cheap way to get you to do work without paying you for it, we\u2019ll pay you in badges that don\u2019t cost anything,\u2019 that\u2019s a manipulative way to go about it,\u201d he said.For some drivers, that is precisely the effect. Scott Weber said he drove full time most weeks last year, picking up passengers in the Tampa area for both Uber and Lyft, yet made less than $20,000 before expenses like gas and maintenance. \u201cI was a business that had a loss,\u201d said Mr. Weber, who is looking for another job. \u201cI\u2019m using payday loans.\u201dStill, when asked about the badges he earns while driving for Uber, Mr. Weber practically gushed. \u201cI\u2019ve got currently 12 excellent-service and nine great-conversation badges,\u201d he said in an interview in early March. \u201cIt tells me where I\u2019m at.\u201dWhen asked whether Uber\u2019s product managers and data scientists were akin to developers at a social gaming company like Zynga, Jonathan Hall, Uber\u2019s head of economic and policy research, accepted the analogy but rejected the implication.\u201cI think there\u2019s something to that, but ultimately Zynga should worry mostly about how fun its games are rather than trying to get you to play a little bit more by some trick,\u201d he said. He argued that exploiting people\u2019s psychological tics was unlikely to have more than a marginal effect on how long they played Zynga\u2019s games or drove for Uber. It is \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d he said.Mr. Hall is clearly right about the effects of certain techniques, like those pitched at drivers\u2019 tendency to set income targets or to focus more on losses than gains. On the other hand, even features that produce relatively small changes in driving patterns can become quite important to a company like Uber.According to Mr. Parker, the former Uber manager in Dallas, increasing the number of drivers on the road by 20 percent at certain hours of the day, or in a busy part of town, can rein in a large fare surge.More important, some of the psychological levers that Uber pulls to increase the supply of drivers have quite powerful effects.Consider an algorithm called forward dispatch \u2014 Lyft has a similar one \u2014 that dispatches a new ride to a driver before the current one ends. Forward dispatch shortens waiting times for passengers, who may no longer have to wait for a driver 10 minutes away when a second driver is dropping off a passenger two minutes away.Perhaps no less important, forward dispatch causes drivers to stay on the road substantially longer during busy periods \u2014 a key goal for both companies.Uber and Lyft explain this in essentially the same way. \u201cDrivers keep telling us the worst thing is when they\u2019re idle for a long time,\u201d said Kevin Fan, the director of product at Lyft. \u201cIf it\u2019s slow, they\u2019re going to go sign off. We want to make sure they\u2019re constantly busy.\u201dWhile this is unquestionably true, there is another way to think of the logic of forward dispatch: It overrides self-control.As with viewers and binge-watching, many drivers appear to enjoy the forward-dispatch feature, which can increase earnings by keeping them busier. But it can also work against their interests by increasing the number of drivers on the road and defusing fare surges. And whether they enjoy it is separate from the question of agency \u2014 whether they have it, or whether the company does.Uber officials say the feature initially produced so many rides at times that drivers began to experience a chronic Netflix ailment \u2014 the inability to stop for a bathroom break. Amid the uproar, Uber introduced a pause button.\u201cDrivers were saying: \u2018I can never go offline. I\u2019m on just continuous trips. This is a problem.\u2019 So we redesigned it,\u201d said Maya Choksi, a senior Uber official in charge of building products that help drivers. \u201cIn the middle of the trip, you can say, \u2018Stop giving me requests.\u2019 So you can have more control over when you want to stop driving.\u201dSometimes all that is necessary is the mere setting of a so-called default. Because humans tend to be governed by inertia, automatically enrolling them in retirement savings plans and then allowing them to opt out results in far higher participation than letting them opt in. Making Post-Play the default can have the same effect.\u201cIf done right, these things can be socially beneficial,\u201d Mr. Laibson said. \u201cBut you can think of all sorts of choice architecture that are quite contrary to human well-being.\u201dEven Mr. Hall, the Uber research director who downplayed the importance of behavioral economics to the company, did make at least one concession. \u201cThe optimal default we set is that we want you to do as much work as there is to do,\u201d he said of the company\u2019s app. \u201cYou\u2019re not required to by any means. But that\u2019s the default.\u201dThere are aspects of the platforms that genuinely do increase drivers\u2019 control over their work lives, as Uber frequently points out. Unlike most workers, an Uber driver can put in a few hours each day between dropping children off at school and picking them up in the afternoon.Uber is even in the process of developing a feature that allows drivers to tell the app in advance that they need to arrive at a given location at a given time. \u201cIf you need to pick up your kids at soccer practice at 6 p.m.,\u201d said Nundu Janakiram, the Uber official in charge of products that improve drivers\u2019 experiences, \u201cit will start to give you trips to take you in the general direction to get to a specific place in time.\u201dThere is also the possibility that as the online gig economy matures, companies like Uber may adopt a set of norms that limit their ability to manipulate workers through cleverly designed apps.Kelly Peters, chief executive of BEworks, a management consulting firm specializing in behavioral science, argued that the same data that makes it easier for Uber to nudge drivers into working an additional 30 or 60 minutes also makes it hard to escape the obligation to look after them.That moment of maturity does not appear to have arrived yet, however. Consider a prompt that Uber rolled out this year, inviting drivers to press a large box if they want the app to navigate them to an area where they have a \u201chigher chance\u201d of finding passengers. The accompanying graphic resembles the one that indicates that an area\u2019s fares are \u201csurging,\u201d except in this case fares are not necessarily higher.Some drivers believe that the intent is to trick them into driving where Uber wants them to go, rather than where driving would be most profitable, by implying that they will find a surge there. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to move people where they want them,\u201d said Mr. Weber, the Tampa-area driver. \u201cBut you get there and it\u2019s nothing. It happens all the time.\u201d Mr. Weber noted that the design of the graphic makes the prompt much easier to accept than decline, which requires pressing a small rectangle in the top left corner.Uber said that the feature was an experiment intended primarily to help new drivers who frequently say they do not know where to find passengers, and that it could be changed if drivers were dissatisfied.Individual features aside, the broader question of how much Uber seeks to influence drivers through behavioral science may come down to how much its business model requires it.While the company has made no secret of its investment in self-driving cars, it could be a decade or more before they completely replace human drivers. In the meantime, as long as Uber continues to set growth and passenger volume as critical goals, it will have an incentive to make wringing more hours out of drivers a higher priority than the drivers\u2019 bottom line whenever it faces a close call between the two.Moreover, the contractor model itself provides a strong impetus for companies like Uber to grow. Many companies in the gig economy simply do not have enough workers, or rich enough data about their workers\u2019 behavior, to navigate busy periods using nudges and the like. To avoid chronic understaffing, they have switched to an employee model that allows them to compel workers to log in when the companies most need them.Once companies achieve a certain scale, on the other hand, they enter a virtuous cycle: The risk of understaffing drops with a big enough pool of workers, and the cost savings of using contractors begins to outweigh the inefficiencies. This in turn frees up money to enter new markets and acquire new customers, which makes the contractor model still more efficient, and throws off still more savings.It is, as a result, not too hard to imagine a future in which massive digital platforms like Uber have an appetite for tens of millions of workers \u2014 not only for ferrying people, but also for delivering food and retail goods. Nor is it hard to imagine workers\u2019 obliging them, perhaps because their skills do not match the needs of more traditional employers, or because they need to supplement their wages.In such an economy, experts say, using big data and algorithms to manage workers will not simply be a niche phenomenon. It may become one of the most common ways of managing the American labor force.\u201cYou have all these players entering into this space, and the assumption is they\u2019ll do it through vast armies of underemployed people looking for extra hours, and we can control every nuance about what they do but not have to pay them,\u201d said David Weil, the top wage-and-hour official under President Barack Obama.When you stop to consider the enormous cost advantages, Mr. Weil said, \u201cit says to me this is an area that will grow fast.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Sues the Government to Block the Unmasking of an Account Critical of Trump", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twitter sued the federal government on Thursday to block the unmasking of an anonymous account that has posted messages critical of the Trump administration and has claimed to have ties to a government agency.The suit sets up a potential confrontation between the Trump administration and Twitter over digital privacy, a thorny issue that has driven a wedge between the technology industry and government in the past.Twitter said in its filing that it could not be compelled to disclose the identity or identities of whoever is behind the account. The company argued that the government\u2019s directive and reasoning were unlawful, and that complying would have \u201ca grave chilling effect\u201d on the speech of alt-accounts that voice resistance to government policies.\u201cA time-honored tradition of pseudonymous free speech on matters of public moment runs deep in the political life of America,\u201d Twitter said in its filing. \u201cThese First Amendment interests are at their zenith when, as here, the speech at issue touches on matters of public political life.\u201dJenny Burke, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security Department, which, with Customs and Border Protection had issued the summons, declined to comment.Even before this episode, previous presidential administrations have sought access the valuable digital information held by Facebook, Google, Twitter and other internet companies, in what some of the companies have said is an overreach of government power. Federal officials have typically said in such cases that they need the data at issue for national security or other reasons.Last year, for example, Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company, squared off against the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a contentious case involving issues of privacy and national security.The new case involving Twitter is more straightforward than Apple\u2019s standoff with the F.B.I., which required the creation of new technology to circumvent the iPhone\u2019s encryption. The Twitter case is centered instead on the protection of free speech, which is critical to the social media company\u2019s platform.The company is seeking to block the Trump administration from forcing it to reveal the identity of a user who has been critical of the Homeland Security Department.On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union said it planned to represent the anonymous user or users behind @ALT_USCIS.\u201cTo unmask an anonymous speaker online, the government must have a strong justification,\u201d said Nathan Freed Wessler, an A.C.L.U. attorney involved in the case. \u201cBut in this case the government has given no reason at all, leading to concerns that it is simply trying to stifle dissent.\u201dThe case stems from a wave of alternative government agency accounts that sprouted on Twitter after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Upon being sworn into office, the president began to silence federal agencies from speaking out on the social media platform after the National Park Service\u2019s official Twitter account posted side-by-side images comparing the size of the crowds at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration \u201cto the apparently larger crowd size at President Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration,\u201d according to Twitter\u2019s court filing.In response, alternative accounts began to pop up, with many professing to be written by current or former employees of federal agencies. Accounts with handles like @Alt_Labor, @BadlandsNPS and @RogueEPAstaff had attracted tens of thousands of followers less than a week after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.The @ALT_USCIS account, which was created in January, has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies, among other topics. Messages posted by the account have referred to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order restricting travel to the United States by people from several mostly Muslim countries as the \u201c#MuslimBan.\u201dThe account has also described itself as \u201cofficial inside resistance\u201d and has said several times that the person or people using it to post messages is a current federal employee of Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Homeland Security Department. Twitter said in its court filing that about 19,000 employees and contractors work for Citizenship and Immigration Services.In March, Customs and Border Protection sent Twitter a summons that ordered the company to hand over information about the @ALT_USCIS account, including the names, phone numbers, mailing addresses and internet protocol addresses of the account holder or holders.The summons cited 19 U.S. Code 1509, a federal law that authorizes Customs and Border Protection to \u201cobtain documents only for investigations and inquiries relating to the importation of merchandise.\u201dTwitter said the law was not relevant to the agency\u2019s request and also that the summons violated the Stored Communications Act, which protects individuals\u2019 privacy and proprietary interests.As for @ALT_USCIS, the account was particularly active on Thursday, posting more than a dozen messages after Twitter\u2019s suit against the government became public. The account, which added 32,000 followers within two months of being started, had ballooned to more than 77,000 followers by early in the evening.Highlighted at the top of the account: a message featuring a screenshot of the Constitution and the First Amendment.Advertisement"}

And we took six million low-income families entirely off the income tax rolls.BOB PACKWOOD, PORTLAND, ORE.The writer, a former Republican senator from Oregon, was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in 1985-86. To the Editor:Unless Americans want to \u201cstarve the beast\u201d further, they should be chary of so-called \u201ctax reform\u201d and \u201ctax simplification.\u201d They can become a slow-motion Trojan horse.Over the years, many of the reforms and simplifications of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 have been repealed outright or just eroded, without even a pretense of maintaining revenue neutrality. Over the long term, tax reform has become a vehicle for ratcheting down the amount of money available for public purposes. At the same time, our tax system has become increasingly inequitable.Legislation that lacks strong mechanisms to defeat tax termites that undermine the structure and to prevent clandestine revenue losses should either be amended or defeated.\u201cReforms\u201d could actually make things worse.To the Editor:As one who considers himself a liberal and usually votes Democratic, I nevertheless find myself in full agreement with the writers\u2019 proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, and to allow capital investment to be fully deducted in the first year of expenditure.I have been a chief financial officer of two venture-backed companies, and I know that every dollar of profit in small businesses goes right back into the business. Enactment of this proposal would further innovation, growth and jobs.I am also enthusiastic about the infrastructure investment proposal. With these two ideas, President Trump has an opportunity to get Democrats and Republicans on board, and fulfill his campaign promises on growth, tax reform and infrastructure.But I would add one caveat: Keep the tax rate at 35 percent for profits used to pay dividends or buy back stock. In the past 10 years, American corporations have spent trillions of dollars in buybacks and dividends, stunting growth while enriching shareholders and mediocre executives. This came at the expense of workers, long-term company health and the American economy.Adding this provision will provide incentives to executives and their shareholders to invest for growth.MICHAEL TWOMEY, AUSTIN, TEX.To the Editor:In case the writers haven\u2019t noticed, big business in America has been racking up record profits. It is small businesses that need the benefit from tax relief. So unless Republicans are intent on bestowing a grand entitlement on big business at the expense of our grander deficit, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to target all tax relief, including the deduction of the full cost of capital purchases and reduction in the tax rate, exclusively to small businesses? And we should ensure that small businesses are given priority in all contracts for infrastructure improvement.Targeting tax relief to where it is most needed may avert a deficit increase and would be more likely to spur growth from the bottom up rather than hoping and praying for it to trickle down.Advertisement"}

Many are also from sub-Saharan Africa; the former French colonies of Ivory Coast, Mali, Senegal and Togo; and what was once French Indochina, today\u2019s Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. For them, neither the right nor the left has delivered when it comes to making jobs more available and reducing discrimination.\u201cThe second round is a catastrophe,\u201d said Cheker Messaoudi, 29, a Frenchman of Tunisian heritage. \u201cI think with Macron we are facing a war on the economy and with Le Pen we are facing a civil war, so it is bad both ways.\u201dWith an abstention rate of 38 percent including blank ballots in contrast to 23.5 percent nationwide in the first round of the presidential election, Stains reflects a particularly high degree of disillusionment. A community of about 38,000 inhabitants on the outskirts of Paris, it voted overwhelmingly for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, a former Trotskyite, who finished fourth. With Mr. M\u00e9lenchon out, many people see the race, as expressed in an old French saying, as a choice between \u201cla peste et le chol\u00e9ra\u201d (the plague and the cholera).To many people here, the policy proposals of both candidates are unattractive: Ms. Le Pen proposes a law-and-order program that would place binational Muslims at higher risk of expulsion from the country if they are considered even remotely connected to those suspected of having terrorist links. She also has inveighed against wearing a head scarf in public.Mr. Macron, a former banker, is seen as close to the moneyed elite. He is disparaged for his support for Uber, which employs many people at low wages and often under poor conditions. He worked as a minister to the Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who promised improvements that never arrived.\u201cThey are really tired of people talking about the banlieues but not doing anything,\u201d said Julien Talpin, a researcher in political science at the University of Lille. \u201cMacron in the banlieues is a kind of big failure. He appears to be an embodiment of the establishment, of the elite, and people can tell he\u2019s not one of them.\u201dMr. Macron received 22 percent of the vote in Stains.Thomas Kirszbaum, a sociologist, says the demographics and voting patterns of the poorer suburbs are far more complex than is widely understood. Living together are people of immigrant background, who vote on the far left or not at all, and some longtime residents, usually white, but also some immigrants, who vote on the extreme right. In Stains, nearly 15 percent of voters favored Ms. Le Pen.Then there is a small, new class of young entrepreneurs, both Muslims and non-Muslims, many of whom support Mr. Macron, who has made outreach to entrepreneurs a priority.Mr. Talpin noted a big change from 2012, when the poor suburbs turned out in large numbers to vote for the Socialist Party candidate, Mr. Hollande; he was running against President Nicolas Sarkozy, whom many people opposed.\u201cThey haven\u2019t really mobilized so much against Le Pen,\u201d he said, despite the xenophobic tone of her campaign. \u201cThey are somehow feeling they are experiencing that discrimination on a daily basis.\u201dSitting in his office not far from the central square in Stains, the mayor, Azz\u00e9dine Ta\u00efbi, who is Muslim, suggested that it would take someone who inspired people, as well as effective government programs, to get people to embrace the political system again.\u201cThis is an electorate that has nothing more to lose,\u201d he said. \u201cFor this reason, what I see in this election is a sense of abandonment from working-class people: Either we leave them in total hopelessness or we build hope with them through an alternative policy.\u201dYassine Belattar, a popular stand-up comedian who grew up in the suburbs, said that anti-government feeling was significantly stronger this year because of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, who ratified people\u2019s sense of injustice and their fury at the system.\u201cHe manipulates anger for his personal ends,\u201d said Mr. Belattar, referring to Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, adding that the candidate\u2019s refusal to endorse Mr. Macron helps Ms. Le Pen. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon announced on Friday that he would not vote for Ms. Le Pen but refused to endorse Mr. Macron.Mr. Belattar said he intended to vote for Mr. Macron.Yet the sense of betrayal is acute among many people, not least toward the Socialists who had promised change but failed to follow through.\u201cHollande visited the suburbs but these were visits for the media,\u201d said Selimane Abderrahmane, an assistant mayor in Bobigny, a neighboring suburb to Stains, where the abstention rate in the vote last week was 37 percent (including blank ballots). Mr. M\u00e9lenchon took 43 percent of the vote.\u201cHollande promised social and economic programs,\u201d he added. \u201cHe promised to end racial profiling. He was full of promises that people never saw come true.\u201dMr. Abderrahmane said he was voting for Mr. Macron only because he was afraid that the situation for Muslims would get markedly worse under Ms. Le Pen.However, his friend Sylvain Leg\u00e9r, a municipal counselor who is white and has spent his whole life in Bobigny, said that after voting for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon in the first round, he could not bring himself to vote for Mr. Macron. He instead will abstain.\u201cHe\u2019s for globalization 100 percent,\u201d Mr. Leg\u00e9r said. \u201cWhat does that mean when workers come from their own country, mix with French workers, and on one side you have young people who want to work and on the other you have people who come from elsewhere in Europe or from other countries and who work for less?\u201dOn Friday, Catharine Bont\u00e9, 75, a former nurse\u2019s aide, recalled writing letters to past presidents seeking help.\u201cThey all helped me a bit with social care,\u201d said Ms. Bont\u00e9, who is black. \u201cAnd Giscard d\u2019Estaing\u2019s wife even came to support me once because I was a single mother and I was a victim of injustices and racism.\u201d\u201cBut Hollande, he never helped me; he never answered my letters,\u201d she added. \u201cSo I understand the ones who gave up on voting. There is a lot of suffering here.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled in some instances the surname of the far-left presidential candidate.

Federal observers oversee 99 percent of the large trawlers fishing for pollock, ensuring that this largest of fisheries maintains an impeccable set of management tools.But in spite of all of our success, only around 9 percent of the seafood available in American markets comes from American fishermen. In fact, the last traditional fishing communities in the United States are fighting for their very existence. Fair-trade local fishermen remain unable to compete in our domestic marketplace, which is overwhelmed and flooded with cheap, untraceable imported seafood.More than half the imported seafood here comes from fish farms, mostly in Asian countries, where there is little regulation of food safety. The rest, which is wild, is often from illegal sources. Rates of seafood fraud and deceptive mislabeling in the domestic marketplace are soaring to unprecedented levels.Which government agency is at the forefront of combating this fraud? NOAA. Any funding for NOAA programs that help consumers reconnect to clean, healthy, sustainable seafood swimming off our shores is funding that we cannot afford to lose. The costs of managing our wild fisheries will not disappear with budget cuts; instead, the financial burden for programs like federal at-sea monitoring will continue to shift onto the shoulders of the last remaining American fishermen.And it\u2019s not just wild American seafood that risks disaster. Aquaculture, the fastest-growing food sector in the world and one of the most promising new industries in the United States, will be crippled by President Trump\u2019s budget cuts. The United States already ranks 17th in world aquaculture production, behind Myanmar. Yes, sad! Without NOAA, things would be even sadder.For those who work at sea, economic opportunity is inextricably tied to environmental protection. An Environmental Protection Agency initiative to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, now on the chopping block, has been the catalyst for more than 500 new ocean farms in the Chesapeake Bay in the last five years.Cutting NOAA\u2019s budget is a bad idea, both for parents who want their children to realize their full potential and for a president who wants to keep eating his favorite sandwich. And if all that fails to convince, consider this: NOAA tracks storms and wave heights, allowing thousands of fishermen to work safely. Without adequate funding, many could find themselves literally lost at sea.An article on Tuesday, about President Trump\u2019s proposed cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, misstated the percentage of large pollock trawlers overseen by federal observers.

That proposal is opposed by home builders and real estate agents, who fear it would diminish the importance of the mortgage interest deduction. And it is likely to necessitate eliminating or curbing other popular deductions, a politically risky pursuit.As of late Tuesday, the plan did not include Mr. Trump\u2019s promised $1 trillion infrastructure program, two of the people said, and it jettisoned a House Republican proposal to impose a substantial tax on imports, known as a border adjustment tax, which would have raised billions of dollars to help offset the cost of the cuts.With that decision, Mr. Trump acceded to pressure from retailers and conservative advocacy groups, but the move could deepen the challenge of passing a broad tax overhaul in Congress, where concern about the swelling federal deficit runs high. His plan would put off the difficult part of a tax overhaul: closing loopholes and increasing other taxes to limit the impact of tax cuts on the budget deficit.Republicans are likely to embrace the plan\u2019s centerpiece, substantial tax reductions for businesses large and small, even as they push back against the jettisoning of their border adjustment tax. The 15 percent rate would apply both to corporations, which now pay 35 percent, and to a broad range of firms known as pass-through entities \u2014 including hedge funds, real estate concerns like Mr. Trump\u2019s and large partnerships \u2014 that currently pay taxes at individual rates, which top off at 39.6 percent.

In trying to slash taxes for \u2018pass through\u2019 business entities, Trump is seeking to dramatically reduce his own tax bill.\u201dThe border adjustment tax may be revisited later but was considered too controversial to include now.Spokeswomen for the White House and the Treasury Department declined to comment on the details of the plan before Wednesday\u2019s announcement, which is expected to contain only broad principles, leaving unanswered crucial questions about the financing of the package and the process for advancing it through Congress.Emerging from a meeting at the Capitol where he briefed Republican congressional leaders on Tuesday evening, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said participants had \u201cvery, very productive discussions\u201d and were united in their desire to accomplish a tax overhaul this year.The broad contours of the plan seemed to please conservatives who had worried in recent weeks that Mr. Trump, who has dropped or modified many of the major proposals of his campaign, was drifting away from the plan he had laid out for voters.\u201cConservatives are going to be very happy with this plan, because it achieves a lot of the objectives that we\u2019ve wanted: lower business taxes, simplification and not a major tax increase that is unacceptable,\u201d said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and helped craft his tax proposal.But Mr. Moore conceded that finding ways to offset the large revenue reductions envisioned in the blueprint would be a challenge.\u201cThat\u2019s the unknown right now, is whether there is some sort of pay-for for any of this,\u201d he said.Government officials crafting the tax plans are aware of the math problem, one of the people involved in the proposal said, but they see the 15 percent corporate tax rate as a compelling starting point for negotiations. Mr. Trump may yet reveal other tactics for replenishing lost tax revenue, someone who has been briefed on the plans said.But the final plans remain very much in flux. At midafternoon on Tuesday, for instance, it was still not clear whether personal income-tax rate cuts or an increase in the standardized deduction for individuals would be part of Wednesday\u2019s announcement.The demise of the border adjustment tax was met with relief by Republicans in the Senate, who had been cool to it from the start.On Tuesday, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said it was safe to conclude that the provision was \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d because of skepticism in the Senate.But Mr. Cornyn described Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to cut the corporate income tax to 15 percent as \u201cpretty aggressive,\u201d with unknown consequences for the deficit.Other Republican senators appeared ready to embrace a tax proposal that adds to the deficit in the name of jump-starting the economy. Republicans appear intent on using parliamentary rules that would block Democrats from filibustering the plan in the Senate, but would also put a time limit on the tax cuts.\u201cI\u2019m open to getting this country moving,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure we have to go that route, but if we do, I can live with it.\u201dSenator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said he was also open to tax cuts with an expiration date if that was the only way to get them passed without Democratic support, pointing to President George W. Bush\u2019s cuts.\u201cYou look at the tax cuts from 2002 and 2003 \u2014 well over 90 percent of them became permanent law,\u201d Mr. Blunt said.Democrats have criticized Republicans for failing to engage with them on a tax overhaul. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he would be open to working with Republicans on a plan that would bring home corporate profits parked overseas and use some of the funds to pay for infrastructure.But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said on Tuesday that he intended to pass tax legislation through budget rules that would block a filibuster. He accused Democrats of being more interested in \u201cwealth transfers\u201d than in spurring economic growth.So far, the Senate has taken a back seat in tax discussions. The abandonment of the border adjustment tax will deal a blow to the comprehensive rewrite of the tax code championed by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.Mr. Brady said Tuesday that he would press ahead with the import tax, not merely because it would make up for lost revenue but because it would protect American jobs.However, he acknowledged that his goal of producing legislation before summer was slipping.\u201cI\u2019m less focused on the month than on the year for tax reform, which would be this year,\u201d Mr. Brady said.An earlier version of this article misstated how much the economy would have to grow to make up for the loss in federal revenue caused by the proposed tax cuts, according to the Tax Foundation. It would have to become 5 percent larger, not five times larger.Advertisement"}

Plant Closed, Havoc Followed", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesBut in the opening pages of \u201cJanesville: An American Story,\u201d Amy Goldstein\u2019s moving and magnificently well-researched ethnography of a small Wisconsin factory city on economic life support, Ryan is just another congressman, pleading on behalf of his hometown, population 63,000.It\u2019s 2008, and Ryan has just received a phone call from Rick Wagoner, then the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, to alert him that the company will shortly be stopping all production in Janesville.\u201cGive us Cavaliers,\u201d he begs. \u201cGive us pickups.\u201d Any model other than the unpopular SUVs the plant is currently churning out, he means. \u201cYou know you\u2019ll destroy this town if you do this!\u201d he yells into the phone.Terrific news, you might say. But that number belies some harsh realities on the ground, as we learn throughout the book. Real wages in the town have fallen. Marriages have collapsed. And Janesville, a town with an unusual level of civic commitment, unity and native spirit \u2014 the Ryan family has been there for five generations \u2014 has capitulated to the same partisan rancor that afflicts the rest of the nation.It was not the sort of place, for instance, where a beloved local politician might find someone unfurling his middle finger at him during Labor Fest \u2014 until 2011, which happened to be the year that Scott Walker, a flamboyantly anti-union and polarizing figure, took up residence in the governor\u2019s mansion. The town is now riven by \u201can optimism gap,\u201d as Goldstein calls it, with dispossessed workers on one side and bullish businesspeople on the other.\u201cJanesville\u201d joins a growing family of books about the evisceration of the working class in the United States. What sets it apart is the sophistication of its storytelling and analysis.The characters are especially memorable. This may be the first time since I began this job that I\u2019ve wanted to send notes of admiration to three people in a work of nonfiction.Readers will also finish \u201cJanesville\u201d with an extremely sobering takeaway: There\u2019s scant evidence that job retraining, possibly the sole item on the menu of policy options upon which Democrats and Republicans can agree, is at all effective.In the case of the many laid-off workers in the Janesville area, the outcomes are decidedly worse for those who have attended the local technical college to learn a new trade. (Goldstein arrives at this conclusion, outlined in detail, by enlisting the help of local labor economists and poring over multiple data sets.) A striking number of dislocated G.M. employees don\u2019t even know how to use a computer when they first show up for classes at Blackhawk Technical College. \u201cSome students dropped out as soon as they found out that their instructors would not accept course papers written out longhand,\u201d Goldstein writes.It makes you realize how challenging \u2014 and humiliating \u2014 it can be to reinvent oneself in midlife. To do so requires a kind of bravery for which no one gets a medal.But perhaps the most powerful aspect of \u201cJanesville\u201d is its simple chronological structure, which allows Goldstein to show the chain reaction that something so calamitous as a plant closing can effect. Each falling domino becomes a headstone, signifying the death of the next thing.Because the G.M. plant closes, so does the plant at the Lear Corporation, which supplied it with car seats and interiors. Because so many in Janesville are now out of work, nonprofits lose board members and contributions to local charities shrivel. Because their parents are out of work, students at Parker High start showing up for school both hungry and dirty. A social studies teacher starts the \u201cParker Closet,\u201d which provides them with food and supplies. (Deri Wahlert: She\u2019s one of the people to whom I\u2019d like to write a fan note.)The fabric of hundreds of families unravels, as an itinerant class of fathers \u2014 \u201cJanesville Gypsies,\u201d they call themselves \u2014 start commuting to G.M. factories in Texas, Indiana and Kansas, just so they can maintain their wage of $28 an hour. Those who stay home invariably see their paychecks shrink drastically. One of the men Goldstein follows, Jerad Whiteaker, cycles through a series of unsatisfying, low-paying jobs, finally settling in one that pays less than half his former wage and offers no health insurance. His twin teenage girls \u2014 to whom I\u2019d also like to send awed notes \u2014 share five jobs between them, earning so much money for their family that they compromise their eligibility for student loans.You will learn a lot about the arbitrary rules and idiosyncrasies of our government programs from this book. They have as many treacherous cracks and crevices as a glacier \u2014 and offer about as much warmth.\u201cJanesville\u201d is not without shortcomings. It can be overwhelming at first, with many characters raining down on the reader at once \u2014 it\u2019s a bit like getting caught in a hailstorm of pickup sticks. (Though there\u2019s a cheat sheet in the front of the book, which helps.) There\u2019s almost no discussion of globalization and outsourcing jobs to Mexico, which seems a strange omission. Surely, the residents of Janesville must have an opinion about this?But these are minor objections, ultimately. \u201cJanesville\u201d is eye-opening, important, a diligent work of reportage. I am sure Paul Ryan will read it. I wonder what he will say.Advertisement"}

Well, that\u2019s a core part of its business.But the bank\u2019s performance in those areas so far this year has been weak \u2014 an embarrassing setback when compared with strong profits in those businesses for competitors, like Bank of America and Citibank.Goldman Sachs doesn\u2019t want people to read too much into just one quarter\u2019s earnings.But this is Goldman, so all of Wall Street was trying to work it out. (Investors punished the bank\u2019s stock, which closed down 4.7 percent.)It wasn\u2019t all bad.

Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said on Tuesday that his office had reached a $40 million settlement with Harbert Management Corporation and several of its top executives over allegations that they had not paid state taxes for some of the most profitable years that Mr. Falcone was managing Harbinger, which was owned by Harbert.An investigation by Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office had found that Harbert paid no state taxes on the profit generated by Harbinger from 2004 to 2009, even though the hedge fund and Mr. Falcone were based in Manhattan.Harbert said in a statement that the firm and its executives \u201cadamantly deny that they committed any wrongdoing\u201d and that they made \u201ca commercial decision to settle this legacy issue.\u201dThat would be another improvement from 2016.

{"Headline": "Partisan Divide Over Economic Outlook Worries Ben Bernanke", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byDealBookBen Bernanke is worried.The former chairman of the Federal Reserve, who can offer his thoughts freely now that he is three years out of office, is not anxious about the objective, actual state of the economy. Rather, he is worried that Democrats and Republicans view the health of our nation completely differently.To Democrats, things look dour indeed. To Republicans, things are rosy and looking better all the time.\u201cThere is this kind of partisan coloring,\u201d Mr. Bernanke told me last week in a rare interview while on a trip to Manhattan from Washington, where he lives.\u201cIt is really striking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe election result completely reversed people\u2019s views of the state of the economy. Republicans who thought that we were in a dystopia now think things look great, and Democrats, the opposite. And it shows that it isn\u2019t all based on an objective assessment of the economy.\u201dMr. Bernanke\u2019s assessment is supported by recent research: A series of new surveys and polls show direct evidence that your politics increasingly define your view of the economy.To Mr. Bernanke, when the economy \u2014 as well as the basic statistics that undergird it \u2014 becomes politicized, the result is bad policy.\u201cA lot of the emotion is not really susceptible to nuanced policy arguments,\u201d he said, shaking his head.Mr. Bernanke has been thinking recently about the current state of politics and the economy. Although he left the Federal Reserve in 2014 (\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more relaxing to be in the civilian world,\u201d he said), he recently had to a write an afterword for the paperback version of his book \u201cThe Courage to Act,\u201d which is expected to come out in two weeks and chronicled his time at the Fed and captured his thinking during the financial crisis.That exercise forced him to try to think through the implications of economic policy in an age of populism. And while wages may be stagnant for many, and some industries are shedding jobs, Mr. Bernanke is convinced that much of the country hasn\u2019t appreciated just how good the economy is.\u201cThe U.S. has done so much better than most of the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean if you have an international perspective and you travel around the world, then you hear from policy makers or average people in other countries: \u2018Boy, the U.S. is doing great. We wish that Europe or Japan could do as well.\u2019\u201dStill, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that his view might appear to be one of a globalist or member of the elite.\u201cI fully acknowledge that doing well on the whole doesn\u2019t mean doing well for everybody, and there are a lot of people who have been left behind or have not done as well as the average,\u201d he said.That unevenness, he said, has led to much of the populism sweeping the globe.\u201cI think a lot of the populist reactions in the world, perhaps even more so than in the United States, is against immigration, which reflects cultural anxiety,\u201d he said, explaining that he believes part of the country is asking, \u201cAre we becoming a minority in our own country?\u201d\u201cClearly there is very substantial stress among a large part of the population,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. \u201cSome of it is cultural-social, and I\u2019m not really an expert on those things. Some of it is economic inequality, disruption from trade and technology, slow productivity growth, which means slow wage growth.\u201dMr. Bernanke, who was always a careful speaker when testifying to Congress, was mostly circumspect when it came to directly commenting on President Trump. A rare moment of direct commentary came when the conversation turned to tax policy and some of the ideas the Trump administration has floated.\u201cIn tax policy, corporate tax reform could be helpful if it stimulates capital investment, but as a practical matter it doesn\u2019t look like major reform is very likely,\u201d he said, brushing aside Mr. Trump\u2019s claims that a tax code overhaul is imminent.\u201cWe might have lower tax rates, maybe balanced to some extent by closing some loopholes, that would be a better policy,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going create a productivity miracle or anything like that, but it would be more efficient. It would probably improve investment a little bit.\u201dAnd while Mr. Bernanke was intrigued by the notion of a border adjustment tax, he was skeptical of this, too.\u201cI think politically it seems very unlikely to happen,\u201d he said. He added that it was \u201ca really interesting idea, and it\u2019s based on some very careful thinking about the tax code.\u201dThe biggest headwind it faces, he said, is \u201cthere is not much confidence that the dollar would appreciate by 25 percent\u201d \u2014 which would be required to make the math work \u2014 and \u201cthe import industry sees it as a big threat to their profits, so it\u2019ll be highly contested.\u201dAnd what about Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans?\u201cI think there is scope for smart infrastructure investment to be helpful,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said, contending that it might make the country more productive by lowering the time people spent in traffic, for example.He has also been following the debate about repealing Dodd-Frank and the seemingly similar calls by Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council, and Senator Elizabeth Warren to bring back some version of Glass-Steagall, which would separate commercial and investment banking. (At the same time, Mr. Bernanke made an unpopular \u2014 though accurate, in my view \u2014 argument: \u201cI don\u2019t think the repeal of Glass-Steagall was a very important factor in the financial crisis.\u201d)Then, with a smile, Mr. Bernanke turned into a political analyst: \u201cI think the idea that Gary Cohn and Elizabeth Warren agree on this may be a little bit overstated.\u201dHe said: \u201cI think the Republican perspective, which I assume Gary Cohn is thinking about, although I don\u2019t know, is to go back to the old world before the crisis, where you had free-standing investment banks and importantly, from the perspective of the free-standing investment banks, they weren\u2019t controlled. They weren\u2019t regulated by the Fed. They didn\u2019t have any of the bank regulation.\u201dOn the other hand, he said, \u201cI think the left or Democratic view of Glass-Steagall is we\u2019re going to break up these universal banks, we\u2019re going to reduce their political power, but we\u2019re not going to deregulate \u2014 we\u2019re going to make all the components subject to tough supervision.\u201dFinally, he said he had been thinking about the potential for robots to take our jobs and upend the economy, something that he thinks should be watched.\u201cYou have to recognize realistically that A.I. is qualitatively different from an internal combustion engine in that it was always the case that human imagination, creativity, social interaction, those things were unique to humans and couldn\u2019t be replicated by machines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are coming closer to the point where not only cashiers but surgeons might be at least partially replaced by A.I.\u201dThat could be a problem for Democrats and Republicans alike.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Supporting Erdogan, Turks Cite Economic and Religious Gains", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byISTANBUL \u2014 Merve Arslan, a teacher, struggles to reconcile her own perception of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey with that of his critics. \u201cHe\u2019s not a dictator,\u201d Ms. Arslan, 28, said. \u201cHe\u2019s a democrat.\u201dTurkey\u2019s main opposition party is demanding a recount after voting irregularities were reported in Sunday\u2019s referendum, which Mr. Erdogan won by 51.3 percent to 48.7. The pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, known by its Turkish abbreviation H.D.P., said that as many as three million votes, far more than the margin of victory, had lacked an official stamp and should be invalidated.But teams of European election observers also had complaints. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said in a preliminary report that the vote had been held \u201con an unlevel playing field,\u201d a reference to a state of emergency imposed by Mr. Erdogan during which lawmakers from one of the main opposition parties were among thousands of people arrested and \u201cno\u201d campaigners were physically intimidated and their rallies and access to public media were limited.The election commission itself denied any irregularities.Whatever the outcome of the appeals, the referendum reflected a country sharply divided, with voters in the major cities tending to oppose the changes while those in rural areas, who usually are more religious and conservative, voting in favor of them.Previously a regional economic powerhouse, Turkey has lost momentum recently, as the Syrian civil war across the border and instability within it have discouraged foreign investment and cut into growth.On Monday, Mr. Erdogan hailed the vote as a major and much-needed step in restoring stability, saying it was the first time that Turkey had changed its political system through \u201ccivil politics.\u201dClearly, roughly half of Turkish voters agreed, happily voting for a man commonly depicted as an autocrat.Ms. Arslan helps explain why. In her eyes, Mr. Erdogan has expanded certain democratic freedoms in Turkey \u2014 in particular, freedom of religion. Ten years ago, Ms. Arslan was unable to attend a Turkish university because women like her who wore head scarves were barred from studying there, a result of rules established by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s predecessors, who were seen as enforcing a repressive form of secularism.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to that era,\u201d Ms. Arslan said as she explained why she voted in support of Mr. Erdogan on Sunday.Until Turkey\u2019s economy began to falter recently, Mr. Erdogan had also brought significant material gain to much of the country. Whether by design or luck, during the early years of his tenure he beefed up the country\u2019s infrastructure, building roads and bridges and improving hospitals \u2014 which added to his popularity.\u201cPeople\u2019s purchasing power has increased. Health care was really bad, but now it has gotten a lot better,\u201d said Seckin Ozdemir, a 45-year-old real estate agent who voted in support of the president on Sunday. \u201cInflation was at 70 to 80 percent before him. It\u2019s as low as 9 percent nowadays,\u201d Mr. Ozdemir added, citing figures from the start of the year.For Mr. Ozdemir, the current crises in the Turkish economy validate rather than undermine the decision to grant more power to Mr. Erdogan. In Mr. Ozdemir\u2019s view, the president would have been able to turn the economy around by now but had been restricted by the actions of the political opposition.But inside Turkey, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s tactics play well with a certain nationalist demographic, people who buy into the narrative of a strong president standing up for an embattled Turkey against external aggressors.\u201cWe are voting \u2018yes\u2019 because the European Union is saying \u2018no,\u2019 \u201d said Yusuf Parlayan, 60, a retired factory worker, at a rally last month in the northern city of Kastamonu.In Sirnak, for example, 71.7 percent of voters opposed Mr. Erdogan, but that was down from 83.7 percent in the November 2015 general election. In Sirnak, 10,000 fewer voters participated in the referendum than in the previous election, according to official results, but the difference was too small to explain the drop in opposition to Mr. Erdogan.Some Kurds who sided with Mr. Erdogan on Sunday said they did so precisely because they hoped he might bring the stability needed to sideline the insurgents. \u201cPeople showed a red card\u201d to the fighters, said Alaattin Parlak, a 43-year-old Diyarbakir businessman, referring to the penalty of expulsion in a soccer match. \u201cThey want stability, peace and employment.\u201dBut other Kurds rejected this interpretation, and European election observers said the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Kurds in the southeast had left many without a fixed address and therefore without the right to vote.Ahmet Turk, an opposition politician jailed for parts of last year, said the electoral shifts were only small. Moreover, he told the Dogan News Agency, the shifts were the result of \u201cintense pressure\u201d by the government, which has jailed and fired hundreds of Kurdish politicians in recent months.In this respect, Kurds showed \u201ca red card\u201d to Mr. Erdogan, rather than to the opposition, Mr. Turk said.Christopher Schuetze contributed reporting from The Hague, Netherlands.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marine Le Pen Draws Cheers in Macron\u2019s Hometown, and He Gets Boos", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byWorkers at the plant, run by Whirlpool in Mr. Macron\u2019s hometown, Amiens, have been striking to prevent the factory from closing. Far from being welcomed as a favored son, Mr. Macron was jeered and booed by a hostile crowd as tires burned, while Ms. Le Pen paid a surprise visit and was greeted with hugs and selfies as activists with her National Front party distributed croissants.Their separate visits, covered live on French television, showed how Ms. Le Pen\u2019s anti-globalization message resonates in regions struggling with factory closings and the loss of jobs, as well as the hostility that many workers feel for Mr. Macron, a centrist former investment banker who wants to loosen labor rules.The contrasting styles, policy approaches and loyalties of the candidates, who face each other in a runoff election on May 7, were on full display in Amiens, sometimes painfully so.Mr. Macron met first with a few union representatives from the factory at the local chamber of commerce; Ms. Le Pen beat him to the plant itself.Mr. Macron said that he could not stop companies from firing workers, but that he would fight to find a buyer for the plant or to retrain workers. Ms. Le Pen promised to save the plant and the nearly 300 jobs there that are supposed to be shifted to Poland next year, and said she would discourage companies from moving jobs abroad with a 35 percent tax on any products imported from plants that are outsourced from France.\u201cThe president of the Republic isn\u2019t here to fix every individual case,\u201d Mr. Attali said.Of course, it was no detail to the people who work there, and campaign officials for Mr. Macron, who has sometimes been criticized as lacking empathy for working people, had to scramble to distance themselves from the comments.It was just one example of how Mr. Macron, 39, who has never held elected office and is running against a political veteran, was on the back foot all day.Ms. Le Pen, 48, praised the Whirlpool workers for \u201cresisting this wild globalization,\u201d and, taking a page out of the populist playbook of President Trump, she promised that the plant would not close if she were elected.\u201cWhen I heard that Emmanuel Macron was coming here and that he didn\u2019t plan to meet the workers, that he didn\u2019t plan to come to the picket line, but that he was going to shelter in some room at the chamber of commerce to meet two or three handpicked people, I considered that it was such a sign of contempt for what the Whirlpool workers are going through that I decided to leave my strategic council and come see you,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said at the site.Mr. Macron, speaking at a news conference after meeting with the union representatives, shot back that Ms. Le Pen would fix \u201cnothing\u201d if elected, arguing that her protectionist proposals would destroy more jobs and that she was \u201cmaking a political use\u201d of the Whirlpool workers. Still, he announced quickly that he would visit the plant, too.He arrived at the site surrounded by a giant, jostling scrum of journalists with cameras and microphones as he tried to talk with the crowd of workers around him.Black smoke from burned tires lingered in the air, and some of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s supporters cried out, \u201cMarine for president!\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come before?\u201d one worker shouted at Mr. Macron. \u201cYou are in favor of globalization,\u201d another said, critically.\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to promise the moon,\u201d Mr. Macron replied. \u201cWhen Marine Le Pen comes here to tell you that we have to leave globalization, she is lying to you.\u201dBut his emphasis on going along with globalization, not trying to stop it, was clearly a hard sell.But his campaign for the runoff has gotten off to a shaky start, with critics saying he celebrated too early and returned to the campaign trail too late.One such call came on Wednesday from former President Nicolas Sarkozy, who ran unsuccessfully in right-wing presidential primary contests last year.\u201cIt is a choice of responsibility, which should in no case be taken as support for his project,\u201d said Mr. Sarkozy, who noted that France would still have the opportunity to vote for his party, the center-right Republicans, in upcoming legislative elections.Instead, his France Unbowed movement is organizing an online \u201cconsultation\u201d asking supporters whether they plan to vote for Mr. Macron, abstain or vote with a blank ballot.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s first-round voters skew younger and more working-class than Mr. Macron\u2019s. Some worry that left-wing voters who supported Mr. M\u00e9lenchon will hurt Mr. Macron\u2019s prospects of winning the runoff by abstaining in large numbers.That is especially true in regions like the one around Amiens, where Ms. Le Pen came in first during voting on Sunday.At a news conference in Paris on Wednesday, Alexis Corbi\u00e8re, a spokesman for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, said \u201cnot one vote must go to the National Front.\u201d But he rejected criticism that Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s attitude was helping Ms. Le Pen.\u201cIt isn\u2019t with absurd admonitions that you are going to suddenly lead people to rally behind Mr. Macron,\u201d Mr. Corbi\u00e8re said. \u201cYou have to discuss things, and convince that the National Front vote is not an option.\u201dPam\u00e9la Rougerie contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economy Grows 6.9%, but Warning Signs Persist", "Date": "2017-04-16", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s economic data is usually very predictable. But occasionally there are surprises, though so small that by other countries\u2019 standards they would barely be noticed.The country\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second-largest behind that of the United States, grew 6.9 percent in the first quarter, led by strong expansion at factories, Chinese officials said Monday. The pace was a slight acceleration in the economic tempo here after five consecutive quarters in which China reported growth of either 6.7 percent or 6.8 percent, a remarkable period of stability in the official data.Most economists had predicted that China would again report 6.8 percent growth for the first quarter. The slightly higher figure announced on Monday reflected the construction industry\u2019s heavy use of steel, which had been expected to slow, while investment in electronics factories rose as overseas demand strengthened.Government data nonetheless holds some warning signs. While a torrent of mortgages issued by the state-controlled banking sector has helped housing sales, the number of housing starts has been rising even faster this spring.But for now, Chinese officials are savoring a strong quarter and are quick to attribute it to measures taken last year to close inefficient coal mines and factories and to improve overall productivity.\u201cSince last year with supply-side reforms, the demand-and-supply relationship is obviously improving and enterprises have more confidence,\u201d Mao Shengyong, the spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said at a news conference in Beijing.There are plenty of reasons not to take the overall stability in economic growth, or even slight acceleration, at face value. Economists instead will parse more detailed data on trade, construction and retail spending to divine whether China \u2014 the largest single contributor to global growth in recent years \u2014 will continue to keep the world economy in gear.Yet based on those other data points, the Chinese economy appears to be steaming along, even as Beijing begins trying to rein in rampant lending. Industrial production increased 7.6 percent in March, the best performance since the end of 2014. Investment and retail sales were also unexpectedly strong.The trick will be to continue that growth while also trying to curb China\u2019s dependence on loans by big state-owned banks to large state-owned enterprises, which has allowed these enterprises to go on spending and investing even in money-losing ventures. The government has been reluctant to risk protests by curtailing lending this year, particularly with a big conclave of the Communist Party to be held in late autumn.Official data shows that China\u2019s economy has grown 6.7 percent to 7.2 percent for the last 11 quarters, a stunningly long period of stability by international standards. By comparison, figures for growth in the United States can move by one or two full percentage points from quarter to quarter.Now, China is not exactly like the rest of the world. The government directly controls its big banks, huge state-owned companies and other tools it can use to hit its growth targets. The government spends heavily on new roads and rail lines, and a surge in government spending in March helped push the economy along. But the government has much less control over retail spending and private investment, which should make the data more volatile.Despite the dubious predictability, other figures suggest that China\u2019s economy is expanding at a vigorous pace.Consumer electronics have led China\u2019s export boom in recent years and have also been at the center of rising domestic demand. Production continues to surge for devices like smartphones and energy-efficient light-emitting diodes, an alternative to compact fluorescent lights or traditional incandescent bulbs.Liu Rulong, 25, a salesman for Guangzhou Juhong Optoelectronics, a manufacturer of light-emitting diodes based in southeastern China, said that his sales were up 20 percent. He said he was expecting monthly bonuses this spring of $1,160 to $1,450 and that some colleagues earned even more.\u201cI\u2019m still in the middle \u2014 some salesmen did far better than me,\u201d Mr. Liu said.Real estate is a big factor in China\u2019s growth. Last year, China\u2019s central bank urged commercial banks to step up mortgage lending to support the housing market, which had been weakening in some cities. The additional mortgages have produced frenzied buying over the past year.March showed a big bulge of extra steel production last year as construction started to take off. So March this year was expected to indicate a slowdown. But steel output last month jumped 7.1 percent from last year\u2019s high base.All this comes amid signs that China is trying to curb the lending that has driven so much of its growth in recent years. That lending kept the economy going but resulted in heavy debt that economists worry could hinder the country\u2019s growth for years to come. So far, the government\u2019s modest pressure on banks to limit lending, notably through slight increases in short-term interest rates, seems to have had only a limited impact on overall bank lending, however, and little effect on mortgage lending.Chinese households put as much as nine-tenths of their savings into real estate, more than households in many other countries. That has continued to produce strong demand for new apartments, which in turn has led to a brisk pace of construction.Credit data released on Friday showed that bank loans to households, a category in which mortgage lending plays a leading role, leapt 24.6 percent in March compared to the same month a year ago, even as other categories of lending began slowing somewhat.But the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday that overall investment in fixed assets, including factories as well as office towers and apartment buildings, climbed 8.8 percent for the first quarter, little changed from a pace of 8.9 percent for the first two months of the year despite the central bank\u2019s modest moves to limit credit. Private investment quickened in March, offsetting a slight slowing in what remains heavy investment by the government, particularly in rail lines and other infrastructure.Chinese blue-collar wages have surged as much as eightfold in the past dozen years. That has considerably eroded the country\u2019s once-daunting advantage in labor costs compared with the West, but it has also produced a broad-based surge in prosperity that has fostered a rise in consumer spending.The government has wanted for many years to shift the economy away from its dependence on investment and toward a greater reliance on consumption, but that process has been slow. The National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday that retail sales were up 10.9 percent in March from a year earlier, considerably stronger than economists\u2019 expectations of a pace below 10 percent.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Mexico, an Epidemic of Fuel Thefts Becomes a Crisis", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported bySAN SALVADOR HUIXCOLOTLA, Mexico \u2014 Some of the day\u2019s first customers pull into the produce market at dawn, but not with fruit and vegetables on their minds. They\u2019re looking for cheap, stolen gasoline.On the edge of the market, dozens of vendors have set up shop, with stacks of five-gallon containers full of stolen fuel and rubber hoses to siphon it.\u201cHow much, cousin?\u201d the vendors holler as they swarm the hundreds of motorists who drive through every day. The price is less than half what customers would pay at nearby gas stations.The brisk, open gas trade is one of the more obvious manifestations of Mexico\u2019s national fuel-theft epidemic. Thieves are now siphoning gasoline and diesel fuel at record-high rates from the system \u2014 often by drilling taps into pipelines under cover of darkness \u2014 and are selling it on the black market around Mexico and perhaps even in the United States and Central America.And the government seems unable to stop it.\u201cThe problem comes down to the fact that the rule of law is weak in Mexico,\u201d said Dwight Dyer, an analyst of the Mexican energy sector. \u201cThis is a part of the market where the rule of law really needs to work for the private sector to say, \u2018I really want to invest.\u2019\u201dThe relentless rise in thefts has been driven by the increasing involvement and sophistication of some of the nation\u2019s largest, best organized and most ruthless criminal organizations, which have used bribery and violence to co-opt officials at all levels of government, including workers at Pemex, the state-owned energy company.The criminal groups have also cultivated widespread support among local residents, some of whom have found lucrative employment with the gangs and many of whom are happy to pay the far lower prices for black-market fuel. In some places \u2014 particularly here in Puebla State, which has emerged as the epicenter of the crisis \u2014 the thieves are viewed as Robin Hood-style heroes who have changed the fortunes of once-impoverished towns overnight as proceeds from the trade flow into local economies.More than 1.47 million gallons of fuel a day are stolen from throughout the system, from the refineries to the gas pump, federal officials said. From time to time, even tanker trucks are hijacked. While the amount taken is equivalent to 1 to 2 percent of the total volume transported every day, it has an outsize impact on the ability of the Mexican government to attract private investors.\u201cIt\u2019s really a barrier for business,\u201d said Carlos Murrieta Cummings, general director of industrial transformation for Pemex. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound optimistic because the problem is very hard. I don\u2019t want to minimize the problem.\u201d\u201cWe need to take care of this from the production fields, at the refineries, at the distribution center, terminals, pipelines \u2014 everything,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have this problem in many different places, not just in one part.\u201dWith international gas prices soaring, fuel theft became particularly lucrative, officials said, and often much easier than trafficking drugs.Despite President Calder\u00f3n\u2019s vows to crush the fuel rings, they continued to grow.\u201cThe truth is that Pemex didn\u2019t give much importance to it,\u201d said Eduardo Guerrero, a security consultant in Mexico City. \u201cIt was regarded as marginal losses.\u201dIn 2009, the authorities discovered 462 illegal taps on the nation\u2019s pipelines and estimated that fewer than 126,000 gallons a day were being lost. Last year they discovered 6,873 taps \u2014 a nearly 15-fold increase.Gangs most often target the 5,600 miles of pipeline that snake throughout Mexico and often pass through sparsely inhabited rural regions, carrying gasoline from refineries to distribution points.The pipelines are mostly buried but at a shallow depth, and they are easily uncovered with a shovel. The thieves perforate the pipelines with high-powered drills and install taps from which they draw the fuel. They have even dug tunnels to the pipelines and diverted fuel through rubber hoses to stolen tanker trucks far away.The plunder is then sold in markets like the one in San Salvador Huixcolotla, on roadsides, door-to-door or to shady gas station owners who then resell it.Some stolen gas has also found its way into the United States and south into Central America, officials and analysts said.In Puebla, the authorities discovered more than 1,500 illegal taps on pipelines last year, nearly double the number found in 2015 and nearly a quarter of the national total, Pemex officials said.The crime is concentrated in this region of the state, a cluster of rural municipalities known as the Tri\u00e1ngulo Rojo, or Red Triangle, through which a major pipeline carries gasoline and diesel fuel to Mexico City from a refinery and a port in the adjoining state of Veracruz.The surge in criminal employment and its proceeds has brought a sharp rise in income for many households in this impoverished region. Wages from farming, historically the main occupation here, cannot compete. Where a farmhand might earn $7 to $11 a day, residents said, a lookout for the fuel thieves can bring in upward of $54 a day.On special occasions like Mother\u2019s Day, the gangs will drive into villages in trucks loaded with gifts for townspeople, including televisions, blenders and other home appliances. The gangs have also started to pay for medical care and other community services.A top municipal police official in the Red Triangle, requesting anonymity out of fear that he would be killed for speaking publicly about the issue, said that local loyalty to the thieves was so deep that his officers were often impeded from entering certain neighborhoods even when responding to problems that had nothing to do with fuel theft.The crime has become such a central part of life in this region of Puebla that it has been celebrated in song, much as drug traffickers and their exploits have been lionized in narcocorridos.In a recent interview, Ms. Alc\u00e1ntara sought to distance herself from gas thievery. Her music, she said, was simply trying to capture the cultural moment. \u201cIt\u2019s where we live,\u201d she said.But the criminal groups\u2019 main weapon is corruption. From Pemex workers tipping off criminals about the most opportune time to drill, to local police officers paid to look the other way, the gas thieves have built their operations with widespread bribery backed by violence.The criminals\u2019 offer is clear-cut, said a former municipal police official in the Red Triangle who requested anonymity: You either collaborate and take money, or you resist and take a bullet.Last month, the mayor of the town of Atzitzintla was detained along with 86 other people in connection with the kidnapping and murder of three government investigators by a criminal group involved in gas theft. The regional press in Puebla has reported that several other mayors have been under investigation for possible links to gas theft.The mayors of six municipalities where the stolen gas rings have won a lot of public support did not respond to repeated requests for interviews.In an acknowledgment that the local police were too compromised and overwhelmed to combat fuel theft effectively, the federal government deployed about 500 security personnel to the Red Triangle in recent weeks. Scores of arrests have followed, but the theft has not abated.Mr. Guerrero, the security consultant, predicted that further pressure in the Red Triangle might eventually set off a social uprising, including strikes and blockades.\u201cWith every passing day, more families, more people depend on this market,\u201d he said. \u201cForget about it. It\u2019s going to be a nightmare when the government tries to control the market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Making of a Legacy: First Steps in the Trump Era", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported by100 DaysWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has presided over an extraordinary first 100 days in office marked by the aggressive use of executive power and a freewheeling leadership style, shattering the norms of the presidency and the traditions of Washington.The regulatory reversals may have been Mr. Trump\u2019s most concrete economic steps so far. He has offered few details on the tax package, which is at least months away from being drafted into legislative form. The pipelines will take years to build. The financial regulations targeted by executive orders will remain in place during a lengthy review process.Mr. Trump has taken credit for job announcements by companies, including a plan by Carrier to retain 1,110 jobs in Indiana, but critics say that they were in the works long before he took office, and that the economic trends that send jobs abroad remain in place. Mr. Trump has done nothing to press the $1 trillion infrastructure spending package he promised during the campaign. Still, the stock markets have reacted positively to his push to cut regulations and taxes.Mr. Trump has made little progress on his promise to quickly repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a system Republicans say would provide greater access to care and more affordable coverage. Divisions among the party scuttled one bill, and a vote on a revised version has been put off. Mr. Trump has failed to offer his own plan.The president has made few changes to the Affordable Care Act, despite the executive order. He has yet to follow through on a threat to withhold subsidies paid to insurance companies so they can reduce costs for low-income consumers \u2014 a bargaining tactic to force Democrats to work with him on an overhaul.Mr. Trump has taken a number of actions, mostly in the form of executive orders, aimed at reversing his predecessor\u2019s environmental legacy and restoring jobs in coal mining and oil drilling. But efforts to dismantle most of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change and clean water rules could take several years. And economists note that the decline in coal jobs and offshore oil drilling has been driven more by market forces than regulations.The president\u2019s proposal to slash the E.P.A.\u2019s budget by 31 percent, more than any other agency, has been met with resistance even by some Republicans in Congress.Mr. Trump has yet to accomplish any of the most ambitious goals he laid out on illegal immigration, including beginning construction of a border wall paid for by Mexico and defunding \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d and he has not overhauled the refugee admission process. A revised travel ban and the sanctuary city order are tied up in the courts.But amid the uptick in immigration arrests, especially of people who have not committed serious crimes, the number of undocumented immigrants caught along the Southwest border has fallen precipitously since the president took office.The White House has argued that Mr. Trump has strengthened the standing of the United States in the world, renewing relationships that Mr. Obama had allowed to languish and reasserting American power. He has questioned long-held precepts of foreign policy, including the One China policy, a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the usefulness of NATO, and the importance of multilateral trade agreements.But Mr. Trump has not yet made big changes in most of those areas. He reversed himself on NATO and dropped his re-evaluation of the One China policy, under which the United States recognizes only the government in Beijing, not the one in Taipei. A new strategy on the Middle East has yet to emerge. Mr. Trump has taken a more personal approach to diplomacy with leaders like Shinzo Abe of Japan and Xi Jinping of China, but it is not yet clear whether the charm offensive will yield strong relationships or diplomatic gains.Mr. Trump in some ways has made good on his promise to be tougher than his predecessor, firing missiles into Syria when Mr. Obama had not, and empowering the military to act quickly abroad. But his budget request for a $54 billion increase in military spending is likely to go nowhere. And while he has used bombastic language toward Iran and North Korea, he has done almost nothing to shift America\u2019s military posture toward those nations.Mr. Trump prioritized the swift selection and confirmation of Justice Gorsuch, in line with his campaign promise to name a conservative who opposed abortion rights. Though he once called himself \u201cpro-choice,\u201d Mr. Trump has moved aggressively to clamp down on access to abortions. Still, he has not followed through on threats to roll back workplace protections for gay men and lesbians.Mr. Trump\u2019s chaotic transition left him extraordinarily far behind in the process of staffing his administration. Of 556 crucial positions that require Senate confirmation, Mr. Trump has yet to fill 465, according to the Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service. The result has been a lack of direction at crucial agencies and fewer officials to help execute Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda.Mr. Trump has shattered the protocols and customs of the presidency, with his unvarnished commentary on Twitter, his seat-of-the-pants approach to policy moves and statements, and his penchant for mixing the official with the commercial. He has called the news media the \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201dBut Mr. Trump has also made himself much more accessible than his predecessors, routinely popping his head into the press cabin on Air Force One for brief on-the-record chats and granting interviews with a wide range of reporters. He has made the White House, once a bastion of stiff decorum, into a more freewheeling place, where surprises are common and abrupt changes are the norm.Coral Davenport and Ron Nixon contributed reporting.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of crucial positions that require Senate confirmation and that Mr. Trump has yet to fill.

{"Headline": "Trump Isn\u2019t Wrong on China Currency Manipulation, Just Late", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneHas the United States mismanaged the ascent of China?By April 15, the Treasury Department is required to present to Congress a report on the exchange rate policies of the country\u2019s major trading partners, intended to identify manipulators that cheapen their currency to make their exports more attractive and gain market share in the United States, a designation that could eventually lead to retaliation.It would be hard, these days, to find an economist who feels China fits the bill. Under a trade law passed in 2015, a country must meet three criteria: It would have to have a \u201cmaterial\u201d trade surplus with the rest of the world, have a \u201csignificant\u201d surplus with the United States, and intervene persistently in foreign exchange markets to push its currency in one direction.While China\u2019s surplus with the United States is pretty big \u2014 almost $350 billion \u2014 its global surplus is modest, at 2.4 percent of its gross domestic product last year. Most significant, it has been pushing its currency up, not down. Since the middle of 2014 it has sold over $1 trillion from its reserves to prop up the renminbi, under pressure from capital flight by Chinese companies and savers.Even President Trump \u2014 who as a candidate promised to label China a currency manipulator on Day 1 and put a 45 percent tariff on imports of Chinese goods \u2014 seems to be backing away from broad, immediate retaliation.And yet the temptation remains. \u201cWhen you talk about currency manipulation, when you talk about devaluations,\u201d the Chinese \u201care world champions,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Financial Times, ahead of the state visit of the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, to the United States last week.For all Mr. Trump\u2019s random impulsiveness and bluster \u2014 and despite his lack of a coherent strategy to engage with what is likely soon to become the world\u2019s biggest economy \u2014 he is not entirely alone with his views.Many learned economists and policy experts ruefully acknowledge that the president\u2019s intuition is broadly right: While labeling China a currency manipulator now would look ridiculous, the United States should have done it a long time ago.\u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, China should have been named,\u201d said Brad Setser, an expert on international economics and finance who worked in the Obama administration and is now at the Council on Foreign Relations.There were reasonable arguments against putting China on the spot and starting a process that could eventually lead to American retaliation.Yet by not pushing back against China\u2019s currency manipulation, and allowing China to deploy an arsenal of trade tactics of dubious legality to increase exports to the United States, successive administrations \u2014 Republican and Democratic \u2014 arguably contributed to the economic dislocations that pummeled so many American workers over more than a decade. Those dislocations helped propel Mr. Trump to power.From 2000 to 2014 China definitely suppressed the rise of the renminbi to maintain a competitive advantage for its exports, buying dollars hand over fist and adding $4 trillion to its foreign reserves over the period. Until 2005, the Chinese government kept the renminbi pegged to the dollar, following it down as the greenback slid against other major currencies starting in 2003.American multinationals were flocking into China, taking advantage of its entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001, which guaranteed access to the American and other world markets for its exports. By 2007, China\u2019s broad trade surplus hit 10 percent of its gross domestic product \u2014 an unheard-of imbalance for an economy this large. And its surplus with the United States amounted to a full third of the American deficit with the world.Though the requirement that the Treasury identify currency manipulators \u201cgaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade\u201d dates back to the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, China was never called out.There were good reasons. Or at least they seemed so at the time. For one, China hands in the administration of George W. Bush argued that putting China on the spot would make negotiations more difficult, because even Chinese leaders who understood the need to allow their currency to rise could not be seen to bow to American pressure.Labeling China a manipulator could have severely hindered progress in other areas of a complex bilateral economic relationship. And the United States had bigger fish to fry.\u201cThere were other dimensions of China\u2019s economic policies that were seen as more important to U.S. economic and business interests,\u201d Eswar Prasad, who headed the China desk at the International Monetary Fund and is now a professor at Cornell, told me. These included \u201cgreater market access, better intellectual property rights protection, easier access to investment opportunities, etc.\u201dAt the end of the day, economists argued at the time, Chinese exchange rate policies didn\u2019t cost the United States much. After all, in 2007 the United States was operating at full employment. The trade deficit was because of Americans\u2019 dismal savings rate and supercharged consumption, not a cheap renminbi. After all, if Americans wanted to consume more than they created, they had to get it somewhere.And the United States had a stake in China\u2019s rise. A crucial strategic goal of American foreign policy since Mao\u2019s death had been how to peacefully incorporate China into the existing order of free-market economies, bound by international law into the fabric of the postwar multilateral institutions.And the strategy even worked \u2014 a little bit. China did allow its currency to rise a little from 2005 to 2008. And when the financial crisis hit, it took the foot off the export pedal and deployed a giant fiscal stimulus, which bolstered internal demand.In a set of influential papers that have come to inform the thinking about the United States\u2019 relations with China, David Autor, Daron Acemoglu and Brendan Price from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Gordon Hanson from the University of California, San Diego; and David Dorn from the University of Zurich concluded that lots of American workers, in many communities, suffered a blow from which they never recovered.Economic theory posited that a developed country like the United States would adjust to import competition by moving workers into more advanced industries that competed successfully in global markets. In the real world of American workers exposed to the rush of imports after China erupted onto world markets, the adjustment didn\u2019t happen.If mediocre job prospects and low wages didn\u2019t stop American families from consuming, it was because the American financial system was flush with Chinese cash and willing to lend, financing their homes and refinancing them to buy the furniture. But that equilibrium didn\u2019t end well either, did it?What it left was a lot of betrayed anger floating around among many Americans on the wrong end of these dynamics. \u201cBy not following the law, the administration sent a political signal that the U.S. wouldn\u2019t stand up to Chinese cheating,\u201d said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cAs we can see now, that hurt in terms of maintaining political support for open trade.\u201dIf there was a winner from this dynamic, it was Mr. Trump.Will Mr. Trump really go after China? In addition to an expected executive order to retaliate against the dumping of Chinese steel, he has promised more. He could tinker with the definitions of \u201cmaterial\u201d and \u201csignificant\u201d trade surpluses to justify a manipulation charge.And yet a charge of manipulation would add irony upon irony. \u201cIt would be incredibly ironic not to have named China a manipulator when it was manipulating, and name it when it is not,\u201d Mr. Setser told me.

These Workers Weren\u2019t as Lucky.", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Supported byHUNTINGTON, Ind. \u2014 These are the Indiana workers whose jobs President Trump didn\u2019t save.After assembling circuit boards for Carrier furnaces at a factory here for 21 years, Jim Sholle, 56, walked out of the plant for the final time last month. But he still finds himself waking up every morning at 4:30, ready to work the 6 a.m.-to-2 p.m. shift.\u201cI\u2019m a routine guy, and I\u2019m not boohooing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I feel used up.\u201dPat Saylors, 57, is still employed, but her days here are numbered, as they are for more than 700 other blue-collar workers. Production is set to end by late December at the plant, this town\u2019s largest private employer, and each month several dozen of them are being let go.\u201cI loved my job,\u201d said Ms. Saylors, who earns $17.31 an hour as a materials specialist, readying parts for the workers on the assembly line. She joined the company 40 years ago, when the plant was in tiny Converse, Ind., and then followed her job to Huntington when the factory here opened in 1990.Ms. Saylors is typical of the factory\u2019s work force, which is mostly female, with an average age around 50. She joined a few months after graduating from high school, as did her daughter Amanda, who is now 33.\u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d she said.During Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the fate of more than 2,000 Carrier jobs that the company wanted to move to Mexico from Indiana, including those in Huntington, were Exhibit A in his attacks on the free-trade policies of his predecessors, both Democratic and Republican.It was not to be. Thanks to public pressure from Mr. Trump and a generous package of tax breaks negotiated by Gov. Mike Pence, now the vice president, Carrier did agree to keep making some of its furnaces in Indianapolis, preserving roughly 800 of 1,400 jobs there.But the plant in Huntington operated by United Technologies Electronic Controls, or UTEC, was not part of that deal \u2014 nor would it be helped by the \u201cbuy American\u201d mandate for federal infrastructure projects that Mr. Trump promised in Wisconsin last week. And by early next year, the components used for furnaces still assembled in Indianapolis will come instead from Monterrey, Mexico, where it takes a day to earn what workers here make in about an hour.The economy in Huntington, a town of 17,000 in rural northeast Indiana, is quite different from what workers in Indianapolis face, however, as is the culture. Despite some notable closings, many factories remain, with 21 percent of local workers employed in manufacturing, a higher proportion than in more than 90 percent of the other counties in the country.For the most part, the workers do not fault Mr. Trump for failing to preserve their jobs, even as he took credit for keeping the Indianapolis plant open.\u201cI support him 100 percent,\u201d said Tami Barnett, a 27-year veteran who left at the end of March. \u201cI was very pleased he saved the jobs in Indianapolis. Do I wish he could have saved mine? Absolutely. But he did his best.\u201dSusan Cropper, 55, who works in the plant with her sister, Sandy VanDiver, 58, said she did not regret voting for Mr. Trump in November, either.\u201cI\u2019m glad he stepped in, but it\u2019s a letdown,\u201d she said, adding that most of her fury was reserved for Carrier and its executives.Asked about the failure to keep the Huntington plant open, a White House spokesman said last week that Mr. Trump was \u201cincredibly proud to work with United Technologies to save nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana and will continue to work with major companies to ensure he is doing all he can to increase American manufacturing, job creation and economic growth.\u201dHuntington\u2019s mayor, Brooks Fetters, admits when pressed to being frustrated that he never heard back from Mr. Pence\u2019s office after he called late last year to find out why Huntington was not helped.\u201cRight or wrong, that\u2019s where we are,\u201d said Mr. Fetters, a moderate Republican. \u201cWe\u2019re not in panic mode.\u201dAnd in any case, he said, \u201cGerman stoicism runs deep in northern Indiana, and you take your lumps.\u201dHuntington has managed to adapt by luring new metalworking and automotive suppliers in recent years, according to Mark Wickersham, director of economic development for Huntington County.\u201cWe are not a dying town,\u201d he said, citing the $1.4 million expansion last fall of a learning center opposite the high school, where teenagers as well as adults can earn certificates in fields like advanced manufacturing and health care.Although retraining offers only modest hope for workers in their mid- to late 50s who possess only a high school diploma, Mr. Fetters insists the UTEC workers do not have to face a dismal economic future if they can learn new skills.A look at the companies that changed plans, announced new ones or stood their ground after catching the president\u2019s attention.\u201cAt 4 percent unemployment, if you\u2019re not working, there\u2019s a reason and it\u2019s not a good one,\u201d Mr. Fetters said. \u201cAs mayor, I don\u2019t have jobs for people who can just use a rake and a shovel. I do have jobs for equipment operators.\u201dThe mayor is right \u2014 up to a point. It\u2019s true that local auto parts suppliers, machine tool makers and other industrial companies are hiring. But only a few positions are available at any time.Not far from the soon-to-be-shuttered UTEC plant, with its parking lot full of late-model S.U.V.s and pickups, Ecolab is hiring. The hourly wage is equal to what UTEC paid, but only four jobs are open at the plant, which makes soaps and sanitizers, with two of them offered to United Technologies employees.Beyond that, Ecolab\u2019s 100-strong work force is not expected to rise significantly, according to Tracey Hartman, the company\u2019s human resources manager in Huntington.Like other longtime workers, Mr. Sholle received a severance package, including a $17,700 payment in his case. But he worries that he is not healthy enough to start over at another factory, and after he paid out $10,000 to cover taxes and medical expenses, the severance does not buy him that much time. His health insurance runs only through September.More than a means to a paycheck, working in the UTEC factory was a way of life, with female workers especially developing the kind of deep bonds more common in small towns than big cities.\u201cWe weren\u2019t blood family, but we were family,\u201d said Ms. Barnett, who worked in aftermarket sales and service. When she had a heart attack and needed quadruple bypass surgery in 2007, colleagues held bake sales and donated close to $2,500 to help her offset the loss of income during her 14-week recovery.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money to me, and I was overwhelmed by the caring and compassion,\u201d Ms. Barnett said.The decision last year to close the plant came as a shock, she added. \u201cWe made the company billions in profits. It\u2019s a slap in the face.\u201dWorkers like Ms. Barnett and Ms. Saylors might have been surprised, but outsourcing factory jobs was hardly a secret on Wall Street.To improve earnings amid slow growth in recent years, a key strategy of United Technologies executives has been to shrink the company\u2019s manufacturing footprint and move production to countries where labor is cheap.At a meeting with analysts last month to discuss the outlook for 2017, the head of the division that includes Carrier, Robert J. McDonough, boasted that profit margins had doubled over the last five years.\u201cPart of it has been moving factories to lower-cost locations, there is no question about that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think everybody knows that\u2019s been part of the formula for us.\u201dWhy was Mr. Trump more successful in Indianapolis than in Huntington? \u201cWe were the redheaded, bucktoothed stepchild,\u201d Mr. Sholle said bitterly. \u201cWe never even got mentioned in the coverage.\u201dThere is some truth to the latter part of Mr. Sholle\u2019s assessment. More than two hours north of Indianapolis and some distance from the nearest Interstate, Huntington, like other rural corners of the country, rarely gets much attention from outsiders.At the same time, true to the spirit of its understated residents, Huntington\u2019s political and union leaders shied away from the spotlight that their counterparts in Indianapolis sought out. Some feared that criticizing United Technologies publicly would undercut negotiations to save jobs.About 100 jobs in sales, marketing and engineering will remain in Huntington after manufacturing ceases, and the company has been adding to its white-collar staff here. Unfortunately, most of the workers on the assembly lines would never be considered for these jobs because they lack college degrees and other credentials, like engineering experience.While it is too late for the likes of Jim Sholle and Pat Saylors, even United Technologies\u2019 chief executive, Greg Hayes, suggested recently that the years of cost-cutting at Carrier, the furnace and air-conditioner maker, had gone too far, putting short-term profits ahead of long-term growth.The need to stay competitive was the reason the company gave for moving the jobs from Indiana to Mexico, but Carrier\u2019s market share actually eroded slightly last year. So Carrier is making a course correction.\u201cWe need to make investments, as I said before, in the sales force,\u201d Mr. Hayes told analysts on Wall Street in December. \u201cWe need to get more feet on the street.\u201d\u201cBob is focused on it,\u201d Mr. Hayes added, referring to Mr. McDonough\u2019s new marching orders to invest, in what sounded like a mix of goal and threat. \u201cBob\u2019s senior leadership team is focused on it, and we\u2019ve got to get everybody in the organization focused on it equally, so more work to do there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "France in the End of Days", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byParis \u2014 For some time France has been a country that does not like itself. Somewhere on the road from its humiliation in World War II to its disappointment with European integration to its discomfort with globalization, France slid into moroseness. High-speed trains purred; France pouted. Grumbling became a way of life, the response to lost grandeur. Now France seems ready to vent this slow-ripening anger in an election that could see the extreme right return to power for the first time since the 1940s and Europe revert to a turbulence not seen since that epoch.If Marine Le Pen of the National Front wins, she says she will take France out of the euro, the shared European currency, and restore the franc. Exit from the European Union could follow. This would constitute an economic and political rupture so violent that even Donald Trump\u2019s victory and Britain\u2019s vote to leave the union would pale beside it. Europe, and not just its markets, would be upended. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has been meddling, would be happy.A Le Pen victory is far from assured, plausible if not probable. Returning to France late last month, to the glow of Paris and the gloom of the provinces, I was struck by how much Le Pen\u2019s party, whose racist ideology was once taboo, has joined the mainstream. The pattern that has prevailed throughout the Fifth Republic \u2014 alternation of center-left and center-right \u2014 seems dead. The French are tired of increasingly indistinguishable Socialist and Republican presidents. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a socialist with a single-digit approval rating, decided not to run for a second term. As elsewhere in the West, traditional parties bereft of compelling ideas are in crisis, buffeted by social-media-driven mobilizations.The first round of voting on April 23 is almost certain to send Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, the 39-year-old upstart leader of a new catchall centrist movement, into the runoff on May 7: the xenophobic nationalist versus the pro-Europe neophyte.Polls show them both with clear, if tightening, leads over the scandal-plagued Republican candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, and an extreme leftist, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, of the Unbowed France movement, whose support has surged in recent days. The left, still singing the Internationale and plotting class struggle, is in disarray. The inclination to blow up the system has found fertile ground. People have had it with experts. \u201c\u00c7a suffit!\u201d \u2014 \u201cEnough!\u201d \u2014 is a much-heard cry; and if disruption leads to deluge, so be it.Such end-of-days gloom is puzzling. Near 10 percent unemployment and near invisible growth cannot explain it. French infrastructure is a rebuke to American decay. French universal health care works. Savoir-vivre, the art of living, is not a French phrase for nothing. From the United States to China, the French hold on the world\u2019s imagination endures. It is a land of unique pleasures.\u201cThere is a certain French masochism,\u201d Pascal Bruckner, an author, told me. \u201cWe are a country that does not unleash its potential. We ruminate on the past. After 1989, we thought Europe would become French. But the models of Germany and Thatcher did much better. And so we lapse into mediocrity.\u201d Jacques Rupnik, a political scientist, put it this way: \u201cFrance suffers from cultural and civilizational insecurity. Many people feel somehow dispossessed.\u201dThis sense of dispossession, of loss, is what the National Front has exploited: loss of identity, jobs, national borders; loss of faith in a corrupt political system. \u201cOn est chez nous!\u201d \u2014 roughly \u201cWe are at home!\u201d \u2014 is the party\u2019s strange battle cry, chanted at every rally. But why such pathological need to reaffirm belonging, and who exactly are \u201cwe\u201d? Millions of immigrants from North and sub-Saharan Africa, many of them Muslims, do not appear to make the cut.\u201cThere is no right or left. This election is about patriotism versus globalization,\u201d Nicolas Bay, the secretary-general of the National Front, told me. \u201cThat is why we would end immigration. If it\u2019s Le Pen against the globalist Macron in the second round, it will be clear what the contest is about: Do we defend the nation, or is the nation finished?\u201dMacron is a former banker and economy minister under Hollande. Small, with glittering blue eyes, his pitch is that he\u2019s a tech-friendly pragmatist with the ability to revitalize France. Nobody quite knows what\u2019s in his gut. To fans he\u2019s a doer; to critics he\u2019s a hedger of bets. But nobody can deny his remarkable surge. En Marche! (Onward!), Macron\u2019s movement, was formed just a year ago. It has become the last best hope of those who would stop Le Pen.In an interview, Macron told me: \u201cLook, do you want to strengthen Europe, to have a strong reformed France, or do you just want to leave this world and return to the 19th century? What Le Pen proposes does not fly even for a second.\u201dI headed east to Metz, in the Lorraine region of France. Outside the station, opened in 1908 when the city was part of Germany, I found French, German and European Union flags fluttering to mark \u201cMetz Wunderbar\u201d (\u201cWonderful Metz\u201d) week, a celebration of French-German friendship. Such is Europe today: a shared house built over borders etched in blood. Lorraine closed its last iron ore mine a couple of decades ago. The region has struggled to replace it with service sector jobs. The National Front has prospered.At a restaurant I ran into Thierry Corona, a sommelier from nearby Koenigsmacker who had come to attend a Le Pen rally. A blue rose, Le Pen\u2019s campaign symbol, was pinned to his lapel. Corona was fired up. Le Pen would boost the wine industry by getting rid of a \u201cpolitically correct\u201d law curtailing advertising. She would end \u201cthe dictatorship of Brussels.\u201d She would rebuild \u201cFrance for the French.\u201dKoenigsmacker, Corona said, had been stripped of life. Small stores had been replaced by huge \u201chypermarkets\u201d on the outskirts of town. Human contact was almost forgotten. \u201cIn the shopping malls the cashiers are lined up like cattle for the slaughter,\u201d he said. Old people without cars were treated like human refuse. \u201cAnd immigrants arrive and they immediately get handouts!\u201dSuch provincial alienation is widespread. The most talked-about political book these days is Christophe Guilluy\u2019s \u201cThe France of the Periphery,\u201d a devastating portrait of what he calls the \u201ctotal cultural fracture\u201d between the networked milieu of Paris and a few other cities, and the declining dystopia outside them. If America has New York and Trump country, France has Paris and Koenigsmacker. The red state-blue state chasm, in various guises, is the core cultural condition of the West.\u201cThe political world is today a field of ruins,\u201d Guilluy writes. He cites a poll conducted in 2014 by the Ipsos research firm that found that 74 percent of French workers felt they were no longer \u201cat home\u201d; 74 percent saw globalization as a threat (while 68 percent of managers saw it as an opportunity).\u201cOn the fundamental subjects of globalization, free trade, immigration and multiculturalism, dialogue has become impossible,\u201d Guilluy concludes. This is the backdrop to workers\u2019 abandonment of the left and their embrace of the National Front, now the leading working-class party in France.Corona took me over to a nearby table where Florian Philippot, one of Le Pen\u2019s top advisers, was lunching. Philippot is an architect of the attempt to rebrand the party by shedding its Fascist, anti-Semitic antecedents (Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine\u2019s father, called the Holocaust \u201ca detail\u201d of history) and replacing it with France-first economic nationalism. Philippot is a slick operator. He did not have time to talk, but I saw him a half-hour later at the rally, warming up the crowd as images of Le Pen on a horse and with a truffle-hunting dog rolled across a giant screen, evoking the connection with \u201cLa France profonde\u201d (deep rural France) that is still de rigueur for any French political career.\u201cON EST CHEZ NOUS!\u201d the crowd roared. Philippot vowed that the \u201cradical Islamists strolling around our towns\u201d would soon be history. He called Macron an agent of high finance, a man \u201crecycling everything that has ruined France.\u201d Somebody in the crowd shouted \u201cRothschild!\u201d and then again \u201cRothschild!\u201d \u2014 a reference to the bank where Macron once worked. The attempt to rid the National Front of its anti-Semitism is clearly a work in progress.Indeed, Le Pen has reopened old wounds by insisting that France was not responsible for the \u201cVel\u2019 d\u2019Hiv\u201d \u2014 a reference to the stadium where 13,000 Jews were rounded up in 1942 before being dispatched to Auschwitz. She tried to portray the wartime Vichy government as distinct from France, an appalling evasion.Le Pen entered to thunderous applause in a black pantsuit. It\u2019s easy to imagine her an everywoman telling it like it is. Her hashtag is #aunomdupeuple (in the name of the people), and, like Trump, she vowed to \u201creturn power to the people.\u201d The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, she declared, would become \u201cthe house of the people,\u201d and referendums would be held on major issues like leaving the European Union.For a couple of hours Le Pen rambled. The influence of Islam was \u201cunbearable.\u201d France faced \u201ca choice of civilization\u201d \u2014 either uncontrolled immigration \u201cor recovering our home.\u201d National borders would not be closed; they would, however, exist. Patriotism meant resistance to \u201csavage globalization.\u201d In short, \u201cThe Republic must again become all-conquering.\u201dTh\u00e9rese and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Defaux were watching. \u201cLook, this is pretty simple,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe need to recover our values and defend them.\u201d Then his voice was drowned out. \u201cON EST CHEZ NOUS! ON EST CHEZ NOUS!\u201dEurope used to signify stability and peace. Now refugees and asylum seekers stream across the union\u2019s porous borders. To find jobs for immigrants, you need an open and flexible labor market. But the comprehensive French welfare state \u2014 financed by mandatory contributions for pensions, health and unemployment benefits that push up wage costs \u2014 tends toward inflexibility. Firing anyone can be tedious and expensive, so there\u2019s reluctance to hire. Youth unemployment stands around 25 percent. Over 31 percent of gross domestic product is spent on health, unemployment and other benefits, compared to 24.6 percent in Germany. France has in effect made a structural choice for unemployment. Everyone knows this. But because attachment to the model is fierce, honest discussion tends to be taboo.The first presidential debate last month was an exercise in evasions. The moderators redefined journalism as deferential passivity. Macron, Fillon and the socialist candidate, Beno\u00eet Hamon, were all dressed in blue suits and blue ties, like a bunch of airline stewards, and their responses scarcely differed more than their attire. Nobody even asked Fillon, a former prime minister, about the fact that he\u2019s been placed under investigation relating to allegations he employed his wife and children in make-believe jobs as aides.Fillon, a social conservative who favors free-market reforms and labor market deregulation, had been looking formidable but slumped after the scandal broke. He had promised to stand aside in the event of a formal judicial inquiry, but reneged, infuriating people. The political classes\u2019 contempt for the electorate was encapsulated in his volte-face. Voters\u2019 disgust has boosted the National Front, even if Le Pen is herself caught up in a financial fraud investigation at the European Parliament and has used parliamentary immunity to avoid a police summons.Her path to victory runs roughly like this. She qualifies for the second round with about 24 percent of the vote. Macron is her opponent, with about the same score. The more right-wing Fillon supporters migrate to Le Pen. Supporters of the far-left candidate, M\u00e9lenchon, refuse to vote for Macron; they\u2019ve had it with so-called \u201cuseful votes\u201d and they believe Macron, for all his talk of being a progressive, will pursue \u201cneoliberal\u201d global capitalism. Some Hamon supporters also refuse to back Macron. The abstention rate soars. Le Pen squeezes past 50 percent and becomes president.It could happen. Only a fool, after Brexit and Trump, would suggest otherwise. Le Pen\u2019s line of attack on Macron is clear: he is the perpetuation of Hollande, the representative of \u201cthe system\u201d and a product of \u201cinternational finance,\u201d with all the attendant innuendo. This attack is pretty disgusting, which is not to say it won\u2019t work. Russia is helping. The Russian propaganda site Sputnik has singled out Macron for attack. It was behind rumors that he\u2019s gay and living with the head of Radio France \u2014 rumors so insistent that Macron, who\u2019s married to his 64-year-old former high-school teacher, had to deny them.One thing is certain: Le Pen needs to distract attention from her economic program, a hodgepodge of nationalist and statist measures combined with exit from the euro, which alone could send French bank accounts into free fall. Fear of such a meltdown may be the biggest obstacle Le Pen still has to overcome.I found Macron in Paris answering questions for a Yahoo News event in French and then English (radical for a French politician). The first question was whether \u201cexplicit Macron\u201d is an oxymoron. He laughed. He said he was pragmatic, supple, interested above all in results. His political family was broad: the pro-European moderate right, socialists, progressives, \u201creasonable ecologists.\u201d He called for \u201cstrong reforms\u201d of the French labor market, decreased corporate taxes and invigorated vocational training.\u201cModernity is disruptive,\u201d he declared, \u201cand I endorse that.\u201dAs economy minister, Macron\u2019s \u201cdisruption\u201d involved allowing stores to open on Sundays and creating what are still called \u201cMacron buses\u201d to offer cheap competition to trains for journeys within France: deregulation, French-style! More reform is needed; it\u2019s proved elusive because nobody wants to give up their \u201cacquis\u201d \u2014 the benefits they already have. Whether Macron could build a parliamentary base for change is also an open question.Still, he\u2019s proved that he can break molds. Perhaps his most attractive feature is his brave attachment to the European Union and commitment to helping refugees. \u201cWe are a continent of refugees,\u201d he said, \u201cand if you say we can\u2019t integrate refugees, that\u2019s not consistent with our values, even if borders cannot be wide open.\u201dI asked him if his pragmatism could really fly in an age of populist demagogy. Sure, he told me. \u201cWe are contrarians,\u201d he went on. \u201cWhen neoliberal economics was triumphing everywhere, we refused to adopt it. And now when demagogues are winning, in France pragmatism is going to win.\u201dMacron continued: \u201cThere is a crisis of such proportions that people are ready for change. I am not shy. I am for an open society. I am for a progressive world. I do not propose to reform France; I propose to transform it at its deepest level.\u201dCould he do it? I want to believe he can, in part because I take seriously something he had said earlier: \u201cI want to help with Muslim integration. If you follow the line of Marine Le Pen, you create a civil war.\u201dIn \u201cSubmission,\u201d his best-selling novel, Michel Houellebecq writes: \u201cThe growing gap \u2014 an abyss \u2014 between the population and those who spoke in its name, politicians and journalists, had necessarily to lead to something chaotic, violent and unpredictable. France, like other western countries, had been heading for a long time toward civil war.\u201dIn the book, frantic maneuvering to keep Le Pen from power leads to the victory of an imagined Islamic party led by a telegenic character Mohammed Ben Abbes. Houellebecq\u2019s France is culturally exhausted \u2014 a land of desperate sex and spiritual emptiness \u2014 and so it succumbs to a movement driven by faith and conviction.I get talking to Moussa Sanogo, who came to France from the Ivory Coast a quarter-century ago, and N\u2019diaye Fousseiny, from Mali. Here\u2019s the deal, Sanogo explains, there are no jobs for his kids. He used to install scaffolding, but these days Polish and Romanian construction workers arrive by truck every Monday, making it impossible for French citizens to compete. \u201cMy son drifts around the projects selling drugs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the only business that works.\u201d Fousseiny, who works a night shift at Disneyland Paris, tells me his 14-year-old daughter got detained the other night while hanging out with dealers. Integration through education, the French Republic\u2019s promise, has broken down.I ask about Islamic radicalism. Sanogo, a Muslim, says the area \u201cis worse than Molenbeek,\u201d the terrorist-breeding district of Brussels. About 30 young men from the area, he says, had left for Syria. \u201cLook,\u201d he tells me, \u201chere we are, there\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s a hole, and the jihadists do this out of vengeance. It\u2019s revenge for an indecent life.\u201d He describes a pattern: first drugs, then the discovery of religion (perhaps in jail), then radicalization in clandestine mosques.Close to five million Muslims live in France. Many succeed, but they are likely to have overcome prejudice first. Nisrine Zaibi, the daughter of Tunisian immigrants and now the socialist vice president of the Burgundy regional council, told me how when she became a French citizen at the age of 18, she was asked if she wanted to change her name to \u201csomething more French.\u201d (She also told me she would never \u201cvote useful\u201d for Macron.) Job interviews inevitably turn to questions about the veil or extremism. La\u00efcit\u00e9 often translates into laws banning Muslim headscarves. It may seem a short step from defining the state by its secularism to insisting everyone become secular. \u201cThe banlieue can be a desperate place,\u201d Zaibi said. \u201cI know people who are ready to vote Le Pen just to break something.\u201dAs I leave Sevran, a lanky kid barges into me. \u201cYou could excuse yourself,\u201d he says, looking for a fight. We square up; he moves off, muttering insults. Violence simmers just beneath the surface.Villers-Cotter\u00eats, a town in Picardy about an hour northeast of Paris, has a special place in French history. It was here in 1539 that Francis I established French rather than Latin as the language of all legal acts and notarized documents. The town is synonymous with the forging of that formidable thing: French culture. Today it is run by a National Front mayor, Franck Briffaut.Briffaut thinks Macron is a clown. \u201cHe\u2019s an unidentified political object, part toad and part duck,\u201d he told me. Another Macron stumble \u2014 the decision to go to Algiers to tell an autocrat that France should apologize for its colonial-era \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d \u2014 caused the mayor to explode. \u201cIt\u2019s scandalous, this penitence! Every country has a history of light and shadow. We cannot blame ourselves. These Algerians wanted us to leave. Well, if French colonialism was so terrible, why do they flock here to colonize us today?\u201dAn ex-parachutist who served in Beirut, the bristling Briffaut sees a war of civilizations against Islamism. Parts of France have become no-go areas, he says. \u201cI joined the National Front because I did not want to see what happened in Lebanon happen in France.\u201d He asks me why Trump even had to say \u201cAmerica First.\u201d It\u2019s obvious a nation must put itself first.After the meeting, I am joined by two leftists who worked in education before retirement, Jean-Claude Meunier and Christiane Dufour. They hate the National Front but will not \u201cvote useful\u201d for Macron. Their issue is growing inequality and what they call the \u201cpauperization\u201d of France as the welfare state and workers\u2019 rights and salaries are gradually eroded. They wanted a \u201csocial Europe\u201d; they got what they see as a Europe of ruthless capitalism.We head for a restaurant called the Kiosk of Bacchus. I order a Coke but am brought a glass of C\u00f4te de Gascogne red wine \u2014 \u201cour form of resistance,\u201d Meunier jokes. Dufour\u2019s daughter, Geraldine Leclerc, has joined us. She is struggling as a nurse. \u201cIt\u2019s just more and more difficult to survive,\u201d she says. \u201cFrance is a land of gradual degradation.\u201d Still, we raise a glass and, of course, the steak tartare is first-rate.An argument ensues. Cyril Jacquiot opened the restaurant last year and is working a 75-hour week. He thinks France\u2019s problem is not the fraying welfare state but the fact that \u201cthere are too many acquired rights and too little will to work.\u201d Jacquiot tells Dufour and Meunier they are deluded. If France is the land of \u201cimmobilisme\u201d \u2014 roughly paralysis \u2014 it is because the French know they are protected. \u201cIf you want less unemployment, you need more flexibility,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople need to know they can be fired. Otherwise all sense of responsibility is lost. You have to decide in life: Do you want to work or not?\u201dI listen to the escalating row. In truth, I am not sure the French will ever decide. They live better than they admit but in a state of growing angst fed by failures they are not quite ready to confront. That is the backdrop to Le Pen\u2019s possible victory. It is a frightening prospect; French streets could become battlegrounds. Insurrection is another of those French habits that do not die easily.Seeking quiet, I wander into a park that was once the grounds of the chateau where Francis I made French the language of the land. The chateau, its roof sagging, its windows boarded up, is collapsing into ruin.An earlier version of this column misstated the given name, in one instance, and the surname, in a photo caption, of a restaurant owner.

{"Headline": "Black People Are Not All \u2018Living in Hell\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byOne of the most significant changes in recent decades is the remarkable gains in income among more affluent blacks. When we adjust for inflation to 2014 dollars, the percentage of black Americans earning at least $75,000 more than doubled from 1970 to 2014, to 21 percent. Those making $100,000 or more almost quadrupled to 13 percent (in contrast white Americans saw a less striking increase, from 11 to 26 percent).Bayer and Charles conclude that the improvement in earnings for upper-income black men have had an uneven impact on African- American communities generally:While the entire economy has experienced a marked increase in earnings inequality, this increase has been even more dramatic for black men, with those at the top continuing to make clear gains within the earnings distribution, and those at the bottom being especially harmed by the era of mass incarceration and the failing job market for men with low skills.African-American households on the highest rungs of the economic ladder \u2014 the top 5 percent of all black households \u2014 experienced a substantial 19.8 percent income increase from 2000 to 2015. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in inflation-adjusted 2015 dollars, these households saw a $41,871 gain, from $211,425 in 2000 to $253,296 in 2015.The top five percent of white households had incomes above those of African-Americans in this category, but they experienced a $4,498 or 1.2 percent, household income loss between 2000 and 2015, from $368,852 to $364,354.In addition, the income gains among the top fifth of African-American earners from 2000 to 2015 stand in contrast to declines for each quintile in the other 80 percent. Mean income in the bottom fifth of African-American households, for example, fell from $8,555 in inflation-adjusted dollars in 2000 to $7,020 in 2015. For those in the middle fifth, mean income fell from $40,731 to $37,184 over the same period.The concentration of wealth in the hands of the top segment of the African-American population is high. In 2009, the top 10% of African-Americans accounted for 67% of the wealth held by all African-Americans, up by 8 points from 59 percent in 2005.For whites in 2009, the top 10 percent owned 51 percent of all white-owned wealth, up from 46 percent of wealth in 2005.The most important trend driving African-American gains at the top can be found in the data on higher education. Between 1980 and 2016, the percentage of African Americans over the age of 25 who had completed a four-year college education tripled from 7.9 percent to 23.9 percent.Top-flight colleges and universities have played a crucial role in the growth of a black upper middle class.While the income gains in the black community have been limited to those at the top of the ladder, there are other, broader, non-monetary gains.There are a host of other significant positive indicators.Mortality rates for African-Americans are falling more sharply than they are for whites.In 1970, white men and women lived to an average of 71.7 years and black men and women lived to 64.1. By 2014, the average white American lived to 79.0 years, a 7.3 year improvement, but the average black American lived to be 75.6, an 11.5 year gain.Patrick Bayer and Kerwin Charles reported in their 2016 NBER paper thatThe gains of black men at higher quintiles have been driven primarily by positional gains within education level due to forces like improved access to quality schools and declining occupational exclusion. At the median and below, strong racial convergence in educational attainment has been counteracted by the rising returns to education in the labor market, which have disproportionately disadvantaged the shrinking but still substantial share of blacks with lower education.In a phone interview, Charles said that changes in the employment marketplace, especially the rising demand for highly educated workers and the sharp drop in demand for those without college degrees, have been brutal for black men without a postsecondary education.In this sense, the civil rights movement came late for millions of African-Americans. Just as black high school graduation rates in the 1970s began to catch up to white rates, the market in well-paying jobs for those with high school diplomas (or less) began to collapse.At the same time, just as African-Americans achieved voting majorities and political power in major rust belt urban centers during the late 1960s and early 1970s, deindustrialization, the movement of factories to nonunion states, offshoring and, more broadly, globalization ate away at the tax bases of those cities. Newly elected black mayors in cities like Detroit and Cleveland faced diminished resources, eroding their ability to use political power to build a middle class as Irish, Italian and Polish and other ethnic leaders had before them.\u201cExactly at the time blacks caught up (getting high school degrees), the market ceased to reward that achievement,\u201d Charles said in our phone interview.In consequence, \u201cthe median black man today occupies roughly the same position in the overall earnings distribution as that held by his father and by his grandfather,\u201d Charles noted during a recent presentation at Brown University:By contrast, the relative position of the 90th percentile black man in the economic distribution has consistently improved compared to his white counterpart.What to make of all this?\u201cBlack people now inhabit all levels of the American class and occupational structure,\u201d Elijah Anderson, a sociologist at Yale, writes in his forthcoming book, \u201cBlack in White Space.\u201dThey attend the best schools, pursue the professions of their choosing, and occupy various positions of power, privilege, and prestige.But for the ascendant black upper middle class, Anderson continues, \u201cin the shadows lurks the specter of the urban ghetto. The iconic ghetto is always in the background,\u201d shapingAmericans\u2019 conception of the anonymous black person as well as the circumstances of blacks of all walks of life.Much more needs to be done. Black America \u2014 in terms of income and wealth inequality, of bearing the brunt of globalization and automation, and of suffering the consequences of lowered demand for workers without college degrees \u2014 is in many ways a more extreme version of America generally.Just as working class whites denied a fair share of economic growth \u2014 and suffering the effects of the Great Recession more acutely than the affluent \u2014 surprised almost everyone in 2016 by initiating a class upheaval within the Republican Party, the same explosive mix is present in the black community. At some point, despite (and in some ways because of) the success of the top fifth of African-Americans, frustration over the failure of the other 80 percent to get their fair share will find parallel expression in the political system, although no one can anticipate what form that will take.Advertisement"}

Examining an ElectionWhen students have enough background to begin their research, they can work in pairs or small groups to learn about the issues at the heart of the elections in France. You might decide to have each pair or small group focus on one candidate, and then share their research with the rest of the class. Or, you might instead have different members of a group learn about different candidates, before sharing what they learned with the rest of their group. Either way, the goal is to have students understand each candidate\u2019s perspective.2. Weaknesses in DemocracyThe recent referendum in Turkey, in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed a narrow majority of votes to expand his presidential authority, is the latest example of a puzzling phenomenon: Democratically elected leaders who triumph in elections even as they move toward autocracy by undermining checks and balances and consolidating power.She then investigates what she calls \u201cthe most common way for a democracy to collapse\u201d in today\u2019s world \u2014 through the actions of an elected incumbent, not a coup or revolution.Have students read Ms. Taub\u2019s analysis, and then consider the following questions, for writing and discussion:1. What role do checks and balances play within a strong democracy? Are they essential? And, why is it dangerous when a democratically elected leader claims popular support for changes that undermine democratic institutions, such as stripping away checks and balances?2. What role does a free press play within a strong democracy? Is it essential? Is it dangerous when democratically elected leaders curtail press freedom or spread misinformation? Why?3. Does democracy need an opposition party or leaders? Why is it dangerous when an elected leader limits the opposition\u2019s ability to campaign or systematically shuts off political opportunities for the opposition?4. Are democratic elections an effective check on tyranny? And how are deeply polarized societies particularly susceptible to sliding from democracy to autocracy?5. What do you think citizens in a democracy should do to strengthen democratic traditions and institutions and prevent the possibility of an authoritarian regime taking control? Why?3. Far-right Nationalism or Fascism?...questions are surfacing around the globe about a revival of fascism, generally defined as a governmental system that asserts complete power and emphasizes aggressive nationalism and often racism. In places like Russia and Turkey, leaders like Vladimir V. Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan employ strongman tactics. In Austria, a nationalist candidate came within three-tenths of a percentage point of becoming the first far-right head of state elected in Europe since World War II.First, ask students to define four key terms: fascism, authoritarianism, populism and nationalism.

{"Headline": "The Myth of Main Street", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported byOpinionShortly after Donald Trump was elected president, John Solak, a resident of Binghamton, N.Y., began lobbying the city to rename its Main Street \u201cTrump Street.\u201d The proposal, though quixotic, succinctly captured the hopes for economic salvation that Mr. Trump represented to so many voters in country towns and small cities across the nation. \u201cAt each and every campaign stop,\u201d Mr. Solak explained to a Binghamton radio station, \u201che mentioned the blight of upstate New York and the economy here.\u201dAnd what better symbol of that blight than Main Street? Throughout the Rust Belt and much of rural America, the image of Main Street is one of empty storefronts and abandoned buildings interspersed with fast-food franchises, only a short drive from a Walmart.Main Street is a place but it is also an idea. It\u2019s small-town retail. It\u2019s locally owned shops selling products to hardworking townspeople. It\u2019s neighbors with dependable blue-collar jobs in auto plants and coal mines. It\u2019s a feeling of community and of having control over your life. It\u2019s everything, in short, that seems threatened by global capitalism and cosmopolitan elites in big cities and fancy suburbs.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign slogan was \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d but it could just as easily have been \u201cBring Main Street Back.\u201d Since taking office, he has signed an executive order designed to revive the coal industry, promised a $1 trillion infrastructure bill and continued to express support for tariffs and to criticize globalism and international free trade. \u201cThe jobs and wealth have been stripped from our country,\u201d he said last month, signing executive orders meant to improve the trade deficit. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing manufacturing and jobs back.\u201dThe frustrations that fuel the nostalgia for Main Street are understandable \u2014 and longstanding. From the beginning of our country\u2019s history, rural and small-town Americans have been on the losing side of a rising market economy. You can draw a straight line from the Jeffersonians in the late 18th century to the agrarian populists in the late 19th century to Mr. Trump\u2019s voters, all of whom have felt that the city hornswoggled the country. The rage that arose in the 1880s, as rural incomes fell and farm mortgages defaulted while city bankers got rich, does not feel so distant today.But nostalgia for Main Street is misplaced \u2014 and costly. Small stores are inefficient. Local manufacturers, lacking access to economies of scale, usually are inefficient as well. To live in that kind of world is expensive.This nostalgia, like the frustration that underlies it, has a long and instructive history. Years before deindustrialization, years before Nafta, Americans were yearning for a Main Street that never quite existed.For a few decades in the 19th century, Main Street store owners were a viable engine of American economic growth, selling to local residents and people in surrounding rural areas. But that hasn\u2019t been the case ever since. In the 1920s, a new and more efficient kind of retail emerged, the chain store, which sealed Main Street\u2019s decline. Main Street retailers had been under assault for decades from national mail-order catalogs like Sears, Roebuck, but it was the chain store, typified by A. & P. and Woolworth\u2019s, that vanquished small-town commerce. These stores, buying in volume, could offer low prices that local shops couldn\u2019t match. National manufacturers, through chain stores, delivered goods that were cheaper than ever before. Small-town manufacturing and retail looked like a thing of the past.A political uproar ensued. The fight to save Main Street, then as now, was less about the price of goods gained than the cost of autonomy lost. Perhaps the most passionate defender of Main Street was William K. Henderson, the owner and operator of the radio station KWKH in Shreveport, La., and a forerunner of political personalities like Rush Limbaugh. He inveighed against the \u201cruinous and devastating effect of sending the profits out of our local communities to a common center, Wall Street.\u201d Chain stores, he warned parents, closed the \u201cdoor of opportunity\u201d for their children, who might otherwise grow up to become \u201cprosperous business leaders.\u201dTo save Main Street, state lawmakers in the 1930s passed \u201cfair trade\u201d legislation that set floors for retail prices, protecting small-town manufacturers and retailers from big business\u2019s economies of scale. These laws permitted manufacturers to dictate prices for their products in a state (which is where that now-meaningless phrase \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price\u201d comes from); if a manufacturer had a price agreement with even one retailer in a state, other stores in the state could not discount that product. As a result, chain stores could no longer demand a lower price from manufacturers, despite buying in higher volumes.These laws allowed Main Street shops to somewhat compete with chain stores, and kept prices (and profits) higher than a truly free market would have allowed. At the same time, workers, empowered by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, organized the A. & P. and other chain stores, as well as these buttressed Main Street manufacturers, so that they also got a share of the profits. Main Street \u2014 its owners and its workers \u2014 was kept afloat, but at a cost to consumers, for whom prices remained high.But this world was unsustainable. It unraveled in the 1960s and 1970s, as fair trade laws were repealed, manufacturers discovered overseas suppliers and unions came undone. On Main Street, prices came down for shoppers, but at the same time, so did wage growth. Main Street was officially dead.It\u2019s worth noting that the idealized Main Street is not a myth in some parts of America today. It exists, but only as a luxury consumer experience. Main Streets of small, independent boutiques and nonfranchised restaurants can be found in affluent college towns, in gentrified neighborhoods in Brooklyn and San Francisco, in tony suburbs \u2014 in any place where people have ample disposable income. Main Street requires shoppers who don\u2019t really care about low prices. The dream of Main Street may be populist, but the reality is elitist. \u201cKeep it local\u201d campaigns are possible only when people are willing and able to pay to do so.In hard-pressed rural communities and small towns, that isn\u2019t an option. This is why the nostalgia for Main Street is so harmful: It raises false hopes, which when dashed fuel anger and despair. President Trump\u2019s promises notwithstanding, there is no going back to an economic arrangement whose foundations were so shaky. In the long run, American capitalism cannot remain isolated from the global economy. To do so would be not only stultifying for Americans, but also perilous for the rest of the world\u2019s economic growth, with all the attendant political dangers. The only choice is turning to the future.Also harmful, however, is the complacent and na\u00efve expectation, often found among well-meaning liberals, that everyone, to have a good job, needs to go to college, preferably to learn computer programming (or some other skill in manipulating information) and ideally to move to New York City or San Francisco. If the answer to rural downward mobility is to turn everyone into software engineers, there is no hope. The idea that every truck driver or coal miner can, or should, become a member of the modern professional class is closely related to the belief that unless you have those particular skills, you have no value \u2014 which isn\u2019t the case.Many rural Americans, sadly, don\u2019t realize how valuable they already are or what opportunities presently exist for them. It\u2019s true that the digital economy, centered in a few high-tech cities, has left Main Street America behind. But it does not need to be this way. Today, for the first time, thanks to the internet, small-town America can pull back money from Wall Street (and big cities more generally). Through global freelancing platforms like Upwork, for example, rural and small-town Americans can find jobs anywhere in world, using abilities and talents they already have. A receptionist can welcome office visitors in San Francisco from her home in New York\u2019s Finger Lakes. Through an e-commerce website like Etsy, an Appalachian woodworker can create custom pieces and sell them anywhere in the world.Americans, regardless of education or geographical location, have marketable skills in the global economy: They speak English and understand the nuances of communicating with Americans \u2014 something that cannot be easily shipped overseas. The United States remains the largest consumer market in the world, and Americans can (and some already do) sell these services abroad.Connecting Americans who live and work in small towns with these kinds of digital platforms is not simply a matter of giving them internet access, as with the new \u201cBroadband for All\u201d initiative of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York (though that is a step in the right direction). We also need programs to support that transition. Right now we are too fixated on \u201cupskilling\u201d coal miners into data miners. We should instead be showing people how to get work via digital platforms with their existing skills.The reality of global economics means that Main Street is a place of nostalgia, but again, that has long been the case. What\u2019s novel is that today, the underlying values of Main Street \u2014 living and working with autonomy in your own small community \u2014 can be attained, as long as you are willing to find that work online.John Solak may think that renaming Binghamton\u2019s Main Street will make his city \u201cgreat again.\u201d What will actually make Binghamton great is connecting its people to the rest of the world. The solution is not to stop the global market, but to help those left out of it find their way from Main Street to the mainstream.Louis Hyman, an economic historian, is the director of the Institute for Workplace Studies at the ILR School at Cornell.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Tumultuous \u201990s Paved the Way for Putin\u2019s Russia", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The hopes for a partnership between Russia and the West have been dashed, and in \u201cWho Lost Russia?\u201d Peter Conradi, the foreign editor of The Sunday Times of London, who spent seven years covering Russia for Reuters, seeks to explain what went wrong.Conradi wisely examines the forest\u2019s contours, avoiding the trees. He writes engagingly and enlivens his smart, balanced analysis with colorful anecdotes, though his book\u2019s title does him a disservice. \u201cWho Lost Russia?\u201d suggests that he, like many Westerners, will treat this gargantuan, complicated country as if it were a misplaced personal item, or solipsistically attribute its post-Soviet path to Western policy. Conradi does discuss the West\u2019s missteps, but he also focuses on the internal developments that shaped Russia\u2019s course. And he is attentive to Russians\u2019 views, even if his footnotes \u2014 which are sparse \u2014 contain only two Russian-language sources, one dating back to 1924.Conradi starts with Gorbachev\u2019s reforms, the fall of the Soviet-backed Communist states in Eastern Europe (in 1989), the Soviet Union\u2019s implosion (1991) and the Yeltsin years (the 1990s). He describes the Russian economy\u2019s crash and the penury millions of Russians endured. He recounts the privatization of state-owned industries and the accompanying corruption and Ponzi schemes of unscrupulous men who hijacked the process, enriched themselves and eventually became oligarchs. He tells of Russians\u2019 dejection as their country\u2019s power and prestige plummeted and of their sense of betrayal when NATO advanced eastward, even as Western leaders celebrated the Cold War\u2019s end and welcomed Russia as a partner. He highlights the gap between the West\u2019s verbal support for Russian reform and its paltry financial aid \u2014 $2.50 per Russian, by his reckoning.And he recalls the 1996 Russian election, which President Clinton praised as a victory for democracy, even though oligarchs bankrolled Boris Yeltsin\u2019s campaign in exchange for shares in state-owned industries at bargain-basement prices. He portrays the tumultuous presidency of the oft-inebriated Yeltsin, who, during a visit to the United States, was encountered by Secret Service agents in front of the White House, drunk and in his underwear, trying to get a cab to a pizza joint.Yet the Clinton administration praised Yeltsin for promoting democratic and market reforms. Clinton had a soft spot for \u201cOl\u2019 Boris,\u201d whom he considered a bulwark against Russia\u2019s Communist Party, which was growing in popularity as Russians\u2019 misery increased.Though Conradi\u2019s coverage of the 1990s doesn\u2019t turn up anything new, it does something valuable. It shows that the authoritarianism, corruption and crony capitalism of Putin\u2019s Russia took root during that decade. More important, given Conradi\u2019s objective, it demonstrates that the disputes currently dividing Russia and the West preceded Vladimir Putin\u2019s presidency.Consider Putin\u2019s broadsides against NATO\u2019s eastward expansion. Conradi reminds us that Yeltsin, not to mention Russia\u2019s military brass, also vociferously opposed NATO\u2019s enlargement. Even Russian liberals, like Boris Nemtsov (later a fierce opponent of Putin who was shot dead on a Moscow bridge in February 2015), predicted a backlash. Clinton airily dismissed such prognoses as \u201csilly.\u201dIn the 1990s, Russia, weak and reliant on Western aid, acquiesced unhappily to NATO\u2019s advance toward its borders. As Yeltsin once said wearily, having again failed to change Clinton\u2019s mind on that policy, \u201cWell, I tried.\u201dLikewise, while Western leaders have condemned Putin\u2019s quest for spheres of influence, Conradi shows that in Yeltsin\u2019s time too Russians believed that they were entitled to preponderance in the countries of the former Soviet Union, particularly Ukraine. For Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Ukraine and Russia were organically connected. Vladimir Lukin, Yeltsin\u2019s ambassador to Washington, advised Strobe Talbott \u2014 Clinton\u2019s top Russia expert and later deputy secretary of state \u2014 to consider Russia and Ukraine as akin to New York and New Jersey. Yeltsin\u2019s first foreign minister, the liberal reformer Andrei Kozyrev, asked why Russia should retreat from territories that took centuries to conquer.Putin\u2019s Russia and the West are now at loggerheads \u2014 even, according to a popular but misguided analogy Conradi uses, enmeshed in a new Cold War. But things didn\u2019t start out that way. Putin\u2019s early meetings with President George W. Bush, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and NATO Secretary General George Robertson were convivial. He presented Russia as part of the West and even startled his interlocutors by proposing that Russia join NATO. He called the White House immediately after the 9/11 attacks, offering assistance, and actually provided it during Washington\u2019s war against Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Though he didn\u2019t like George W. Bush\u2019s renunciation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, his invasion of Iraq and NATO\u2019s incorporation of the three Baltic States \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 he took these matters in stride.When did things go awry and why? Conradi suggests that the democratic revolutions in Georgia in 2003-4 and Ukraine in 2004-5 may have been a turning point. Western governments applauded the protesters, and American and European NGOs had long financed and trained Georgian and Ukrainian pro-democracy groups. For Putin, the democratic movements represented a Western effort to undercut Russia in its own neighborhood; democracy and human rights were ruses, demanded of some countries but not others.In 2007, at the annual Munich Security Conference, Putin lambasted the United States for foisting its values on others, sowing instability and behaving arrogantly. He has stuck to this script. And it has had enormous appeal within Russia. For lots of Russians, Putin personifies a break with the 1990s, when their country, led by a boozy, erratic president, was politically chaotic, economically near collapse and dissed by the West.Only 47 when he was elected president in 2000, Putin exuded vitality \u2014 a stark contrast, as Conradi shows, to Yeltsin\u2019s decrepitude. Taking advantage of soaring oil prices, which quintupled between 2000 and 2008, Putin bulked up Russia\u2019s army, acquiring the muscle to push back: in Georgia in 2008 (Conradi provides an illuminating account of the events that culminated in the Georgian army\u2019s humiliating defeat) and in Ukraine in 2014 (here Conradi doesn\u2019t add anything original).If any one event explains the rupture between Russia and the West, it was, as Conradi vividly shows, the mass rebellion that erupted in Ukraine in late 2013 when President Viktor Yanukovych, popularly elected albeit venal, cut off negotiations with the European Union on an association agreement and tacked instead toward Russia. Western governments immediately embraced the uprising against him. Senator John McCain and Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland visited Kiev and communed with the protesters.On Feb. 21, the E.U. brokered a deal between Yanukovych and opposition leaders that included an early presidential election. But when the protesting masses cried betrayal, Yanukovych was finished. He fled the next day. To Putin, his ouster was another Western conspiracy. Russian officials seized on a telephone conversation in Kiev between Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt, the American ambassador, about the post-Yanukovych government\u2019s composition, an amateurish exchange that was intercepted by Russian intelligence and inevitably reached YouTube. Putin upped the ante in March, annexing Crimea, with its Russian majority, and backing separatists in eastern Ukraine with weapons and troops. The West slapped Russia with economic sanctions and banished it from the G-8. President Obama\u2019s ailing \u201creset\u201d policy lay dead.So who lost Russia? Russia\u2019s leaders, primarily Putin, who neither built democracy nor made Russia a partner of the West? Or the West, which was never serious about respecting Russia\u2019s interests, let alone a partnership? Conradi doesn\u2019t provide a clear-cut answer to his question. Given the complexities he grapples with, who can blame him?Rajan Menon, a City College political science professor, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Conceit of Humanitarian Intervention.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ontario Hopes Tax on Non-Canadians Buying Toronto Homes Will Temper Prices", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 In a bid to slow the soaring growth of housing prices in the Toronto area, Ontario officials announced several measures on Thursday, including a 15 percent tax on residential buyers who are not residents or citizens of Canada.While Ontario\u2019s premier, Kathleen Wynne, emphasized the need for the 15 percent tax on outside purchasers, similar to one enacted recently in Vancouver, British Columbia, there are no statistics on the number of Toronto houses that have gone to such buyers. Ontario\u2019s finance minister estimated that they make up 8 percent of the market, but other estimates are well above or well below that figure. Neither Ms. Wynne nor members of her cabinet were able to quantify the effect of what they called \u201cphantom\u201d purchasing.\u201cThis is a complex issue,\u201d Ms. Wynne said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t one single thing we could do that would deal with the issues we\u2019re confronting.\u201dPolitical pressure is escalating on Ms. Wynne and the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to cool off the Toronto market.At the same time, both levels of government have been loath to take steps that effectively punish current homeowners by forcing down the value of their property.On Thursday, the premier said that the high prices were not entirely a bad thing, calling the market boom \u201cthe unwanted consequence of a strong economy.\u201dSome economists have encouraged Ontario to impose a nonresident tax in what is generally known as the Greater Toronto Area.\u201cThe province is aiming at those effectively parking wealth in the G.T.A. real estate market, and we have been fully in favor of such a move for some time,\u201d Robert Kavcic, senior economist with BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, wrote in an analysis.But Mr. Kavcic was also skeptical that the tax and other measures announced by Ms. Wynne would have a substantial effect.He said the tax would mostly prevent a rise in the prices of the most expensive houses on the market.Because not all of Ontario has experienced a major escalation in house prices, the new tax and some other measures announced on Thursday will apply only to a portion of the province within commuting distance of Toronto. The tax also includes several exemptions and will be rebated to people who later can prove that they have stayed in Canada to work or study.Ms. Wynne outlined some modest changes intended to remedy that. Cities and towns in Ontario can now impose extra taxes on houses left empty by investor-owners, and undeveloped land that has water and sewer service and that is approved for housing will face increased property taxes. The province will also allow housing to be built on some of its vacant land in the Toronto area.The province also expanded provincial rent controls to include apartments built after 1991. It will try nevertheless to encourage apartment construction through real estate tax reductions and rebates for things like development charges.Mindful of Toronto\u2019s large immigrant community with its many house hunters, Ms. Wynne pointedly noted that the new tax would not apply to people who make their home in Ontario.\u201cThe nonresident speculation tax has nothing to do with new Canadians,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Their shouted slogans made it equally clear what they wanted.\u201cFreeport must be shut down!\u201d the crowd chanted.It was a refrain that, in recent months, has resonated throughout Indonesia. Less than a week earlier, dozens of students from a different organization \u2014 dressed in red and white, Indonesia\u2019s national colors \u2014 gathered outside the same office, calling for the government to take a firm hand with the company.\u201cFreeport hasn\u2019t brought prosperity. It\u2019s just destroyed the natural environment,\u201d said Surya Anta, national coordinator for the Indonesian People\u2019s Front for West Papua. His organization helped organize anti-Freeport protests in 17 cities around the country.Billions of dollars\u2019 worth of metal is produced at the mighty Grasberg mine, which provides jobs in a province with few other prospects. The problem? The mine is \u2014 to the frustration of Indonesians watching their country\u2019s economic growth begin to sputter as commodity prices sag \u2014 American owned and operated.To address that, the government has in recent years passed regulations intended to exert greater control over mine operators. Freeport says those requirements violate the company\u2019s 1991 contract, which lasts until 2021 and which it wants to renew.The dispute has put the brakes on production at the mine and slammed Freeport directly into Indonesian politics. The company, which counts as a major investor the billionaire Carl Icahn, a major backer of President Trump, has brought it to the attention of the United States government.\u201cIt is disingenuous and insulting that Indonesia would violate a contract by hiding behind politically motivated laws that were enacted after the contract was signed,\u201d Mr. Icahn said.The contract fight exemplifies Indonesia\u2019s often fraught transition from a country exploited by colonial powers to one with the political clout to control its own resources, which are worth billions of dollars. For many Indonesians, Freeport, the biggest mining operation here, puts a face on that struggle.\u201cWe are hoping that if Freeport is nationalized, the revenue from Freeport will be distributed to ordinary people, to subsidize basic needs and education,\u201d said Ahmad Hedar, a student activist.Freeport has operated Grasberg since the early 1970s, the crown jewel in what a former chief executive called its global \u201ctrove of treasures.\u201dIndonesia, however, sees the mine as a national resource whose riches are being spirited away to foreign owners.\u201cFreeport pays only 8 trillion rupiah in taxes,\u201d but complains about unfair treatment, Ignasius Jonan, the minister of energy and natural resources, told the youth wing of a prominent Muslim organization in February.That figure, about $600 million, compares with about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper mined in 2015. But the company says that from 1992 to 2015, about 60 percent of its profit was returned to Indonesia in taxes, royalties, fees and stock dividends.Both sides have threatened to take the contract disagreement to international arbitration. Until the dispute is resolved, the Grasberg mine will run at about 40 percent capacity; without a licensing deal, the Indonesian government will not allow Freeport to export unprocessed minerals.The price of copper has been stable since a sharp rise in November, but the company\u2019s shares have dropped nearly 20 percent in the last two months.\u201cIt is in the best interests of all stakeholders to receive a resolution in these matters,\u201d Richard Adkerson, the chief executive of Freeport, said in a written statement to The New York Times.The Indonesian government faces extraordinary pressure from its citizens and national media to be firm with Freeport. This is driven by a perception that the company has consistently taken advantage of the Indonesian government since it entered the country in 1967 as one of its first big foreign investors.\u201cIndonesians have always been educated that they have world-class resources that are the envy of the entire world, but that over the years Western colonial powers have hatched schemes to take over Indonesia to exploit those resources,\u201d said Matthew Busch, a research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute for International Policy.Eve Warburton, a researcher at Australian National University who studies Indonesian resource nationalism, said that over the last decade Indonesian politicians had consistently been more assertive toward foreign mining companies.\u201cNow it seems many people in government believe that Indonesia can afford to stay the nationalist path in the resources sectors,\u201d she said.The conditions may be scaring off business. Last year Newmont, an American miner, sold its stake in Indonesia\u2019s Batu Hijau copper mine after struggling to adjust to Indonesian regulations. Rio Tinto, the British-Australian company, has a deal to develop Grasberg with Freeport, but its chief executive suggested in February that the company might back out over the new rules.International analysts say Freeport\u2019s contract might not be as one-sided as many Indonesian government officials make it out to be. And despite the uncompromising statements from both sides, they say, a deal remains in reach.\u201cI see this as smoke and mirrors,\u201d said Bill Sullivan, a lawyer and mining analyst in Jakarta. \u201cThe government has no incentive whatsoever to make things so difficult for metal mineral producers that they won\u2019t reach an agreement. Because of the government\u2019s need for deep political cover, however, it has to relax the export ban in a way that does not make it look as though the government is caving in to metal mineral producers.\u201dBut with Vice President Mike Pence scheduled to visit Indonesia in April, politicians here are unconcerned about effects on international relations.\u201cI\u2019m someone who is very happy with Donald Trump\u2019s brilliant ideas and was glad to see him elected president,\u201d said Mukhtar Tompo, an Indonesian legislator who has called for Freeport to be expelled from Indonesia. \u201cAs long as Donald Trump looks at things from every perspective, he will agree with our side.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Tax Plan May Shift Use of Corporate Debt", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byBut one of the plan\u2019s most important provisions could secure bipartisan support, and win acclaim from tax experts and economists. The groundbreaking shifts envisioned by the provision would influence the way corporations in the United States raise money and invest.The House measure would cause a sea change in how companies account for debt, perhaps their most important source of financing. It would stop companies from treating the interest they pay on their borrowings as an expense for tax purposes, something they have done for many decades. Right now, the interest paid on debt reduces a firm\u2019s taxable profits, effectively allowing it to pay less in tax.Its supporters say the measure would remove skewed incentives, stoke entrepreneurship and even make the economy less prone to recessions over the long run. To some, like Jason Furman, a senior economic adviser in the second Obama administration, the provision could form a major part of a tax bill that could win over Democrats in Congress. But opponents warn of an overall drop in investment and it becoming harder for businesses, especially small ones, to raise the money they need to expand.When a company or person can use an expense to reduce taxes, it is called a deduction. And allowing corporations to deduct interest may appear to make sense, since interest is a cost of doing business, like paying wages or spending on marketing.But the tax treatment of debt is very different from the treatment of equity, the other main source of financing for companies. For instance, firms typically cannot deduct the dividends they pay out on their stock.Tax experts and economists have long argued that as a result, borrowing gets an unfair advantage. This, they assert, has at times created incentives for companies to take on too much debt, which might be invested poorly and leave them vulnerable when interest rates go up or business hits a rough patch.Some high-profile examples of this happening are the debt-burdened commercial real estate projects that got Mr. Trump into financial trouble during his career as a developer. And on a broad scale, too much debt can make the wider economy more vulnerable to recession.Importantly, though, the House plan does not just yank away the deductibility of interest without giving back something big in return.It also proposes that companies would be able to immediately treat as an expense all of the money they spend on items like plant and equipment. Under current tax rules, such capital expenditures are accounted for bit by bit over time, a practice known as depreciation. But under the House proposal, a company spending $1 million on a new machinery would be able to subtract that cost from revenue immediately rather than spaced over a number of years. And if the company borrowed $1 million to buy the machinery, the interest on that debt would no longer be deductible.To some tax specialists and economists, these changes would create a more neutral operating environment for companies, because the tax advantage would be directly tied to their investment spending, not the debt they might have used to finance the spending.And that is why those experts believe eliminating the interest deduction is one of the least-bad ways to raise the hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes needed to make up some of the shortfall caused by the big tax cuts envisioned elsewhere in the House plan.\u201cThis is a tax increase on debt finance \u2014 there is no question about that,\u201d said Alan Cole, an economist at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, a research organization. \u201cBut there are some grounds to think this is reasonably justified.\u201dEstimating how much the two changes will affect tax revenues is tough, but experts calculate that in the first decade, the tax revenue loss on the capital expenditures would far outweigh the gain from ending the interest deduction. \u201cIf you go to immediate expensing, you have this big upfront cost,\u201d said James R. Nunns, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the center-left Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.Industries that take a relatively long time to write down their assets would get the biggest one-time boost from the immediate expensing of capital expenditures. The beneficiaries would include commercial real estate developers. And that fillip could offset any concerns, perhaps in the White House, about the negative effect on real estate firms of removing the interest deduction.After 10 years, though, the revenue raised from eliminating the interest deduction could outweigh that lost to expensing capital expenditures. That is in part because the House plan would eliminate only the deductibility of interest on new debt. As old debt is replaced, the amount of revenue from the elimination would increase. In the first 10 years, the two changes could drain $1 trillion out of tax revenue but raise another $1.1 trillion in the second 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center.One reason this decline might not occur is if the tax overhaul slashes corporate taxes to a level that prompts companies to invest considerably more than they did before, thus offsetting any negative effects of ending the interest deduction. But the Goldman economists are skeptical that the final overhaul will push the corporate tax rate down to the 20 percent level envisioned in the House plan.And a higher effective cost of borrowing could be worse for some companies than for others. Firms with high borrowings would feel the effects as they came to issue new debt. Large public companies could offset costlier debt financing by raising money in the equity markets, which would become more attractive economically than the debt market. But small businesses that generally do not tap stock markets could get squeezed.Some economists are also skeptical more generally about ending interest deductibility. They say that it is not definitive whether tax policies have had a large role in driving up debt levels at corporations. Company owners may prefer using debt because selling stock reduces their ownership control over the firm. And big debt binges, including the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, may have been caused far more by weak banking regulations and excessively cheap loans than by tax incentives.Conversely, of course, that means that removing the deductibility of interest may have less of an impact on how companies finance themselves than many people expect. \u201cIt could be muted in the other direction,\u201d Mr. Leary added.Minimal disruption would most likely be a welcome bonus for Republicans whose main priority is to find ways of paying for their corporate tax cut. Eliminating the interest deduction could raise a ton of money. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a big deal,\u201d said Mr. Cole of the Tax Foundation, \u201cand it definitely helps lower the corporate rate, and that\u2019s definitely a policy goal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico Ready to Play the Corn Card in Trade Talks", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 From the hundreds of millions of tortillas consumed every year to the countless tons of corn-enriched feed that fattens livestock and poultry, corn is perhaps Mexico\u2019s most important agricultural commodity, one at the center of its life and culture.The reason: Much of the corn that Mexico consumes comes from the United States, making it America\u2019s top agricultural export to its southern neighbor. And even though President Trump appears to be pulling back from his vows to completely overhaul Nafta, Mexico has taken his threats to heart and has begun flexing its own muscle.American corn shipments to Mexico totaled nearly $2.6 billion last year and are part of an elaborate agricultural trade relationship between the two nations that has helped to interlace their economies. But though the corn business is a tiny fraction of the overall $525 billion in annual trade between the two countries, it has gained outsize importance and become something of a symbol for the nations\u2019 economic codependence.The prospect that the United States could lose its largest foreign market for corn and other key products has shaken farming communities throughout the American Midwest, where corn production is a vital part of the economy. The threat is particularly unsettling for many residents of the Corn Belt because much of the region voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump in the presidential election.\u201cIf we lose Mexico as a customer, it will be absolutely devastating to the ag economy,\u201d said Philip Gordon, 68, who grows corn, soybeans and wheat on a farm in Saline, Mich., that has been in his family for 140 years.Mr. Gordon said he planned to call Mr. Trump at the White House \u201cand remind him we need trade.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a businessman,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cHe understands how much support for him came from the agricultural community.\u201dStill, people involved in agricultural trade on both sides of the border said they were not about to rest easy on the basis of the document, which even the White House seemed to disavow.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to track with this president,\u201d said Todd Hultman, a grains analyst at DTN, an agriculture news and data service based in Omaha. \u201cThe campaign rhetoric has been really over the top. But what actions are really going to come from the White House is still a mystery.\u201dMr. Trump has repeatedly asserted that Mexico has been the big winner under Nafta, and the United States the loser. But many leaders in the agricultural and food industries in the United States \u2014 not just in the corn market \u2014 hope Mr. Trump does not disrupt the agreement too much.\u201cWhen you mix politics with economics, you hope that economics influences your political decisions and not vice versa,\u201d said Luis A. Ribera, associate professor of agricultural economics and director of the Center for North American Studies at Texas A&M University.Many leaders in the American agriculture industry say Nafta has been a boon for farmers in the United States, particularly because it opened up new foreign markets and helped to expand agricultural exports more than fourfold since the agreement was signed.In 2016, the United States exported nearly $18 billion of agricultural products to Mexico, the third-largest market for these American exports, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.Mexico is not only the leading destination of American corn, but it also imports more dairy products, poultry and wheat from the United States than any other nation, and is one of the top importers of American pork, soybeans and beef, the department says.Mexico imported about 13.8 million tons of American corn last year, according to the Mexican government. Nearly all \u2014 about 12.7 million tons \u2014 was yellow corn, which is largely used for livestock feed, supplementing about 3.5 million tons of homegrown yellow corn.The remainder of corn imports were of the white variety, which is used mostly for human consumption and is a key ingredient in tortillas. Mexico is essentially self-sufficient in white corn. The country produced 22.2 million tons last year and imported about 1.1 million tons of American white corn to make up for lucrative white corn exports to South Africa and other countries, according to the Mexican government.And just as international supply chains in automobiles, aerospace and other industries crisscross the border, the same is true of agricultural products. Mexican calves \u2014 possibly fed American corn \u2014 are exported to the United States, where they are further fattened and then butchered for meat that may be exported for sale abroad, including to Mexico.Farmers and agricultural industry representatives say that American farmers are already reeling from higher production costs and declining commodity prices, and that Mr. Trump\u2019s threats on trade and immigration have injected more uncertainty.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of volatility in agricultural markets to begin with,\u201d said Barbara Patterson, government relations director of the National Farmers Union, \u201cand shutting off our borders or losing access to trading partners has farmers concerned.\u201dThe loss of Mexico as a market for agricultural products, farmers say, could presage job losses and bankruptcies.\u201cWe\u2019d like to see careful consideration and a cautious approach,\u201d Ms. Patterson said.Formal talks to renegotiate Nafta are still at least several months away. Still, corn producers, as well as their counterparts elsewhere in American agriculture, have begun to lobby elected officials and the administration.\u201cSoup to nuts: corn, dairy, meat, specialty products, fruit \u2014 they\u2019re all pretty much gathered together,\u201d said Tom Sleight, president and chief executive of the U.S. Grains Council. Producers, he said, are seeking to remind the administration of the importance of trade and Mexico to agriculture\u2019s bottom line.The administration\u2019s threats have already begun to sour longstanding business arrangements between American sellers and Mexican buyers.\u201cRelationships are getting frosty with our customers right now,\u201d Mr. Sleight said. \u201cUsually it\u2019s been a very symbiotic relationship, but recently it\u2019s gotten a little more difficult. Mexicans are saying, \u2018Why are you doing this to us? We\u2019ve been your best customers.\u2019\u201dThe Mexican government has not delayed in exploring other markets in which to purchase corn. A top agricultural official from Argentina visited Mexico City last month to discuss the possibility of increasing sales of Argentine yellow corn to Mexico. Officials from Mexico\u2019s Agriculture Ministry are planning a trip to Argentina and Brazil this month to discuss increasing corn purchases from those countries.Last month, Mexico\u2019s deputy economy minister told The Financial Times that Mexico was exploring the possibility of allowing duty-free access to Argentine and Brazilian corn imports.Developing new import arrangements with South America will not be easy, officials said. New relationships would have to be brokered, and costs to import may also be higher, officials say, in part because there are fewer established transportation routes between Mexico and the Mercosur countries of South America.Mexican officials say, however, that an increase in trade between the regions might lead to more competition, which could increase efficiency and lower costs.The showdown on Nafta has also inspired Mexican agricultural officials and producers to step up programs that would increase domestic corn production and revive a sector undercut by the agreement, said Alejandro V\u00e1zquez Salido, director of Aserca, a Mexican government agency that supports farmers and promotes the marketing of Mexican agricultural products.Mr. V\u00e1zquez said that even before Mr. Trump began to attack Nafta and Mexico, the Mexican authorities had begun to discuss plans to substitute imports with national production. \u201cBut these new challenges, these new policies that we\u2019re facing, are having us move in that direction faster than we were,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump has knocked Mexicans \u201cout of our comfort zone,\u201d forcing agriculture officials to find ways for Mexico to be less dependent on American imports, Mr. V\u00e1zquez continued. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to move where we should\u2019ve moved a long time ago: trying to produce internally what we\u2019re importing.\u201dMeredith Hoffman contributed reporting from San Antonio.Advertisement"}

Exxon Mobil shares, which have slumped so far this year, climbed 1 percent in morning trading.\u2022 The economy barely grew, expanding at an annual rate of only 0.7 percent.\u2022 The growth was a sharp decline from the 2.1 percent annual rate recorded in the final quarter of last year. It was the weakest quarterly showing in three years.\u2022 Consumption, the component reflecting individual spending, rose by only 0.3 percent, well below the 3.5 percent rate in the previous quarter.The economy\u2019s weakness reflected new caution among consumers. Other sectors like housing and business investment turned in a stronger showing, but not enough to offset factors like weaker retail sales.James E. Staley, the Barclays chief executive, offered another apology to investors on Friday about a \u201cmistake\u201d that led to an inquiry by British regulators into his treatment of a whistle-blower.Directors at Barclays have said they will formally reprimand Mr. Staley and make a \u201cvery significant compensation adjustment\u201d to his bonus after the inquiry.\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Mr. Staley said on a conference call with journalists on Friday. \u201cI was trying to protect a vulnerable colleague, but I should have left the organization to handle it. I\u2019ve accepted the judgment of the board.

The bank has reported annual losses for the past nine years, but says it expects to be profitable in 2018.A consortium of investors led by the private equity firms Hillhouse Capital and CDH Investments have offered to buy China\u2019s Belle International in a transaction that would value the shoe retailer at $6.8 billion.That represents a premium of nearly 20 percent to the company\u2019s share price before trading was halted at the company\u2019s request on April 18.Belle has suffered as China\u2019s vast and fast-growing consumer culture changes the way it shops. Increasingly, Chinese people shop online, leading to booming business for American-traded online Chinese e-commerce firms like Alibaba Group and JD.com. But like in the United States, that shift has resulted in slower traffic at brick-and-mortar stores.Advertisement"}

When one sees how these last few days have been going, it\u2019s not very reassuring.\u201dThe election on Sunday is one of the most consequential in recent times \u2014 not just for France, but for Europe \u2014 and one of the most unpredictable.Even at this late stage, a remarkable 28 percent or so of voters remained undecided. The four leading candidates span the extremes of the political spectrum and are locked in a virtual dead heat.The potential outcomes are just as broad. Depending on who wins, France could seek to leave the European Union and recast security alliances with a tilt toward Russia. Some would have France take harsher stands on Muslims, immigration and domestic security.Alternately, France may elect a president who wants to shrink the ranks of civil servants, eliminate some job protections and reduce France\u2019s generous welfare state, making the country more competitive in the global economy but risking a popular backlash. Yet another possibility: a winner who aspires to sharply increase taxes on the rich and nationalize banks.The two candidates who receive the most votes on Sunday will compete in a runoff on May 7.\u201cThere\u2019s never been a campaign where the uncertainty was so uncertain,\u201d said Edouard Lecerf, global director for political and opinion research for Kantar Public, a public opinion research firm. \u201cThe mistrust of politicians is stronger than it has ever been.\u201dThat mistrust appears to have caused many voters to veer away from traditional politicians in search of someone they feel is more principled, prompting even candidates who are insiders to claim they are \u201coutsiders.\u201dA majority of French voters have historically supported parties with established ideologies, either mainstream left or right. But traditional left-right allegiances are breaking down all over in Europe \u2014 as they appear to have in the United States \u2014 as polarization grows.With allegiances to existing parties diminishing, pollsters have found some voters torn between diametrically opposed candidates.A good example was Pierre Haux, a teacher at a technical school, who attended a rally last week in Lille of the mainstream conservative candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who is under the cloud of a nepotism scandal that has led to claims of embezzlement.Mr. Haux said he was also weighing voting for the far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, but worried that he was \u201ca one-man show.\u201dThe race\u2019s fluidity has allowed each leading candidate to claim to be on the verge of victory. At least three have been in the lead at some point, making it almost impossible to identify the front-runner.\u201cI will be in the runoff,\u201d Mr. Fillon told supporters on Thursday, though the current polls suggest that would be a reach.Most striking is how voter concerns keep shifting, from day to day and even hour to hour, resembling the impatience of adolescents. That phenomenon is one of several that pollsters said had made the race so unpredictable.In France, as elsewhere, the election may be decided in the provinces, in smaller and midsize towns and rural communities. Rural areas have proved especially unpredictable in recent votes, like Britain\u2019s so-called Brexit vote to leave the European Union and President Trump\u2019s election in the United States.In addition, the trend lines \u2014 whether a candidate appeared to be steadily gaining votes, losing them or remaining flat \u2014 underscored the race\u2019s volatility. Most recently they showed the third- and fourth-place candidates, Mr. Fillon and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, gaining, with the two in the lead, Mr. Macron followed closely by the far-right Marine Le Pen, remaining flat or losing ground.For French voters, who are facing 10 percent unemployment, with levels closer to 25 percent for young people, the most pressing issues are economic, but even those can lead in multiple directions.Some voters attribute France\u2019s economic ills to poor leadership, others to globalization and still others to an influx of immigrants.Unlike in previous years, nothing in the current election has followed old patterns.It is a clich\u00e9 of French politics that voters follow their hearts in the first round, choosing the person they most want, but follow their heads in the runoff, choosing one less likely to do damage.That equation may no longer apply. Because the race is so close, voters may try to choose strategically on Sunday and not risk an outcome in which two extremist candidates reach the final round.On the other hand, if tradition holds and voters follow their hearts, it is not impossible to foresee a final round where voters must choose between extremes, Ms. Le Pen on the right and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon on the left.Significant numbers of voters also appear likely to abstain or to cast a blank piece of paper to show their dissatisfaction. That, too, would seem to favor the nonestablishment candidates, whose supporters are more motivated to vote.One such candidate is Ms. Le Pen, whose voters are passionately convinced she is the right choice.\u201cLet\u2019s look after ourselves before we look after others,\u201d said Catherine Rigaud, 56, who was waiting in line to enter the Zenith concert hall on the northeast edge of Paris where Ms. Le Pen was speaking in the campaign\u2019s last week.Ms. Rigaud used to vote for the mainstream right but said she would now vote for Ms. Le Pen. She is unemployed and partly disabled and said that her 600 euro (about $640) monthly government support check did not cover her rent.Sebastien Orange, an art teacher who lives in Louviers, is fed up with politicians and will put a blank ballot in the voting box, he said as he watched ducks paddle in the placid Eure river that runs through town.\u201cToday, with social media, we know that more than ever they take us for idiots, with money to throw away,\u201d Mr. Orange said, referring to politicians and, obliquely, to the embezzlement charges hanging over Mr. Fillon and to accusations of financial malfeasance against Ms. Le Pen.\u201cOne forgets 1789 and why their heads were cut off,\u201d he added of France\u2019s former royalty, toppled and beheaded in the French Revolution.\u201cThey stuffed themselves, they never declared their wealth and people say nothing to them. It\u2019s just shameful,\u201d he said.More striking to pollsters is how changeable voters have been. The shooting of three police officers Thursday on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es only increased the volatility. Some voters who had been leaning toward one camp said they were now likely to cast ballots for a different candidate, one they perceived as tougher on law-and-order issues.\u201cI used to hesitate between Macron and Fillon, but no longer,\u201d said Roland Boulang\u00e9, 79, who was walking in his hometown, Rouen, a picturesque northern city, on Friday.\u201cI decided I\u2019d vote for Fillon after the attack last night,\u201d he said, choosing the more conservative of the two. \u201cMacron is too young. We need someone experienced to fight against terrorism.\u201dOf 15 people interviewed on Friday in Rouen, less than a third said they would change their vote; all had been in the somewhat-but-not-entirely-undecided camp.The major role played by social media in the campaign has added a new element to the mix even as it opened up new ways for polling companies to study voter thinking.One company, Brandeye, which is based in South Africa and works for large financial institutions, as well as candidates around the world, studies social media conversations to tabulate positive and negative words about candidates, and how frequently candidates are mentioned.The company\u2019s assessments, a \u201cnet sentiment\u201d for each candidate, differed markedly from those of traditional pollsters, but were similarly in flux. \u201cThe sentiment is very, very volatile,\u201d Nic Ray, the chief marketing officer, said.\u201cBut both Fillon and M\u00e9lenchon have more positive comments,\u201d he added, suggesting that those two could well end up in the final round.That matchup has not been discussed much, but with four leading candidates, at least six potential combinations of winners could emerge from the first round, all within the realm of possibility.Beno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting from Louviers, France, Elian Peltier from Rouen, and Pamela Rougerie from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philippines Moves to Shut Mines Accused of Polluting", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byCLAVER, Philippines \u2014 The Philippine mining town of Claver is busy with bakeries, fruit stands, pool halls and karaoke bars. In the mountains nearby, bulldozers cling to treeless slopes, scooping out red soil and leaving gaping pits. On the horizon, cargo ships wait to bring nickel ore to China.Many here are afraid that none of this will last.\u201cIf the mines go, then the jobs are gone too,\u201d said Jayson Reambonanza, 31, who drives a dump truck for one of the area\u2019s many nickel mines.In February, Gina Lopez, the acting secretary of the environment, said she was shutting down the operations of 28 of the country\u2019s 41 mining companies. Those companies, which account for about half of Philippine nickel production, have been accused of leaving rivers, rice fields and watersheds stained red with nickel laterite.On Feb. 14, she followed up by canceling 75 contracts to develop new mines, in what she called a \u201cgift of love\u201d for the Filipino people.And on Thursday, she said she would soon issue an order banning open-pit mines, calling the pollution of rivers with heavy metals \u201ca perpetual liability.\u201d\u201cIt is time for social justice,\u201d she said in announcing the initial ban in February. \u201cYou cannot run your business and affect our farmers and fishermen.\u201dThe crackdown has unnerved the mining industry; the people who depend on it have denounced the move as disastrous for the economy. They are joined in their opposition by indigenous tribes that stand to lose royalties paid by mining companies for use of their ancestral lands.Environmentalists, religious groups and others have cheered the mine closings, saying that corruption has long given the mining industry free rein to pollute. Among the supporters is the country\u2019s popular president, Rodrigo Duterte.\u201cSons of whores, look at what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Duterte said last month, addressing the mining companies. He has dismissed concerns about the potential loss of tax revenue from closed mines, saying, \u201cWe can live without it.\u201dThe costs are substantial. The government has estimated that 234,000 jobs could be lost. The mining industry says the closings would affect as many as 1.2 million people, including employees of companies that depend on the industry, like equipment suppliers.The country\u2019s annual nickel ore production would fall as much as 50 percent, Ms. Lopez has said. Such a drop, analysts said, would dent global supply by 8 percent to 10 percent. A temporary increase in world nickel prices followed Ms. Lopez\u2019s announcement in February.Many mines continue to operate while companies fight Ms. Lopez\u2019s orders in court. They are also opposing her permanent appointment as environment secretary, which Congress is expected to vote on next week. (In the Philippines, presidential appointees can run departments before they are confirmed, but they must step down if Congress votes against them.)Ms. Lopez, a former environmental activist, said that her office was rushing to finalize the ban on open-pit mines before the confirmation hearing. \u201cI am not going to take the risk of not getting it done,\u201d she said in an interview on Thursday.Government corruption has let Philippine mining companies skirt environmental regulations for decades, said Yeb Sa\u00f1o, executive director of Greenpeace for Southeast Asia. The results have included deforestation, flattened mountaintops and heavy metal contamination of water and soil, said Mr. Sa\u00f1o, who called it shortsighted to focus on the benefits brought by the mining industry.\u201cThe environmental impacts will outlive any benefit,\u201d he said.\u201cThey will outlive anyone.\u201dIn Caraga, the region that includes Claver, where a nickel-mining boom began in the 2000s, both the benefits and the damage are apparent.In the mountains surrounding the village of Barangay Magasang, an open-pit nickel mine is clearly visible, even though the village is in a watershed area, where mining is prohibited by law. Ronito Eresari, 42, a farmer in the village, said the river had been muddied with nickel laterite, making well water undrinkable and killing the freshwater mollusks that villagers once collected from the banks.The companies responsible should be put out of business, Mr. Eresari said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see them digging out our mountain,\u201d he said.Romeo Lisano, 44, sees those companies very differently. Mr. Lisano is the datu, or chief, of a 17-family tribe of Lumad Mamanwa, an indigenous ethnic group that claims the mountains of Surigao del Norte in Caraga as its ancestral domain. Many men in his tribe lost their jobs on nickel ore barges after a Claver mining operation was suspended by Ms. Lopez in August.Now the men strip rattan vines that women in the tribe weave into baskets or hammocks, to sell by the roadside along with orchids gathered by their children, Datu Lisano said. The tribe makes a fraction of what it did before, and the children have stopped going to school, he said.\u201cWe came from the forest,\u201d Datu Lisano said, referring to the tribe\u2019s hunter-gatherer past. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to the forest.\u201dThe mining companies also provide services that poor rural communities have come to rely on, like medical services, student scholarships and funding for infrastructure projects.Ms. Lopez has proposed hiring former mine workers to rehabilitate the closed sites and establish environmentally friendly industries in mining areas.The industry is regulated by the Mining and Geosciences Bureau, a division of the department now headed by Ms. Lopez. Its regional director for Caraga, Roger de Dios, denied that enforcement had been lax before the Duterte administration, saying the bureau had shut down mines before. \u201cIf there\u2019s an imminent threat to the environment, we can suspend the mines,\u201d he said.But Dr. Cielo Magno, an economist at the University of the Philippines, Diliman, who studies extractive industries, said that previous suspensions had amounted to slaps on the wrist, and that the industry had long operated with little oversight. The country has sound environmental laws, but the government\u2019s failure to ensure compliance is \u201ca huge problem,\u201d she said.Many officials in Caraga responsible for monitoring the mines own businesses that benefit from the industry, like barge companies or bars in mining towns, said Danilo Adorador, a Caraga journalist. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear conflict of interest there,\u201d he said.Claver\u2019s mayor, Eddie P. Gokiangkee, is among the industry\u2019s critics. He said he was \u201c200 percent sure\u201d that bribery and corruption had undermined enforcement of environmental laws.\u201cI know this from observation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very clear: The sea is red, the rivers are red. It shouldn\u2019t be that way if they are regulating it.\u201d He said that he welcomed the tax revenue and supported responsible mining, but that he did not want Claver left with a ravaged environment once the nickel was gone.Ronald S. Recidoro, vice president of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines, an industry lobbying group, said that any environmental infractions by mining companies had been \u201cvery minor and do not warrant a closure or suspension.\u201d He also accused Ms. Lopez of not being forthcoming about how companies were selected for shutdowns or suspensions.But activists say he has a mixed record on the environment. He signed the Paris agreement to address climate change only in March, after initially saying that he would not because it would interfere with development. He also recently approved new coal-fired power plants.In Claver, even some of those who benefit directly from the mines support Ms. Lopez\u2019s actions.A truck driver, Demetrius Orong, 27, said that if the mines closed, they would find other work. \u201cWe were fine before the mines came,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019ll be fine after they leave.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a truck driver in Claver. He is Jayson Reambonanza, not Jayson Reambonaza.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debt Crisis Shakes Chinese Town, Pointing to Wider Problems", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 In China, it\u2019s all about whom you owe.That precise question \u2014 who owes what to whom? \u2014 shook the Chinese industrial town of Zouping in recent weeks. Some businesses closed. City officials engineered a desperate corporate takeover. An executive was detained by the police.The problem: Local companies had agreed to guarantee hundreds of millions of dollars of one another\u2019s loans. When some of those loans went bad, the impact rippled across the city.Zouping\u2019s plight offers a sobering example of the problems that could lurk within China\u2019s vast and murky debt load. A nearly decade-long Chinese lending spree drove growth but burdened the economy with one of the world\u2019s heaviest debt loads, equal to $21,600 worth of bank loans, bonds and other obligations for every man, woman and child in the country. Debt in China has expanded twice as fast as the overall economy since 2008.China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States, has considerable firepower to address any financial crisis. But many economists worry that hidden debt bombs could expose the breadth and severity of the problem.The Chinese government has begun an urgent effort to discourage companies from guaranteeing one another\u2019s bank debts, ordering local banking regulators across the country to file comprehensive reports by the end of the month on the problem. But sussing out the extent could be difficult.\u201cBecause of the limited transparency and disclosure,\u201d said Grace Wu, a senior director and the head of China bank ratings at Fitch Ratings, \u201cit\u2019s hard to know where the true risk lies.\u201dChinese economists have consistently argued that their country is uniquely able to handle high debt because it has little foreign debt and because the government\u2019s control of the banking system allows it to respond quickly.One of the paradoxes of China\u2019s debt troubles is that the country is awash in debt, yet publicly listed or privately held companies can find it hard to borrow. The state-controlled banking system lends mainly to state-owned enterprises, which can seem like a good credit risk because they have implicit government guarantees.In response, private companies often band together, guaranteeing one another\u2019s borrowings, to give bank credit officers more confidence that loans will be repaid. The downside is that if one company runs into trouble, it can drag down the other companies that guaranteed its debts. Those other companies, in turn, can set off their own credit guarantees from yet more companies with no direct connection to the first one.A government-controlled website that releases financial regulatory decisions said at the end of last week that the China Banking Regulatory Commission had asked its branches to examine loan guarantees across the nation immediately because of problems in places like Shandong province, where Zouping is.The commission has instructed its local regulators to pay particular attention to loan guarantees in sectors like aluminum production and steel manufacturing, the website said, highlighting two industries suffering from overcapacity in China. Both industries overinvested in new factories by obtaining enormous loans at low interest rates from the state-controlled banking system.\u201cIt\u2019s a national issue for us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not an issue bounded by geography.\u201dZouping\u2019s problems have their roots in a company called the Qixing Group. The conglomerate started off in aluminum but diversified into real estate and other sectors. When it declared last month that it had financial problems, that called into doubt the loans that others had guaranteed.That led to a messy and acrimonious scramble for control of factories and other assets and a temporary shutdown at some of Qixing\u2019s businesses. The local government ended up orchestrating a takeover of Qixing by its local rival, the Xiwang Group. When Qixing\u2019s executive vice president, Zhao Qiang, strongly complained two weeks ago, he was promptly detained by the police.\u201cXiwang has always wanted to merge with us,\u201d said Li Zemin, a spokesman for Qixing, \u201cbut the appearance of their devouring us is bad.\u201d Mr. Zhao has just been released by the police, Mr. Li added.A stock market filing by Xiwang this month offered a glimpse of the extent of the problem. Xiwang said that it had previously guaranteed $421 million worth of Qixing\u2019s debt, though it had obtained collateral.Wang Yuanyuan, a corporate planner for Xiwang, said that the company had paid Qixing\u2019s employees for their most recent month of back wages and reopened Qixing\u2019s main aluminum operations. She added that the workers were still owed many previous months of back wages.Zeng Libin, the president of the China Aluminum Association, said that Qixing made only low- or midlevel aluminum products, and brought its problems on itself.\u201cThe problem Qixing faced is quite common in China,\u201d Mr. Zeng said. \u201cQixing expanded blindly.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsherAilin Tang and Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canadian VW Dealers Move Diesels Out of Storage and Into Showrooms", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 Volkswagen dealers in Canada have quietly resumed selling diesel cars that they had been holding in inventory since the company\u2019s emissions-cheating scandal erupted in 2015.The Vancouver dealer and others did not respond to requests for comment.Higher fuel prices in Canada, largely because of taxes, had made diesel engines relatively popular in the country. Before the emissions scandal, diesels once accounted for about a quarter of the sales of some Volkswagen models in Canada, particularly the Golf.In September 2015, in what it said was a voluntary move, Volkswagen Canada halted sales of new and used vehicles that used the emissions-cheating software and said the matter was being investigated by Environment Canada, the federal regulator. That investigation is continuing.The combination of the scandal surrounding the carmaker\u2019s diesel vehicles and the subsequent improvements to some models, particularly the Golf, means that the cars that had been kept off dealership floors are being heavily discounted. The dealer in Vancouver was offering discounts of 9,500 Canadian dollars (about $7,000) for cash sales and 7,500 Canadian dollars, plus zero percent interest rates, for customers seeking financing.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely taking a risk, no question,\u201d said Jake Fisher, the director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, about buying a Volkswagen diesel today. \u201cThe question is: How are these cars performing after the fix?\u201dHowever, it added that it did \u201cnot expect any significant changes in fuel consumption or driving characteristics.\u201dMr. Fisher said that cars with the emissions-control fix would need to be tested to determine whether Volkswagen\u2019s assessment was correct. But he said he was sure there would be differences after the repairs, and perhaps not for the better. The new equipment and software could also reduce the longevity of engines, he said.\u201cIf they had the ability through software to make these engines comply with emissions rules, they would have done that in the first place, so obviously there will be differences,\u201d Mr. Fisher said.Volkswagen settled class-action lawsuits in Ontario and Quebec on Friday, involving owners nationwide, affecting about 105,000 Volkswagens and Audis with the 2.0-liter diesel engine made from 2009 to 2015; the company also said it would offer owners cash payments and other remedies, including repair or repurchase. Earlier, lawyers involved in the litigation estimated the cost of the settlement at 2.1 billion Canadian dollars.In a statement, the company said that the settlement \u201cis not an admission of liability by Volkswagen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "(It\u2019s Great to) Suck at Something", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported bySportingOver the past 15 years, surfing has become a kind of obsession for me. I surf eight months a year. I travel to surf destinations for family vacations and seek (forgiving) waves in the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. I have spent thousands of dollars on boards of all sizes and shapes.And yet \u2014 I suck at it. In the sport of (Hawaiian) kings, I\u2019m a jester. In surfing parlance, a \u201ckook.\u201d I fall and flail. I get hit on the head by my own board. I run out of breath when held down by a four-foot wave. I wimp out when the waves get overhead and I paddle back to shore. When I do catch a wave, I\u2019m rarely graceful. On those rare occasions when I manage a decent drop, turn and trim, I usually blow it by celebrating with a fist pump or a hoot.Once, I actually cried tears of joy over what any observer would have thought a so-so performance on a so-so wave. Yes, I was moved to tears by mediocrity.So why continue? Why pursue something I\u2019ll never be good at?Because it\u2019s great to suck at something.When people hear that I surf, I get a knowing nod of awesomeness from the terra firma-bound. I know what they\u2019re picturing: me on a thruster, carving up and down a wave face until I casually kick out the back to paddle out to the line up for another. The truth is that most surfers don\u2019t come close to what we see in highlight videos. But pretty\u2019s not the point. The point is the patience and perseverance it requires to get back on the board and try again. After a surf instructor pushed me into my first wave, it took me five years to catch one on my own.My friend Andy Martin is a Cambridge don of French literature. He has surfed the world over. But about his status as a surfer, he tells me, \u201cI am called a surfer only at Cambridge.\u201d In his mind, he sucks, but he\u2019s O.K. with that. That being O.K. is the humility that comes only with sucking and persevering.The notion of sucking at something flies in the face of the overhyped notion of perfectionism. The lie of perfectionism goes something like this: \u201cIf I fail, it\u2019s only because I seek perfection.\u201d Or \u201cI can never finish anything because I\u2019m a perfectionist.\u201d Since the perfectionist will settle for nothing less, she is left with nothing.Self-knowledge here is key. No one ever tells you how much you suck at something. Unless you have a mean boss, an abusive parent or a malicious friend, most people are happy to help us maintain the delusion that our efforts are not in vain. No, we cannot count on people around us to let us know how much we suck. It is far more acceptable to compliment than to criticize. So the onus is on us as individuals to admit to ourselves how much we suck at something. And then do it anyway.By taking off the pressure of having to excel at or master an activity, we allow ourselves to live in the moment. You might think this sounds simple enough, but living in the present is also something most of us suck at.Think about how focused you become when you\u2019re presented with something totally new to accomplish. Now, what happens when that task is no longer new but still taps into intense focus because we haven\u2019t yet mastered it? You\u2019re a novice, an amateur, a kook. You suck at it. Some might think your persistence moronic. I like to think of it as meditative and full of promise. In the words of the Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki, \u201cIn the beginner\u2019s mind there are many possibilities; in the expert\u2019s mind, there are few.\u201d When I surf, I live in the possibility.Or, as the great father of surfing, Duke Kahanamoku, wisely advised: \u201cBe patient. Wave come. Wave always come.\u201dBut, then what\u2019s going to happen?Maybe sucking at something where the stakes are low can lead us to a better place. Maybe it could be a kind of a medicine for the epidemic cocksureness in our culture. Seeing ourselves repeatedly doing something we suck at \u2014 no matter how trivial \u2014 might make us a bit more sympathetic to how hard so many things really are: trying to navigate health issues, listening to our neighbors, improving the economy or mitigating relations with hostile nations.By exposing ourselves to the experience of trying and failing we might develop more empathy. If we succeed in shifting from snap judgments to patience, maybe we could be a little more helpful to one another \u2014 and a whole lot more understanding.If we accept our failures and persevere nonetheless, we might provide a respite from the imperative to succeed and instead find acceptance in trying. Failing is O.K. Better still, isn\u2019t it a relief?There\u2019ll always be another chance. And another after that, trust me. Be patient. Waves come. Waves always come.Do you suck at something?

Still, coal\u2019s long-term outlook is poor, less because of environmental regulations than market forces, including competition from natural gas and increasingly cost-effective renewable sources.

We are, by now, the establishment \u2014 the senators, governors, think-tank presidents and columnists who, until Mr. Trump came along, got to define what \u201cRepublican\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d meant. My cohort simply cannot accept that Mr. Trump has taken away that coveted role and revolutionized not just our party, but also the very terms of the American political divide.But we need to. Because as Mr. Trump recognized, the new schism in American life is not about big versus small government, or more or less regulation. It is about immigration, free trade and the broad and deep impacts of globalization on America\u2019s economy and culture. \u201cAmericanism, not globalism, will be our credo,\u201d he told the Republican National Convention.It is obvious to all but the most blinkered Republicans that with or without Mr. Trump, the Reagan era is over. The conservative-donor and think-tank consensus has been exploded. The next smart, ambitious young Republican politician with national aspirations will not adopt Ted Cruz\u2019s strategy of trying to revive the rotting flesh of Reaganism. He will read out of Mr. Trump\u2019s playbook, attacking globalism rather than big government. And he\u2019ll win, because he\u2019ll be talking about what worries voters.When William F. Buckley founded National Review in 1955, he argued that individual freedom needed to be protected from liberalism\u2019s drift toward collectivism. Mr. Reagan\u2019s vigorous anti-Communism put this into practice, as did his support of deregulation and tax cuts to promote economic freedom. My generation of conservatives inherited this framework.Over time, however, that iteration of Republican conservatism became less salient, in large part because it won. In 1989 we saw the fall of the Berlin Wall. Soon after, Bill Clinton declared that the era of big government was over. Barack Obama bailed out Wall Street, promoted the further extension of free trade and was a cheerleader for Silicon Valley billionaires. By 2016, only a thoroughly catechized conservative believed Democrats were strangling economic freedom. Democrats have also assumed a large piece of the libertarian mantle, especially when it comes to sexuality and drugs.Meanwhile, the Republican Party stood still. True, the positions Mr. Buckley outlined over the years were supple enough, but their advocates were not: Their unthinking and increasingly ritualized loyalty to that phase of conservatism led the Republican establishment into political irrelevance, as Mr. Trump\u2019s takeover of the party so brutally revealed. Given a clear, brash alternative, the Republican base tossed aside the orthodoxies of Reaganism.Most commentators struggle to explain Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral success, because they assume he has no coherent political philosophy. This is myopic. As a public figure, Mr. Trump has articulated a consistent message that speaks to a fundamental political challenge facing the 21st-century West: We must affirm nationalism and fight globalism.This basic political message is dramatized by his populist rhetoric. At his campaign rallies he did not get cheers for denouncing government waste or championing tax cuts. His applause lines spoke of building a wall, deporting illegal immigrants, renegotiating trade deals and bringing back jobs. The America First, antiglobalist themes won him the election, not freedom-oriented, anti-government ones.I\u2019m not surprised. Both parties \u2014 but not the average American voter \u2014 have been moving in a globalist direction for years. In his 2013 Inaugural Address, President Obama championed the qualities of innovation and mobility that will allow our nation to thrive in \u201cthis world without boundaries.\u201d He was not proposing to eliminate passports, but he was expressing a sentiment that regards borders, limits and boundaries as necessary but regrettable, while openness and diversity are inherent goods.This way of thinking is everywhere, which makes it seem like common sense, rather than a political choice. Woodrow Wilson formulated Princeton\u2019s informal motto: \u201cPrinceton in the nation\u2019s service.\u201d In 1996 it was extended to include \u201cand in the service of all nations,\u201d and then recently revised to read \u201cPrinceton in the nation\u2019s service and the service of humanity.\u201d Undoubtedly, administrators thought they were adapting to new global realities, rather than taking a controversial stance.The same goes for Stanford\u2019s president, John Hennessy, who raised $750 million to fund a new program to gather \u201cthe world\u2019s brightest minds\u201d who can work \u201ctoward solving global challenges.\u201d Isn\u2019t this an admirable, sensible and responsible adaptation to the direction things are going?In contrast, Mr. Trump does not presume that the world must become flat. His Inaugural Address contrasted sharply with Mr. Obama\u2019s 2013 speech. He spoke of renewing borders and solidarity, and called for national reconsolidation. This does not mean putting a stop to global trade or shutting down immigration, any more than Mr. Obama meant to bargain away American sovereignty or \u201cdestroy America,\u201d as some conservative pundits insisted during his administration. But these two speeches, only four years apart, reflect a stark difference in emphasis. What Mr. Obama presented as a happy evolution Mr. Trump frames as something to be resisted. As he said in his recent address to the joint session of Congress: \u201cMy job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s shocking success at the polls has done our country a service. Scholars may tut-tut about the historical connotations of \u201cAmerica First,\u201d but the basic sentiment needs to be endorsed. Our country has dissolved to a far greater degree than those cloistered on the coasts allow themselves to realize. The once vast and unifying middle class has eroded over the last generation. Today we are increasingly divided into winners and losers. This division involves more than divergent economic prospects and income inequality. Globalism is an ideology of winners who stand astride our society as it is being remade by dramatic economic, demographic and cultural changes.Mitt Romney wrote off nearly half the American population as \u201ctakers.\u201d Hillary Clinton made her notorious remarks about \u201cdeplorables.\u201d These sentiments, widely shared by elites on the right and left, have become toxic. Caterpillar recently announced it is moving its corporate headquarters from Peoria, Ill., to Chicago. The unspoken reason? \u201cC-suite level\u201d talent bridles at relocating to flyover country. In today\u2019s America, the rich, well-educated and globalized people on top, whether Republicans or Democrats, do not want to live among those who populate our country. The leaders increasingly hold them in disdain.After World War II, Mr. Buckley adopted an exaggerated approach to postwar American liberalism (which was hardly inclined toward socialism) because he thought the stakes were high. We face different dangers. In 2017, a growing economic divide and continuing cultural fragmentation, and even animosity, are grave threats that now define our politics. The Cold War is now domestic. Easy talk about the world becoming flat or global trade lifting all boats disguises, explains away and exacerbates the damage being done to the body politic. Mr. Trump\u2019s stark juxtaposition of globalism and Americanism is crude and hyperbolic, but necessarily so.The generation of conservatives tutored by Mr. Buckley\u2019s polemics against collectivism developed a healthy skepticism of big government. But they did not dismantle the modern welfare state; instead, they sought to limit its excesses and reduce long-term dependency. In the same spirit, rejecting globalism need not entail renouncing America\u2019s role as leader of the international order or attacking global trade.Rather, we need to become much more skeptical of post-national ways of thinking. For too long a globalist utopianism \u2014 Mr. Obama\u2019s happy, peaceful and inclusive world without boundaries \u2014 has tempted us to neglect one of the fundamental tasks of political leadership, which is to promote the kind of national solidarity that binds a country\u2019s leaders to its people.Globalism poses a threat to the future of democracy because it disenfranchises the vast majority and empowers a technocratic elite. It\u2019s a telling paradox that the most ardent supporters of a \u201cborderless world\u201d live in gated communities and channel their children toward a narrow set of elite educational institutions with stiff admissions standards that do the work of \u201cborder control.\u201d The airport executive lounges are not open and inclusive.John Q. Public is not stupid. He senses that he no longer counts. And he resents the condescension of globalist elites, which is why Mr. Trump\u2019s regular transgressions against elite-enforced political correctness evoke glee from his supporters.After Auschwitz, nationalism inevitably frightens many. I prefer to speak of patriotic solidarity, or a renewed national covenant. Whatever we call the antithesis to utopian globalism, it need not mean wholesale endorsement of Mr. Trump\u2019s harshest rhetoric, which is often narrow and inarticulate. There\u2019s a great deal more to our country than he allows, including traditions of secular and religious universalism that make the idealistic internationalism Mr. Obama sometimes articulated paradoxically very American. Nevertheless, we\u2019ve tilted too strongly in the globalist direction. In our divided country, conservatism \u2014 and liberalism as well \u2014 needs to lean in the direction of nationalism.For many in the conservative camp, this seems unnecessary, even irresponsible. They think Mr. Trump has betrayed the movement Mr. Buckley shaped. We need to remember, however, that the Cold War gave drama and relevance to Mr. Buckley\u2019s way of framing our fundamental political commitments. But the Soviet Union collapsed a generation ago. Our commitments must be made against a different horizon.R. R. Reno is the editor of First Things.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Don\u2019t All Jobs Matter?", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported bySo will the Trump administration ever do anything substantive to bring back mining and manufacturing jobs? Probably not.But let me ask a different question: Why does public discussion of job loss focus so intensely on mining and manufacturing, while virtually ignoring the big declines in some service sectors?And retailing isn\u2019t the only service industry that has been hit hard by changing technology. Another prime example is newspaper publishing, where employment has declined by 270,000, almost two-thirds of the work force, since 2000.So why aren\u2019t promises to save service jobs as much a staple of political posturing as promises to save mining and manufacturing jobs?One answer might be that mines and factories sometimes act as anchors of local economies, so that their closing can devastate a community in a way shutting a retail outlet won\u2019t. And there\u2019s something to that argument.But it\u2019s not the whole truth. Closing a factory is just one way to undermine a local community. Competition from superstores and shopping malls also devastated many small-city downtowns; now many small-town malls are failing too. And we shouldn\u2019t minimize the extent to which the long decline of small newspapers has eroded the sense of local identity.A different, less creditable reason mining and manufacturing have become political footballs, while services haven\u2019t, involves the need for villains. Demagogues can tell coal miners that liberals took away their jobs with environmental regulations. They can tell industrial workers that their jobs were taken away by nasty foreigners. And they can promise to bring the jobs back by making America polluted again, by getting tough on trade, and so on. These are false promises, but they play well with some audiences.By contrast, it\u2019s really hard to blame either liberals or foreigners for, say, the decline of Sears. (The chain\u2019s asset-stripping, Ayn Rand-loving owner is another story, but one that probably doesn\u2019t resonate in the heartland.)Anyway, whatever the reasons that political narratives tend to privilege some jobs and some industries over others, it\u2019s a tendency we should fight. Laid-off retail workers and local reporters are just as much victims of economic change as laid-off coal miners.While we can\u2019t stop job losses from happening, we can limit the human damage when they do happen. We can guarantee health care and adequate retirement income for all. We can provide aid to the newly unemployed. And we can act to keep the overall economy strong \u2014 which means doing things like investing in infrastructure and education, not cutting taxes on rich people and hoping the benefits trickle down.I don\u2019t want to sound unsympathetic to miners and industrial workers. Yes, their jobs matter. But all jobs matter. And while we can\u2019t ensure that any particular job endures, we can and should ensure that a decent life endures even when a job doesn\u2019t.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Job Growth Loses Steam as U.S. Adds 98,000 in March", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byLooking for a Trump bump in the economy? Keep waiting.After two months of stellar job creation that convinced administration officials that President Trump\u2019s policies were paying off immediately, employers pulled back sharply on hiring in March.The economy added 98,000 jobs, the Labor Department reported Friday, fewer than half the monthly number for January and February.The report contained some notable good news: The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, the lowest level in almost a decade and a milestone in the long road back from the Great Recession. The rate was 4.7 percent in February. Wages also continued to rise.But the disappointing number of new jobs was jarring for the administration, and well below what economists had expected. It comes as the stock market surge, which followed the November election, subsides and amid signs that economic growth in the year\u2019s first quarter proves weak.Economic perceptions, as well, may not be playing out in reality. Sentiment among consumers and businesses rose after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, but so far, it has not been matched by a comparable increase in spending by either group.\u201cWe\u2019ve given up on waiting for hard data to improve,\u201d said Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays. \u201cIt\u2019s been five months since confidence increased. If consumption were going to improve, it would have already.\u201dIndustries that Mr. Trump emphasized in his campaign \u2014 particularly manufacturing \u2014 continued to add jobs last month, but at a slower pace. Payrolls in the retail sector, meanwhile, declined further, shedding tens of thousands of jobs.The response from the White House, which crowed last month after more than 200,000 jobs were produced in Mr. Trump\u2019s first full month in office, was muted Friday.Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive who is director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, emphasized the decline in the unemployment rate. \u201cWhen you look at the jobs report as a whole, I think there\u2019s an awful lot of good news in here,\u201d he told Fox Business Network. Congressional Democrats took a dimmer view.Also watching closely are the policy makers of the Federal Reserve, which has begun to reel in its post-recession stimulus. It raised interest rates last month and said it planned to do so twice more this year. But signs of a sluggish economy could affect how quickly the central bank moves.\u201cThis raises the stakes for the April report,\u201d said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a research firm. \u201cYou need to see things pick up in April, or else March won\u2019t look like aberration.\u201dThe market reaction, in any case, was sanguine, with stocks essentially flat for the day.Barclays has said it expects the economy to actually slow in the first half of 2017, before rebounding modestly in the second half. \u201cGiven this data today, we see downside risk in our already soft expectations for the first half,\u201d Mr. Martin said.The consensus view on Wall Street is that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 1 percent last quarter, with the pace of growth in the current second quarter rising to 3.5 percent.The March report represents a snapshot of the economy, not an oil painting. And snow and cold weather in many parts of the country clearly took a toll on the construction sector, which barely grew after gaining a total of more than 90,000 jobs in January and February.\u201cJanuary and February were abnormally warm, so they were pumped up, and you had some payback in March exacerbated by the harsh weather,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said.On Capitol Hill, Republicans acknowledged a glass-half-full view of the report. \u201cThe economy clearly should be generating higher job growth,\u201d said Representative Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. \u201cHowever, the unemployment rate fell to the lowest rate since before the recession.\u201dThe top Democrat on the committee, Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, ignored the new jobless rate and focused instead on the disappointing payroll gain.\u201cToday\u2019s jobs numbers show there are still challenges ahead that this administration must address,\u201d Mr. Heinrich said. \u201cPresident Trump promised that he would be \u2018the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.\u2019 Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee will hold him to this promise.\u201dPart of the problem for the administration is that its legislative accomplishments in the first hundred days are falling far short of the expectations \u2014 notably, for tax cuts and infrastructure spending \u2014 since the election.Whether or not they support Mr. Trump, mainstream economists say it will take many months for policy shifts in Washington to move a battleship-like economy with 153 million workers.What is more, the tepid numbers for March mask pockets of strength. For example, a few white-collar sectors like professional and business services are holding up well, adding 56,000 jobs last month.Hyland, a business software designer in Westlake, Ohio, plans to hire at least 300 people this year, Bill Priemer, its chief executive, said. That is a 15 percent increase in head count at the company, and it is a sign of just how quickly demand is growing for new technologies like content management, one of Hyland\u2019s specialties.\u201cWe are growing faster than the economy and the enterprise software sector overall,\u201d Mr. Priemer said. \u201cDigital transformation is a big buzzword, but it\u2019s just fancy terminology to describe how business can use technology to streamline their operations.\u201dOn the other hand, new technologies are upending venerable industries like retailing, as consumers shift to shopping online and department stores close. The retail sector lost almost 30,000 jobs last month, after a decline of about 31,000 in February.The headline numbers for hiring and the unemployment rate are derived from separate surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one of establishments, the other of households. Although the two tends to converge over time, they can vary widely from month to month, and March was one of those times.So while businesses showed an anemic gain of 98,000 jobs in terms of payrolls, households reported a 472,000 increase in employment, without any fall in labor participation. That explains why the unemployment rate could fall by 0.2 of a percentage point, even as the number for job creation was far short of expectations.\u201cI think the headline number was clearly impacted by the weather,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But at some point she said, rosy economic expectations are likely to catch up with a more sober reality.\u201cSentiment surveys moved sharply higher after the election on expectations of pro-business policies and tax reform,\u201d she added. \u201cSo far, that hasn\u2019t happened, and the big question is whether confidence can remain as strong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Economy Grows, North Korea\u2019s Grip on Society Is Tested", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Despite decades of sanctions and international isolation, the economy in North Korea is showing surprising signs of life.Scores of marketplaces have opened in cities across the country since the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, took power five years ago. A growing class of merchants and entrepreneurs is thriving under the protection of ruling party officials. Pyongyang, the capital, has seen a construction boom, and there are now enough cars on its once-empty streets for some residents to make a living washing them.Reliable economic data is scarce. But recent defectors, regular visitors and economists who study the country say nascent market forces are beginning to reshape North Korea \u2014 a development that complicates efforts to curb Mr. Kim\u2019s nuclear ambitions.Even as President Trump bets on tougher sanctions, especially by China, to stop the North from developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of striking the United States, the country\u2019s improving economic health has made it easier for it to withstand such pressure and to acquire funds for its nuclear program.While North Korea remains deeply impoverished, estimates of annual growth under Mr. Kim\u2019s rule range from 1 percent to 5 percent, comparable to some fast-growing economies unencumbered by sanctions.But a limited embrace of market forces in what is supposed to be a classless society also is a gamble for Mr. Kim, who in 2013 made economic growth a top policy goal on par with the development of a nuclear arsenal.Mr. Kim, 33, has promised his long-suffering people that they will never have to \u201ctighten their belts\u201d again. But as he allows private enterprise to expand, he undermines the government\u2019s central argument of socialist superiority over South Korea\u2019s capitalist system.There are already signs that market forces are weakening the government\u2019s grip on society. Information is seeping in along with foreign goods, eroding the cult of personality surrounding Mr. Kim and his family. And as people support themselves and get what they need outside the state economy, they are less beholden to the authorities.\u201cOur attitude toward the government was this: If you can\u2019t feed us, leave us alone so we can make a living through the market,\u201d said Kim Jin-hee, who fled North Korea in 2014 and, like others interviewed for this article, uses a new name in the South to protect relatives she left behind.After the government tried to clamp down on markets in 2009, she recalled, \u201cI lost what little loyalty I had for the regime.\u201dKim Jin-hee\u2019s loyalty was first tested in the 1990s, when a famine caused by floods, drought and the loss of Soviet aid gripped North Korea. The government stopped providing food rations, and as many as two million people died.Ms. Kim did what many others did to survive. She stopped showing up for her state job, at a machine-tool factory in the mining town of Musan, and spent her days at a makeshift market selling anything she could get her hands on. Similar markets appeared across the country.After the food shortage eased, the market in Musan continued to grow. By the time she left the country, Ms. Kim said, more than 1,000 stalls were squeezed into it alongside her own.Kim Jong-il, the father of the North\u2019s current leader, had been ambivalent about the marketplaces before he died in 2011. Sometimes he tolerated them, using them to increase food supplies and soften the blow of tightening sanctions imposed by the United Nations on top of an American embargo dating to the Korean War. Other times, he sought to suppress them.But since 2010, the number of government-approved markets in North Korea has doubled to 440, and satellite images show them growing in size in most cities. In a country with a population of 25 million, about 1.1 million people are now employed as retailers or managers in these markets, according to a study by the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.Unofficial market activity has flourished, too: people making and selling shoes, clothing, sweets and bread from their homes; traditional agricultural markets that appear in rural towns every 10 days; smugglers who peddle black-market goods like Hollywood movies, South Korean television dramas and smartphones that can be used near the Chinese border.At least 40 percent of the population in North Korea is now engaged in some form of private enterprise, a level comparable to that of Hungary and Poland shortly after the fall of the Soviet bloc, the director of South Korea\u2019s intelligence service, Lee Byung-ho, told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing in February.This market activity is driven in part by frustration with the state\u2019s inefficient and rigid planned economy. North Koreans once worked only in state farms and factories, receiving salaries and ration coupons to buy food and other necessities in state stores. But that system crumbled in the 1990s, and now many state workers earn barely a dollar a month. Economists estimate the cost of living in North Korea to be $60 per month.\u201cIf you are an ordinary North Korean today, and if you don\u2019t make money through markets, you are likely to die of hunger,\u201d said Kim Nam-chol, 46, a defector from Hoeryong, a town near the Chinese border. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple.\u201dBefore fleeing in 2014, Mr. Kim survived as a smuggler in North Korea. He bought goods such as dried seafood, ginseng, antiques and even methamphetamine, and he carried them across the border to sell in China. There, he used his earnings to buy grain, saccharin, socks and plastic bags and took it back to sell in North Korean markets.He said he had paid off border guards and security officers to slip back and forth, often by offering them cigarette packs stuffed with rolled-up $100 or 10,000-yen bills.\u201cI came to believe I could get away with anything in North Korea with bribes,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept the crime of criticizing the ruling Kim family.\u201dEighty percent of consumer goods sold in North Korean markets originate in China, according to an estimate by Kim Young-hee, director of the North Korean economy department at the Korea Development Bank in the South.But Kim Jong-un has exhorted the country to produce more goods locally in an effort to lessen its dependence on China, using the word jagang, or self-empowerment. His call has emboldened manufacturers to respond to market demand.Shoes, liquor, cigarettes, socks, sweets, cooking oil, cosmetics and noodles produced in North Korea have already squeezed out or taken market share from Chinese-made versions, defectors said.Regular visitors to Pyongyang, the showcase capital, say a real consumer economy is emerging. \u201cCompetition is everywhere, including between travel agencies, taxi companies and restaurants,\u201d R\u00fcdiger Frank, an economist at the University of Vienna who studies the North, wrote recently after visiting a shopping center there.A cellphone service launched in 2008 has more than three million subscribers. With the state still struggling to produce electricity, imported solar panels have become a middle-class status symbol. And on sale at some grocery stores and informal markets on the side streets of Pyongyang is a beverage that state propaganda used to condemn as \u201ccesspool water of capitalism\u201d \u2014 Coca-Cola.When Kim Jong-un stood on a balcony reviewing a parade in April, he was flanked by Hwang Pyong-so, the head of the military, and Pak Pong-ju, the premier in charge of the economy.The formation was symbolic of Mr. Kim\u2019s byungjin policy, which calls for the parallel pursuit of two policy goals: developing the economy and building nuclear weapons. Only a nuclear arsenal, Mr. Kim argues, will make North Korea secure from American invasion and let it focus on growth.Mr. Kim has granted state factories more autonomy over what they produce, including authority to find their own suppliers and customers, as long as they hit revenue targets. And families in collective farms are now assigned to individual plots called pojeon. Once they meet a state quota, they can keep and sell any surplus on their own.The measures resemble those adopted by China in the early years of its turn to capitalism in the 1980s. But North Korea has refrained from describing them as market-oriented reforms, preferring the phrase \u201ceconomic management in our own style.\u201dIn state-censored journals, though, economists are already publishing papers describing consumer-oriented markets, joint ventures and special economic zones.It is unclear how much of recent increases in grain production were due to Mr. Kim\u2019s policies. Defectors say factories remain hobbled by electricity shortages and decrepit machinery while many farmers have struggled to meet state quotas because they lack fertilizer and modern equipment.More broadly, the economy remains constrained by limited foreign investment and the lack of legal protections for private enterprise or procedures for contract enforcement.Plans to set up special economic zones have remained only plans, as investors have balked at North Korea\u2019s poor infrastructure and record of seizing assets from foreigners, not to mention the sanctions against it.But there is evidence that the state is growing increasingly dependent on the private sector.Cha Moon-seok, a researcher at the Institute for Unification Education of South Korea, estimates that the government collects as much as $222,000 per day in taxes from the marketplaces it manages. In March, the authorities reportedly ordered people selling goods from their homes to move into formal marketplaces in an effort to collect even more.\u201cOfficials need the markets as much as the people need them,\u201d said Kim Jeong-ae, a journalist in Seoul who worked as a propagandist in North Korea before defecting.Ms. Kim fled North Korea in 2003 but has kept in touch with a younger brother there whom she describes as a donju, or money owner.Donju is the word North Koreans use to describe the new class of traders and businessmen that has emerged.Kim Jeong-ae said that her brother provided fuel, food and crew members for fishing boats, and that he split the catch with a military-run fishing company.\u201cHe lives in a large house with tall walls,\u201d she added, \u201cso other people can\u2019t see what he has there.\u201dCalled \u201cred capitalists\u201d by South Korean scholars, donju invest in construction projects, establish partnerships with resource-strapped state factories and bankroll imports from China to supply retailers in the marketplaces. They operate with \u201ccovers,\u201d or party officials who protect their businesses. Some are relatives of party officials.Others are ethnic Chinese citizens, who are allowed regular visits to China and can facilitate cross-border financial transactions, and people with relatives who have fled to South Korea and send them cash remittances.Whenever the state begins a big project, like the new district of high-rise apartment buildings that Kim Jong-un unveiled before foreign journalists in April, donju are expected to make \u201cloyalty donations.\u201d Sometimes they pay in foreign currency. Sometimes they contribute building materials, fuel or food for construction workers.\u201cKim Jong-un is no fool,\u201d said Kang Mi-jin, a defector who once ran her own wholesale business. \u201cHe knows where the money is.\u201dDonju often receive medals and certificates in return for their donations, and use them to signal they are protected as they engage in business activities that are officially illegal.They import buses and trucks and run their own transportation services using license plates obtained from state companies. Some donju even rent farmland and mines, working them with their own employees and equipment, or open private pharmacies, defectors said.\u201cDonju wear the socialist hide, operating as part of state-run companies,\u201d Ms. Kang said. \u201cBut inside, they are thoroughly capitalist.\u201dBefore Kim Jong-un took power, the government made a last attempt to rein in donju and control market forces. It called on citizens to shop only in state stores, banned the use of foreign currency and adopted new bank notes while limiting the amount of old notes that individuals could exchange.The move wiped out much of the private wealth created and saved by both donju and ordinary people. Market activity ground to a near halt. Prices skyrocketed, and protests were reported in scattered cities.The government eventually retreated and is believed to have issued an apology when officials convened villagers for their weekly education sessions. It also executed the country\u2019s top monetary official, Pak Nam-gi.The crisis is widely considered the moment when the government concluded it could no longer suppress the markets. A year later, Pak Pong-ju, a former prime minister who had been ousted for pushing market-oriented policies, was restored to power. He now manages the economy under Mr. Kim.As the markets develop, growing numbers of North Koreans will see the vastly superior products made overseas and perhaps question their nation\u2019s backward status.\u201cThanks to the market, few North Koreans these days flee for food, as refugees in the 1990s did,\u201d said the Rev. Kim Seung-eun, a pastor who has helped hundreds of defectors reach South Korea. \u201cInstead, they now flee to South Korea to have a better life they learned through the markets.\u201dJung Gwang-il, who leads a defectors\u2019 group in Seoul called No Chain, said that with more North Koreans getting what they needed from markets rather than the state, their view of Mr. Kim was changing.\u201cNorth Koreans always called Kim Jong-un\u2019s grandfather and father \u2018the Great Leader\u2019 or \u2018the General,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jung said. \u201cNow, when they talk among themselves, many just call Jong-un \u2018the Kid.\u2019 They fear him but have no respect for him.\u201d\u201cThey say, \u2018What has he done for us?\u2019\u201d Mr. Jung said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Offshore Money, Bane of Democracy", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorGreedy rulers around the world steal billions from their people, then disguise the money and stash it offshore, usually in the West. The extraction of this much capital cripples the economies of source countries like Afghanistan, Nigeria or Ukraine, and breeds insecurity and violence there. Offshoring is also a problem for host states. If a government doesn\u2019t know who owns the country it runs, how can it know how those owners will behave in a crisis?It wasn\u2019t supposed to work this way. At the end of World War II, the Allies decided to build an international financial system that would safeguard their victory. Central to their plan were restrictions on the streams of hot money that had so unsettled the world between the two wars. Because these governments prioritized global stability over return on investment, they would control how investment moved between countries.Investors in the new bonds were primarily tax-dodging Westerners, but they also included kleptocrats and organized-crime groups. By making the bonds anonymous, portable and redeemable anywhere, the London bankers deliberately made it easy for buyers to hide their identity.This is the original sin that explains why the offshore system has remained so durable. The privacy it allows, either through shell companies or anonymous bank accounts, is as useful to regular businesspeople as to fraudsters or kleptocrats. Any effort to crack down on, say, mobsters who stash their money in New York real estate also inconveniences corporations seeking to minimize their taxes, and thus triggers concerted opposition.But what\u2019s good for large corporations and rich individuals can be disastrous for society. Experts at the F.B.I., Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office and other leading investigators of grand corruption say shell companies are the primary obstacle to bringing the world\u2019s fraudsters to justice. One Miami lawyer told me they are like armor plating: Shell companies own other companies across multiple jurisdictions, creating layers of corporate plating so thick it becomes all but impenetrable.These two measures alone can\u2019t be enough to reveal the true owners of the anonymous money that is buying up so much of the West. But they can go a long way toward depriving dictators and thieves of a haven for their dirty cash, while helping officials in democracies regain control over who is buying the countries they were elected to run.Oliver Bullough is the author of \u201cLet Our Fame Be Great: Journeys Among the Defiant People of the Caucasus.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are the New Megadonors Distorting American Society?", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Imagine you have more money than you know what to do with. Not tens of millions of dollars, but hundreds of millions \u2014 billions even. After acquiring that dream villa on Lake Como, a vintage Bugatti and a seat on Elon Musk\u2019s maiden voyage to Mars, what would you do with the rest of your fortune? Buy the Yankees? Pay the Kardashians to disappear? O.K. But then what? Among America\u2019s ultrarich, more and more people are making the laudable, if not wholly selfless, decision to give it away.Much like the poor, philanthropists have always been with us. Certainly, the United States has enjoyed its share of Rockefellers and Carnegies over the years. But in \u201cThe Givers,\u201d David Callahan aims to introduce a new breed of megadonors\u2014 more numerous, more aggressive and vastly richer than their forebears \u2014 poised to reshape American society to an unprecedented degree. This, he contends, should make everyone at least a teensy bit nervous.\u201cThe Givers\u201d concerns itself with the tippy-top tiers of \u201cthe philanthrosphere.\u201d We\u2019re not talking here about bush-leaguers like Bill and Hillary Clinton, whose family foundation has to go scrounging for other people\u2019s money. Callahan focuses on the biggest of big givers \u2014 people like Bill Gates, the Walton clan, Mark Zuckerberg and Warren Buffett, who actually struggle to give away their fortunes because the money multiplies faster than they can shovel it out the door. The book covers all the basics: Who are these people? Why do they give? What causes do they favor, and how much impact do they have?The founder and editor of the website Inside Philanthropy, Callahan clearly knows the game and its players. This has its drawbacks. Especially in the early going, the book can feel laundry listy. After spending a couple of pages ticking through top Wall Street givers, he assures readers: \u201cI could name many additional donors coming out of finance, like Jeremy Grantham, Seth Klarman, Louis Bacon, George Roberts, Glenn Dubin, Kenneth Griffin, Michael Milken, Henry Kravis and Leon Black.\u201d All right already. You know your stuff. Can we please move on?Happily, Callahan hustles through the preliminaries and into a sweeping exploration of what makes mega-givers tick, how they operate and how they differ from their predecessors. Today\u2019s masters of the universe, for instance, are donating at a much younger age and taking a much more hands-on approach. Forget spending decades amassing piles of cash to be handed over in the twilight of life to endow some foundation. These folks want to start saving the world right now.Especially absorbing is Callahan\u2019s probing of mega-givers\u2019 psyches. Of course tech billionaires are all about risk-taking and disruption and tackling problems no one else is addressing. That\u2019s how they got to be billionaires in the first place. (They are \u201cmore ready by disposition to embrace the adage that philanthropy \u2018is society\u2019s risk capital.\u2019\u201d) Wall Street donors are often drawn to the \u201cstewardship model of philanthropy\u201d and prefer to support well established institutions \u2014 universities, hospitals, land conservation trusts and so on. (\u201cThey\u2019re more into charity than change.\u201d) \u201cTitans of the old economy\u201d tend to be older, more methodical, less creative and more political.Another significant development is the growing focus on data. (Even the philanthrosphere, it seems, has been invaded by the quants.) Givers are demanding an ever-clearer picture of what\u2019s working and how to get the biggest bang for their bucks. Callahan devotes a chapter to givers\u2019 quest for \u201cleverage points,\u201d most notably the strategic use of the court system to effect change.As suggested by the book\u2019s subtitle, Callahan is not here merely to praise the new philanthropists. His core mission is to sound the alarm about how even the best intentioned among them are distorting American society and eroding \u201cthe egalitarian ethos so core to our national identity.\u201dBy now, pretty much everyone recognizes the potentially corrupting aspects of big-dollar political giving. Callahan\u2019s contention is that big-dollar philanthropy affords its purveyors even greater influence, with fewer downsides and vastly less accountability. Sinking millions into, say, a presidential campaign subjects givers to intense public scrutiny and may ultimately win them nothing. Funding a nonprofit to sway thinking on, say, climate change or marriage equality or school choice \u2014 pick your issue \u2014 is a lower-profile, less risky, more enduring investment.\u201cThe Givers\u201d is not a big-P political book. While Callahan takes issue with ideologically motivated giving dressed up as philanthropy (and with politically minded nonprofits enjoying the same tax status as traditional charities), he endeavors to be bipartisan in his scolding. For every tale of a conservative pushing supply-side economics or traditional marriage via \u201ccharitable\u201d giving, he spotlights a liberal bankrolling gun control or clean energy. One positive byproduct of the swelling pool of mega-givers, he notes, is the philanthrosphere\u2019s growing ideological diversity. You may hate how Charles Koch doles out his billions but delight in how George Soros uses his. Or vice versa.Indeed, the book can be exhausting in its quest to hammer home the warping nature of Big Philanthropy. By the time Callahan makes the case that charitable giving actually perpetuates dynastic influence more than simply leaving one\u2019s offspring a big pile of cash, many readers will be ready to throw up their hands in exasperation. So now we\u2019re supposed to fret about rich people being too socially conscious? What exactly does this guy want?For all his efforts toward partisan balance, Callahan has a clear political perspective. A co-founder of the progressive think tank Demos, he is an unapologetic fan of big government \u2014 which, as he sees it, is the proper shaper of society. Central to his concern about philanthropy\u2019s clout is that it is waxing as government\u2019s is waning. He warns in the prologue, \u201cWe face a future in which private donors \u2014 who are accountable to no one \u2014 may often wield more influence than elected public officials, who (in theory, anyway) are accountable to all of us.\u201d (That \u201cin theory\u201d covers a multitude of sins. While it\u2019s not Callahan\u2019s aim to grapple with the gross dysfunction of our political system, his periodic touting of the oh-so-democratic accountability of public officials nonetheless comes off as vaguely credulous.)It is not until the epilogue that Callahan really lets his progressive flag fly. He offers a handful of reform ideas that will feel familiar to anyone who has followed the money-in-politics debate over the years: greater transparency (especially when it comes to the \u201cdark philanthropic money\u201d channeled through opaque vehicles like \u201cdonor-advised funds\u201d), stricter tax guidelines and increased government regulation. (He suggests a new \u201coffice of charitable affairs\u201d to help on that front.)With such prescriptions, Callahan seeks \u201cto target the philanthropic behavior that\u2019s most troubling, not hobble the sector as a whole.\u201d But this also means that, as Callahan acknowledges, even the most ambitious of his reforms would do little to alter the fundamental nature, or spiraling influence, of the greater philanthrosphere.As Callahan sees it, the only way to knock us off the path of \u201cbenign plutocracy\u201d is \u201cto revive government as a dynamic agent of change\u201d \u2014 which is the modest proposal he presents in literally his final three pages. Such a revival would involve huge shifts in spending priorities, tax hikes on the wealthy and an overhaul of agencies. In other words: It would require an entirely different political and social climate than the one we have. Then again, tackling seemingly intractable problems is what Big Philanthropy is all about. As such, it seems uncharitable to deny Callahan his dreams of a more egalitarian world.Many readers no doubt will share Callahan\u2019s views on the dark side of Big Philanthropy, and his ideas for addressing it. But even those who don\u2019t should give \u201cThe Givers\u201d a go. Callahan offers a peek inside a rarefied, poorly understood world with ever greater power to remake the broader world. It\u2019s an engaging, thought-provoking tour well worth the taking.Michelle Cottle is a contributing editor at The Atlantic, covering the culture and politics of Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Coming Crisis With Iran", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWhile Iran\u2019s economy has been growing, the recovery has been driven by renewed oil exports. As a result, most Iranians have yet to see much economic benefit from the sanctions relief brought by the nuclear deal. Real economic growth will require sizable foreign direct investments but international banks have remained hesitant about financing projects in Iran largely because of lingering American sanctions and the fear that the Trump administration will scrap the nuclear deal.If Mr. Rouhani is punished at the ballot box, there will be trouble. It would have been difficult enough for the deal to survive a Trump presidency. But to survive both Mr. Trump and a hard-line president in Iran may prove impossible.A third threat may prove the most potent: the Trump administration\u2019s adoption of Saudi Arabia\u2019s obsession with \u201ccountering Iranian influence\u201d in the Middle East. While the Obama administration viewed the Saudi-Iranian rivalry as a source of instability and urged the two Middle Eastern powers to learn to share the region, the Trump administration seems to have opted to make the Saudis\u2019 conflict with Iran its own. The main arena for this confrontation is Yemen, where the United States is ramping up its support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s bombardment as a means to combat what it believes is Iranian influence.For the nuclear deal to endure, tension between Washington and Tehran on other issues must be contained or the nuclear deal must be sufficiently insulated to survive external turbulence. It is difficult to see, for instance, how the deal can remain in place while the United States and Iran engage in direct or indirect confrontations throughout the region.If the United States reneges on its obligations under the deal, Iran is likely to follow suit and start expanding its nuclear activities \u2014 regardless of who wins the presidential elections. As Iran gets closer to possessing a nuclear weapon, the United States will once again inch closer to war. That was precisely the situation in 2012 and 2013: Faced with the realization that the United States\u2019 sanctions policy was more likely to lead to war than to Iran\u2019s capitulation, President Barack Obama decided to double down on finding a diplomatic solution through secret talks held in Oman. This time around, the American president won\u2019t have a diplomatic exit ramp.For many of the hawks in Washington, this is a lesser problem than the constraints the nuclear deal has imposed on the United States\u2019 ability to confront Iran elsewhere. That is not an accident: The deal aimed to make an escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran more difficult and costly for both countries. For Iran, this has restrained its policy on Israel. Iran\u2019s actions and rhetoric on the Jewish state have shifted remarkably ever since nuclear negotiations began. Iran\u2019s stance on the 2014 Gaza war is a case in point: Tehran remained relatively silent and did little to add fuel to the fire compared with what it might have done under other circumstances. The Iranians understood that they could not secure and sustain a nuclear deal with the United States without shifting their posture on Israel.And therein lies the true promise of the nuclear deal: Precisely because of its value, both sides are incentivized to contain their other disputes to ensure its survival. Over time, this could convert the United States and Iran from sworn enemies into mere competitors.During the negotiations, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, told me numerous times that he was frustrated that Washington didn\u2019t recognize that the nuclear deal could be a base rather than the ceiling for American-Iranian relations. It could create the possibility of America losing an enemy in the Middle East. When was the last time that happened?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Costly Addiction to Health Care Jobs", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisThe health care industry has been a great friend to the United States economy. Its plentiful jobs helped lift the country out of the Great Recession, and thanks in part to the Affordable Care Act, it now employs one in nine Americans \u2014 up from one in 12 in 2000.As President Trump seeks to fulfill his campaign pledge to create millions more jobs, the industry would seem a promising place to turn. But the billionaire businessman also campaigned to repeal Obamacare and lower health care costs \u2014 a potentially serious job killer. With Mr. Trump renewing his push to replace Obamacare, he faces a dilemma.\u201cThe goal of increasing jobs in health care is incompatible with the goal of keeping health care affordable,\u201d said Katherine Baicker, a Harvard University health economist who sees advantages in trimming the industry\u2019s growth. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence we can get more bang for our buck in health care. We should be aiming for a health care system that operates more efficiently and effectively. That might mean better outcomes for patients and fewer jobs.\u201dBut the country has grown increasingly dependent on the health sector to power the economy, and it will be a tough habit to break. Thirty-five percent of the nation\u2019s job growth has come from health care since the recession hit in late 2007, the single biggest sector for job creation.Hiring rose even more as coverage expanded in 2014 under the health care law and new federal dollars flowed in. The law gave hospitals, universities and companies even more reason to invest in new facilities and staff. Training programs sprang up to fill the growing job pool. Cities welcomed the development \u2014 and the revenue. Simply put, rising health spending has been good for some economically distressed parts of the country, many of which voted for Mr. Trump last year.The West Virginia University health system, for example, recently opened a 10-story medical tower in Morgantown and hired more than 2,000 employees last year. In Danville, Pa., the Geisinger Health System has added some 2,200 workers since July, and it\u2019s trying to fill 2,000 more jobs across its 12 hospital campuses and insurance company. Out west, UCHealth in Colorado expanded its Fort Collins hospital and is building three new hospitals in the state.In cities such as Pittsburgh, Cleveland and St. Louis, health care has replaced dying industries like coal mining and heavy manufacturing as a primary source of jobs. \u201cThe industry accounts for a lot of good middle-class jobs and, in many communities, it\u2019s the single-largest employer,\u201d said Sam Glick, a partner in the San Francisco office of Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm. \u201cOne of the hardest decisions for the new Trump administration is how far do they push on health care costs at the expense of jobs in health care.\u201dHouse Republicans, with backing from Mr. Trump, took the first swipe. Their American Health Care Act sought to roll back the current health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion and cut federal subsidies for private health insurance. The plan faltered in the House, but Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration say they are again trying to draft a replacement for Obamacare.Neither the Affordable Care Act nor the latest Republican bill tackles what some industry experts and economists see as a serious underlying reason for high health care costs: a system bloated by redundancy, inefficiency and a growing number of jobs far removed from patient care.Labor accounts for more than half of the $3.4 trillion spent on American health care, and medical professionals like health aides and nurse practitioners are in high demand. But the sheer complexity of the system has also spawned jobs for legions of data-entry clerks, revenue-cycle analysts and medical billing coders who must decipher arcane rules to mine money from human ills.For every doctor, there are 16 other health care workers. And half of those 16 are in administrative and other nonclinical roles, according to Bob Kocher, a former Obama administration official who worked on the Affordable Care Act and is now a partner in the venture capital firm Venrock.\u201cI find super-expensive drugs annoying, and hospital market power is a big problem,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cBut what\u2019s driving our health insurance premiums is that we are paying the wages of a whole bunch of people who aren\u2019t involved in the delivery of care. Hospitals keep raising their rates to pay for all of this labor.\u201dTake medical coders. Membership in the American Academy of Professional Coders has swelled to more than 165,000, up 10,000 in the past year alone. The average salary has risen to nearly $50,000, offering a path to the American dream.Some of these back-office workers wage battle every day in clinics and hospitals against an army of claims administrators filling up cubicles inside insurance companies. Overseeing it all are hundreds of corporate vice presidents drawing six-figure salaries.America\u2019s huge investment in health care and related jobs hasn\u2019t always led to better results for patients, data show. But it has provided good-paying jobs, which is why the talk of deep cuts in federal health spending has many people concerned.Linda Gonzalez, a 31-year-old mother of two, was among the thousands of enrollment counselors hired to help sign up Americans for health insurance as Obamacare rolled out in 2014. Ms. Gonzalez, a college graduate, makes more than $40,000 a year working at an AltaMed enrollment center, tucked between a Verizon Wireless store and a nail salon on a busy street in Los Angeles.In her cramped cubicle, families pull up chairs and sort through pay stubs and tax returns, often relying on her to sort out enrollment glitches with Medicaid. As the sole breadwinner for her two children, ages 9 and 10, she counts on this job but isn\u2019t sure how long it will last.\u201cA lot of people depend on this,\u201d she said recently. \u201cIt\u2019s something I do worry about.\u201dChad Terhune is a senior correspondent for Kaiser Health News and California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Sluggish Start to New Jersey\u2019s Race for Governor", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byThe candidates for governor in the New Jersey Democratic primary pack impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s: There is a former ambassador to Germany, a former under secretary of the Treasury, a state assemblyman with two decades of experience and a state senator with nearly four decades in Trenton.Voters, however, have so far been underwhelmed, so the contest is off to a decidedly sleepy start.The lack of enthusiasm among voters, even though New Jersey is only one of two states to hold statewide elections this year, is a curious conundrum facing the candidates jockeying to replace Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican. The candidates are trying to inspire an electorate seemingly angry and desperate for change after the 2016 election, while also battling exhaustion and an extended hangover from the outcome.\u201cIt\u2019s unusual,\u201d John Weingart, the associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said, referring to voter apathy. Voter fatigue is one possibility, but Mr. Weingart added, \u201cThe other reason is I think, whether or not it\u2019s justified, there\u2019s been a sense of inevitability of Phil Murphy.\u201dInitially, the Democratic primary, on June 6, was shaping up to be a highly competitive race among three state heavyweights: Mr. Murphy; Steven Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City; and Stephen M. Sweeney, the State Senate president. But when Mr. Fulop announced that he would not run and immediately endorsed Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Sweeney followed suit, the anticipated battle sank to a simmer and the flooding of airwaves and mailboxes that usually accompanies a closely contested primary never even reached a drip.Compounding the diminished battle is the long shadow of the 2016 election. On a recent overcast Saturday, about 100 people showed up in Plainfield, in northern New Jersey, as part of a nationwide protest to demand that President Trump release his taxes.Their focus was on the president, not on any New Jersey officials, with chants and pun-filled signs that have become commonplace as the movement against Mr. Trump enters the fourth month of his presidency.In interviews with about a dozen voters, only three knew that two candidates \u2014 Jim Johnson, the former under secretary, and Ray Lesniak, the state senator \u2014 would be speaking at the event.\u201cSo far, my main guy is Philip, um, Philip,\u201d said Jim Young, 81, of Rahway. He paused while a reporter helped him recall the surname. \u201cMurphy, yeah, Murphy is my main guy because he\u2019s been everywhere in the neighborhoods. He\u2019s all on TV.\u201dMr. Murphy has not been taking his front-runner status for granted. On a recent weekday he held a town-hall meeting in Fort Lee, a town at the foot of the George Washington Bridge, before about 200 people. Since beginning his campaign he has done three dozen or so of these events, which he has referred to as \u201cthe mosh pit.\u201dOnce a signature of Mr. Christie, town-hall meetings have become a hallmark of Mr. Murphy\u2019s campaign as he spins around the room delivering a high-energy stump speech \u2014 complete with arm whips, finger-pointed shout-outs and even some air guitar inspired by his good friend Jon Bon Jovi \u2014 before taking written questions.But like his campaign advertisements, which have been broadcast in New Jersey for nearly a year, Mr. Murphy has ignored his rivals and instead focused on the politician sucking the oxygen out of the political conversation: Mr. Trump.\u201cWe are literally, on June 6, the first election up to bat in the Trump presidency,\u201d he told the crowd in Fort Lee. \u201cWe did not ask for this moment. We did not ask for this responsibility. But the long road back for America, as it turns out, starts right here in the state of New Jersey.\u201dMr. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has marshaled much of his campaign around an economic message. He has called for the establishment of a public bank of New Jersey, an independent commercial enterprise \u201cowned by the taxpayers,\u2019\u2019 to help spur investment in small business and infrastructure.\u201cI\u2019ve been saying if we don\u2019t get the economy right, we don\u2019t get New Jersey right,\u201d he said in a brief interview.With Mr. Murphy\u2019s candidacy ascendant, his rivals have been campaigning aggressively to chip into his lead.Mr. Johnson was the first candidate to qualify for matching public funds \u2014 Mr. Murphy opted out of the program \u2014 and is the only other candidate advertising on television. He has received the largest amount of matching funds, nearly $2 million so far, and his campaign says it has spent about $1 million to advertise on cable television and digital media.He has centered his campaign on ethics reform and is promoting himself as an outsider with a record of success, a point he emphasizes in his stump speech as he introduces himself to voters and makes the case for his candidacy.\u201cThere aren\u2019t Democrats and Republicans,\u201d he said in remarks at the protest in Plainfield. \u201cThere are insiders, and everybody else. And I\u2019m running for everybody else.\u201dThen he ran into another supporter, who had come with his dog. \u201cThe next governor just petted you,\u201d Timothy Priano, 55, said to his dog, as Mr. Johnson tousled the animal\u2019s ears and shook Mr. Priano\u2019s hand.Following Mr. Johnson at the event was Mr. Lesniak, who offered a somewhat rambling, off-the-cuff speech that showcased both his extended roots in the state (he makes references largely using just first names, like the first same-sex couple to be married in New Jersey, whose wedding was \u201cin my house\u201d) and his \u201cfrom the heart\u201d style.\u201cThat is what distinguishes me from the rest of the candidates: I never have a prepared speech,\u201d Mr. Lesniak said in a brief interview.John Wisniewski, the state assemblyman, made a name for himself as the crusading force behind the investigation into the lane closings at the George Washington Bridge and as the chairman of the Bernie Sanders campaign in the state.His embraces some of the most liberal positions among the Democratic contenders, including a single-payer health care system and tuition-free college for some students, echoes of Mr. Sanders though without the resonance. He is also the only Democratic candidate, besides Mr. Johnson, to qualify for matching state funds, having received nearly $700,000.While Mr. Wisniewski may have been hoping for a proxy battle for the soul of the Democratic Party, Mr. Sanders lost the New Jersey primary last year by a large margin, his 37 percent dwarfed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 63 percent share, leaving Mr. Wisniewski with a smaller liberal base to build upon.Nonetheless, Mr. Wisniewski does have the support of some Sanders voters, including Paula Friedman, a retired union activist, who turned out to see Mr. Murphy\u2019s town-hall meeting to size up the crowd and the competition.\u201cThis is all establishment stuff,\u201d she said, waving her arm at the crowd, which she deemed as not having enough young people to qualify as progressive. Mr. Wisniewski, she said, is a \u201cdecent man,\u201d adding that she was drawn to his single-payer health care proposal.As the crowd arrived in Fort Lee, the energy in the room rose and the standing-room crowd shifted on their feet in anticipation. Though the crowd was largely older, they didn\u2019t necessarily share Ms. Friedman\u2019s concerns about Mr. Murphy\u2019s liberal bona fides.\u201cMy heart belongs to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party,\u201d said Donna Campos, 72, from Fort Lee.Whether that aligned with Mr. Murphy\u2019s views did not seem to matter as she smiled when she talked about her preferred candidate.\u201cClose enough,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll do. But that\u2019s why were here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coal Museum Sees the Future; Trump Doesn\u2019t", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byGo figure. The coal mining museum is going solar, for solid economic reasons, and President Trump is reviving coal, with no economic logic at all. This bizarre contrast speaks to a deeper question of leadership and how we judge presidents.Trump took two major national security decisions in the past few weeks. One was to strike Syria for using poison gas. Trump summoned his national security team, asked for options on Syria, chose the cruise-missile strike \u2014 which was right \u2014 and won praise for acting \u201cpresidential.\u201dThe other decision you didn\u2019t see. It was Trump dismantling budgets and regulations undergirding U.S. climate and environmental protection policies \u2014 in his nutty effort to revive U.S. coal-fired energy \u2014 while quietly announcing plans to withhold a promised $32.5 million U.S. contribution for the U.N. Population Fund, which supports family planning and maternal health.Unlike the Syria decision, Trump made the second move without seeking a comprehensive briefing from experts \u2014 he controls the world\u2019s greatest collection of climate scientists at NASA, NOAA, the E.P.A., the Pentagon and the C.I.A. \u2014 and without ever asking for an intelligence briefing on how the combination of climate change, environmental degradation, drought and population explosions helped trigger the civil war in Syria, spawn terrorist groups like Boko Haram around Africa\u2019s central Lake Chad (which has lost 90 percent of its water mass since 1963) and become the main force pushing tens of thousands of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa into Europe each year, and from Central America up to the U.S.I promise you that Trump will spend the rest of his presidency dealing with the disruptions caused by this cocktail of population explosion and climate/environmental degradation \u2014 and his generals know it. But in today\u2019s politics, bombing is considered presidential and ignoring science and defunding family planning, when populations are exploding and droughts expanding, are ho-hum back-page news.Since Trump seems to be pivoting from some of his campaign nonsense, one can only hope he will do the same on these issues. If Trump is looking for a blueprint, he could not do better than to read a smart new book, \u201cClimate of Hope,\u201d by a most unlikely duo: former Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope and billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.When Carl met Mike\u2026 It was 2011, Pope went to Bloomberg with a plan for generating bottom-up community activism to help shut down as many coal-fired power plants in America as possible, so another generation of American kids wouldn\u2019t be afflicted with childhood asthma and another generation of coal workers wouldn\u2019t have to make a living breathing coal dust.Bloomberg put $50 million into the effort, and the rest is \u2014 helping to make coal \u2014 history, thanks to the Sierra Club mobilizing communities and technology making natural gas (when the methane leakage is controlled) a much cleaner, cheaper base-load power source for utilities, and wind and solar energy so much more cost-effective.When the Sierra Club and Bloomberg started in 2011, there were 514 coal-fired power plants in America; since then, 254 have announced they will shut down. They expect that fully two-thirds will be phased out by 2022 \u2014 no matter what Trump says or does.\u201cClimate of Hope\u201d is about how to build on this, by reframing the interrelated challenges of climate change, clean air, clean water and population \u201cfrom questions of who is going to sacrifice to who is going to grab the profits,\u201d Bloomberg explained in an interview. Each of these challenges, he said, can be met in ways that enable cities and countries to make themselves more prosperous, innovative, healthy and secure \u2014 if we just get the incentives right.Imagine every U.S. city joining those already buying electric self-driving vehicles, thereby scaling a new auto-on-demand industry \u2014 while reducing the need for personal cars and the parking places and garages for them \u2014 thereby unlocking so much real estate for growth and easing urban housing prices. Imagine that instead of vowing to bring back coal mining jobs, our president offered to link West Virginia and the nation\u2019s most prosperous metropolitan economy, Washington, D.C., with high-speed rail service.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Government Gorsuch Wants to Undo", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisAt recent Senate hearings to fill the Supreme Court\u2019s open seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch came across as a thoroughly bland and nonthreatening nominee. The idea was to give as little ammunition as possible to opponents when his nomination comes up this week for a vote, one that Senate Democrats may try to upend with a filibuster.The 80 years of law that are at stake began with the New Deal. President Franklin D. Roosevelt believed that the Great Depression was caused in part by ruinous competition among companies. In 1933, Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act, which allowed the president to approve \u201cfair competition\u201d standards for different trades and industries. The next year, Roosevelt approved a code for the poultry industry, which, among other things, set a minimum wage and maximum hours for workers, and hygiene requirements for slaughterhouses. Such basic workplace protections and constraints on the free market are now taken for granted.But in 1935, after a New York City slaughterhouse operator was convicted of violating the poultry code, the Supreme Court called into question the whole approach of the New Deal, by holding that the N.I.R.A. was an \u201cunconstitutional delegation by Congress of a legislative power.\u201d Only Congress can create rules like the poultry code, the justices said. Because Congress did not define \u201cfair competition,\u201d leaving the rule-making to the president, the N.I.R.A. violated the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.The court\u2019s ruling in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. the United States, along with another case decided the same year, are the only instances in which the Supreme Court has ever struck down a federal statute based on this rationale, known as the \u201cnondelegation doctrine.\u201d Schechter Poultry\u2019s stand against executive-branch rule-making proved to be a legal dead end, and for good reason. As the court has recognized over and over, before and since 1935, Congress is a cumbersome body that moves slowly in the best of times, while the economy is an incredibly dynamic system. For the sake of business as well as labor, the updating of regulations can\u2019t wait for Congress to give highly specific and detailed directions.The system worked well enough for decades, but questions arose when Ronald Reagan came to power promising to deregulate. His E.P.A. sought to weaken a rule, issued by the Carter administration, which called for regulating \u201cstationary sources\u201d of air pollution \u2014 a broad wording that is open to interpretation. When President Reagan\u2019s E.P.A. narrowed the definition of what counted as a \u201cstationary source\u201d to allow plants to emit more pollutants, an environmental group challenged the agency. The Supreme Court held in 1984 in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council that the E.P.A. (and any agency) could determine the meaning of an ambiguous term in the law. The rule came to be known as Chevron deference: When Congress uses ambiguous language in a statute, courts must defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of what the words mean.Chevron was not viewed as a left-leaning decision. The Supreme Court decided in favor of the Reagan administration, after all, voting 6 to 0 (three justices did not take part), and spanning the ideological spectrum. After the conservative icon Justice Antonin Scalia reached the Supreme Court, he declared himself a Chevron fan. \u201cIn the long run Chevron will endure,\u201d Justice Scalia wrote in a 1989 article, \u201cbecause it more accurately reflects the reality of government, and thus more adequately serves its needs.\u201dThat was then. But the Reagan administration\u2019s effort to cut back on regulation ran out of steam. It turned out that the public often likes regulation \u2014 because it keeps the air and water clean, the workplace safe and the financial system in working order. Deregulation of the financial system led to the savings-and-loans crisis of the 1980s and the financial crisis a decade ago, costing taxpayers billions.Businesses, however, have continued to complain that the federal government regulates too much. In the past 20 years, conservative legal scholars have bolstered the red-tape critique with a constitutional one. They argued that only Congress \u2014 not agencies \u2014 can create rules. This is Schechter Poultry all over again.At his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch hinted that he might vote to overturn Chevron without saying so directly, noting that the administrative state existed long before Chevron was decided in 1984. The implication is that little would change if courts stopped deferring to the E.P.A.\u2019s or the Department of Labor\u2019s reading of a statute. Judges would interpret the law. Who could object to that?But here\u2019s the thing: Judge Gorsuch is skeptical that Congress can use broadly written laws to delegate authority to agencies in the first place. That can mean only that at least portions of such statutes \u2014 the source of so many regulations that safeguard Americans\u2019 welfare \u2014 must be sent back to Congress, to redo or not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Was Lenin Thinking?", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byRed CenturyLONDON \u2014 What was Vladimir Lenin thinking on the long journey to Petrograd\u2019s Finland Station in 1917?Like everyone else, he had been taken by surprise at the speed with which the February Revolution had succeeded. As he traveled from Zurich across Europe to Russia, on board a sealed train courtesy of Germany\u2019s kaiser, he must have reflected that this was an opportunity not to be missed.That the weak liberal parties dominated the new government was to be expected. What worried him were the reports he was receiving that his own Bolsheviks were vacillating over the way forward. Theory had bound them, together with most of the left, to the Marxist orthodoxy that, at this stage, the revolution in Russia could be only bourgeois-democratic. Socialism was possible only in advanced economies like Germany, France or even the United States, but not in peasant Russia. (Leon Trotsky and his band of intellectuals were among the few dissenters from that view.)Since the course of the revolution was thus preordained, all that socialists could do was offer support to the provisional government as it carried through the revolution\u2019s first phase and developed a full-fledged capitalist society. Once this was completed, then they could agitate for a more radical revolution.This combination of dogmatism and passivity infuriated Lenin. The February upheaval had forced him to rethink old dogmas. To move forward, he now believed, there had to be a socialist revolution. No other solution was possible. The czarist state had to be destroyed, root and branch. So he said as he stepped off the train in Petrograd: No compromise was possible with a government that continued to prosecute the war or with the parties that supported such a government.The Bolshevik slogan that embodied his tactical thinking was \u201cpeace, land and bread.\u201d As for the revolution, he now argued that the international capitalist chain would break at its weakest link. Winning over the Russian workers and peasants to create a new socialist state would pave the way for an insurrection in Germany and elsewhere. Without this, he argued, it would be difficult to build any meaningful form of socialism in Russia.From February to October, arguably the most open period in Russian history, Lenin won over his party, joined forces with Trotsky and prepared for a new revolution. The provisional government of Alexander Kerensky refused to withdraw from the war. Bolshevik agitators among the troops at the front assailed his vacillations. Large-scale mutinies and desertions followed.Within the workers\u2019 and soldiers\u2019 councils, or soviets, Lenin\u2019s strategy began to make sense to large numbers of workers. The Bolsheviks won majorities in the Petrograd and Moscow soviets, and the party was developing rapidly elsewhere. This merger between Lenin\u2019s political ideas and a growing class consciousness among workers produced the formula for October.Far from being a conspiracy, let alone a coup, the October Revolution was perhaps the most publicly planned uprising in history. Two of Lenin\u2019s oldest comrades on the party\u2019s central committee remained opposed to an immediate revolution and published the date of the event. While its final details were obviously not advertised beforehand, the takeover was swift and involved minimal violence.That all changed with the ensuing civil war, in which the nascent Soviet state\u2019s enemies were backed by the czar\u2019s former Western allies. Amid the resulting chaos and millions of casualties, the Bolsheviks finally prevailed \u2014 but at a terrible political and moral cost, including the virtual extinction of the working class that had originally made the revolution.The choice that followed the revolution of October 1917 was thus not between Lenin and liberal democracy. The real choice was to be determined instead by a brutal struggle for power between the Red and White armies, the latter led by czarist generals who made no secret that if they won, both Bolsheviks and Jews would be exterminated. Pogroms carried out by the Whites saw entire Jewish villages wiped out. A majority of Russian Jews fought back, either as members of the Red Army or in their own partisan units. Nor should we forget that a few decades later, it was the Red Army \u2014 originally forged in the civil war by Trotsky, Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Mikhail Frunze (the former two killed later by Stalin) \u2014 that broke the military might of the Third Reich in the epic battles of Kursk and Stalingrad. By then, Lenin had been dead for almost two decades.Weakened by a stroke for the last two years before he died in 1924, Lenin had time to reflect on the achievements of the October Revolution. He was not happy. He saw how the czarist state and its practices, far from being destroyed, had infected Bolshevism. Great-Russian chauvinism was rampant and had to be rooted out, he realized. The level of party culture was lamentable after the human losses of the civil war.\u201cNo,\u201d he concluded, \u201cwe are ridiculously deficient.\u201d The Revolution had to admit its mistakes and renew itself, he believed; otherwise, it would fail. Yet this lesson went unheeded after his death. His writings were largely ignored or deliberately distorted. No subsequent Soviet leader emerged with Lenin\u2019s vision.\u201cHis mind was a remarkable instrument,\u201d wrote Winston Churchill, no admirer of Bolshevism. \u201cWhen its light shone it revealed the whole world, its history, its sorrows, its stupidities, its shams, and above all, its wrongs.\u201dOf his successors, neither of the notable reformers \u2014 Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s and \u201960s and Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980s \u2014 had the capacity to transform the country. The implosion of the Soviet Union owed almost as much to its degraded political culture \u2014 and, at times, the ridiculous deficiency of the bureaucratic elite \u2014 as it did to the economic stagnation and resource dependency that set in from the 1970s. Obsessed with mimicking the technological advances of the United States, its leaders cut the ground out from beneath their feet. In the revolution\u2019s final, sorry chapter, not a few of its bureaucrats rediscovered themselves as millionaires and oligarchs \u2014 something Trotsky had predicted from exile in 1936.\u201cPolitics is a concentrated expression of economics,\u201d Lenin once remarked. As capitalism stumbles, its politicians and their oligarchical backers are finding voters deserting their parties in droves. The shift to the right in Western politics is a revolt against the neoliberal coalitions that have governed since the Soviet Union collapsed. Today, however, the politicians cannot blame socialism as they once did \u2014 for it does not exist.In the national-conservative Russia of its president, Vladimir V. Putin, there are no celebrations this year of either the February Revolution or the October one. \u201cThey are not on our calendar,\u201d he told an Indian journalist of my acquaintance last year.Tariq Ali, a member of the editorial committee of the New Left Review, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Dilemmas of Lenin: Terrorism, War, Empire, Love, Revolution.\u201dThis is an essay in the series Red Century, about the legacy and history of communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Warren Agree? Maybe, on Plan to Shrink Big Banks", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump has vowed to roll back financial regulation, saying that it is preventing banks from lending and businesses from growing.Wall Street, it would seem, has found its dream president.There is just one possible complication: His top advisers continue to float an idea that would not only hurt the nation\u2019s largest banks, it would upend them.In a meeting on Wednesday with senators from both parties, Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, said the administration was considering a proposal that would require separating retail banking from investment banking and trading. Mr. Cohn mentioned the idea to members of the Senate Banking Committee as one of several financial regulations on the table.The goal of Glass-Steagall was to prevent banks from taking risks with people\u2019s federally insured deposits.Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is arguably Wall Street\u2019s harshest critic on Capitol Hill, has said restoring Glass-Steagall would reduce the risks bank pose to the economy by creating a \u201cwall between commercial and investment banking.\u201d\u201cDespite the progress since 2008, the biggest banks continue to threaten our economy,\u201d Ms. Warren said in a statement.On Thursday, she seized on the news of Mr. Cohn\u2019s comments to reintroduce a bill that she sponsored with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, called the 21st-century Glass-Steagall Act.It was a rare moment of harmony between the Trump administration and Ms. Warren. They are even calling their proposals by the same name.\u201cThe president spoke to the need for a simplification of the banking system on the campaign trail, what he called a \u201821st century Glass-Steagall,\u2019 to make it easier for businesses to grow and create jobs in their communities,\u201d a White House spokeswoman said in a statement on Thursday.Since the Republican convention last July \u2014 when the restoration of Glass-Steagall was inserted into the party\u2019s platform \u2014 Mr. Trump has on occasion signaled a willingness to break up the big banks.The idea seems incongruent with the president\u2019s many other policies on taxes and the environment that will largely benefit corporations and the wealthy.Yet invoking Glass-Steagall, which was repealed in 1999, seems tailored to appeal directly to the angry voters who elected Mr. Trump.Many Americans are still smarting from the 2008 recession, which was caused by the financial crisis, and still believe that the Obama administration did not go far enough in reining in Wall Street.Still, it is unclear whether a return to Glass-Steagall is politically feasible.Banking lobbyists dismissed Mr. Cohn\u2019s comments as empty politics and ineffective policy.\u201cLarge financial institutions play a role in the American economy other institutions are not able to fill,\u201d said Tim Pawlenty, the chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry group, and a former Republican governor of Minnesota.Even regulators, who worry about the systemic risks posed by huge banks, say restoring Glass-Steagall is no cure-all.During the financial crisis, the failure of investment firms that had no major retail business \u2014 Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers \u2014 posed grave risks to the economy.\u201cGlass-Steagall by itself will not address \u2018too big to fail,\u2019\u201d said Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, who was a Treasury official during the financial crisis.Others warned that breaking up large banks could benefit firms like Mr. Cohn\u2019s former employer, Goldman Sachs, whose retail deposit business is relatively recent and small: It would have a greater impact on Goldman rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.Goldman, said Dennis Kelleher, president and chief executive of Better Markets, a group that advocates more restrictions on Wall Street, \u201cwould be king of the financial world where bank holding companies couldn\u2019t compete.\u201dIf anything, the proposal to restore Glass-Steagall shows the shifting sands of Wall Street\u2019s position in Washington.During the presidential campaign, Wall Street executives overwhelming supported Hillary Clinton, who was seen as a moderate on financial issues, someone who understood the important role that big banks play in the global economy.Mrs. Clinton said during the campaign that bringing back the law would not make the banks safer or eliminate the chance of another crisis like 2008.Glass-Steagall had been repealed during her husband\u2019s administration, ushering in an era of consolidation that created behemoth banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup that did everything from issuing auto loans to trading complex derivatives.Despite backing the Democrat, Wall Street has already benefited greatly from Mr. Trump\u2019s election.Stocks of banks like Bank of America and Citigroup, beaten down for years, have had their biggest rebound in recent memory \u2014 a rally driven in part by proposed regulatory relief. In particular, Mr. Trump has said he will be taking aim at the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, passed in the wake of the financial crisis, which contains a thicket of restrictions on trading and oversight.Banks are also hoping that Mr. Trump\u2019s appointments to important positions on the Federal Reserve will provide relief on how much capital they need to hold to cushion against losses.\u201cEssentially, too big to fail has been solved,\u201d Mr. Dimon wrote. \u201cTaxpayers will not pay if a bank fails.\u201dOne day later, talk of breaking up the big banks was back in vogue and the industry\u2019s regulatory fortunes seemed more uncertain than before.Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Trump and Congress Solve the Rubik\u2019s Cube of Tax Reform?", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byHeavy LiftingThat\u2019s partly because the first and last time there was a comprehensive rewrite of the tax code, it was 1986. But there is more than that.What makes trying to solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube so exasperating is that every rotation you make to align the colors on one side messes up something on one of the other sides. Nothing moves in isolation; everything affects everything else, and rarely for the better.The 1986 tax overhaul took two years. Despite bipartisan backing from the Reagan administration and congressional Democrats, it had many false starts and reversals in its voyage to becoming a law.Congress and the Trump administration will solve tax reform only by navigating difficult trade-offs. Think of these trade-offs as the six sides of a Rubik\u2019s cube, each of which needs to match up perfectly \u2014 but each of which can foul up the others.That means Republican tax writers need a bill to keep party members on board, or one that could attract significant Democratic support and allow more room for Republican defections.In theory at least, there\u2019s room for common ground with Democrats on the corporate income tax. President Obama proposed corporate tax changes that would have lowered the rate on businesses to 28 percent from its current 35 percent while changing its structure.Republicans, who showed their internal divisions during the health bill debate, need to stay united or to give up on some of the longstanding priorities of the conservative movement (and of Republican donors).Instead of increasing deficits and debt, Congress could offset lower rates by eliminating deductions with the overall result that American individuals and companies would still pay as much to the government. But this tactic runs into its own problems. Namely:But the distress of a relatively small group that loses some favorable tax treatment can be a lot louder than the gratitude of masses of people benefiting from a lower rate. Trying to take away deductions or other tax advantages from one group tends to stir the passions of that group, which might then fight the entire reform effort.For example, the House Republican tax plan introduced last year would pay for tax rate cuts in part by eliminating the tax deduction for state and local income taxes. That is a tremendously valuable deduction for people in high-tax states like California and New York.There are countless such tripwires in reforming the corporate tax code, and every large company and trade association is watching carefully for its own interests. For example, eliminating the tax deductibility of interest payments, a feature of the House Republicans\u2019 plan last year that helped enable proposing a much lower tax rate for all corporations, is stridently opposed by real estate and private equity industries that rely heavily on borrowed money.Those in danger of losing a valuable deduction will lobby to preserve it, which collectively makes it hard to make that lower-rate/broader-base ideal possible.That can include cuts to the corporate income tax or cuts on income-tax rates for top earners. By contrast, tax cuts meant to leave more income in people\u2019s pockets have less impact. Tax cuts on wages, \u201cwhether they are at the top or the bottom, tend to have very modest impacts on the economy,\u201d said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation.That presents a political problem for Republicans: The changes they believe will create the strongest pro-growth effects would offer few direct benefits to middle-class Americans. It\u2019s hard to make a populist pitch for a tax cut that gives the biggest benefits to millionaires and large corporations, but that is what the House Republican plan does.In 2001 and 2003, the George W. Bush administration took the \u201cboth-and\u201d approach to its tax bills, layering both substantial tax cuts for the middle class and for investment income and the wealthy. Trying to do that again today would get right back to the issue of increasing the deficit.For the Senate to pass a tax bill with a simple majority vote, as opposed to a 60-vote supermajority, it will need to do so under \u201creconciliation,\u201d a legislative process with its own set of rules.Among them: A bill passed through reconciliation cannot be projected to increase the budget deficit beyond a 10-year period. That gives the engineers of a tax bill a choice: Either devise changes that don\u2019t increase long-term deficits (which limits how much you can cut taxes) or cut taxes with abandon but with the possibility that they\u2019ll expire after 10 years.The George W. Bush administration took the latter strategy, betting that future Congresses would be unwilling to allow taxes to rise, effectively making them permanent. Wrong. The Obama administration was able to raise taxes on the wealthy at the end of 2013 essentially by doing nothing.Economists believe that imposing this tax would cause the value of the dollar to rise on currency markets, which would offset the tax on imports, and so consumer prices wouldn\u2019t rise. In theory, at least, no one would be worse off.It looks like the holy grail of tax reform: It allows lowering tax rates without increasing the deficit, without creating powerful losers, and creating a more efficient economy for the long run.But the very cleverness of the proposal \u2014 it is an idea that has been tossed around in academic circles for a decade but never adopted in any country \u2014 is what makes border adjustment so fraught.In effect, the elegant, clever solution to many of the other trade-offs involving taxes introduces a level of complexity and uncertainty that may doom an otherwise promising approach.As they seek to resolve these interrelated tensions, tax writers in Congress will face pressure from hometown industries and constituents as well as practically every business lobbyist in Washington \u2014 and will also confront the inherent political challenge of getting to a majority.Advertisement"}

But the issues that have animated the movements \u2014 slow economies, a lack of jobs, immigration \u2014 are not going anywhere, and the far right has already moved the political terrain in its direction.\u201cThere is a sigh of relief,\u201d said Jan Techau, the director of the Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin. \u201cIt\u2019s good that in addition to all the other issues on the agenda, we don\u2019t also have an extremist French problem.\u201dAfter a year of unpredictable elections in Europe and the United States, it would be unwise to discount Ms. Le Pen entirely, even if her odds are long. Still, the French result was particularly welcomed by Brussels and Berlin, which have been praying for a French partner willing to challenge both the statist structure of France and the complacency of the European Union. And after weeks of market jitters, investors on Monday cheered the results, with global stocks surging and the euro reaching fresh highs.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, broke protocol to congratulate Mr. Macron and wish him continued success, as did the German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, who said, \u201cHe will be a great president.\u201dBy winning more votes than Ms. Le Pen, Mr. Macron, who at 39 is on course to be France\u2019s youngest head of state since Napoleon, seemed to many to be a new generation\u2019s centrist answer to sclerotic and corrupt establishment politics and the challenge of populism and the far right.Even so, candidates of the far right and far left did very well in the voting, reflecting strong and skeptical views among the French public.\u201cOf course many people in Brussels and so on are relieved that we don\u2019t have two extremists in the last round, but only one,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, a German who directs Bruegel, a Brussels-based research organization.\u201cBut the fact of the matter is that we still have a little bit more than 40 percent of the electorate having voted for an extremist,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cSo that shows that a large part of the French population doesn\u2019t seem to be very happy with his or her own position and pretty dissatisfied with the political system.\u201dThe question for many is whether a centrist reformer like Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, is prepared to seriously take on board the dissatisfaction of ordinary working people.\u201cBut the threat from the far right is not over,\u201d they were quick to add. \u201cIf Macron is to take it on and defeat it, he needs to get real on social justice and do more for those who feel marginalized.\u201dStill, for a majority in Europe, the far right has not provided answers either, as it has fallen short of predicted triumphs.Yet on traditional measures, Ms. Le Pen did very well in the first-round vote on Sunday. She received nearly 7.7 million votes, compared with her 6.4 million in the first round in 2012 and the 4.8 million that her father, Jean-Marie, received when he advanced to the second round in 2002.While Ms. Le Pen is expected to lose in the runoff, Mr. Macron \u2014 as a youthful banker with an elite education \u2014 is an easy target for her. French unhappiness with establishment parties is sure to be reflected in the June votes for the French legislature, in which Mr. Macron and his year-old movement, En Marche!, will have to work hard to cobble together a working majority.Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, a research institute in London, cautioned that populist views have been growing for many years, not just in southern Europe but in \u201cmore settled northern Europe,\u201d like Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands.\u201cIn a time of economic turbulence, there\u2019s been a search for national identity and individual identity, a feeling that national identities are being stripped away at a pace people can\u2019t control,\u201d he said. \u201cThe E.U. is seen as an expression of that loss, and even a vehicle for it.\u201dAs important, the far right\u2019s nationalism and opposition to multilateralism have split mainstream parties and pushed the national conversation to the right.\u201cAt the moment, conservatives are doing a better job at coalescing support and co-opting aspects of the populist message,\u201d Mr. Niblett said. Each country has its own specific political context, he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see the validity of the populist message declining.\u201dGermany especially is looking forward to a more like-minded French partner, as together they make up about 47 percent of the eurozone\u2019s gross domestic product, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.\u201cMacron understands Europe and the need to change things, and that means changing France, too,\u201d she said, noting a speech by Mr. Macron in Berlin that directly linked \u201creform and modernization in France with reform in the E.U.\u201dThat is the perfect line for Germany, she said, \u201cwhich fears pressure for more burden-sharing with countries who haven\u2019t done their economic homework.\u201dMr. Macron has said he wants a common eurozone budget under a eurozone \u201cfinance minister\u201d and has proposed \u201cdemocratic conventions\u201d to identify reform priorities for the European Union.The Germans fear that if the eurozone integrates further with a budget and banking union, but without prior economic changes from its members, Germany will end up bailing out everyone else forever. So Mr. Macron, vowing economic reform in France, is singing a song much more attuned to German ears.But Mr. Macron, if elected, is also expected to push a harder negotiating line with Britain over its exit from the European Union \u2014 especially on the issue of financial services, about which he knows a great deal.\u201cWith his background, we assume Macron sees much more clearly where the actual issues lie and will work to prevent Europe from facing a competitive disadvantage,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said.But there is much to play for, not just in Britain\u2019s election in June but especially in Germany\u2019s in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a strong challenge from the center-left Social Democrats, and the far-right Alternative for Germany is likely to win seats in the federal Parliament for the first time.At the far right\u2019s party conference this past weekend in Cologne, there were strong themes of nationalism and distaste for immigration despite the party\u2019s internal disputes, in which Frauke Petry, one of its leaders, lost her effort to pull the party away from the hard right.Her rivals brought delegates to their feet with speeches that pandered to identity loss. Whether or not the party succeeds, the issue seems likely to continue to resonate broadly.J\u00f6rg Meuthen, a professor who leads the party with Ms. Petry, said that few Germans could be seen as one walked around a typical German town.\u201cThis is our country,\u201d he told cheering delegates. \u201cThe country of our grandparents and parents. We must take it back.\u201dSteven Erlanger reported from London, and Alison Smale from Cologne and Berlin. James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Plan Is a Reckoning for Republican Deficit Hawks", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported bySome skeptics are already ringing alarm bells, fearing that Republicans will sign on to what critics see as a dangerous plan composed by a president who called himself the King of Debt.\u201cIt seems the administration is using economic growth like magic beans: the cheap solution to all our problems,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that advocates fiscal restraint. \u201cBut there is no golden goose at the top of the tax-cut beanstalk, just mountains of debt.\u201dA point-by-point look at how much it will increase the federal deficit.While Mr. Trump and his team point to the growth linked to tax cuts passed by previous presidents, today\u2019s economy is different from that of 1981 or 2001, when Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush cut tax rates.The office\u2019s predictions have been off before, and the impact of tax cuts on the economy is a matter of debate, as so many variables determine a country\u2019s economic fortunes. But tax historians and veterans of previous tax fights are quick to point out that lower rates are not necessarily a panacea for slow growth.\u201cThis is fool\u2019s gold that you\u2019ll cut taxes, everybody will work harder, more money will come and you\u2019ll erase the fiscal impact,\u201d said Steve Bell, who was a Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee from 1981 to 1986. \u201cIt never happens.\u201dJoseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, said the Trump plan appeared to have strong parallels with Reagan\u2019s 1981 cuts. Mr. Thorndike recalled that the Reagan administration soon realized the problem of the red ink it was facing and started looking for new sources of revenue.\u201cThis looks like \u201981, where they said, \u2018Deficit be damned, we want to do a tax cut,\u2019\u201d Mr. Thorndike said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cautionary tale.\u201dTwenty years later, the Bush tax cuts, which reduced the top individual tax rates and increased the standard deduction for low-income households, took place in a different environment. Mr. Bush made the case that it was time to spend the nation\u2019s surplus to jump-start a flagging economy.\u201cIt\u2019s very important to recognize that the fiscal situation today is not what it was in 2001,\u201d said Scott Greenberg of the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group. \u201cInstead of facing a large projected surplus, the country faces a large projected deficit.\u201dThe White House\u2019s outline was too thin on details to allow for a concrete analysis of how much deficits would grow. There were no specifics about what income would fall into the three, instead of seven, individual tax brackets. The explanation of how the mammoth switch to a territorial corporate tax system would work was vague. There was no word on how low the tax on repatriated foreign corporate earnings would be. And Gary D. Cohn, the director of the president\u2019s National Economic Council, could not say how much of a tax cut a middle-income American would get.The debate over the impact of the plan is only beginning. If Republicans are not able to make the cuts revenue-neutral \u2014 that is, causing no increase in the deficit \u2014 they will need the support of Democrats to get 60 votes in the Senate and make the legislation permanent under budget reconciliation rules. Otherwise, any changes to the tax code will expire in 10 years.While Republicans in the House, Senate and Trump administration have said they do not want to add to the deficit, there is a growing acknowledgment of the possibility that they will need to settle for temporary tax cuts. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday that short-term cuts were better than nothing. And Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said this week that he could live with cuts that added to the deficit if it meant getting the economy moving faster.Republican budget hawks will need to decide whether they want to stick to the arguments of fiscal responsibility that they used to bludgeon Democrats during the Obama era. One of those hawks, Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, said Wednesday, \u201cRather than conforming to arbitrary budget constraints, the president\u2019s plan rightfully aims to jump-start investment, which will produce significantly more revenue for the Treasury over the long term than any revenue-neutral tax plan could generate.\u201dMick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, who was a fierce critic of deficits when he was a member of Congress, offered a glimpse of the rationale his former colleagues might embrace. \u201cAs a conservative, that bothers me a little bit,\u201d he said Tuesday on CNN of the possibility that Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan would increase the deficit. \u201cBut we also look at deficits through sort of a different lens.\u201dFor Democrats, now out of power, the reversal is bitterly ironic, and several lawmakers assailed the president for, they said, preparing to cripple the country with debt.\u201cI\u2019m not the first to observe that a Republican Congress only cares about the deficit when a Democrat is in the White House,\u201d said Alan B. Krueger, the Princeton economist who was chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIt may be that Dick Cheney is right and that deficits don\u2019t matter to the public, but they do matter to the economy.\u201dBut for Republicans who have been craving big tax cuts for years, confidence was high that the worries about deficits were overwrought.\u201cThis is a thing of beauty, a thing of wonder,\u201d Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, said of Mr. Trump\u2019s one-page plan. \u201cGrowth, growth, growth!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Trump, a Steep Learning Curve Leads to Policy Reversals", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byFor any new occupant of the White House, the early months are like a graduate seminar in policy crammed into every half-hour meeting. What made sense on the campaign trail may have little bearing on reality in the Oval Office, and the education of a president can be rocky even for former governors or senators. For Mr. Trump, the first president in American history never to have served in government or the military, the learning curve is especially steep.\u201cAs he governs, he is realizing that the campaign talk doesn\u2019t fit neatly into governing and he needs a different approach, one that gets results,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of the president\u2019s. \u201cSo he will discard things and people that don\u2019t work out, and those that do work, he will magnify. That\u2019s how he became successful in business and entertainment.\u201dPresident Trump has reversed himself on several longstanding positions over the past week.But he arrived at the White House surrounded by advisers who, like him, were neophytes to governing. His White House chief of staff, chief strategist, senior adviser, counselor and national economics adviser have no prior government experience of consequence. Nor do his secretaries of state, Treasury, commerce, housing or education.\u201cI\u2019ve probably never met a chief executive who didn\u2019t have a different perspective when they occupy that chair than when they\u2019re on the outside, whether you\u2019re a mayor or you\u2019re running a company,\u201d Mr. Hochberg said. \u201cAnd we ought to applaud people when they learn and they change their minds.\u201d\u201cAfter listening for 10 minutes, I realized that it\u2019s not so easy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou know, I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power over\u201d North Korea, he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s not what you would think.\u201d\u201cYou look at the president\u2019s position, where he wanted to see NATO, in particular, evolve to, and it\u2019s moving exactly in the direction that he said,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday.But the alliance has hardly changed in three months. Just three more members out of 28 have committed to raise military spending to target levels by next year, and the only shift in NATO\u2019s approach to terrorism was to create a new intelligence office before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u201cObviously, most presidents aren\u2019t nuclear scientists,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is important is that the White House provide a disciplined process for the experts to present their views, which are often differing. The president\u2019s role as the chief executive and decision maker is to listen to, question and probe the expert recommendations, then apply informed judgment to the decision.\u201dFollow Peter Baker at @peterbakernytAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bannon\u2019s Views Can Be Traced to a Book That Warns, \u2018Winter Is Coming\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Stephen K. Bannon has read the book three times. He still keeps a copy of it \u2014 one that\u2019s creased and copiously underlined \u2014 in a library with the rest of his favorites at his father\u2019s house in Richmond, Va.The book, \u201cThe Fourth Turning,\u201d a 1997 work by two amateur historians, Neil Howe and William Strauss, lays out a theory that American history unfurls in predictable, 80-year cycles of prosperity and catastrophe. And it foresees catastrophe right around the corner.The book delineates history into four seasonal cycles, or \u201cturnings\u201d: growth, maturation, decay and destruction. It is the kind of wild, provocative idea that Mr. Bannon loves. But it is also just the kind of thinking that his opponents see as evidence that he is too Machiavellian and idiosyncratic for the job of President Trump\u2019s chief strategist.The basis of his worldview \u2014 which has been described as everything from Leninist to alt-right, an extremist fringe movement associated with white nationalism \u2014 is still shrouded in mystery and conjecture. But by his own telling, much of the foundation for his political beliefs can be found in the book, which predicts that America is hurtling toward a crisis on par with the American Revolution, the Civil War and the Great Depression.And the grim future that the book foresees helps explain the underpinnings of the president\u2019s conservative, nationalist \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, one that Mr. Bannon has played a large role in shaping.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that the world is in the beginning state of a crisis that it can\u2019t avoid,\u201d Mr. Bannon said in a recent interview, before Mr. Trump removed him from the National Security Council and started contemplating a broader White House shake-up that could further marginalize him.But Mr. Bannon, choosing his words carefully, allowed that while he did not believe a cataclysm like global war was inevitable, failing to prepare as if one might happen would be foolish.\u201cEverything President Trump is doing \u2014 all of it \u2014 is to get ahead of or stop any potential crisis,\u201d Mr. Bannon added.But those who question Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon\u2019s motives say the central premise of \u201cThe Fourth Turning,\u201d with its religious subtext and dark premonitions, is a convenient excuse to sow fear and justify extreme action. Many academic historians dismiss the book as about as scientific as astrology or a Nostradamus text. And many will find reason for alarm in its conclusion that the coming crisis will demand loyalty and conformity from citizens.It also leads to unavoidable questions about war and whether Mr. Bannon, who has recommended the book to countless friends and made a film about it in 2010, is resigned to catastrophic global conflict. He says he is not. And he remains unconvinced that the United States can effectively intervene in overseas conflicts like the one unfolding in Syria. As one of the voices in the administration who expressed skepticism about a military strike in response to the Assad regime\u2019s chemical attack on its own citizens, Mr. Bannon insists he is no warmonger.In the interview, Mr. Bannon rattled off a list of White House policies that he said fit with the larger goal of strengthening the country for whatever calamity might await just over the horizon.They included starting the process of building a wall on the southern border, barring foreigners from seven predominantly Muslim nations, and taking steps that he said were meant \u201cto empower the secretary of defense, the C.I.A. to step up the war\u201d against radical Islam.\u201cI think it\u2019s very simple: You\u2019ve got to take care of the country,\u201d Mr. Bannon said. Ultimately, he added, America could reclaim its position as a keeper of peace and stability throughout the world. \u201cAmerica has to be strong \u2014 economically strong and militarily strong. And a strong America could be ultimately a provider of Pax Americana.\u201dBut to those who see Mr. Trump as someone who instigates crises, rather than defuses them, the knowledge that his senior strategist is an evangelist for a theory that forecasts the destruction of society as we know it is alarming.In their book, Mr. Howe and Mr. Strauss note the roughly 80-year intervals between catalytic events in American history like the Declaration of Independence (1776), the attack on Fort Sumter (1861) and the bombing of Pearl Harbor (1941). They predicted the next crisis would begin around 2005 and reach its climax sometime before 2025.\u201cHistory is seasonal, and winter is coming,\u201d they warn.Precipitating each fourth turning, the authors wrote, is a breakdown of the existing civic order and the institutions that prop it up.In an interview, Mr. Howe recalls getting an email about 10 years ago from Mr. Bannon, whom he had never heard of at the time, asking if he would participate in a film about the book. \u201cWe kind of blew him off,\u201d Mr. Howe, who is now a demographer at the investment firm Hedgeye Risk Management, said recently.Mr. Howe, who eventually agreed to be interviewed for the film, said that Mr. Bannon seemed to have no qualms about the destruction part of the cycle. \u201cThere is something beneficial about the creative destruction that comes with a fourth turning,\u201d Mr. Howe said. \u201cThere has to be a period in which we tear down everything that is no longer functional.\u201dMr. Bannon\u2019s suspicion of powerful institutions and the men and women who run them might seem at odds with his personal conservatism. He is a Catholic, a former Navy officer and a traditionalist in many ways. But Peter Schweizer, an author and frequent collaborator with Mr. Bannon on films and books, said Mr. Bannon believes the nation\u2019s elites arrogantly underestimate their own role in creating crises and then overestimate their ability to solve them.\u201cI do think the reason this theory is so powerful in Steve\u2019s mind is it kind of goes to the heart of his problem with elites,\u201d Mr. Schweizer said. \u201cHe does have a skeptical view of the limitations of human intellect. This notion that a few smart guys know how to quote unquote run a global economy is just laughable to him.\u201dIn the 2010 film, \u201cGeneration Zero,\u201d which was produced by Citizens United, whose films often attack favorite conservative targets like the Clintons, the screen flashes with foreboding imagery: a mushroom cloud from an atomic bomb, a shark fin skimming above the water, a guillotine blade falling.The film\u2019s thesis is that the financial collapse of 2009 was the beginning of the modern fourth turning. But Mr. Bannon sees not just a financial crisis unfolding. A deeper cultural crisis \u2014 selfishness, excessive political correctness and a lack of civic responsibility \u2014 has infected the country\u2019s political and economic institutions, which must be purged.Today Mr. Bannon is much more prudent about tossing out predictions of imminent catastrophe and conflict. But some who spoke with him for the film said he was not always so reticent.Mr. Bannon insisted that was not his view. \u201cYou\u2019re not inexorably pulled into this,\u201d he said. But it seemed undeniable to him that the book got a lot right about the general direction that America is headed.\u201cIn the \u2018Fourth Turning\u2019 theory you\u2019ve got a country that believes it\u2019s off course,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo-thirds of Americans now think we\u2019re on the wrong track. That\u2019s an extraordinary number.\u201dHe added, \u201cCertainly they feel the country is in some sort of crisis.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Plans Have Deal Makers Dreaming Big ($100-Billion-Cash-Takeover Big)", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "Supported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 It wasn\u2019t just cocktails on Bourbon Street or lucky breaks at the blackjack tables that contributed to the buoyant mood of the deal makers who gathered here last week. President Trump \u2014 and his support for lower taxes and lighter regulations \u2014 also had something to do with it.At a gathering of the nation\u2019s top mergers and acquisitions lawyers and bankers, the consensus was that under the Trump presidency, deal making should boom.Lower taxes and less regulation, the thinking goes, should contribute to strong stock prices. And when the markets are up, companies are more likely to strike big deals. Finally, the pro-business Trump administration, most deal makers believe, is likely to take a forgiving view when it comes to antitrust matters.Taken together, it was enough to lift the spirits of the lawyers, bankers and other advisers who attended Tulane University\u2019s mergers conference last week.Lawyers who attend earn legal credits (several lawyers said they eagerly awaited a panel discussion on the arcane matter known as shareholder appraisal rights, a topic that makes nonlawyers\u2019 eyes roll). But the real purpose of the event is to network, whether over butter-laden gulf fish at Galatoire\u2019s or sherried turtle soup at Commander\u2019s Palace or at the high-roller poker tables at Harrah\u2019s.Mergers data for the first three months of the year appeared to at least partly support that. Some 10,229 transactions, worth $771.3 billion, were announced in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. The dollar value was up 11 percent from the same time a year ago, although the number of deals was down about 11 percent.Yet doubts were already emerging about whether Mr. Trump will really usher in a boom time for mergers, with the failure of the Republican health care overhaul and the president\u2019s unpredictability threatening to dampen spirits.The tone for much of the conference was set as Kurt Simon, global chairman for mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan, made his bold prediction that an enterprising corporate giant today could assemble an all-cash takeover bid of $100 billion.\u201cThe U.S. economy is in really good shape,\u201d Mr. Simon said.For years, many of the panelists at Tulane argued vigorously that activist hedge funds trying to shake up companies were short-term investors and did not have the best interests of other shareholders at heart.Now, even the staunchest critics of these activist shareholders concede that the practice is here to stay.This conference was perhaps the first one in which an activist sat on stage with the chief executive of a company his firm had targeted. And each man sang the other\u2019s praises.\u201cI just want great outcomes,\u201d Mr. Hassell said when asked who deserved praise for the bank\u2019s turnaround. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue of who gets credit.\u201dAnd during another panel on activism, the entire group \u2014 advisers both to activists and to the companies those investors target \u2014 treated the practice as a permanent fixture on the corporate landscape.\u201cThe biggest change I\u2019ve seen in my practice is there is positive dialogue between the activist and the company for a settlement,\u201d she told the group.For lawyers in particular, one major draw of the conference is the chance to mingle with judges from Delaware, the corporate home for the vast majority of American companies.And in particular, that means hearing from the most quotable of them all: Leo E. Strine Jr., the chief justice of Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court.Mr. Strine is widely regarded as one of the sharpest minds on the Delaware bench, and almost certainly its sharpest wit.At the Roosevelt, he displayed the offbeat humor that laces his judicial opinions. He described one legally dubious situation as having a smell that was \u201cnot Bourbon Street when you\u2019re having fun, but Bourbon Street the next morning.\u201dNot all was sunshine at the Tulane conference, whether with the mercurial New Orleans weather or with the outlook on transactions.Panelists pointed to the rise of economic nationalism as a potential dampener on mergers. Both the Brunswick survey and Mr. Simon, of JPMorgan, cited a likely drop in offers for American companies by Chinese and Russian bidders.Then there was the prospect that the Republicans\u2019 failure to pass a replacement for Obama-era health care regulations made a sweeping tax law overhaul less likely. Some deal makers feared that the issues on which they most want to see reform \u2014 corporate tax rates and the taxation of sales made abroad and then brought back to the United States \u2014 could end up felled by political gridlock.\u201cPost-heath care, we have to consider a number of scenarios, one of which is that nothing happens,\u201d said Eileen T. Nugent of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.And finally, there is Mr. Trump himself, and his brand of economic populism.Merger proposals that would lead to big job cuts would be unlikely to go anywhere, George R. Bason Jr. of the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell said, calling such layoffs \u201ca tragedy for a lot of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Takes a Back Seat to Tesla as America\u2019s Most Valued Carmaker", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 By almost every measure, General Motors has been on a roll.Its bellwether pickups and sport utility vehicles have hit the sweet spot in a record-setting American market for two years. The company is steadily increasing profits and revenue. And President Trump has vowed to ease regulations and put cars at the forefront of his crusade to add manufacturing jobs.In short, G.M. has come a long way from a near-death experience eight years ago, when it filed for bankruptcy and needed a $49 billion government bailout. But apparently investors have yet to be convinced that G.M., the nation\u2019s largest automaker, has put its troubled past behind it.In a sign of how the industry\u2019s future is being reimagined, the electric-car maker Tesla passed G.M. on Monday as America\u2019s most valuable auto company.With its stock gaining more than 3 percent for the day to $312.39, Tesla has a market capitalization of $50.9 billion, just a hair ahead of G.M.\u2019s.G.M. is working hard to establish its own bona fides in automotive innovation, developing home-grown technology, acquiring or investing in Silicon Valley companies with promising approaches to self-driving or ride-hailing systems, and bringing a new electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt, to market.\u201cWe are spending money on the future, whether it is in mobility, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence or electrification,\u201d said Mark L.

And now an activist shareholder, the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, is pushing for a financial restructuring to unlock more of the company\u2019s value.But G.M. epitomizes both the frustration attached to the old American auto industry, and the determination to prove the skeptics wrong over the long term.A G.M. spokesman played down the company\u2019s loss of its title as the most valuable American automaker. \u201cWe have a track record of strong financial performance, with a great outlook for 2017,\u201d the spokesman, Tom Henderson, said on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay focused on delivering outstanding results, generating strong cash flows and investing capital where it will drive the highest returns.\u201dStill, G.M. executives know that investors worry whether the company owes its recent success mostly to a strong domestic market, buoyed by low oil prices that have indulged car buyers\u2019 tastes for big, profitable sport utility vehicles \u2014 conditions that could be at risk if the economy falters.\u201cNo one is going to believe we are for real until we successfully go through a downturn, and go through it well,\u201d Mr. Reuss said at a company event last week. \u201cWe have to prove it.\u201dThe company has taken some drastic steps recently to shed the baggage of past decades, when its desire to be the world\u2019s biggest automaker seemed to be its driving ambition.Moreover, the company has pared back incentives it once relied on to reduce bloated inventories, and eliminated factory shifts to better align production with demand.The newfound discipline, along with a consistent flow of new models, has helped G.M. outperform the United States market so far this year. Through March, its sales are up slightly less than 1 percent, while the industry over all is down 1.5 percent.The company is also aggressively updating older models and adding new ones. Its Buick division, for example, will take the wraps off new versions of its midsize Regal sedan and Enclave S.U.V. at media previews this week for the New York Auto Show. And the battery-powered Bolt has been on sale for months, while Tesla is still gearing up to produce its first mass-market electric car, the Model 3.Yet despite the expectations that G.M. will increase earnings and sales this year, the company suffers by comparison with Tesla, which has rarely made a profit but has huge potential to grow.Industry analysts see the race for stock market value as a competition tilted in favor of the little electric automaker that produces a fraction of the vehicles made by the big Detroit manufacturer.\u201cTesla is viewed as a high-tech start-up driven by lots of stock speculation, while G.M. is an old-line industrial business with lots of institutional investors,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the firm Autotrader.The frustration with G.M.\u2019s share price led Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund overseen by the billionaire investor David M. Einhorn, to propose creating two classes of stock \u2014 one that pays a dividend on the company\u2019s core business, and a second that tracks its growth in ventures such as autonomous vehicles and ride-hailing services.G.M.\u2019s board rejected the proposal, but the hedge fund \u2014 which owns about 3 percent of the company\u2019s stock, according to the automaker \u2014 has promised to take the fight to the annual meeting, likely to be held in June.The meeting could become a forum for Ms. Barra to defend the company\u2019s step-by-step strategy to innovate, while it continues to refine its older, core operations.Mr. Reuss, who has worked for G.M. for more than 30 years, said the company was taking a long view of its destiny, while at the same time defending its market share in North America and China.\u201cYears ago, G.M. was fixated on the next quarter or the next year \u2014 and not the next 10 years,\u201d he said.For now, the company can ill afford to allow a stagnant American market, or its costly restructuring efforts overseas, to crimp its momentum. Even the smallest setback could depress its market value \u2014 and allow Tesla to pull further ahead.\u201cThey have no choice but to keep focusing on what makes money, and that\u2019s selling pickup trucks and S.U.V.s,\u201d Ms. Krebs said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amtrak at a Junction: Invest in Improvements, or Risk Worsening Problems", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byWhen Amtrak\u2019s new chief executive took responsibility for two recent train derailments at Pennsylvania Station in New York, it was a low point for a railroad already confronting a series of urgent challenges.Commuters have long complained that the station is overcrowded and dreary, but now Amtrak had acknowledged that its tracks were in poor shape and not being properly maintained.Today, Amtrak finds itself at a crossroad: Is the 46-year-old national railroad at the cusp of a new era of investment as it pushes to build a train tunnel between New York and New Jersey \u2014 one of the country\u2019s largest infrastructure proposals \u2014 or will service deteriorate to levels that could damage the economy in the corridor between Washington and Boston?Without major investments, the kinds of recent upheavals that have upended the lives of hundreds of thousands of travelers will be difficult to avoid, said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School.\u201cIf a bridge collapses, would people say, \u2018Oh, sorry, that just proves we shouldn\u2019t invest in bridges\u2019?\u201d she said. \u201cNo, they\u2019d fix it.\u201dBut Amtrak, a favorite punching bag for Republicans, could face major cuts under President Trump. His budget proposed eliminating federal funding for Amtrak\u2019s long-distance routes and would slash a grant program that Amtrak was counting on to build a new Hudson River rail tunnel. Yet many long-distance routes traverse parts of the country that voted for Mr. Trump, including the City of New Orleans line, which runs between Chicago and New Orleans.Then there is the fragile infrastructure at Penn Station, North America\u2019s busiest train station. The recent derailments closed several tracks, leading to cancellations and delays across the three railroads that share the station: Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road.On April 14, a New Jersey Transit train became stuck in the Hudson River tunnel for hours, setting off another round of delays and harsh words between Amtrak and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who had already threatened to halt his state\u2019s payments to the railroad as a result of the earlier derailments.\u201cThe number of trains and the number of people going through there are double what they were years ago,\u201d Mr. Moorman said in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve had this place where we weren\u2019t putting enough money in while the demand was growing.\u201dAmtrak has struggled, amid competing demands, to schedule maintenance work at the congested station, Mr. Moorman said. Not only must the railroad coordinate track closings with other railroads, but it also has to juggle the needs of bigger projects like building a new train hall in the James A. Farley Building across from Penn Station, a plan important to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York.\u201cWhat we have to do is work with these folks and make sure that we prioritize correctly,\u201d Mr. Moorman said. \u201cClearly, my priority is to make sure we do the work so this kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201dTo address safety concerns, Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration are inspecting all of the track infrastructure at Penn Station. Mr. Moorman also said he would lead a review of Amtrak\u2019s maintenance practices and its engineering departments.There were 178 derailments on Amtrak from 2010 to 2016, and 73 of the accidents, or 41 percent, were a result of track problems, according to federal statistics. Still, despite recent high-profile accidents, the number of derailments at Amtrak has remained relatively flat in recent years. There were 22 last year, down from 79 in 2000.Ever since Amtrak was created in 1971 to bring together many ailing rail lines, it has struggled to become profitable. It now carries more than 31 million riders annually, up from about 22.5 million in 2000. More than a third of Amtrak\u2019s trips take place on the Northeast Corridor.Federal subsidies to Amtrak, which reached a high of $1.7 billion in 1999, have remained relatively flat in recent years even as its needs have grown. Last year, Amtrak requested about $1.8 billion from the federal government, but wound up getting about $1.4 billion.For much of Amtrak\u2019s history, a tight budget has forced it to make difficult choices between spending on maintenance or new equipment, said John C. Spychalski, professor emeritus of supply chain management at Pennsylvania State University.\u201cIt\u2019s existed hand-to-mouth, patchwork to patchwork, to a great degree,\u201d he said.In an interview with The New York Times this month, Mr. Trump refused to say whether he would support the Gateway tunnel. But Mr. Christie, a Republican who once led Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team and backs the tunnel plan, said recently that he had discussed the project with Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019ve spoken personally to the president about the project many times, and I am absolutely convinced that the president understands the importance of the project,\u201d Mr. Christie told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him talk about this and say that it\u2019s the most important infrastructure project in the country.\u201dStill, Mr. Christie held a news conference recently alongside Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, to urge the new federal transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, to visit New Jersey to see the tunnel\u2019s crumbling walls for herself. A spokeswoman for Ms. Chao said that was on her to-do list.Amtrak\u2019s decision to hire Mr. Moorman, a former chairman of Norfolk Southern, a freight rail operator, was widely praised. After earning millions of dollars in his previous job, Mr. Moorman declined to accept a salary and says he simply wants to help.\u201cIt is a big catch to get a major, experienced, well-respected private sector rail operator,\u201d said Ms. Kanter, the Harvard Business School professor. \u201cThat adds a lot of credibility.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said Amtrak\u2019s recent problems might prompt Congress to offer more support for the railroad.\u201cThe most vexing thing here, that really is just troubling, is this could have been prevented,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in an interview, referring to the derailments.In a letter to Congress in February 2016, Amtrak\u2019s last chief executive, Joseph H. Boardman, warned that the railroad\u2019s \u201coutdated and inadequate infrastructure\u201d must be replaced. After nearly eight years on the job, Mr. Boardman called once more for higher levels of federal investment.The letter was prescient.\u201cMy successor, if he or she is fortunate enough to spend as many years in this position as I have, will not have much time,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto reverse current trends before they adversely affect our performance and the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Armed Civilian Bands in Venezuela Prop Up Unpopular President", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 The bikers thundered up in a phalanx of red jackets and dark clothes, some with faces covered, revving motorcycles before a thousand protesters in Caracas. They threw tear gas canisters to disperse the crowd. Then, witnesses say, they pulled pistols and fired.Someone fell. Carlos Moreno, 17, lay sprawled on the ground, a pool of blood around his head.\u201cHis brain matter was coming out,\u201d recalled Carlos Julio Rojas, a community leader who witnessed the fatal shooting in Venezuela\u2019s capital on Wednesday.The uniformed men who shot Mr. Moreno were not government security forces, witnesses say. Rather, they were members of armed bands who have become key enforcers for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as he attempts to crush a growing protest movement against his rule.The groups, called collectives or colectivos in Spanish, originated as pro-government community organizations that have long been a part of the landscape of leftist Venezuelan politics. Civilians with police training, colectivo members are armed by the government, say experts who have studied them.Colectivos control vast territory across Venezuela, financed in some cases by extortion, black-market food and parts of the drug trade as the government turns a blind eye in exchange for loyalty.Now they appear to be playing a key role in repressing dissent.Hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Caracas and other cities demanding elections in Venezuela. Galvanized by a ruinous economy that has left basic foods and medicines scarce \u2014 as well as a botched attempt by leftists to dissolve the country\u2019s congress last month \u2014 they present the largest threat to the country\u2019s rulers since a coup that briefly ousted Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, in 2002.Mr. Maduro has responded by sending National Guardsmen armed with water cannons and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds. But alongside the security forces, experts and witnesses say, are the enforcers from the colectivos, who engage in fiercer and often deadly intimidation.\u201cThese are the true paramilitary groups of Venezuela,\u201d said Roberto Brice\u00f1o-Le\u00f3n, director of the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, a nonprofit group that tracks crime.The presence of the colectivos hardly ends with demonstrations on the streets.As rising foreign debt and falling world oil prices have depleted the Venezuelan government\u2019s coffers, it has increasingly turned to colectivos as enforcers. From labor disputes with unions to student demonstrations on university campuses, colectivos are appearing almost anywhere the government sees citizens getting out of line, Venezuelans say.Eladio Mata, a hospital union leader, says he was shot last year by colectivo members when negotiations deadlocked with the University Hospital of Caracas.Mr. Mata said he had arrived to the front door of the hospital to find colectivo members blocking it. They were called, he said, by the hospital management. Staff members tried to help him force his way through, he said, but a colectivo member shot him in the back. He was then dragged into an operating room for emergency surgery.\u201cIn this country, it\u2019s prohibited to dissent,\u201d Mr. Mata said.Dr. Oscar Noya, a tropical infectious disease researcher, said his laboratory had been vandalized almost 30 times by colectivo members, who had destroyed equipment and taken electrical cables.Dr. Noya said his repeated complaints to the authorities had been met largely with silence and that the colectivos had \u201creached a level of total impunity.\u201dExperts say the colectivos date to the early days of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who originally conceived them as social organizations to advance his vision of a Socialist revolution to transform Venezuela\u2019s poor neighborhoods. Many had their own names, flags and uniforms. The government eventually handed them arms and security training as well, deploying them as a separate militia.As the groups became more powerful, they exerted their own influence independent of the government, most notably in controlling organized crime like drug trafficking in Caracas barrios.Their power was so great that some even clashed with the police in 2014, part of an effort to oust an interior minister who had sought to curb them. More recently, others have fought deadly shootouts with soldiers in military operations to stop organized crime.Today, the groups control 10 percent of towns and cities in Venezuela, according to Ferm\u00edn M\u00e1rmol, a criminologist at the University of Santa Mar\u00eda in Caracas. Mr. M\u00e1rmol said the deep left-wing ideological bent of the groups means they will defend Mr. Maduro at any cost.\u201cIf tomorrow the revolution loses the presidency, the colectivos will immediately change to urban guerrilla warfare,\u201d the criminologist said.The colectivo bands have been accused of repeated attacks on journalists covering their activities in the streets. However, in rare interviews in the past, group leaders have denied criminal activity and said they primarily defended the leftist cause.Despite their attacks against dissenters, for some poor Venezuelans, the colectivos are a source of order that people have come to accept.On Thursday, in the neighborhood of La Vega, a working-class Caracas area roiled by protests, residents looked on as a band that they identified as members of a local colectivo stopped at a traffic circle during a patrol.Haide Lira, 58, an administrative assistant who lives on the edge of the neighborhood, said clashes between protesters and the colectivos had startled residents. Her sympathies were drifting away from the protesters. \u201cYou don\u2019t push out a government this way,\u201d she said.Of the colectivos, she said: \u201cThey put order where there is disorder. It\u2019s true, they are armed civilians, but what can you do in this upside-down world of ours?\u201dBut their attacks on protesters have traumatized many demonstrators in Caracas, like Mr. Rojas, who witnessed the death of Carlos Moreno, the teenager.The demonstrators, he said, had tried in vain to save Carlos, pushing his limp body onto a motorcycle to be taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.Some of the crowd tried to pursue the assailants, but were restrained by others who said it would be useless, witnesses said.Mr. Rojas, who works with opposition politicians, said he had become used to the attacks, which have long been a fixture of his activism.\u201cThey attack your neighbors when they are in food lines and are identified as opposition members, they attack store owners by making them pay extortions, they attack bakers by taking away part of their production which they later sell on the black market,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not true collectives, or political actors \u2014 they are criminals.\u201dPatricia Torres reported from Caracas, and Nicolas Casey from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

{"Headline": "Macron Wants to Change France. But Will Voters Elect an Unknown?", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byBAGN\u00c8RES-DE-BIGORRE, France \u2014 In the final days before France\u2019s presidential election on Sunday, Emmanuel Macron was tramping through the snow high in the mountains near the Spanish border for a critical campaign stop near this tiny village where his grandparents once lived.With the race exceptionally tight, it seemed an unlikely place for any candidate. Hardly a voter was in sight. Instead, what Mr. Macron later described as a \u201cpilgrimage,\u201d with some 20 journalists in tow, was in part intended to show his human side, to reflect his connection to a \u201cterroir\u201d \u2014 a definable place and personal history \u2014 that French voters could latch onto.With no political party to speak of, and never having held elected office, Mr. Macron, 39, a onetime investment banker and former economy minister, is leading an improbable quest to become modern France\u2019s youngest president. His profile is that of an insider, but his policies are those of an outsider. If the ever-precocious Mr. Macron is to succeed, his first challenge is to sell a product still largely unfamiliar to almost everyone: himself.Mr. Macron is so close to Ms. Le Pen, leader of the National Front, that it is difficult to say who is the front-runner. But Mr. Macron is buoyed by the fact that more than half of French voters support candidates other than those from the traditional, mainstream parties.Mr. Macron has begun a new political movement, En Marche!, which means \u201cForward\u201d or Onward,\u201d that draws from both sides of the political spectrum. He is gambling that his postpartisan philosophy matches the national mood.But the smartest kid in the class is not always the one who wins. Though he has already checked virtually every box required for a successful career among the French elite, Mr. Macron may actually be the kind of change agent France fears.In a runoff \u2014 presuming both he and Ms. Le Pen get through to the final round \u2014 she would be the political placeholder, the vote to preserve or restore a nostalgic (critics say outmoded) vision of France and one that revives nationalism and fans anti-Muslim sentiments. She has expanded her movement by assailing globalization \u2014 the European Union, the loss of French jobs and an influx of migrants.Mr. Macron is the establishment\u2019s anti-establishment candidate. He tilts at sacred cows \u2014 retirement benefits, employee protections \u2014 with an eye toward making France more business-friendly, while professing he will preserve its social safety net. Many question whether he will really be able to do both at the same time.Despite the political risks, Mr. Macron has proudly embraced an unpopular European Union, and preached tolerance toward immigrants and Muslims never beloved in France, and even less so since the 2015 terrorist attacks.Yet he has clearly struck a chord with many voters, despite being \u201can unidentified political object,\u201d as Pascal Perrineau, a political science professor at Sciences Po in Paris, described him.\u201cThis is a man who, certainly, began his career in the Socialist Party, and he says that he is not a centrist,\u201d Mr. Perrineau said. Yet, \u201che is, as he says, from the right and from the left and this is an invention that our political family has not seen before.\u201dThe visit to Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre \u2014 almost four years to the day since Mr. Macron\u2019s grandmother died \u2014 was a chance for the candidate to further define himself. At once sincere and strategic, the excursion was designed to portray him as someone with roots in the \u201creal\u201d France of villages and hard-working rural people.\u201cThe journey I made today brought to mind many memories,\u201d Mr. Macron later told a crowd of 5,000 at an evening rally nearby in Pau, a city of nearly 80,000, adding that it was where he used to reunite with his grandmother, \u201cwhom I loved so much.\u201d\u201cIt was she and my grandfather who for years and years led me to live in Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre, to walk there, to run there, to learn how to bicycle, to ski, to be rooted in our country,\u201d he said.Born and raised in Amiens, about 70 miles from Paris, Mr. Macron is the eldest of three children. Both parents are doctors. He attended a parochial school founded by Jesuits. When he was 15, he met Brigitte Trogneux, a teacher of French and drama with whom he fell in love. About 24 years his senior, she tried initially to discourage him, but he was determined and she was eventually smitten.In a documentary broadcast on the France 3 television network, she recalled the year he went off to finish high school in Paris at the prestigious Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV. \u201cHe called me all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe spent hours on the telephone. Little by little he conquered all my resistance in a manner that was incredible \u2014 with patience.\u201dShe ultimately divorced her first husband and the father of her three children. One of them, a daughter, is working on Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign. The student and his teacher married in 2007.Their love affair was the kind of audacious undertaking that has defined Mr. Macron\u2019s life and career. His sheer drive, his focus and his willingness to leapfrog in a country where most success is built step by step make him more like the entrepreneurs he admires than a typical politician.A product of top schools, including the prestigious Sciences Po and the \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration, Mr. Macron won a coveted place in an elite auditing body at the Finance Ministry before leaving to join the investment bank Rothschild & Company.Although he knew little about investment banking, in four years at the firm Mr. Macron was promoted from director to managing director. He earned nearly 2.9 million euros ($3.1 million) in those years, according to the financial disclosure form from when he was economy minister.By 2014, at 36, he was appointed minister of economy under France\u2019s current Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, before leaving to begin his campaign. His one significant achievement was passage of what became known as the Macron Law, a hodgepodge of economic policies mostly designed to cut red tape and make markets more flexible.Those who have worked closely with Mr. Macron, both in government and in the private sector, are almost uniformly impressed by his grasp and dedication, but some said that at times they felt misled as Mr. Macron pursued his ambitions.Francis Vercamer, a member of the center-right Union of Democrats and Independents, remembers proposing several amendments to the Macron Law in private and said that the economy minister spoke positively about them. But when Mr. Vercamer later brought them up in debate on the legislation, Mr. Macron turned down every one, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it was dishonest because that\u2019s not the right term,\u201d said Mr. Vercamer, who was a vice president of the committee that examined the bill. \u201cBut for someone who comes to a private meeting and says, \u2018This is good,\u2019 and then comes to a public meeting and doesn\u2019t support you and doesn\u2019t give a reason, that\u2019s not worthy of a representative of the Republic.\u201dThe idea of what Mr. Macron represents as a candidate \u2014 a novel amalgam of pro-business and pro-social welfare policies, with an optimistic outlook on France\u2019s future \u2014 often seems to inspire more than Mr. Macron himself.At his recent rally in Pau, the crowd seemed a bit more enthusiastic before he spoke than afterward when some seemed baffled by his lofty proposals. He has been criticized as being technocratic, abstract and sometimes lacking in empathy.The young man called out to the neatly attired former banker, saying he had \u201cnot a penny to pay for a suit like that one.\u201dMr. Macron responded: \u201cThe best way to pay for a suit is to work.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve worked since the age of 16,\u201d the man shot back, in an exchange popularly interpreted as having put Mr. Macron in his place.Mr. Macron\u2019s policy proposals, while numerous, have been assailed as vague and hard to define politically, particularly for a country that thinks in terms of the political left and right. But to others, that is his appeal.Jacques Attali, an economist, writer and longtime adviser to French politicians, said that many of Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas were forged working on a prestigious nonpartisan economic commission set up under the right-leaning President Nicolas Sarkozy.\u201cThe idea behind the commission was to do something that should have been done by either the left or the right, or by both, but that had not been done by anyone,\u201d said Mr. Attali, who served as the commission\u2019s chairman.That embrace of bipartisanship can result in neither side trusting him.\u201cIn a way, the left doesn\u2019t really believe in him; in a way, the right doesn\u2019t really believe in him,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel, a well-known writer on politics and culture, who also hosts a popular radio program on France Culture.Yet there are many people who do, particularly among the urban, educated and relatively young.\u201cHe has a kind of free spirit that one can see in the choices he\u2019s made,\u201d said Am\u00e9lie Castera, a longtime friend of Mr. Macron\u2019s who studied with him at the \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration and now holds a senior position at AXA, the French insurance giant.\u201cHe has this freedom that comes from his confidence in his destiny,\u201d she said.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Hardtop MX-5 Miata RF Gains Elegance but Loses Openness", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byDrivenDo you like the idea of slicing through traffic in a Mazda MX-5 Miata but have stopped short of owning it for fear vandals will slice through the soft top? Two letters should alleviate that anxiety: RF. This version of Mazda\u2019s diminutive smile machine has a solid folding roof impervious to knives. It\u2019s quieter while driving with the top up, too.For those who know and love the Miata (a moniker used only in the United States), fear not. The extra weight of the RF \u2014 for retractable fastback \u2014 is kept to 113 pounds and gives the car perfect 50/50 balance front to rear. The suspension is tweaked to compensate for the mechanism\u2019s additional mass.Unlike the awkward appearance of the retractable hardtop model discontinued a few years ago, the RF\u2019s roofline provides a newfound stubby elegance. I was even asked if my tester, coated in rich Machine Gray paint, was Italian. The top also gives everyone within 50 feet a ballet performance as the buttresses rise rearward and the roof panel pirouettes back behind the two seats.For an encore, the 13-second operation can happen while motoring through a parking lot at up to six miles an hour. The crowd goes wild.As expected, the RF is more expensive. To begin with, it\u2019s not available on the base Sport model that gets sun worshipers into a soft top MX-5 for $25,750. RF demands moving to the Club or Grand Touring models. The hardtop costs $2,955 for the Club (which starts at $32,430), or $2,555 for the tested GT ($33,495). Unlike a soft top, it never needs to be replaced because of weathering or age. Or hooligans.Those craving the open-sky feeling of the original MX-5 will feel claustrophobic. Only the roof panel above tucks away. The rear structure remains, making the RF something less than a convertible. Checking rearward for a lane change? The view is mostly of the pillar. Fortunately, blind spot detection is standard.The rear hardware also generates a good amount of wind noise in the cabin above 40 m.p.h. If memory serves, my hair was tousled a bit more in the RF, too.Everything else that\u2019s right about the MX-5 experience remains. Full disclosure: I\u2019ve owned an original year Miata for over 27 years. Each time I drop into the driver\u2019s seat of any generation, there\u2019s an automatic grin reflex. It\u2019s a car that\u2019s worn like a jet pack or Ironman\u2019s suit. Tire grip is clearly felt. Brakes bite firmly and progressively. There\u2019s communication with the road without harshness. It fits like a glove. For large and tall people, it will be a snug one.The powertrain stays the same. A 2-liter 4-cylinder provides 155 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque. Choose between a 6-speed manual and an optional 6-speed automatic with steering wheel paddle shifters. Power is routed to the rear tires.Mazda says 60 percent of MX-5s are sold with the manual gearbox, possibly the highest rate in the industry for cars offering the choice. The manual is widely considered among the best in the business. I understand why automatics are popular for those slogging though traffic jams. I\u2019m not a card-carrying member of the Save the Manuals club, but I\u2019ll opine that it\u2019s the way to go in this car. The precision snickety-snick dynamic of the short throw lever is a joy, not a chore.Miatas are all about balance, not brute force. Dashing from stoplight to 60 m.p.h. in about 6.5 seconds is plenty quick. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s fuel economy rating is unchanged from the soft top.

{"Headline": "Trump Is Said to Abandon Contentious Border Tax on Imports", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration has dropped any support for a so-called border adjustment tax on imports, according to two people who have been briefed on the matter.The tax was intended to be the keystone of a tax reform proposal developed by Republican leaders in the House of Representatives. But it faced immense pushback from influential companies including Walmart and Toyota.If enacted, a border adjustment tax would have effectively imposed significant levies on billions of dollars of imported goods. Retailers in particular would have been hard hit, as products ranging from tires to T-shirts, which are imported from overseas, would have suddenly cost more. Automakers and other manufacturers that rely heavily on foreign parts and supplies would have also been hit.The border tax may be revisited later, one of these people said, but it was shelved ahead of the Wednesday release of the White House\u2019s new tax plan. A White House spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters, did not respond to requests for comment. President Trump had always seemed ambivalent toward the border tax.In a late February interview with Reuters, Mr. Trump said the border tax \u201ccould lead to a lot more jobs in the United States.\u201d But the proposal received a mixed reception among his top aides; whereas chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon supported it, National Economic Council director Gary Cohn opposed it.The change of heart comes as Mr. Trump is rushing to reveal bold policy ideas ahead of the 100th day of his presidency, which falls on Saturday. In a public announcement on Wednesday, Mr. Trump is expected to lay out a broad tax plan that includes lowering corporate taxes to 15 percent.Dropping the border tax intensifies the political challenges of his plan for taxes. Under the plan by House Republicans, it was supposed to offset the revenue lost by other tax cuts. By just lowering corporate taxes, the budget deficit is expected to increase.Increasing the deficit has always been a deal killer for most Republicans in Congress. However, the powerful chairman of the Senate finance committee said Tuesday he was prepared to support President Trump\u2019s plan to cut corporate tax rates to 15 percent even if it added to the budget deficit.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Republican finance committee chairman, is a critical voice on tax issues in Congress and support from him could make the difference in whether members of Congress fall in line and support the president\u2019s proposal.Republicans in Congress have generally been against tax cuts that add to the deficit. But many argue that now is the party\u2019s opportunity to bring sweeping and enduring changes to the tax code.\u201cI\u2019m open to getting this country moving,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. He said that if the tax cut could stimulate the economy, then he was not as bothered by the impact it had on budget deficits. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure we have to go that route, but if we do, I can live with it,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.The comments came as Republican congressional leaders were preparing to huddle with President Trump\u2019s economic team ahead of the administration\u2019s rollout of its tax plan on Wednesday. Mr. Trump has told his staff that he wants to slash the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent even if doing so increased the federal budget deficit.Mr. Hatch, of Utah, said that he was not sure how the Congressional Budget Office would analyze the corporate tax plan that Mr. Trump is expected to propose. Republicans are planning to rely on \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d that accounts for economic growth created by the tax cuts to show that they would not increase the deficit.\u201cWhether 15 percent is the right figure or not, that\u2019s something to be determined,\u201d Mr. Hatch added.Mr. Hatch had expressed skepticism on Monday about such a low corporate tax rate because, under the Senate\u2019s reconciliation rules, changes to the tax code that reduce tax revenue expire after 10 years. Republicans are looking to use this maneuver to pass legislation with a simple majority that does not need to rely on votes from Democrats.Democrats remain vehemently opposed to any tax legislation that offers big tax cuts for the rich. The idea of slashing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent appeared to be a nonstarter with Democrats, who have been critical of Republicans for shutting them out of discussions about tax reform.\u201cWith respect to taxes, getting both sides together is the winning way,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the finance committee.Mr. Wyden said that Mr. Trump should heed the lessons from the failed effort of Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act without input from Democrats. He also warned that using reconciliation to approve tax cuts would not fulfill the president\u2019s promise to make the economy more competitive.\u201cThe track record shows it\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Airstrike in Syria Overshadows Meeting Between Trump and Xi", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byPALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Trump welcomed President Xi Jinping of China here for a first meeting on Friday that ended up being less about great-power collaboration than a chance for the Chinese leader to witness a raw display of American military might.Hours after Mr. Trump ordered Tomahawk cruise missiles to be fired on a Syrian airfield, he pressed Mr. Xi to use China\u2019s leverage to curb another rogue government, North Korea\u2019s. Mr. Trump repeated his warning that if China did not do more, the United States would act on its own to constrain the belligerent actions of North Korea\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong-un.The president also brought up the chronic trade imbalance between China and the United States. A senior administration official said Mr. Trump had told Mr. Xi that the two sides needed to begin addressing that deficit immediately, prompting China to propose a 100-day plan to overhaul the trade relationship between the world\u2019s largest economies.Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said Mr. Trump had told the Chinese leader that there needed to be \u201cconcrete steps to level the playing field for American workers.\u201d A second senior administration official said the tone in the one-on-one exchanges on trade had been \u201ctough,\u201d though he said there was chemistry between the two men.The 100-day project was the only tangible announcement to come out of a meeting that few expected to be much more than a get-acquainted exercise, held at Mr. Trump\u2019s palm-fringed resort, Mar-a-Lago. In the end, even the rituals of superpower summitry were largely overshadowed by the drama unfolding in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.Around 8:40 p.m. on Thursday, as the leaders were finishing a dinner of pan-seared Dover sole and dry-aged prime New York strip, Mr. Trump told Mr. Xi that he had ordered a barrage of missiles to be fired at Syria to punish it for the deadly chemical weapons attack by the government of Bashar al-Assad. According to Mr. Tillerson, Mr. Xi told the president he understood that a military response was necessary \u201cwhen people are killing children.\u201dMr. Tillerson\u2019s account of Mr. Xi\u2019s reaction was somewhat more supportive than the Chinese government\u2019s official response. On Friday, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, repeated China\u2019s call for a \u201cpolitical settlement\u201d in Syria to prevent the situation from deteriorating further.Administration officials said the missile strike had not disrupted the meeting. In fact, they said, it might have strengthened Mr. Trump\u2019s hand as he called on the Chinese to exercise more pressure on North Korea. While officials noted that North Korea poses different, and in some ways more formidable, challenges than Syria, the parallel of a rogue government that possesses weapons of mass destruction was not lost on the Chinese.Mr. Xi told Mr. Trump he agreed that the threat posed by North Korea had reached a \u201cvery serious stage,\u201d according to Mr. Tillerson. Days before the meeting, Pyongyang tested another intermediate-range ballistic missile. But the Chinese made no new offers about how to deal with Mr. Kim\u2019s government, according to an American official.The Chinese also brought no concessions on trade to the meeting, beyond the 100-day plan. Mr. Trump intends to sign an executive order to penalize countries for dumping steel into the American market, a move that would be aimed at China. Administration officials declined to discuss the order, and it was not clear whether they had presented it to the Chinese.\u201cThere are areas where they clearly want to work with us,\u201d said the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. He said the administration\u2019s \u201cobjective is to increase our exports to them.\u201dWilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said the 100-day plan was ambitious, given that trade negotiations usually stretch for years. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big sea change in the pace of discussions,\u201d he said.In their spare public comments, the two leaders glossed over longstanding sources of friction. Facing each other under chandeliers and across a horseshoe table at Mar-a-Lago, the presidents spoke of their budding personal ties.\u201cWe have made tremendous progress in our relationship with China,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cLots of very potentially bad problems will be going away.\u201d Mr. Xi replied in Mandarin that the talks had accomplished many things, \u201cmost important being deepening our friendship and building a kind of trust in keeping with the Sino-U.S. working relationship and friendship.\u201dThe summit meeting bore similarities to President Barack Obama\u2019s meeting with Mr. Xi at the Sunnylands estate in Southern California in 2013, though it was shorter. Before lunch, Mr. Trump took Mr. Xi on a brief tour of the manicured grounds at Mar-a-Lago, gesturing to points of interest and the vista of the Atlantic Ocean beyond.On Friday morning, Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, and Mr. Xi\u2019s wife, Peng Liyuan, visited a middle school that specializes in arts, dance, music and theater. They listened as 80 girls sang \u201cAstonishing,\u201d a song about the empowerment of women. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump\u2019s granddaughter Arabella sang in Mandarin to the two couples, and her brother Joseph greeted them.The two sides also agreed to create a new high-level dialogue, led by Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, to discuss issues ranging from diplomacy and security to economics and social problems. On Friday morning, Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers kicked off the dialogue, meeting for breakfast with their Chinese counterparts at two tables on the patio at Mar-a-Lago.In addition to Mr. Xi and his wife, the Chinese delegation included four members of the Politburo \u2014 a rare turnout of Communist Party brass to an American summit meeting. Mr. Xi invited Mr. Trump to visit China in 2017, and the president accepted, though Mr. Tillerson said he would have to consult a calendar to see if it could happen this year.Reading from a White House statement, Mr. Tillerson said the United States sought a relationship with China based on \u201cmutual interest.\u201d That is one of several phrases that the Chinese government frequently uses, and it can be interpreted to mean deferring to Beijing\u2019s interests on delicate issues like Taiwan, Tibet or the South China Sea.American officials said the Chinese had pushed for the United States to use several other phrases in the statement, including \u201cwin-win solutions,\u201d which Mr. Tillerson used during a visit to China last month and for which he was criticized by China experts. The Chinese also pushed to issue a joint statement, which the Trump administration rejected.Mr. Tillerson did not say whether Mr. Trump had pressed Mr. Xi on specific human rights issues.\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to have a separate conversation, somehow separate our core values around human rights from our economic discussions, our military-to-military discussions or our foreign policy discussions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re really embedded in every discussion.\u201dPerhaps the greatest difference between this meeting and the ones Mr. Xi held with Mr. Obama had to do with the environment, a major area of cooperation between the two countries during the previous administration. Mr. Trump has made it clear that climate change is no longer a priority for the United States, and the Chinese appeared to drop it from the agenda as well.\u201cThat was not a major part of the discussion,\u201d Mr. Ross said, \u201cnor do I recall the Chinese specifically raising it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The American Dream Meets a Central American Nightmare", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIt is an unprecedented time in a nation\u2019s political history. A neophyte politician \u2014 a man famous for lowbrow TV antics who has never held political office \u2014 is vying to become president. He feeds on simmering discontent about the corruption of the political establishment and mainstream politicians. Backed by extreme right-wing elements, he makes vague promises and trumpets his lack of political experience as a reason to vote for him. His competition is a former first lady married to a left-leaning ex-president. She is an altogether polarizing figure considered by a large portion of the electorate to be deeply corrupt.Surprising all the pundits, he rides a wave of populist anger to victory.Sound familiar? Yes, but it is also the story of Guatemala\u2019s 2015 presidential election. The politician is a man named Jimmy Morales, a clownish talk-show comedian who ran on the ticket of an extreme right-wing political party called the National Convergence Front. His oft-repeated campaign slogan was \u201cNeither corrupt nor a thief.\u201dAt first glance, the uncanny parallels between President Morales\u2019s and President Trump\u2019s victories may seem mere coincidence. In many ways, the two nations could not be more distinct. Guatemala has long been one of the Western Hemisphere\u2019s most unequal societies, and for generations the American dream has lured hundreds of thousands of Guatemalans seeking to escape poverty and insecurity.And yet in the United States, the promise of a better future that animates the American dream \u2014 not only for poor migrants but also for American working-class families \u2014 has been in retreat for decades. Since the 1970s, the gap between rich and poor has widened inexorably. And now, the aspirations of right-wing United States lawmakers may portend even deeper and more disturbing convergences between Central American nightmares and the fading American dream.The United States is still a beacon for Central Americans desperate for a better life. Last July, I spoke with a 20-year-old Guatemalan man named Wilmer who was traveling through Mexico and looking to cross into the United States. \u201cFor poor people like me, my country is like a cage with no way out,\u201d Wilmer said as he waited with dozens of other Central Americans to hop a northbound freight train. \u201cAnd we all know that this journey is dangerous. We might fail, we might even die. But at least there\u2019s some hope at the end of it.\u201dFor now, the American dream is alive and kicking. How terrifying, though, to imagine a future in which the hope that the United States has come to represent for poor Central Americans is extinguished, not because of some \u201cbig beautiful wall\u201d but because entrenched inequality has made it a monstrous doppelg\u00e4nger of their own societies.Anthony W.

{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren on Big Banks and Their (Cozy Bedmate) Regulators", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byFair GameHow could such pernicious practices at the bank be allowed for so long? Why didn\u2019t the board do more to stop the scheme or the incentive programs that encouraged it? And where, oh where, were the regulators?Wells Fargo\u2019s management has conceded making multiple mistakes over many years; it also says it has learned from them. In a meeting this week with reporters at The New York Times, Timothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, said the bank had made substantive changes to its structure and culture to ensure that dubious practices won\u2019t take hold again.But there\u2019s a deeper explanation for why Wells Fargo\u2019s corrosive sales practices came about and continued for years. And it has everything to do with the bank-friendly regulatory regime in Washington and the immense sway that institutions like Wells Fargo have there. This poisonous combination contributes to a sense among giant banking institutions that they answer to no one.\u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight\u201d contains juicy but depressing anecdotes about how our most trusted institutions have let us down. It also shows why, years after the financial crisis, big banks are still large, in charge and, basically, unaccountable for their actions.\u201cIn too many of these organizations, there are rewards for cheating and punishments for calling out the cheaters,\u201d Ms. Warren said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cAs long as that\u2019s the case, the biggest financial institutions will continue to put their customers and the economy at risk.\u201dMs. Warren\u2019s no-nonsense views are bracing. But they are also informed by a thorough understanding of how dysfunctional Washington now is. This failure has cost Main Street dearly, she said, but has benefited the powerful.This week, Ms. Warren called for the ouster of the company\u2019s directors and a criminal inquiry into the bank.\u201cYes, the board should be removed, but that\u2019s not enough,\u201d she told me. \u201cThere still needs to be a criminal investigation. The expertise is in the regulatory agencies, but the power to prosecute lies mostly with the Justice Department, and if they don\u2019t have either the energy or the talent \u2014 or the backbone \u2014 to go after the big banks, then there will never be any real accountability.\u201dBanks are not the only targets in Ms. Warren\u2019s book. Others include Wal-Mart, for its treatment of employees; for-profit education companies, for the way they pile debt on unsuspecting students; the Chamber of Commerce, for battling Main Street; and prestigious think tanks, for their undisclosed conflicts of interest.My favorite moments in the book involve the phenomenon of regulatory capture: the pernicious condition in which institutions that are supposed to police the nation\u2019s financial behemoths actually come to view them as clients or pals.One telling moment took place in 2005, when Ms. Warren, then a Harvard law professor, was invited to address the staff at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a top regulator charged with monitoring the activities of big banks.She was thrilled by the invitation, she recalled in the book. After years of tracking various problems consumers experienced with their banks \u2014 predatory lending, sky-high interest rates and dubious fees \u2014 Ms. Warren felt that, finally, she\u2019d be able to persuade the regulators to crack down.Her host for the meeting was Julie L. Williams, then the acting comptroller of the currency. In a conference room filled with economists and bank supervisors, Ms. Warren presented her findings: Banks were tricking and cheating their consumers.After the meeting ended and Ms. Williams was escorting her guest to the elevator, she told Ms. Warren that she had made a \u201ccompelling case,\u201d Ms. Warren writes. When she pushed Ms. Williams to have her agency do something about the dubious practices, the regulator balked.\u201cNo, we just can\u2019t do that,\u201d Ms. Williams said, according to the book. \u201cThe banks wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201dMs. Warren was not invited back.\u201cI told her I agreed with her concerns,\u201d Ms. Williams wrote in an email, \u201cbut when I said, \u2018We just can\u2019t do that,\u2019 I explained that was because the Comptroller\u2019s office did not have jurisdiction to adopt rules to ban the practice. I told her this was the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s purview.\u201dThe report cited a raft of agency oversight breakdowns regarding Wells Fargo. Among them was its failure to follow up on a slew of consumer and employee complaints beginning in early 2010. There was no evidence, the report said, that agency examiners \u201crequired the bank to provide an analysis of the risks and controls, or investigated these issues further to identify the root cause and the appropriate supervisory actions needed.\u201d\u201cRegulatory failure has been built into the system,\u201d Ms. Warren said in our interview. \u201cThe regulators routinely hear from the banks. They hear from those who have billions of dollars at stake. But they don\u2019t hear from the millions of people across this country who will be deeply affected by the decisions they make.\u201dBut this setup has also made the bureau a target for evisceration by bank-centric politicians.\u201cThere was a time when everything that went through Washington got measured by whether it created more opportunities for the middle class,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cNow, the people with money and power have figured out how to invest millions of dollars in Washington and get rules that yield billions of dollars for themselves.\u201d\u201cGovernment,\u201d she added, \u201cincreasingly works for those at the top.\u201dTwitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Macron Would Fix the French Economy", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byThe world keenly watched the first-round vote for president in France last Sunday because of the rise of Marine Le Pen, who wants to take the country out of the European Union and shut immigrants out of France. But she came in second to a centrist, Emmanuel Macron, who positioned himself as anti-Le Pen and \u201canti-system.\u201d He attributes the nation\u2019s woes not to outsiders \u2014 European officials and immigrants \u2014 but on France\u2019s own \u201csclerotic\u201d and unsustainable welfare state.The next French revolution now seems unlikely to be a populist uprising. Polls predict Mr. Macron will easily beat Ms. Le Pen in the May runoff, and if he does, his government would work to strengthen the European Union rather than hold a vote on whether to leave. It would invest more in integrating immigrants into French society, rather than banish them. Most strikingly, Mr. Macron would work to slim down one of the world\u2019s fattest welfare states, rather than build it up as Ms. Le Pen would do.Of course France has attempted welfare state reform before, without success. The latest effort came last year, when Mr. Macron was a minister in the Socialist government, and wrote the Macron laws, opening regulated industries to competition. Those plans set off mass protests, and were watered down, but Mr. Macron says there is a big difference now: Earlier governments were not elected with a mandate to downsize the welfare state, while his could be.Clearly the case for change has grown more urgent. The strong state goes back centuries in France, and its absurdities have been the butt of jokes for almost as long. Georges Clemenceau, who served twice as prime minister between 1906 and 1920, cracked that his country was very fertile: \u201cYou plant bureaucrats and taxes grow.\u201d Over the last decade state spending has grown even more, to 57 percent of gross domestic product, up from 51 percent.Mr. Macron leads an emerging centrist consensus that recognizes that \u2014 more than immigrants or the euro \u2014 the main obstacle retarding France\u2019s economy is its attachment to a welfare state culture of short workweeks and generous benefits. After the debt crisis that began in Europe in 2010, Spain, Portugal and even Italy made some effort to become more competitive, whether by cutting debts, restraining public spending, lowering labor costs or all three.France has gone the opposite way. Labor costs have risen, and in the last five years total public and private debt has risen by 38 percentage points as a share of gross domestic product \u2014 compared to 15 percentage points on average for eurozone countries. This rising debt has delivered little for beleaguered French workers: Per capita G.D.P. has been growing significantly more slowly than the eurozone average.The rules that pour out of the Paris bureaucracy make it difficult for newcomers to rise in French business, which is dominated by old families. According to data from Forbes, a staggering share of billionaire wealth, 73 percent, comes from inherited fortunes in France, compared to less than 50 percent in most other countries.France has been so resistant to change it can feel like an open-air museum, but Mr. Macron may have stronger support than reformers in the past. The center-right leader Fran\u00e7ois Fillon finished third on Sunday, promising even bigger cuts in public jobs and pensions that would lower state spending to 50 percent of G.D.P. Unlike Mr. Macron, Mr. Fillon combined his anti-state message with a harsh anti-immigrant line, appealing to voters who believe the welfare state is too generous to outsiders. He has endorsed Mr. Macron, which could help him steal conservative votes from Ms. Le Pen.The coming battle could be brutal. France is deeply divided. Together, Mr. Macron and Mr. Fillon took 43.5 percent of the vote, a sign of deep discontent with the welfare state status quo. However, Ms. Le Pen is an old-fashioned French statist, and so is the radical-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who promised a 100 percent tax on high incomes and finished fourth. Together he and Ms. Le Pen took 41 percent.Whoever wins the runoff, the other side is likely to revolt. And if Mr. Macron prevails, those protests are less likely to be about Europe or immigrants than about the future of one of the world\u2019s largest welfare states.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

In January and February, 36 people were killed during actions by officers from that battalion, compared with six during the same period last year, according to the same reports.The Rio police declined to answer questions about Maria Eduarda\u2019s death. In an emailed statement, they said officers had been sent \u201cto intervene in an action by criminals\u201d and that \u201cthere was a confrontation.\u201d Maria Eduarda\u2019s death is being investigated, the statement said, and the two officers shown in the video are in custody and their case being investigated by internal affairs.The deaths also come as Rio struggles with financial and political crises. Brazil is undergoing its worst recession on record, with 13 million people unemployed and an economy that contracted 3.6 percent last year. The state government in Rio is broke, struggling to pay police salaries and reeling from the jailing of a former governor, S\u00e9rgio Cabral, accused of running a multimillion-dollar graft network that took bribes from Olympic and other public works projects.Although policing is a state government responsibility, the current governor, Luiz de Souza, formerly Mr. Cabral\u2019s deputy governor, has yet to comment on the killings but plans to meet with Maria Eduarda\u2019s family this week.Ant\u00f4nio Costa, founder of River of Peace, an anti-violence group, said Mr. de Souza\u2019s silence was symptomatic of a city many feel is descending into chaos.\u201cThe State of Rio has no leader,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no one in command, there is a complete loss of credibility,\u201d he said.Maria Eduarda\u2019s brother Uidson Ferreira, a 32-year-old martial arts instructor, said his sister\u2019s death showed how the police were woefully unprepared to deal with armed confrontation in densely populated areas. \u201cWith this crisis, with these 13 million unemployed, the violence has been very explicit,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cWhat is happening is a lack of preparation of the whole hierarchy of the government. This comes from above, and the poor class always pays the bill.\u201d\u201cThe family has totally fallen apart psychologically,\u201d he added, his voice shaking with tears. \u201cIt is like we are going crazy.\u201dBruna Aguiar, 25, a university student and resident of Acari, a favela just across the subway line from Fazenda Botafogo, said the police would have thought more carefully before opening fire near a school in a middle-class area. Outside Rio\u2019s favelas, she said, people avoid subjects like police killings and poverty.\u201cIf you talk about it, you touch on an open wound,\u201d Ms. Aguiar said.They know all about stray bullets in Acari, which is also policed by the 41st battalion. Ms. Aguiar is part of a local collective that has denounced regular police invasions it says causes terror among residents.On Sunday afternoon, the favela hummed with life. Beeping motorbikes zipped down its winding lanes, where residents sat out on plastic chairs and young men with rifles from its dominant drug gang, the Third Pure Command, guarded strategic corners.One with a radio pointed to the rooftop from which he said the police had shot a fellow gang member dead the previous week. As darkness fell, another wearing an earpiece cradled a machine gun and moved to music booming from a nearby bar.Priscilla Cabral, 32, a shop assistant, showed the bullet holes left in her front door after one police operation; her daughter Angelina, 8, had tried to cover them up with chewing gum. Ms. Cabral had pulled her dozing son Robert, 15, off the sofa seconds before another bullet thudded into the wall behind him.She said her studious daughter got upset when gun battles stopped her from going to school.\u201cShe said to me: \u2018Take me out of here. I can\u2019t stand it anymore,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Cabral said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Xi: Two Imposing Leaders With Clashing Agendas", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 When President Xi Jinping of China arrives at President Trump\u2019s Florida estate on Thursday, his goal will be to get through the quick visit looking like a resolute leader who can hold his own against the American president, something that even some of Washington\u2019s closest allies have failed to pull off.Mr. Xi wants to show his domestic audience that he can manage the relationship with Mr. Trump and avert a crisis in relations with the United States, a message that would strengthen his hand in the jockeying for power ahead of a Communist Party leadership congress this year.But while the meetings could lift Mr. Xi\u2019s stature at home, they also present significant risks. The two men are at odds on several contentious issues, and perhaps no Chinese leader has ever walked into a meeting with an American president like Mr. Trump, who has shown a disdain for the language of diplomacy. Mr. Xi has a highly scripted style, and the Chinese are accustomed to meetings that are tightly choreographed.Mr. Xi is likely to play down potential conflicts, offering vague assurances on trade and North Korea\u2019s nuclear provocations that he believes Mr. Trump will want to hear but that may not amount to significant policy changes. At the same time, however, he will not want to look as though he is backing down or being lectured. For the Chinese, the atmospherics of the talks will be as important as the substance.\u201cHow to deal with Trump is a test of statesmanship,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cSuccess is very important.\u201dMr. Trump and Mr. Xi may seem like polar opposites when it comes to temperament, but they are both imposing men with ambitious and at times clashing agendas.Mr. Trump, unpredictable and a neophyte to diplomacy, has pledged to put \u201cAmerica First,\u201d in part by stalling China\u2019s rise and forcing it to the bargaining table on trade. Twitter is inaccessible in China, but the Chinese are rattled by Mr. Trump\u2019s habit of making brash statements on the internet.Yet Chinese analysts say Mr. Xi enters the meetings, beginning on Thursday afternoon, confident that he can stave off an eruption on the two biggest issues: North Korea and trade.Mr. Xi is prepared for Mr. Trump to press for more economic punishment against North Korea for its expanding nuclear weapons program and will offer to bear down on the North, an ally of China\u2019s, Mr. Shi said.But, he added, the Chinese leader is expected to cleave to a strategic bottom line: North Korea must serve as a buffer zone against the potential of a unified Korean Peninsula dominated by the American military.Adding to tensions were signs last week in North Korea of intensified activities at its Punggye-ri underground test site.The preparations could be for an audacious test to disrupt the talks, experts said. But it was more likely that a test was aimed for April 15, an important national anniversary in North Korea. That timing would also embarrass Mr. Xi just fresh from his Florida meetings.Mr. Xi appeared to be satisfied he could head off Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign threats of calling China a currency manipulator and imposing heavy tariffs on Chinese imports to the United States, Chinese officials said.If Mr. Trump made these moves, the Chinese state media said, China would be ready with reprisals: ending purchases of grains from the heartland, ordering passenger aircraft from Airbus instead of Boeing and clamping down on the sales of American microchips and phones.But as the Florida trip has gotten closer, China has become more nervous.Even on the basic issue of American adherence to the \u201cOne China\u201d principle \u2014 a longstanding diplomatic policy recognizing Beijing as the sole government of China \u2014 Mr. Xi cannot be entirely confident, said Zhang Baohui, professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.Mr. Trump told Mr. Xi in February that he would respect Beijing as the sole government of China and that the United States did not recognize Taiwan.But after that phone conversation, Mr. Trump let Mr. Xi know that he owed him one. When the two sides issued separate statements, the White House version noted that Mr. Trump had agreed to the policy \u201cat the request\u201d of Mr. Xi.In a telling difference, the Chinese version omitted that Mr. Xi had made the request.\u201c\u2018One China\u2019 is not necessarily a done deal,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cThe question is: Can you trust Trump? \u2018One China\u2019 is never settled, and he knows bargaining better than anyone.\u201dTop Chinese officials have been closely gauging Mr. Trump\u2019s domestic fortunes as a barometer of the president\u2019s mood when the talks open.On the eve of the scheduled vote on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, an American economist, Eswar Prasad, said he dropped in on Chinese colleagues who were gaming out Mr. Xi\u2019s economic proposals for Florida.Mr. Prasad said he was surprised to find that the Chinese economists were obsessed with tracking Mr. Trump\u2019s fortunes in the congressional vote. For example, they knew exactly how many votes the Freedom Caucus had mustered, he said.\u201cThey were saying they wanted the vote to go Trump\u2019s way because then Trump would be less tempted to take it out on China,\u201d said Mr. Prasad, an economist at Cornell. Mr. Trump suffered a big legislative defeat, the opposite of what they hoped for.To address the administration\u2019s complaints blaming the trade imbalance with China for the loss of American jobs, Mr. Xi is likely to offer Chinese investments in American infrastructure and plants, Chinese analysts said.But plans for such an announcement are not clear, and whether they will satisfy the hard-line wing of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team is an open question. Further, the analysts said, Mr. Xi did not want to appear too deferential to Mr. Trump.\u201cBeijing\u2019s hope of using the Trump-Xi t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate to smooth the bilateral economic relationship,\u201d Mr. Prasad said, \u201chas been complicated by the uncertainties generated by Trump\u2019s hostile Twitter posts and the mixed signals emanating from different parts of the administration.\u201dBefore Mr. Xi\u2019s departure, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry was preparing for all possibilities \u2014 fretting over camera angles for the retinue of state-run media that will beam back images of him with Mr. Trump in balmy climes, and whether he would be comfortable staying at a hotel slightly less opulent than Mr. Trump\u2019s lavish Mar-a-Lago.Most of all, they were worried about how the two men would get along.\u201cBoth leaders have strong characters,\u201d said one Chinese official involved in the planning who requested anonymity per diplomatic practice.Perhaps at the back of his mind was the fact that Mr. Xi and President Barack Obama met many times, starting with a similarly planned informal visit in 2013 at Sunnylands, a sumptuous estate in Southern California.\u201cAfter that, the relationship only got grimmer and grimmer,\u201d Mr. Shi said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Last of New York\u2019s Master Wigmakers", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "At a time when wigs are increasingly popular, the artisans who make them by hand are a vanishing breed.Supported byNicholas Piazza keeps 600 pounds of hair in his Staten Island garage.He stores it in plastic bins and cardboard boxes, opposite the fishing supplies. \u201cGot grays, got browns, got blonds,\u201d he said. \u201cGot everything.\u201dInside one bin, shiny brown bundles nestled around one another like snakes. He picked two thick braids and lifted them from the bin. Uncoiled, they were three feet long and nearly reached the ground. \u201cThis is all Russian hair cut right off people\u2019s heads,\u201d Mr. Piazza said.Much of his hair came from this stash, sourced from around the world, and which eventually outgrew his studio. \u201cI couldn\u2019t close my closets,\u201d he said. \u201cI had more hair than I knew what to do with.\u201dMr. Piazza is one of the last Old World wigmakers making wigs for the public in the city, men and women trained mostly by Italian and Jewish immigrants in the centuries-old trade of hand-tying wigs, a fussy affair that on the patience spectrum falls somewhere between tailoring a jacket and counting the stars.\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d he said. \u201cJust coasting.\u201dThis may appear to be yet another case of an antiquated craft disappearing from New York, one artisan at a time. But wigs are far from being swept into the past. The demand, it turns out, hasn\u2019t been as high as it is now since the wig craze of the late 1960s and early \u201970s, when Mr. Piazza and his fellow wigmakers entered the field. Wigs are part of the boom in the human hair trade that began with extensions.Most of the wigs on the market, though, are made in China, where thousands of factory workers do the painstaking work that New York\u2019s wigmakers once did: plucking short and splintered hair from bundles, baking curls, stirring hair in vats of bleach, hand-knotting wigs. \u201cA lot of the people who call their wigs \u2018custom,\u2019\u201d Mr. Piazza said, \u201cthey just write up the order and send it to the Orient and then when they get it, they\u2019ll do some tweaking.\u201dOne measure of a good wig is its hairline. It\u2019s the most difficult thing to imitate, which is why a lot of wigs tend to have bangs. To achieve a naturalistic look, wigmakers stitch hair individually at the hairline, often even adding baby hair.Another mark of a superior wig is the quality of the hair. Hair of the kind Mr. Piazza has in his garage \u2014 long, European and \u201cremy,\u201d which means cut from one head, lined up roots to ends \u2014 is the most valuable. It is $4,000 per kilogram, roughly the going rate of truffles. High-grade Indian hair sells for $2,000 per kilogram.And that is where things get strange. Hair is unregulated, a largely hidden economy open to abuse.\u201cThere are a whole lot of people living off of hair,\u201d Ms. Tarlo, the anthropologist, said.The hair industry has expanded deliriously since Mr. Piazza started making wigs. It\u2019s filled with stories of fraud and theft and hair obtained from countries in upheaval. In that sense at least, he says, not much has changed.Mr. Piazza was not born with a passion for hair. He grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, where he met his wife, Beverly, when he was 16 at an Italian street festival. \u201cI came back from Vietnam, and I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI became a hairdresser because my wife was a hairdresser.\u201dMr. Piazza apprenticed himself to a German wigmaker after hairdressing school, then went to work for Enny of Italy, under Ernesto Capparelli.Many of New York\u2019s wigmakers were Italian. For much of the 20th century, Palermo, Sicily, was the drop-off spot for hair harvested far and wide, and Italy had become the center of the hair trade.Mr. Piazza remembers this as a time of creativity and drama. When synthetic fibers like Japanese Kanekalon appeared in the late 1960s, they drove down the price of wigs and caused the price of human hair to plummet. Some of New York\u2019s wig purveyors were incensed.Often, it wasn\u2019t clear what was real. By 1970, human hair mixed with synthetic or animal hair was so common that the Federal Trade Commission reminded wigmakers that \u201c\u2018true hair,\u2019 \u2018natural hair\u2019 and \u2018genuine hair\u2019 should mean human hair.\u201d That year, it issued regulatory guidelines. (They were rescinded in 1995.)Mr. Piazza started working for Kenneth Battelle in 1973, and he invited him to start a wig business under the Kenneth salon name in 1979. As the wig craze faded, Mr. Piazza diversified.He made falls, slides, clip-ons, topknots and toupees, a mustache for an open-coffin funeral. In 1976, he said, he was called in to make an emergency merkin for a Penthouse model who didn\u2019t have enough coverage. He made a line of hair ornaments that appeared in Vogue and looked suspiciously like fishing lures.And before long, Mr. Piazza began hunting for hair.\u201cWhen Kenneth first put me in business, it was very difficult to find European hair in this country,\u201d Mr. Piazza said. \u201cEveryone always said the finest hair comes from Italy.\u201d So he got a list of hair suppliers from the Italian Trade Commission and for the next several summers flew to Italy.\u201cI\u2019d grab a suitcase with like two T-shirts and a pair of jeans, and I\u2019d come home with about 80 pounds of hair,\u201d he said.Soon hairdressers and other wigmakers started requesting his services. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018Pick me up a couple pounds, I don\u2019t care if you make a few dollars. You\u2019ve got good hair.\u2019 So all of the sudden, I was a hair dealer.\u201dThe three-foot braids in Mr. Piazza\u2019s garage came into his possession in the mid-1990s. One day, two Russian men appeared in his shop carrying suitcases. \u201cNatural blonds, natural reds, straight off people\u2019s heads,\u201d he said. It was the kind of hair known in the industry as \u201cliquid gold\u201d \u2014 Caucasian hair untouched by Western chemicals, long and remy.\u201cI say, \u2018Whoa, fellows, you don\u2019t have to go no further; let\u2019s talk.\u2019\u201dOf his Russian dealer\u2019s shipments, Mr. Piazza recalled: \u201cSometimes it came stitched in pillows. Sometimes he would ship 20, 30 kilos of hair at a time. Sometimes I\u2019d be going to an apartment in Brighton Beach at 2 in the morning or meeting a plane at Kennedy. He\u2019d hand me a suitcase, and I\u2019d hand him an envelope.\u201dIt lasted just a decade. As capitalism spread, so too did Western hairstyles, hair dye and rapacious competition. Virgin hair became harder to find. The hair in the suitcases went from 36 inches long to 22, then to 18 and then to a barely usable six. \u201cIt got shorter and shorter,\u201d Mr. Piazza said. \u201cThen they couldn\u2019t get it no more.\u201dBut he figures he is pretty much set. \u201cI still have two lifetime supplies.\u201dFortunately for Mr. Piazza, hair decays very, very slowly. An Egyptian mummy on display at the American Museum of Natural History was put through a CT scanner, and the images revealed the outlines of what look like flattened pin curls on her skull.Standing in Mr. Piazza\u2019s garage among boxes and boxes of hair, I couldn\u2019t help wondering whether the hair, harvested decades ago, hadn\u2019t started to smell.\u201cDo you smell anything?\u201d Mr. Piazza asked, handing me a braid.The hair was clean and soft and had a faint, medicinal scent. Before I could answer, he announced: \u201cMothballs. Sometimes someone will come in and say, \u2018I smell like mothballs.\u2019\u201d He smiled and took the blame. \u201cI didn\u2019t wash it good enough. And I\u2019ll say, \u2018It\u2019s your imagination.\u2019 It\u2019ll come out.\u201dWhen we met at her home in Midwood, Brooklyn, she wore an apron over a sweater. Ms. Grunwald lost the lease on her salon on Coney Island Avenue, and for the moment she is working out of her basement.Among the usual wigmaking bric-a-brac are items specific to her Orthodox Jewish clientele: black hair tightly coiled around sticks that are baked to make curly, prosthetic payot (the traditional Orthodox side locks); a head form with a fluffy white beard for an Orthodox man with alopecia. \u201cIt\u2019s made of yak hair from Tibet,\u201d she said.Her own sheitel is shoulder length, gray and wavy. Orthodox women traditionally wear sheitels that are the same color and texture as their own hair, she said. Her custom wigs, which start at $3,800, are meant to be as close to an exact replica of their hair as possible, down to the part line and cowlicks. \u201cEvery one is like a fingerprint,\u201d she said of her wigs.When Ms. Grunwald arrived in New York, in 1949, her skills were in demand. Hats were going out of fashion, and sheitels were coming back. She immediately found a job with a wigmaker, and in 1960, after beauty school and marriage, she struck out on her own.The owner, Shulamit Amsel, acknowledges that she is in a different category than Ms. Grunwald. \u201cI\u2019m not a wigmaker,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a wig manufacturer.\u201dIn the wake of the ruling, women rushed to buy synthetic wigs as well as cloth head coverings at the Uptown Girl Snood Factory Outlet in Brooklyn. Burning the wigs was declared the only acceptable way of disposing of them.\u201cThen a man darted inside the ring of people to throw yet another wig on the fire.\u201dMs. Grunwald said: \u201cI thought it was ridiculous. Crazy, meshugas. It was the zealots that caused it to happen. There\u2019s nothing wrong with Indian hair.\u201d Ms. Amsel, of Shuly Wigs, said, \u201cIt\u2019s all connected to beliefs that we don\u2019t want to comment on whatsoever.\u201dSheitels eventually returned, some of them with kosher labels, but the decision had lingering consequences. India\u2019s exports were affected. \u201cThere were a lot of wigmakers,\u201d Ms. Grunwald said. \u201cThe men were sitting and learning Torah. The women were working as wigmakers to put food on the table. And that ruined a lot of women.\u201dShe paused.\u201cWe were all happy when it was over,\u201d she said. \u201cNow no one asks about Indian hair.\u201dRaffaele Mollica will tell you he is the last wigmaker. He will tell you loudly. He will shout and wave his arms and dismiss his competitors, even the deceased ones: \u201cThat hairpiece finagler?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the only wigmaker who can make a wig from start to finish on earth all by myself. If anyone thinks otherwise, I accept,\u201d he shouted, standing in his 84th Street atelier. \u201cWe can go into a room, bring our fabric, our hair, our ventilating needles, and we can make a wig.\u201dMr. Mollica, who goes by Raffa and Ralph, was born 71 years ago in Sicily and grew up in Astoria, Queens. His wigs start at about $5,000 and are known as Ralphs.They are so popular in international Orthodox Jewish communities that an impostor has been making imitations that he advertises around Israel, trading on Mr. Mollica\u2019s reputation. \u201cHe\u2019s a worthless scurve,\u201d said Mr. Mollica, showing me a flyer for the so-called Ralph Wig Collection. The real Mr. Mollica is the one who gets a call when they fall apart.Like Mr. Piazza, Mr. Mollica was a hairdresser who shifted to wigs during the wig craze, trading haircuts for wigmaking lessons from a retired ballerina from Italy. He was inspired by the naturalism of \u201cthe Vidal Sassoon revolution,\u201d he said, but after stints at salons including Vidal Sassoon, Kenneth and Elizabeth Arden, he opened his own studio in the 1980s, inspired by another revolution. \u201cThe chemotherapy revolution,\u201d he said.Mr. Mollica said chemotherapy changed his approach. Wigs for everyday use had to be both undetectable from a yard away and durable; wigs for film, TV and fashion don\u2019t have to be routinely washed or handled.Marcia Glikas, 65, found Mr. Mollica nearly 40 years ago, after trying injections and braided-in hair and falls to cover her rapidly thinning hair. She now has 20 Ralphs. \u201cI can\u2019t go in a convertible with my hair blowing in the wind, with my scarf blowing in the wind; I would love that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have hair, I have hair thanks to Raffa.\u201dHis wigs are as soft and light as he is brash. \u201cIn real life,\u201d Mr. Mollica told me, meaning if I were his client, \u201cyou would only want a wig to look like you do now. Naturally, sloppily correct as opposed to plasticized at the beauty parlor by some insane hairdresser.\u201dMs. Glikas came in for some upkeep on her wavy wig not long ago. \u201cI was shocked to find he was bald,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had lymphoma, after helping so many people.\u201d The cancer is in remission, Mr. Mollica said; he has no plans to leave the business. \u201cI\u2019ll retire when I die,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will never be another custom wigmaker after I die.\u201dNew York\u2019s Old World wigmakers have not systematically passed on their knowledge to apprentices, though they have taught countless immigrant women to weave hair for them. And when Merria Dearman, a wigmaker for theater productions, wanted to learn how to make wigs for the public, she said, she had to come seek them out.She was working at a salon and making wigs for companies like the Berkeley Repertory Theater, when one day she realized the wigs she was making for performers were higher quality than what was available for people with alopecia and cancer. \u201cThere is a gap in our market,\u201d she said. \u201cIt clicked.\u201dShe moved to New York from the San Francisco Bay Area. She sought out wigmakers like Mr. Piazza. \u201cImagine, I move here to learn this, and these are the guys I meet,\u201d Ms. Dearman, 40, said. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of a dying breed. They\u2019re the Italians everyone goes to.\u201dShe opened her studio three years ago, on 58th Street, and the clients rained in, mostly young women with hair loss. \u201cThey find me after they\u2019ve had their hearts broken by other wigs,\u201d she said.\u201cForget about this supposed \u2018I\u2019m a single black woman woe is me\u2019 epidemic,\u201d a writer for the news site The Root named Yesha Callahan wrote on her blog one day in 2010. \u201cThe real crisis sweeping the nation are lace-front hairlines that start at the eyebrows!\u201d Her tongue-in-cheek sendup of celebrities with imperfect wigs concluded: \u201cI blame Tyra and Beyonc\u00e9 for this lace-front wig epidemic.\u201dCelebrity culture is credited with \u2014 or blamed for \u2014 the sudden popularity of wigs. But Hadiiya Barbel, the former wig stylist on Wendy Williams\u2019s talk show, said the real instigator was technology. Celebrities had always worn extra hair. But in the 2000s, high-definition cameras created the need for a more convincing illusion.\u201cWe really had to make it look like it was coming out of her scalp,\u201d she said of Ms. Williams, who is vocal about her love for wigs. \u201cWe had to perfect the hairlines and balance it \u2014 add denseness, take away fullness.\u201d Like Tokyo Stylez, who has worked with Lil\u2019 Kim and Rihanna, Ms. Barbel became part of a new phenomenon: the celebrity wig stylist. The wigs in her line, Araya, run from $750 to $3,000.\u201cI started converting my clients from weaves to wigs,\u201d said Ms. Barbel, noting that they were the latest development in the so-called natural hair movement, which encourages black women to forgo harsh chemical treatments like relaxers or perms.Ms. Barbel, who shows off big, dramatic wigs on Instagram, recently got a feverish request from a Brazilian Carnival queen who had seen a video of her dancing: \u201cGive me that hair.\u201dEgypt Lawson, whose wig company Hairline Illusions operates in Harlem and Atlanta, said the big shift was that people spoke openly about wearing hair. \u201cVivica Fox took off a piece of her hairdo on TV \u2014 it\u2019s not so secretive like it used to be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Jewish wigs.\u201dFor people who can\u2019t afford their own wigmaker, the problem with wigs remains the quality. Lace-front wigs can be found for less than $100 at beauty supply stores or on Alibaba, the Chinese Amazon.com, which now sells directly to consumers. But they\u2019re made from processed hair \u2014 stripped of the cuticle, bleached, dyed, dipped in silicone \u2014 and can fall apart after a few washings, once the chemicals are gone.D\u2019Wanna Randolph\u2019s solution, like Mr. Piazza\u2019s so long ago, was to go find good hair herself. \u201cI got tired of getting bogus hair in the mail,\u201d said Ms. Randolph, a model who lives in Detroit and recently started Infallible Luxe, which sells hair online. She had been in two Delta Air Lines safety videos and took a job in customer service for the carrier so that she could travel free, inspecting small hair factories.She flew to Seoul, South Korea, and traveled through Southeast Asia with a fixer.

{"Headline": "Yellen Signals Shift From Stimulating Economy to Sustaining Growth", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byJanet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said Monday that the Fed was shifting its focus from stimulating the economy to keeping growth on an even keel.She said the economy was \u201cpretty healthy,\u201d thanks in part to the Fed\u2019s long-running stimulus campaign, which the central bank is moving to end.\u201cLooking forward, I think the economy is going to continue to grow at a moderate pace,\u201d Ms. Yellen said during an event at the University of Michigan. \u201cOur job is going to be to try to set monetary policy to sustain what we have achieved.\u201dMs. Yellen, interviewed onstage by Susan M. Collins, the dean of the Ford School of Public Policy at the university, used the opportunity to make a strong case for the financial regulations enacted by Congress in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to address the problems revealed by the 2008 financial crisis.Ms. Yellen pushed back on both counts. She cited changes that she said had increased the strength of the financial system, including requiring banks to raise more money from investors and subjecting large banks to annual stress tests.\u201cWe have accomplished a lot, and we have a much safer system,\u201d she said.She also directly addressed the argument that the regulatory pendulum has swung too far and that government rules are preventing healthy financial activity. \u201cI don\u2019t think if you look at objective data on lending, that it\u2019s possible to make the case that regulation has simply stifled lending,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cLending is growing in a very healthy way as the economy has recovered.\u201dMs. Yellen\u2019s assessment of economic conditions remained upbeat.She said, however, that the economy still faced problems that were beyond the power of monetary policy. While job growth has been strong, economic growth remains relatively slow, around 2 percent a year in recent years. If more people are working, making more things or doing more things in less time, the economy should be growing faster.\u201cThe fact that you can create that many jobs in the context of growth that is so low points to a significant problem,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cAnd the problem is that productivity growth is very low.\u201dProductivity measures the average person\u2019s economic contribution. There are only two possible causes of economic growth: more people or increased productivity, which is to say, the same number of people making more stuff. We have slow population growth and slow productivity growth, so we have slow economic growth.Some economists think the flow of good ideas has simply slowed. Others point to a leveling-off in educational attainment. She also pointed to recent research that suggested one factor was a decline in corporate competition: less creation of new businesses and more corporate consolidation.Ms. Yellen said the combination of relatively fast job growth and relatively slow economic growth pointed to the underlying problem.She also fielded some lighter questions. Asked how she dealt with pressure, Ms. Yellen described herself as an \u201cardent believer\u201d in the importance of a good night\u2019s sleep. Asked for life advice, she encouraged students to find a profession that fills them with a sense of enthusiasm every day.\u201cFor me,\u201d she said, \u201cthe core of having a satisfying career first and foremost was finding something to do that I really love.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ecuador, Len\u00edn Moreno Headed for Victory in Presidential Election", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "Supported byLen\u00edn Moreno, a 64-year-old former vice president of Ecuador, appeared headed to a second-round win in the country\u2019s presidential election on Sunday. It would be a rare victory for the Latin American left, which has recently suffered stinging election defeats.With more than 90 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Moreno, a close ally of departing President Rafael Correa, had won 51 percent of the vote, while his opponent, Guillermo Lasso, a 61-year-old banker, had won 49 percent, according to early figures published by Ecuador\u2019s electoral commission.While Mr. Moreno quickly declared victory on Sunday night, his opponent did not concede, saying all the votes needed to be counted.The race was closely watched in the region, where, time and again, leftist stalwarts who rose to power on populism and high commodity prices have seen their fortunes turn.Liberal movements in Venezuela, Argentina and Bolivia have been rebuffed by voters in recent elections as their economies have stumbled. Brazil\u2019s leftist president, Dilma Rousseff, was brought down by impeachment last year.In the end, it was the candidate named for the founder of Russian Communism who was favored to win.Mr. Moreno has promised to push forward the so-called Citizens\u2019 Revolution of his predecessor, which funneled state funds back to the poor in the form of education, housing and infrastructure.In a speech on Sunday, Mr. Moreno said it became clear during his travels that he had the support of ordinary Ecuadoreans. \u201cSince before we claimed victory, we knew it, we felt it,\u201d he said.Yet maintaining Mr. Correa\u2019s momentum could prove hard. There is the issue of oil revenues, for one, which have stagnated. The economy has ground to a halt after years of high growth.There is also the figure of Mr. Correa himself, a strong-willed populist who ruled for a decade, created a new Constitution and lifted large sections of his nation out of poverty. Few expect that the mild-mannered Mr. Moreno can sustain his success.\u201cThe economic orientation will change; the social emphasis will change,\u201d said Sim\u00f3n Pachano, a political analyst based in Quito, the capital.Still, Mr. Moreno\u2019s vision differed sharply from that of his opponent, Mr. Lasso, who lost to Mr. Correa by a larger margin in 2013.Mr. Lasso, from the port city of Guayaquil, had promised to cut back on what he called the excesses of the previous president, including by reducing the public-sector work force and government spending. He also proposed cutting taxes for the wealthy and for businesses.Each candidate faced a steep climb to the presidency. Mr. Moreno was criticized for being too close to Mr. Correa, whose decade in power ended with accusations of corruption involving public infrastructure projects. Mr. Correa earned a harsh reputation for attacking critics, suing journalists and, on his state television show, angrily reading the names of those who had sent tweets that reflected poorly on him.But for many, Mr. Lasso was never able to overcome his history as banker in a country that has been rocked by financial crises and inflation.His opponents hammered him throughout the campaign for his past positions in the government of Jamil Mahuad, the Ecuadorean president who moved the country onto the United States dollar after a banking crisis destroyed its national currency, the sucre.The financial collapse, known as the \u201cbank holiday\u201d in Ecuador, prompted a migration of more than 1.5 million people, most of whom sought work in the United States and Europe. The country limped by in negotiations with creditors for years until Mr. Correa took Ecuador into default, calling the foreign debt \u201cimmoral.\u201dMore recently, an Argentine newspaper published what it said were documents showing that Mr. Lasso had shuttled financial gains he made during the country\u2019s economic crisis into an offshore account. Mr. Lasso denied wrongdoing, but Mr. Correa said the candidate was under investigation.Mr. Moreno, by contrast, presented a softer image.Known to be more humorous and conciliatory than Mr. Correa, he appeared in campaign stops in his wheelchair, which he has used since he was shot during a robbery in the late 1990s. He is probably best known for his social programs, which have helped people with disabilities in Ecuador.\u201cWe can\u2019t lose what\u2019s been given to the poor,\u201d said Edwin Tat\u00e9s, who works as a driver in Quito and voted for Mr. Moreno.He added, \u201cThis government has had many errors, above all those of Correa, who has fought with everyone, but we need to change things for the good of the country, not to change the whole government.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conservative Split Over Import Tax Imperils Trump\u2019s Overhaul", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byAll three organizations share a common lineage: They are part of the political network overseen by Charles D. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative businessmen. Now they are among a host of conservative organizations mounting a furious campaign against a new tax on imports proposed by House Republicans, imperiling what is supposed to be a centerpiece of the Republican tax overhaul effort.Their opposition threatens yet another rupture with President Trump, some of whose advisers see the provision as a critical way to bring about tax reform while protecting American manufacturers.The battle could not only jeopardize Mr. Trump\u2019s second major legislative initiative, but also redefine the boundaries of conservative economic policy. Much like the failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the import tax is dividing conservatives, the business sector and some of the deepest-pocketed groups funding conservative politics. Along the way, it is exposing the broader ideological divide between nationalist policies embraced by Mr. Trump and the traditional small-government movement that his election ejected from the driver\u2019s seat of Republican policy-making.\u201cTrump ran on a different set of economic issues than traditional conservative Republicans have,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation who favors the border tax on intellectual grounds, but said he had come to see it as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d for broader tax reform.\u201cThe baton has been passed on from Reagan to Trump,\u201d Mr. Moore continued, \u201cand there\u2019s no doubt he ran on a much more populist economic message.\u201dThe idea of a border adjustment tax has percolated among academic economists and in think tanks since the 1970s, as the United States has considered ways of harmonizing its tax code with countries that use value-added taxes. Central to the plan is a provision that would tax imports at a rate of 20 percent while exempting exports from taxation. In theory, this would buttress domestic manufacturing, make American products more competitive with foreign goods and encourage American companies to bring home cash they have been parking overseas.\u201cIt is a simple and elegant way to get good tax compliance,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist and president of the right-leaning American Action Forum, a nonprofit tied to a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that backs House Republicans.Some conservatives oppose it for the same reason: In their view, such a tax would be too easy to increase, with the potential costs to Americans hidden behind rising prices.The Koch network and groups like the Club for Growth, which for years have targeted what they call \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d in Washington, have opposed the border tax as an unnecessary tax increase and a form of favoritism that would hurt the economy. But Mr. Trump and his team have pledged to target what they see as a more insidious kind of cronyism, including unfettered free trade that some Trump advisers say benefits wealthy elites at the expense of American workers.The dispute echoes Mr. Trump\u2019s battles with his party last year, when the Club for Growth, a group of wealthy conservatives that backs anti-tax candidates in Republican primary races, financed a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign against him. The Koch network, uncomfortable with Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals on trade and immigration, sat out the presidential election entirely, turning its advertising dollars and activists to down-ballot races.Now, some of the same groups are organizing visits to lawmakers and paying for an online advertising campaign attacking the border tax proposal.The roster includes Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network\u2019s flagship political advocacy group; the Libre Initiative, which is aimed at Latinos; and Generation Opportunity, which focuses on young adults. In 2015, the most recent year for which tax returns are available, the three groups took in a combined $34 million from Freedom Partners, an umbrella group representing the Kochs and other donors who pool money for political and educational initiatives.Americans for Prosperity is calling on Mr. Trump to rely more on spending cuts, rather than on a border adjustment tax, to finance the tax overhaul. The group\u2019s list of proposals include indexing Social Security benefits to a different measure of inflation \u2014 a popular idea in conventional conservative circles but one that could violate Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to protect the program\u2019s beneficiaries.\u201cWhen you look at the network broadly, we\u2019re all guided by the same vision,\u201d said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to be active on the major policy decisions that are happening in Washington.\u201dMore recently, Koch has circulated studies indicating that the tax would increase the price of gasoline, which the company says would lift its profits in the short term but harm the economy in the long term.Philip Ellender, a top executive at the company, said in an interview that Koch Industries was lobbying against the new tax out of principle, not for profit.\u201cIn the short term, Koch would profit handsomely from it,\u201d Mr. Ellender said. His summary of the company\u2019s case against the tax: \u201cIt would stifle free trade, it picks winners and losers, and it raises prices on consumers so that corporations can get a tax break.\u201dThe debate has divided the White House, too.A profusion of strategic and political motives also divides Republicans on the issue. To enact a tax overhaul that does not increase the federal deficit but delivers rate cuts to wealthy taxpayers and corporations, Mr. Trump and Congress need to find some source of new revenue \u2014 hence the border tax. For Mr. Ryan, who holds more conventional free-trade views than Mr. Trump, the new tax provides a way to satisfy Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist impulses without imposing punitive, and potentially even more disruptive, tariffs.But some conservatives are not so sure. In opposing the tax, Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Walmart\u2019s home state, Arkansas, finds himself in the position of defending his local corporate giant and the conservatism that he thought he knew.\u201cMost conservatives I know have long believed that tax reform would look at all of the carve-outs in the tax code,\u201d Mr. Cotton said, \u201cnot introduce a whole new concept of taxation.\u201dAn article on Sunday about tax reform efforts supported by conservative groups referred incorrectly to one proposal for indexing Social Security benefits. The proposal includes indexing those benefits to a different measure of inflation, not to inflation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Le Pen Aide Is Fired Over Holocaust Comments", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The interim leader that Marine Le Pen chose to run her far-right party while she ran for the presidency has been forced to step down because he praised a Holocaust denier and expressed doubt that the Nazis used poison gas to murder Jews.Ms. Le Pen called the outrage directed at Mr. Jalkh a \u201cdefamation\u201d on Friday morning.The negative news, however, was somewhat offset by day\u2019s end, when Ms. Le Pen got an endorsement from a defeated right-wing presidential candidate, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, who won less than 5 percent of the vote nationwide.\u201cMarine Le Pen is not on the far right to me,\u201d he said.Ms. Le Pen is one of two candidates to advance to the second round of the presidential race, and announced on Monday that she would temporarily step down as National Front leader to focus on defeating the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, considered to be the favorite in the election on May 7.Revelations that Mr. Jalkh, who is also a member of the European Parliament and a vice president of the National Front, had praised a Holocaust denier quickly prompted the party to react, fearful that his comments might cast a shadow on Ms. Le Pen\u2019s campaign.Mr. Aliot said on BFMTV that Mr. Jalkh wanted to \u201cdefend himself; he\u2019s going to press charges because he believes that his honor is being sullied.\u201dFew of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s voters are expected to switch to Ms. Le Pen. But high abstention in their ranks could favor her.\u201cYou don\u2019t need me to tell you what you have to do,\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said, before adding that he would organize the coming legislative elections for his movement, Unbowed France, without saying whether he would run in those contests.It was difficult to estimate the impact of Mr. Jalkh\u2019s Holocaust denial on Ms. Le Pen\u2019s campaign, which has centered thus far on a bitter competition between Ms. Le Pen\u2019s protectionist views and Mr. Macron\u2019s support for globalization and the European Union. The economy is at the top of the country\u2019s priorities and security is also a major issue.While Ms. Le Pen was still trailing in opinion polls, which forecast that she would not get more than 38 to 40 percent of the votes, her campaign had gained momentum after the first round.\u201cFrench politics are not only about the Holocaust. It\u2019s an important topic, because it has to do with the memory of the Second World War, but it\u2019s not an everyday issue when you are president,\u201d Jean-Yves Camus, a scholar of far-right politics and director of the Observatory of Radical Politics at the Jean Jaur\u00e8s Foundation, told the Anglo-American Press Association on Thursday.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Curb the Use of Overseas Tax Havens? Yes! But How?", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byThe current system \u2014 in which profits earned abroad are not taxed until they are brought home \u2014 creates perverse incentives, encouraging American companies to park their money in lower-tax havens outside the United States. That stash now amounts to roughly $2.6 trillion.Repairing that system will require policy makers to confront two vexing problems. The first is how to get American companies to reel in the enormous sum and pay at least some of the tax that is due. The second is to overhaul how foreign earnings are taxed in the future so that multinationals change their ways.The broad plan unveiled on Wednesday by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, shows that the administration is eager to tackle both issues, but the plan does not provide enough detail to judge whether its approach will actually work.\u201cThese bizarre short-term loans are just silliness,\u201d Mr. Viard said.\u201cWhatever the rate is, it should be collected when the money is earned,\u201d regardless of whether it is repatriated, he said, adding, \u201cCompanies should be free to keep the money where they want and use it however they want.\u201dIn the past, policy makers tried to persuade companies to bring home profits by dangling a carrot: a voluntary, one-time tax holiday for companies that brought overseas profits back to invest in the United States. Yet the promised investment boom from a 2005 initiative never materialized, and the tax holiday turned into more of a permanent vacation. Companies did ship some money home \u2014 about $299 billion \u2014 but nearly all of it was used to increase shareholder dividends or buy back stock.A point-by-point look at how much it will increase the federal deficit.\u201cIt is just handing money to some of the people who have done really well in the global economy over the last three decades,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to create a single job or start a single factory.\u201dMr. Viard, of the American Enterprise Institute, agrees. \u201cThere is a strong case for a relatively high tax\u201d that is compulsory, he said. Even if a new system steeply cuts multinationals\u2019 taxes in the future, in his view, they should not be given a free pass on profits already earned. \u201cWe should not give people unexpected windfalls,\u201d he said.In his view, a mandatory 20 percent rate would be appropriate, although unlikely. In 2015, for example, President Barack Obama was unable to stir up enough support to pass an immediate 19 percent tax on American companies\u2019 global profits.As for overhauling the system, President Trump moved closer to the House Republicans. The administration plan endorses a shift away from a worldwide system (in which corporate profits are taxed no matter where around the globe they are earned) to a territorial one (that seeks to tax only profits earned within the United States).But both systems have their pitfalls. As is currently the case, the worldwide system encourages American companies to engage in all sorts of tax-avoidance methods to keep from booking their profits at home. Yet the danger of a territorial system is that without adequate safeguards, it would simply lead to a different set of schemes to shift profits from the United States to foreign subsidiaries, which would, in turn, eat away at the tax base.Michael J. Graetz, a tax law professor at Columbia University, is not very worried about shifting shenanigans, given that the president is pushing to drop the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. (The House Republican plan would reduce the rate to 20 percent, which would raise more revenue and produce a smaller budget deficit than Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal.)\u201cOnce you get the rate down to that low, then the incentive to shift profits offshore decreases,\u201d since the difference between the American rate and other countries\u2019 is so much smaller, Mr. Graetz said. \u201cSafeguards are then less important.\u201dNot everyone is as optimistic. Shutting those loopholes is crucial to the success of any plan, Ms. Clausing of Reed College said, whether the rate ends up at 15 percent or 20 percent. \u201cThe tough and the toothless versions of a territorial tax are very different beasts,\u201d she said. Japan and France, for example, designate countries with extremely low tax rates as havens and tax corporate profits sheltered there, she said. A similarly designed approach could work in the United States, she added.Protecting against base erosion is essential, said Rohit Kumar, a former deputy chief of staff for the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, and now a co-leader of PwC\u2019s Washington National Tax Services. The problem is figuring out how to do it.\u201cThere is no anti-base erosion rule that everybody likes,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. \u201cThe one that will prevail will be the one that everybody hates the least.\u201dWhile many Republicans, business leaders and Wall Street analysts would be happy to see tax rates pushed so low, many realize there is a still a long and winding road before a bill is passed.\u201cThe administration\u2019s tax-cut proposals are wildly ambitious and will meet very stiff resistance,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a commentary. \u201cSome tax cuts are likely this year, but not on the scale set out.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

Local party bosses and state senators, teachers and retirees, unionized and nonunion workers, talking about their hopes and dread as a brash untested leader strode into the world\u2019s most consequential job.Now, as President Trump approaches his 100th day in office, we wanted to circle back to some of the voters \u2014 most of them Trump supporters \u2014 we had spoken with around the start of his presidency about the issues that had driven their votes. Had Mr. Trump fulfilled his promises? Did his struggles and slack poll numbers disappoint them? Was he pleasing any of his detractors, or proving worse than they had feared?Many of his biggest backers said they had no regrets. No matter how few legislative accomplishments Mr. Trump can list, no matter the problems facing \u201cthe Wall,\u201d no matter if his Twitter posts make them wince, they praised his swagger, his executive orders and his Supreme Court appointment. \u201cHitting it out of the ballpark,\u201d said Dianna Ploss, a former nurse in Massachusetts.Others who opposed him then said they oppose him even more now. \u201cWhen I get up in the morning, I think, \u2018Well, what did Trump do now?\u2019\u201d said Diane Kirt, 64, of Reedsburg, Wis. But his critics have newfound energy and inspiration from protests that have propelled millions into the streets and nudged some to make first-time runs for public office.And then there are those somewhere in between. Some who were reluctant in November say they are happy with a growing economy and his support for the military. Some who cast a hedged, qualified vote for Mr. Trump say they are frustrated with his temperament and repeated falsehoods and would consider supporting a primary challenger.Others say: Give it more time \u2014 100 more days, or 1,000.Al Exner, Republican Party chairman of Sauk County, Wis., made no secret of his delight over Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as he chatted in January in a diner in one of America\u2019s most closely divided places. Mr. Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton was a mere 109 votes here, part of a shift that flipped Wisconsin from blue to red.Back in January, Maureen Sauer had to be coaxed into traveling to the Women\u2019s March on Washington from her home in O\u2019Fallon, Ill. She has a bad back and she did not think marching would make any difference. But her sisters prevailed, and the march proved an inspiration. Now, she is active in a church group called Dormant No More, trying to bring about change in her own town. She joined the school board and the local League of Women Voters, attended her first City Council meeting and worked to oust the mayor.At the dawn of the Trump era, Brandon Moore, 39, sat down inside a Mexican restaurant in central Ohio and counted himself a hopeful skeptic. As a Bible-believing Christian and supporter of gun rights, he had voted for Mr. Trump but was watchful. And today?\u201cI do have mixed feelings,\u201d he said. He liked Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to order a missile attack on a Syrian airfield because it showed that \u201cAmerica means business again.\u201d He liked how Mr. Trump baited and sparred with the news media.Matthew Heimbach, 26, is among the young men who identify with the alt-right, the amalgam of white supremacist and misogynist internet trolls and citizens who were energized by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.This month, Mr. Heimbach said he felt more invigorated than ever. \u201cHe did what we in the alt-right wanted him to do,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump had brought anti-immigrant sentiment into the mainstream, destabilized politics and polarized the electorate, Mr. Heimbach said. \u201cOur movement, it\u2019s gotten more unified,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten more clear on direction as to what we\u2019re working toward, which is an independent homeland.\u201dAt white nationalist events these days, he said, he is often among the oldest in the room, a stark difference from pre-Trump years, in which the people who shared his views were often twice his age. Mr. Heimbach runs a group called the Traditionalist Worker Party, which advocates replacing the United States with nation-states based on races, ethnicities and religions. He said that vision seems closer than ever.Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt talk has always been a selling point for State Senator Mark R. Maynard, 44, a freshman lawmaker in West Virginia and a Republican who was a leader of Mr. Trump\u2019s state campaign. So it was unsurprising that close to 100 days in, Mr. Maynard had nothing bad to say about Mr. Trump\u2019s shoot-from-the-hip talk and style, which has been such a departure from previous presidents.In fact, Mr. Maynard, who hails from tiny Genoa, W.Va., could not think of a single criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure thus far. He liked Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on President Barack Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. And he said his optimism is widely shared in his district, set in the struggling heart of Appalachia and coal country.\u201cYou know, everybody that I talk to has a positive rating, and they like what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard any complaints \u2014 and that\u2019s my feelings, too.\u201dEven Mr. Trump\u2019s failures \u2014 the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the travel ban blocked by a federal judge \u2014 seemed reassuring to Mr. Maynard because they showed that Mr. Trump was trying to do what he had promised.At a rally in Ambridge, Pa., a once-thriving steel and energy town and a symbol of the losses and grievances that powered Mr. Trump to the White House, Ron Ritz waited in line for hours to see the candidate. Back then, in October, Mr. Ritz said of Mr. Trump, \u201cI think he\u2019s going to try to give the American people back the things they deserve that were taken from them.\u201dIn Iowa, Mary Whisenand compared Mr. Trump in September 2015 to a \u201csummer fling\u201d that her fellow Republicans would soon get over as they turned to other candidates. Throughout the primary race and general election, Ms. Whisenand, a longtime party activist, never worked to elect Mr. Trump. She said the other day that she did not declare her support for him until Nov. 8, Election Day, when she cast her ballot.

{"Headline": "The Ups and Downs of the Sears Empire", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAlthough the company had stores all over America, they were in the big cities and towns. We went only once to the Kansas City store, when I was about 6, when a neighbor drove us there to shop for bedding \u2014 my parents didn\u2019t learn to drive until some years later.The size of the store terrified me \u2014 floor after floor with display shelves twice my height. Although every aisle showed something different, in their symmetry they all looked the same to me. I got lost and thought my parents would be so angry that they wouldn\u2019t bother to look for me. Fortunately my resourceful older brother tracked me down before I spent the rest of my childhood riding the elevators, bleating piteously.The rest of the time, we shopped through the catalog. My mother bought all her appliances from Sears, along with the husky-size jeans my brothers and I needed. Twice a year, Mom carefully filled in the order forms for everything from children\u2019s underwear to Craftsman tools and Kenmore vacuum cleaners, enclosed a check and waited for delivery.When she\u2019d finished shopping, my brothers and I got to use the catalog to make paper dolls or soldiers. Special catalogs had fabric samples that I could use for bedspreads and carpets in my dollhouse.My mother herself, during her Depression childhood, had cut out pictures of grand pianos and diamond tiaras and presented them as her wish list for presents.Our Jewish family stood out like giraffes in our small Kansas town: stared at and commented on but rarely targets of hostility. We were even more rarely targets of reverence, but the local Kenmore repairman belonged to a Protestant sect that believed, with Calvin, that Jews were the first called by God. The repairman thought working for a Jewish family brought him close to holiness, and he would never charge my mother for fixing her Kenmore washer or dryer.When I heard the news that Sears might be closing, that repairman was the first person I thought of. I\u2019m sure, like my mother, he has been dead many years, but he exemplified what Sears meant in small towns across the country. Unlike Amazon and other contemporary retail behemoths, Sears had employees who were part of our communities.Sears was the Amazon of its day. It sold everything: dishes, appliances, clothes, toys, groceries, motorcycles, car parts and even houses that you could construct bit by bit from the catalog. Having moved its headquarters from Minneapolis to Chicago, the company officially opened its 40-acre warehouse in 1906 to hold merchandise for national distribution. Retail stores would come later.When I moved to Chicago in 1968, Sears was the world\u2019s largest retailer. It employed about 350,000 people; its insurance company subsidiary, Allstate, dominated the auto and homeowners market. It had long outgrown its million-square-foot warehouse and had regional distribution centers three or four times that size.In 1970, with antiwar and civil rights protests roiling the country and the economy stagnant, Sears broke ground for a new headquarters building in downtown Chicago. It wanted three million square feet of office space and it wanted a monument to its historic market success \u2014 from small Minneapolis watch company in 1886 to retail giant in 1970.I couldn\u2019t afford Sears when I first moved here \u2014 everything I bought came from Goodwill. Besides, I\u2019ve never overcome my 6-year-old\u2019s anomie inside giant retail spaces. The fluorescent lights, the mind-numbing Muzak and the miles of aisles disorient me.The store where I used to daydream was Marshall Field \u2014 another vanished icon \u2014 where I\u2019d try on $2,000 frocks in the 28 Shop and imagine myself at opening night at the opera.By the time the Sears Tower was topped in 1973, the company had already begun to decline. The marketing strategies of the past century didn\u2019t work against muscular young competitors like Walmart. Sears closed stores; it eliminated products; it sold off Allstate, its most profitable subsidiary; but it wasn\u2019t able to stop the bleeding.A friend took a job at Dean Witter, the brokerage house Sears bought in an effort to stanch the flow. I\u2019d visit her at Sears on our lunch breaks, where the smell of stale popcorn made the store seem dreary and old. It was a far cry from the company\u2019s prime, when you could visit the dentist or podiatrist while you were buying a house, a tombstone or a dining room set.The London-based Willis insurance company took over naming rights for the tower when Sears\u2019s rights expired. The building is now officially Willis Tower, but for me and millions of other Chicagoans, it will always be the Sears Tower.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Tools Needed to Track Technology\u2019s Impact on Jobs, Panel Says", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byAmerica needs new tools for the timely measurement and monitoring of technology, jobs and skills to cope with the advance of artificial intelligence and automation, an expert panel composed mainly of economists and computer scientists said in a new report.The panel\u2019s recommendations include the development of an A.I. index, analogous to the Consumer Price Index, to track the pace and spread of artificial intelligence technology. That technical assessment, they said, could then be combined with detailed data on skills and tasks involved in various occupations to guide education and job-training programs.A public-private collaboration, they added, is necessary to create such tools because information from many sources will be the essential ingredient. Those information sources range from traditional government statistics to the vast pools of new data from online services like LinkedIn and Udacity that can be tapped to gain insights on skills, job openings and the effectiveness of training programs.Both the report and commentary were spurred by the advances in A.I. in recent years, including document-reading software and self-driving cars, which promise to make inroads into work done by humans. That prospect has created angst for many American workers about the difficulties of adapting to technological change and the failure of institutions to help them.Yet technologists and academics still differ sharply on how fast the next wave of automation will proceed and how many occupations will be affected. That prompted the panelists to suggest the new data-monitoring tools and the pulling together of government and online data sources to sort through the consequences.Those moves could eventually give a worker in a declining occupation useful information about a more promising occupation, with some similar skills but also requiring some new ones, Mr. Mitchell said. Then the software tool might also pull information on job placement rates for courses that teach those new skills.That style of data-driven decision-making is a hallmark of internet companies like Amazon and Google, and it has been increasingly embraced across corporate America. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason government can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Brynjolfsson said.\u201cBut our surveys are not really designed to track technology or its impact,\u201d said Professor Haltiwanger, who was a member of the expert panel. \u201cThe best shot at that is the private sector data.\u201dA broad national initiative, perhaps with the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis setting rules for private sector data sharing and privacy protections, might not be possible, Mr. Brynjolfsson conceded. But he and Mr. Mitchell wrote in Nature, \u201cPerfection here is not a prerequisite for utility \u2014 anything is better than flying blind.\u201dOne program that embodies the panel\u2019s recommendations is Skillful, a collaboration of the Markle Foundation, LinkedIn, Arizona State University and edX, a nonprofit provider of online courses. The partners are working with employers, educators and local governments in Colorado and the Phoenix metropolitan area to link jobs, skills and training more tightly.Past times of economic turmoil have led to new kinds of economic data collection and analysis.At the outset of the Depression in 1929, for example, there was no measure of national economic activity or reliable information on unemployment. In June 1930, based on scattered reports of improvement, President Herbert Hoover prematurely declared, \u201cThe Depression is over.\u201dTo address the information gap of its day, the government hired economists and statisticians to come up with a scientific method for measuring the national economy. In 1934, a team led by Simon Kuznets published its report on how to calculate national income. The field of econometrics took a big step forward, and policy makers were less in the dark.The time has now come, the expert panel suggested, for a similar effort to adapt to the modern digital economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retired Miners Lament Trump\u2019s Silence on Imperiled Health Plan", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byUNIONTOWN, Pa. \u2014 Donald J. Trump made coal miners a central metaphor of his presidential campaign, promising to \u201cput our miners back to work\u201d and look after their interests in a way that the Obama administration did not.Now, three months into his presidency, comes a test of that promise.Unless Congress intervenes by late April, government-funded health benefits will abruptly lapse for more than 20,000 retired miners, concentrated in Trump states that include Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Many of the miners have serious health problems arising from their years in the mines.In mining areas like Uniontown, Pa., and surrounding Fayette and Greene Counties, which Mr. Trump carried 2 to 1, it is an upsetting and potentially costly prospect. \u201cIt\u2019s just a terrible, terrible feeling,\u201d said one of the retirees, David VanSickle, who spent four decades at work in the mines. \u201cI think about that 25 times a day.\u201dThe president has offered no public comment on the issue, even as he has rolled back regulations on mine operators, an omission that has not escaped the notice of Mr. VanSickle and other retired miners.\u201cTo me, that was kind of a promise he did make to us,\u201d Mr. VanSickle said about Mr. Trump, whom he supported last fall. \u201cHe promised to help miners, not just mining companies.\u201dResponsibility for the retirees\u2019 health plans has increasingly shifted to the federal government in recent years, as struggling coal companies have shed their liabilities in bankruptcy court. Congress voted last fall to finance benefits for a large group of retirees for several months, but House and Senate Republican leaders have yet to agree on a longer-term solution.The benefits can easily mean the difference between a middle-class retirement and economic hardship, since many retired miners are too young to qualify for Medicare. Others have chronic or debilitating health problems that would require expensive supplemental coverage \u2014 currently provided by the retiree plan \u2014 even with the Medicare benefit.Norm Skinner worked for more than 20 years as a miner in eastern Ohio and had triple bypass surgery in 2010. Without the retiree health plan, he said, the surgery \u201cwould have broke me,\u201d even with Medicare picking up much of the bill.Uniontown, which lies about 30 miles east of two large mines that once employed well over 1,000 miners but are down to roughly 600 after one ceased production in 2015, hints at both middle-class affluence and postindustrial angst.Around the corner from Ptak\u2019s, a formidable-looking formal wear store on Main Street, are a handful of dilapidated storefronts and a vast, empty commercial space that advertises \u201cmental health counseling\u201d and \u201cmotivational speaking\u201d for veterans. The space has the appearance of a renovation that was never completed and, to the naked eye, could pass for a sign of either revival or decline, like much of Uniontown itself.Mr. VanSickle, who lost parts of two fingers on the job, said his doctor advised him to retire two years ago, at 59, because he suffers from black lung, a condition associated with long-term exposure to coal dust.He manages the illness by attaching himself to a breathing machine that essentially props open the airway to his lungs while he sleeps. \u201cMy oxygen content would drop so low without it,\u201d he said, fitting tubes into his nose from the bedroom of his comfortable home in Uniontown.Last fall, Mr. VanSickle priced out a private insurance plan that would provide roughly comparable benefits for him and his wife, who takes about a dozen separate medications to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The estimates came in at $1,500 to $1,800 per month.\u201cI always wanted to be a person who would leave a little legacy for my children,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I lose these benefits and my pension, there will not be enough for me, let alone for my children.\u201d(Mr. VanSickle and his wife could be eligible for thousands of dollars in subsidies if they purchased insurance under the Affordable Care Act, said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. But such a plan would most likely be more limited, and Mr. Trump still maintains that he wants to undo the program.)The miners typically regard their health care with a sense of moral entitlement, having frequently passed up higher pay during contract talks in order to top off their benefits.John Leach, 67, worked in four different mines over 23 years as a miner in western Kentucky. As a result, he said, \u201cI got four of those speeches: \u2018If you work here, you work your 20 years, you are guaranteed insurance for yourself and your family for the rest of your life.\u2019\u201dSince he retired in 2001, that insurance, along with Medicaid and Medicare, has kept him and his wife, Rhonda, 60, afloat. The couple care for two adult children with severe physical and mental disabilities. In 2015, the health plan paid out over $50,000 for Rhonda\u2019s hip-replacement surgery.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever gone through a serious test at the doctor\u2019s office,\u201d Ms. Leach said by phone. \u201cYou wait and wait and don\u2019t hear anything and the pressure starts building up: Am I going to live or am I going to die? That\u2019s exactly what this is like: living and dying.\u201dMany retired miners who supported Mr. Trump understood that his promise to revive employment in their industry was a long shot in the face of cheap natural gas \u2014 \u201ca couple of jobs\u201d might come of it, Mr. VanSickle said.But they believed their wish was a modest one. The price tag for their benefits averages a little under $200 million per year over the next 10 years, which can be partly offset through interest that accrues in a federal fund for reclaiming abandoned mines. Because no new miners would become eligible for the health benefits awarded to this group, the cost would eventually dwindle to zero.Last year, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, appeared reluctant to expedite a vote on a permanent fix despite bipartisan support, and despite representing a state where several thousand retirees are affected.One reason for his lack of enthusiasm may have been the hundreds of thousands of dollars the union spent opposing him in his most recent re-election campaign.Earlier this year, Mr. McConnell appeared to develop a sense of urgency, however, introducing legislation to pay for a once-and-for-all extension of the health benefits. (A McConnell spokesman noted that he had supported a one-year extension late last year.)Some time after that, the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, let it be known that he could abide no more than 20 months, after which the benefits would either lapse or have to be extended again.\u201cIt perfectly lined up with the 2018 election,\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, the Senate\u2019s leading proponent of a permanent resolution. Mr. Manchin speculated that Republicans favored another short-term reprieve so that his Republican opponent next year, who could be one of the House Republicans from his state, could claim credit for yet another extension.A spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee said all 2017 funding bills were still being negotiated.A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.In the last few days, the House Republican leadership has suggested that it, too, might support a permanent fix, according to Phil Smith, the chief lobbyist for the miners union, but only if it can settle on a revenue source to offset the full cost. \u201cIt leaves the door wide open to \u2018Well, we couldn\u2019t find one,\u2019\u201d Mr. Smith said.Many miners in their early 60s are postponing retirement, unsure if their savings will suffice absent the health insurance they have long expected.Tony Brnusak, 62, who has worked for nearly 40 years in the Cumberland mine, said he would probably be retiring, if not for the uncertainty around his benefits.\u201cMy wife works and she\u2019ll be retiring next year, but she won\u2019t have the medical when she retires, she won\u2019t have a pension,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re counting on mine.\u201dHe serves as president of the local mine workers union and estimates that at least 50 to 60 more workers at Cumberland, out of just under 600, are in a similar position.Although he agrees with Mr. Trump on some key issues, not least climate change, he can\u2019t conceal his disappointment that the health care issue has lingered for so long.\u201cI thought he was really going to help people,\u201d Mr. Brnusak said, referring to Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s helped the rich man, the coal operators. But nothing for us so far.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuelan Court Revises Ruling That Nullified Legislature", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe decisions of the court have not divested the Parliament of its powers,\u201d Maikel Moreno, the court\u2019s chief judge, said in an address on Saturday afternoon. He said the Supreme Court should not be in conflict with other branches of government \u201cbecause it is only an arbiter.\u201dThe state television network VTV on Saturday published summaries of the court\u2019s most recent rulings in which the judges said they had \u201csuppressed\u201d parts of an earlier decision to nullify the legislature and allow the court to write laws itself. Judge Moreno said the court had also reversed a decision to strip lawmakers of their immunity from prosecution.The court\u2019s initial ruling, published on Wednesday night, prompted widespread outrage because it removed what most consider to be the last remaining check to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s growing power, the opposition-controlled legislature. The court, packed with judges loyal to Mr. Maduro, is considered to be controlled by the president.But as of late Saturday, the court itself had not published its rulings on its website, leaving it unclear how far the court planned to go in restoring the legislature\u2019s powers, which it has been chipping away at for more than a year.Margarita L\u00f3pez Maya, a Venezuelan political scientist, said the court appeared to consider the legislature to be in contempt, meaning that it might not be able to pass laws, even if the court agreed not to take over its legislative powers.The court has also spent the past year overturning major decisions made by the chamber, Ms. L\u00f3pez said, including a law granting amnesty to political prisoners and moves to block the president from expanding his power over the economy. That stalemate, she added, seemed unlikely to change.\u201cIt\u2019s like a chess game where you just moved one pawn,\u201d she said.Enrique S\u00e1nchez Falc\u00f3n, a Venezuelan constitutional expert, said he also believed that the court would continue to consider the legislature to be in contempt of the law and questioned whether it was even legal for its earlier decision to be revised.But the series of events had done damage to the rule of law in Venezuela, he said. \u201cThe constitutional order of Venezuela has been completely fractured,\u201d he said.On Saturday, the Venezuelan opposition showed no signs that it would accept the court\u2019s reversal as evidence that a respect for democratic principles had been restored.Several thousand protesters gathered in the streets in a show of support for the National Assembly. Witnesses said that security forces dispersed by firing tear gas canisters, which injured at least two lawmakers who had joined the protest.The court\u2019s initial decision also revealed dissent within Mr. Maduro\u2019s movement that could reflect limits on his march toward one-man rule.Am\u00e9rico Mart\u00ed, a Venezuelan lawyer and leftist leader, said that Ms. Ortega\u2019s dissent represented a \u201ckind of democratic reaction within Chavismo and a reflection of the international and national pressure\u201d the movement was facing.Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, a regional body that aims to promote democracy, trade, and economic and social development, called the move a \u201cself-inflicted coup,\u201d while the United States and other countries condemned the decision as eroding the country\u2019s democracy.\u201cWhat we have warned of has finally come to pass,\u201d said Mr. Almagro, who has spent much of the past year chastising the government, even accusing Mr. Maduro of aiming to become a \u201cpetty dictator.\u201dCritics say the court\u2019s assault on the legislature is part of a longer slide away from democracy that has come as the government\u2019s popularity has declined amid the worst economic crisis in recent memory. Falling oil prices and years of economic mismanagement have left many Venezuelans facing shortages of food and basic medicines, setting off widespread protests.The government is holding at least 114 political prisoners, according to Penal Forum, a human rights group. Local elections that were to have been held last year have been postponed.Nicholas Casey reported from Iquitos, and Patricia Torres from Caracas, Venezuela.

Mr. Thomas had been shot twice before and carried two slugs in his body from the first attack, in 2011, when he took eight bullets to the torso.One weekend last October, the men came face to face in the Mott Haven Houses, the authorities say.Mr. Rice, 39, rolled his wheelchair into a small fenced courtyard where an impromptu birthday party was in progress, accompanied by his brother, Darrell, and three friends, the police said. He wore dreadlocks, glasses and a black down vest.Mr. Thomas, 28, rose to to meet them. It was about 1:50 a.m. on Sunday, Oct. 23. Known as Biggie, Mr. Thomas stood 6-foot-3 and weighed about 300 pounds. He had been expecting trouble for weeks, his friends said. He told his mother that the Rice brothers might be looking for him because he had beaten up their uncle.Mr. Rice and Mr. Thomas had long arrest records on charges including crack dealing and gun possession. Both had served time in prison. Both had been suspects in other shootings. Both were feared figures in the Mott Haven Houses and the nearby Patterson Houses, projects notorious for gun violence and feuds between street gangs.The guns are used not only in crimes like robbery and drug dealing, but also in a struggle for respect in some of the city\u2019s most impoverished neighborhoods.That Sunday morning, security cameras recorded a confrontation in the courtyard, the police said. Mr. Rice\u2019s brother, Darrell, walked up to Mr. Thomas and threw the first punch, detectives said. Mr. Thomas absorbed the blow, unfazed, and took off his jacket, squaring up to brawl. Then Daniel Rice, who calls himself Capone, drew a .45-caliber pistol, leveled it at Mr. Thomas and, investigators believe, started firing. Ten bullets tore into Mr. Thomas\u2019s chest, arms, legs and groin.He went down on his belly, blood fanning out. He had a puzzled look, said a friend who arrived just after the shooting but did not witness it.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even talk,\u201d the friend said, asking that his name not be published for fear of the Rice family. \u201cHe died right in my arms right there on the floor. I watched him take his last breath.\u201dThe Rices left the scene with no evident alarm, Darrell Rice pushing his brother calmly toward Willis Avenue, detectives said. They headed several blocks west on East 141st Street and disappeared into an apartment building, their retreat recorded by security cameras along the way.\u201cHe knows no one is ratting him out because they are scared of him,\u201d Detective Oscar Rosa, the lead investigator, said a few days later. \u201cThey fear him.\u201dSigns of gun violence are ubiquitous in the 4-0, which has some of the highest rates of shootings and of gun seizures in the city. Bullet holes pock walls in the area\u2019s projects and the doors of some all-night bodegas. On the sidewalks, wounded men in the prime of life walk with canes or ride in wheelchairs.Gunshots at night are not uncommon in and around the Mott Haven and Patterson projects, residents say.

And agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives say the flow of guns into the city has not diminished, despite efforts to crack down on gunrunners.Guns produce money in New York: A pistol bought for $200 out of state can go for $700 on Brook Avenue in the Bronx. But unlike many drug dealers, gunrunners tend to rely on personal connections and rarely sell in the open, federal officials said. New Yorkers visiting relatives in Virginia or Ohio, for instance, may take orders from people they know and buy guns at pawn shops, at sporting-goods stores, at gun shows or from private sellers, then haul them back, often on economy buses run out of Chinatown, law enforcement officials said. The sales are sometimes arranged on social media, they said.The firearms remain in circulation for decades, being resold again and again, studies show. Some are kept by street gangs as community weapons, stashed in mailboxes, trash cans or the wheel wells of cars, available to use at a moment\u2019s notice, the officials said.In 2015, about 3,674 guns were recovered in the city, with 89 percent of them originating in other states, according to the state attorney general\u2019s office. The Bronx had the most guns recovered per capita in the city, with 902, or 62 for every 100,000 residents. Brooklyn was close behind, with 55 for every 100,000. The South Bronx and northern Brooklyn are also where two-thirds to three-quarters of the city\u2019s shootings take place, Chief Shea said.A 30-year-old man who helps run a heroin-dealing operation in the 40th Precinct said that procuring a gun was simple. \u201cI can walk down the street and buy a gun right now,\u201d said the dealer, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified by name. \u201cIt\u2019s probably used. It\u2019s probably got a body. Somebody\u2019s going to sell it to you.\u201dFive days after he was killed, Mr. Thomas was laid out in a dust-blue coffin with a floral pattern at the Porta Coeli San German Funeral Home on Westchester Avenue. His mother, Rosa Martinez, sat opposite him on a couch, while his girlfriend, Shantice Murphy, handed out prayer cards with his photo.His uncle, James Thomas, a Brooklyn pastor, implored the mourners not to seek vengeance. \u201cThis pain we are going through in my family \u2014 I don\u2019t want any of my loved ones causing it to someone else,\u201d he said.Ms. Martinez said most of her children managed to find jobs and move out of the Mott Haven Houses, but not Kevin, her third and most impulsive son. He began smoking marijuana and getting in trouble with the law when he was 12 years old, around the same time she separated from his father, remarried and moved into the development.She lost control over him, she said. When he was 14, she persuaded a judge to send him to a state-financed boarding school for troubled teens in Westchester County. But he ran away twice and eventually dropped out. Soon he was dealing crack and marijuana behind 350 East 143rd Street, a high-rise in the Mott Haven complex.Mr. Thomas\u2019s family said he seemed happy hustling his nights away in the courtyard, selling drugs, smoking marijuana, bingeing on Netflix and doing as little as he could for money \u2014 not much of it legal. \u201cI can\u2019t say he was an ambitious person, like he had dreams and goals,\u201d said Kary Thomas, his sister. \u201cHe just lived for the moment. He worried about having the latest Jordans, MCM belts and being in fashion, being popular.\u201dBesides stylish clothes and Hennessy Cognac, Mr. Thomas had one other obvious passion: a shiny red motor scooter. He would race around Upper Manhattan and the South Bronx, his huge frame barely fitting on the seat as the machine careened around corners.At 19, he was arrested in the courtyard with his best friend, Alex Martinez, on charges that they tried to kill a father and son. According to court papers, Mr. Thomas was charged with attempted murder after he pistol-whipped the son, Angel Cruz Jr., and tried to shoot him. The gun went off three times during the struggle, hitting Mr. Martinez. Arrested on drug charges while out on bail, Mr. Thomas later pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to nine months in jail.Over the next four years, Mr. Thomas was arrested more than a dozen times on assault, weapons possession and drug-selling charges. He pleaded guilty in March 2009 to selling crack cocaine and was diverted into a drug-treatment program. But he failed to attend, and in February 2012, a judge sentenced him to three years in prison.When he wasn\u2019t behind bars, Mr. Thomas would occasionally find his own place to stay, usually a cheap rental, but always ended up back at his mother\u2019s place. He worked off and on as a janitor and hauled boxes around a warehouse.But mainly he sold drugs, always with the same cadre of friends in the fenced courtyard behind 350 East 143rd Street. He operated independently of other dealers and often fought with them, the police said. \u201cHe sold whatever he wanted; he sold to whomever he wanted,\u201d Detective Rosa said. \u201cThere were no rules in his game.\u201dMr. Thomas\u2019s sister said he enjoyed intimidating rivals. \u201cHe was a never-back-down type of person,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like anybody really liked him. They feared him. That was the problem. They feared him.\u201dHis pugnacity led to trouble. In July 2011, Mr. Thomas became embroiled in a fight with Jamel Fielder, then 21, a diminutive man from the Patterson Houses known as Pee-wee. Mr. Thomas stripped Mr. Fielder of a gun near the Mott Haven Houses and shot him in the buttocks as he ran away, the police said.A month later, Mr. Fielder ambushed Mr. Thomas as he emerged from a pizza shop, shooting him eight times as he crossed the street, the police said. Mr. Thomas collapsed on a metal bench, a half-eaten pizza slice still in his hand, according to the police and the account of a witness. Doctors could remove only six of the slugs, and Mr. Thomas was left with long scars on his torso and arms. (Mr. Fielder was charged with attempted murder but later pleaded guilty to gun possession and received a two-year prison sentence.)After the attack, Mr. Thomas\u2019s mother tried to be moved to an apartment in a different project, arguing that her family had been traumatized. But she was never relocated. Once her son recovered, he went right back to selling in the courtyard, she said, despite her pleas.In September 2015, Mr. Thomas again became a shooting victim. It happened after he accused another person in his circle of having been an informant in a federal drug case and took a swipe at him with a knife, according to one witness. The man shot Mr. Thomas in the leg, leaving him with a limp.Though the police arrested a suspect in the shooting, Mr. Thomas refused to testify and the charges were eventually dropped, the police said. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I say something, they\u2019ll come and kill me and all of us,\u2019\u201d his mother recalled.Among the people who regularly bought crack from Mr. Thomas was Joshua Rice, 57, an addict known as Pop Bucket because he carried a pail and rags everywhere. He washed cars to earn drug money. He was Daniel Rice\u2019s uncle, though he had little regular contact with his relatives and could not be located for comment.Sometime in early October \u2014 no one is sure of the date \u2014 Mr. Thomas gave Joshua Rice a few dollars to wash his prized motor scooter, but the older man never got around to the chore, the police said. Angry, Mr. Thomas confronted Mr. Rice and broke his jaw, the police said.That night, Mr. Thomas told his mother he had been warned the Rice brothers might retaliate. \u201cHe told me his family said they are going to come for him,\u201d Ms. Martinez recalled. Daniel Rice was especially feared, known to carry a pistol secreted in his wheelchair, several acquaintances said.Mr. Rice and his lawyer declined requests to be interviewed for this article. So did his father, his daughter, two of his uncles, his grandmother and several other relatives. Efforts to contact Darrell Rice at his apartment and on the telephone were unsuccessful.The details of the shooting that left him without full use of his legs remain murky. Whatever the cause, it did not deter Mr. Rice from committing crimes. Starting in 1994, he was arrested three times on charges of gun possession and ended up serving a three-year stint in prison after guilty plea.He had been out on parole for just five months when the police barged into his family\u2019s apartment in May 2002, searching for Darrell Rice, who had fled the police and left behind a car full of crack. The officers did not catch him that night, but they found Daniel in his bedroom with a gun and a large quantity of cocaine. This time, he was charged in federal court, where sentences for gun crimes are stiffer.During court proceedings, Daniel Rice\u2019s lawyers argued that the shooting that put their client in a wheelchair as a teenager had left him psychologically scarred. Paranoid about another attack, he had developed an \u201cinfatuation with guns,\u201d his lawyers said.But prosecutors noted the evidence that Mr. Rice dealt drugs. \u201cRice is a crack dealer who also uses guns, not a person scared of being the victim of another random shooting,\u201d the prosecutor, Steven D. Feldman, argued in papers.In the end, Mr. Rice was sentenced to 10 years in a federal penitentiary.After he returned in 2012, he demanded that young people in the projects show him respect, a former friend said, and he talked tough with men like Mr. Thomas, almost daring them to mock him for his disability.\u201cHe\u2019s not to be played with,\u201d the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIt was a lot of people testing him because he was in a wheelchair.\u201dThe man who was with Mr. Thomas when he died said he also had known Mr. Rice for more than 20 years. He said that Mr. Rice was quick to brandish a pistol if he felt slighted. \u201cHe really thinks he\u2019s Al Capone and people owe him and his family respect,\u201d the man said. \u201cHe was a bitter guy.\u201dMs. Martinez \u2014 Mr. Thomas\u2019s mother \u2014 said she could see the spot where he died from the window of his room. She sat there often after he was buried at a cemetery in New Jersey and thought about how he had been murdered \u201cfor slapping\u201d Joshua Rice. \u201cEvery little fight, they take out a gun,\u201d Ms. Martinez said. \u201cYou lose a life for nothing.\u201dIt did not take long for the 40th Precinct\u2019s detective squad to hear chatter that Mr. Rice was behind the shooting, and investigators believed that the man in the wheelchair with long dreadlocks seen on security camera footage matched his description.Still, they waited to question him. The images were too grainy to make out the shooter\u2019s face clearly. As a rule, detectives in the Bronx rarely charge someone on video evidence alone, because a defense lawyer can easily cast doubt on the identification. The investigators needed a witness to confirm the shooter\u2019s identity.\u201dThey\u2019re both scared to death,\u201d said Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the squad commander.Tests on shell casings at the scene linked the gun used to kill Mr. Thomas to another shooting. And the police had evidence that Mr. Rice had provided the pistol used in an additional attack, the 2014 shooting of Latroy Tarver, another Mott Haven man with a history of drug offenses.With no witnesses, Detective Rosa thought the only way to move the case forward was to ask federal prosecutors to step in and use racketeering laws to wrap the three crimes together in one indictment against Mr. Rice.Then the squad caught a break. In late November, the police arrested a man on unrelated charges who said he had seen Mr. Thomas get shot.Sergeant LoPuzzo said he was skeptical at first. \u201cI said, \u2018I ain\u2019t interested in what you heard in the street.\u2019 He says, \u2018I didn\u2019t hear anything, I was there,\u2019 and everything fell into place.\u201dOnce they had a witness, the detectives persuaded a judge to let them track Mr. Rice\u2019s cellphone to locate him. On Jan. 20, it pinged in a barber shop at Westchester and Waterbury Avenues. Mr. Rice, fresh from a haircut, was arrested as he left the shop. He had a loaded Glock pistol tucked under his belt, according to a criminal complaint.Back at the station house, detectives helped Mr. Rice up the stairs, half-carrying him to an interview room. He asked for a lawyer right away. \u201cHe was kind of laughing,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said. \u201cLike he wasn\u2019t taking anything seriously.\u201dIt turned out the gun he was carrying was not the one used in the shooting of Mr. Thomas. Still, the detectives held him on a gun possession charge, and four days later, prosecutors brought the witness before a grand jury and obtained a murder indictment.At his arraignment, Mr. Rice pleaded not guilty and complained to Justice William I. Mogulescu that his court-appointed lawyer had prevented him from testifying before the grand jury. \u201cYou are telling me I have no right to go before the grand jury?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want this lawyer. I want to go before the grand jury.\u201dDuring his next appearance, Mr. Rice sounded nonchalant as he pleaded not guilty to the gun possession charge. As he was wheeled out, he yelled \u201cI love you\u201d to his adult daughter, then glanced at a reporter in the court, smiled and said, \u201cCheese!\u201dBenjamin Mueller and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Toyota to Invest $1.3 Billion in Kentucky Plant", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 In the latest move by a major automaker to enhance its American manufacturing operations, Toyota said on Monday that it would invest more than $1.3 billion to upgrade its assembly plant in Kentucky.The announcement follows a push by President Trump for auto companies to expand in the United States, and it follows similar actions by General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler.The investment will not add jobs at Toyota\u2019s plant in Georgetown, Ky., but a company spokesman, Scott Vazin, said the investment \u201csolidifies its commitment\u201d to manufacturing vehicles in the United States.Asked if Mr. Trump\u2019s policies played a role in the decision, Mr. Vazin said, \u201cNo, but we do share his goal of growing the economy and jobs in the U.S.\u201dThe Georgetown plant is Toyota\u2019s largest in the world, and it employs 8,200 people. Last year, it added 700 employees to support the introduction of a version of the Camry sedan, its top-selling vehicle.Toyota said the new investment would cut the time needed to develop new models and would improve manufacturing flexibility so that the company can quickly respond to changes in demand.The company also released a statement from Mr. Trump endorsing the move. \u201cToyota\u2019s decision to invest $1.3 billion in their Kentucky plant is further evidence that manufacturers are now confident that the economic climate has greatly improved under my administration,\u201d the president said in the statement.Mr. Trump has taken a keen interest in the auto industry, both during his presidential campaign and in the first months of his administration.While he has criticized auto companies, including Toyota, for investing in Mexican factories that supply vehicles to the United States, he has also pledged to cut regulations to encourage the expansion of American manufacturing facilities.Automakers had requested the move after the Obama administration finalized standards that called for companies to achieve an average corporate fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.Toyota said its investment in Kentucky would be spread over three years and would introduce a new product development and manufacturing process that shortens vehicle development cycles.\u201cThis $1.33 billion investment is part of Toyota\u2019s plan to invest $10 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, on top of the nearly $22 billion Toyota has invested in the U.S. over the past 60 years,\u201d said James E. Lentz, chief executive of Toyota Motor North America.Of vehicles sold in the United States, the Camry is considered to have the most American-produced parts, and it has been the nation\u2019s top-selling passenger car for more than a decade.The auto industry is coming off two consecutive years of record annual sales in the United States. Sales have begun to slip slightly so far this year, however, and dropped 1.6 percent in March compared with the same period in 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tillerson Toughens Tone on Iran After U.S. Confirms Nuclear Deal Compliance", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byThe whiplash left Republicans on Capitol Hill, who had universally excoriated the agreement to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program and voted against its implementation, uncertain of how to respond. Its architects, however, said they were cautiously optimistic that the deal would stay in place.The nuclear deal \u201cfails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cIt only delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state.\u201dHe said that Iran continued to threaten the United States and the rest of the world, and he announced that the Trump administration was reviewing ways to counter challenges posed by Tehran.In a hastily called news conference at the State Department on Wednesday, Mr. Tillerson likened Iran to North Korea, whose nuclear weaponry and burgeoning missile technology is what the administration now believes is the gravest risk to world peace and security. Mr. Pence visited Seoul, South Korea, this week to declare that the United States was united with its allies to stem North Korea\u2019s threat.The Iran deal \u201crepresents the same failed approach to the past that brought us to the current imminent threat that we face from North Korea,\u201d Mr. Tillerson told reporters. \u201cThe Trump administration has no intention of passing the buck to a future administration on Iran. The evidence is clear: Iran\u2019s provocative actions threaten the United States, the region and the world.\u201dOnce the National Security Council completes a review of the nuclear deal, Mr. Tillerson said, \u201cwe will meet the challenges Iran poses with clarity and conviction.\u201dHours earlier, late on Tuesday night, Mr. Tillerson sent a terse letter to Speaker Paul D. Ryan pledging to evaluate whether earlier suspension of sanctions against Iran, as required under the terms of the nuclear agreement, \u201cis vital to the national security interests of the United States.\u201d\u201cI think part of the review, the interagency process, is to determine where Iran is in compliance with the deal and to make recommendations to the president on the path forward,\u201d Mr. Spicer said.The enigmatic remarks left top Republicans on Capitol Hill nonplused. Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican who led congressional opposition to the Iran deal, said in a statement that the administration\u2019s \u201ccertification is shaky, and it doesn\u2019t mean that the intentions behind Iran\u2019s nuclear program are benign.\u201dSenator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the Trump administration appeared to be preparing a tougher line against Iran.\u201cSecretary Tillerson made clear that regardless of Iran\u2019s technical compliance with the nuclear deal, the administration is under no illusion about the continued threat from Tehran and is prepared to work closely with Congress to push back,\u201d Mr. Corker said in a statement on Wednesday.Tuesday\u2019s certification extends sanctions relief for Iran in exchange for continued constraints on its nuclear program. American sanctions, as approved by Congress, were suspended instead of revoked; they can be reimposed with the stroke of a presidential pen.The Trump administration has given itself 90 days to complete its review, but it will need to make a series of decisions in coming weeks about whether to continue its support of the deal, which was also brokered with Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. Those governments, along with representatives of the United States and Iran, will meet next week in Vienna to review the pact\u2019s progress.Mr. Trump faces a mid-May deadline, as imposed by Congress, to decide whether to continue the suspension of sanctions.Backing away from the agreement would spur enormous consternation across Europe and in Moscow.In their first congratulatory phone calls to Mr. Trump after his electoral victory, both President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany emphasized the need to keep the Iran deal in place. And after her first meeting with Mr. Tillerson in February, Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign minister, said the Trump administration pledged \u201cto stick to the full strict implementation of the agreement in all its parts.\u201dAnalysts and former government officials said it was unlikely the Trump administration would renounce the Iran agreement.\u201cI\u2019m glad this deal has held up to this point, and I hope it continues to hold up,\u201d said Wendy Sherman, a former under secretary of state who was deeply involved in negotiating terms of the deal during the Obama administration.Robert Einhorn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was involved in Iran policy under President Barack Obama, said it was \u201cpretty much a foregone conclusion\u201d that Mr. Trump would keep the nuclear agreement in place.The Trump administration has returned the United States to closer ties with its traditional Arab friends in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Part of those ties means supporting those nations, which are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim, in their intense rivalry with Iran, a Shiite power.By contrast, by the end of his second term, Mr. Obama had begun to view those sectarian tensions with a jaundiced eye, believing the United States should not intervene in a millennium-old religious struggle.Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Tillerson attended a United States-Saudi Arabia chief executive summit meeting where he declared that he was \u201cpleased to be here today to reaffirm the very strong partnership that exists between the United States and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201dMark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a group that sought to defeat the Iran deal, said the administration may still walk away from the agreement or renegotiate it. He contended that the administration \u201cshould not be bound by arms control agreements that are deeply flawed.\u201dAnd even Ms. Sherman shied away from predicting it will remain in place. \u201cI\u2019m taking this one day at a time,\u201d she said.An article on Thursday about Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\u2019s diplomatic efforts with Iran erroneously included Bahrain among allies of the United States that have a Sunni Muslim demographic majority. It is majority Shiite (though the family that leads Bahrain is Sunni).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why an Open Market Won\u2019t Repair American Health Care", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.A few years back, the future of American health policy appeared to hinge on how similar medical care was to broccoli. It was March 2012, and the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) was before the Supreme Court. Justice Antonin Scalia zeroed in on its controversial requirement that all Americans purchase health insurance. Yes, everybody needs health care, Scalia conceded, but everybody needs food too. If the government could make people buy insurance, why couldn\u2019t it \u201cmake people buy broccoli\u201d?The Affordable Care Act survived, of course \u2014 though not before a fractured court made the expansion of Medicaid optional, leaving millions of poorer Americans without its promised benefits. But the question Justice Scalia asked remains at the heart of a debate that has only intensified since: Why is health care different? Why does it create so much more anxiety and expense, heartache and hardship, than does buying broccoli \u2014 or cars or computers or the countless other things Americans routinely purchase each day?For those leading the charge to roll back the 2010 law, the question has a one-word answer: government. President Trump\u2019s point man on health policy, the former congressman (and ultrawealthy orthopedic surgeon) Tom Price, has said that \u201cnothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government\u2019s intrusion into medicine through Medicare.\u201d Senator Rand Paul (another surgeon) and House Speaker Paul Ryan have claimed that the affordability of Lasik eye surgery \u2014 generally not covered by health insurance \u2014 shows that a much freer health care market would be much less expensive. Their idea of \u201creform\u201d is to cut back public and private insurance so consumers have \u201cmore skin in the game\u201d and thus shop more wisely.The physician-turned-journalist Elisabeth Rosenthal offers a very different answer in her eye-opening \u201cAn American Sickness.\u201d Rosenthal \u2014 formerly a reporter for The New York Times, now the editor in chief of the nonprofit Kaiser Health News \u2014 is best known for a prizewinning series of articles, \u201cPaying Till It Hurts.\u201d In them, Rosenthal chronicled the seemingly endless pathologies of America\u2019s medical-industrial complex, from prescription drugs that grew more costly as they became more dated to hip-replacement surgery so expensive it was cheaper for a patient to fly to a hospital in Belgium.Rosenthal thinks the health care market is different, and she sums up these differences as the \u201ceconomic rules of the dysfunctional medical market.\u201d There are 10 \u2014 some obvious (No. 9: \u201cThere\u2019s money to be made in billing for anything and everything\u201d); some humorous (No. 2: \u201cA lifetime of treatment is preferable to a cure\u201d) \u2014 but No. 10 is the big one: \u201cPrices will rise to whatever the market will bear.\u201d To Rosenthal, that\u2019s the answer to Scalia\u2019s question. The health care market doesn\u2019t work like other markets because \u201cwhat the market will bear\u201d is vastly greater than what a well-functioning market should bear. As Rosenthal describes American health care, it\u2019s not really a market; it\u2019s more like a protection racket \u2014 tolerated only because so many different institutions are chipping in to cover the extortionary bill and because, ultimately, it\u2019s our lives that are on the line.Consider the epicenter of America\u2019s cost crisis: the once humble hospital. Thanks in part to hit TV shows, we think of hospitals as public-spirited pillars of local communities. Yet while most are legally classified as nonprofits, they are also very big businesses, maximizing surpluses that can be plowed into rising salaries and relentless expansion even when they are not earning profits or remunerating shareholders. And they have grown much bigger and more businesslike over time.Rosenthal tells the story of Providence Portland Medical Center, a Northwest hospital system founded by nuns. Four decades ago, its operational hub in Portland, Ore., consisted of two modest hospitals: Providence and St. Vincent. As it happens, my mother was a nurse at St. Vincent for more than half those years, and thus had a front-row seat as Providence transformed from a Catholic charity into one of the nation\u2019s largest nonprofit hospital systems, with annual revenues of $14 billion in 2015.Along the way, Providence jettisoned most of its original mission, replacing nuns with number crunchers. Once run mainly by doctors, it filled its growing bureaucracy with professional coders capable of gaming insurance-reimbursement rules to extract maximum revenue. Meanwhile, Providence stopped paying doctors as staff and reclassified them as independent contractors (though not so independent they could skip a \u201ccharm school\u201d designed by its marketers). Yet even as its C.E.O. earned more than $4 million, Providence touted itself as a \u201cnot-for-profit Catholic health care ministry\u201d upholding the \u201ctradition of caring\u201d started by the nuns (now listed as \u201csponsors\u201d in promotional materials). Rosenthal sums up the result as \u201ca weird mix of Mother Teresa and Goldman Sachs.\u201dActually, not much of Mother Teresa: Providence-like consolidation in every part of American health care has created a structure at least as concentrated as the European systems conservatives decry, yet without the economy or coordination of care such concentration might offer if it were focused on people rather than profits. The Yale economist Zack Cooper has shown that prices paid by private insurers are not just massively higher than those paid by Medicare. (They\u2019re in a different orbit from those paid abroad.) They are also hugely variable from place to place and even institution to institution, without any evidence that higher prices produce better care. Providers charge high prices not when and where they need to; but when and where \u2014 courtesy of consolidation \u2014 they can.Rosenthal\u2019s book doesn\u2019t conclude with conglomerates. She also provides an eye-opening discussion of skyrocketing drug prices, as well as the less-familiar pathologies of excessive medical testing and overpriced medical devices, such as artificial hips and knees \u2014 a market dominated by a few manufacturers that, like big drug companies, shun direct competition in favor of building cozy relationships with the people who prescribe their products. In each case, Rosenthal diagnoses the incentives of the system by recalling the professional advice of Willie Sutton, who said he robbed banks because \u201cthat\u2019s where the money is.\u201d What outsiders might see as inefficiency or a conflict of interest, she shows, insiders have carefully constructed to maximize their bottom line. She also weaves in moving tales of those who are paying dearly for that enhanced bottom line \u2014 which, in the end, includes all of us.Where Rosenthal\u2019s account falls short is in explaining why this deeply broken system persists. Early on, Rosenthal seems to side with Speaker Ryan and Senator Paul, describing \u201cthe very idea of health insurance\u201d as \u201cin some ways the original sin that catalyzed the evolution of today\u2019s medical-industrial complex.\u201d But, as Rosenthal (too briefly) discusses, countries where people are much better insured don\u2019t have anything like our self-dealing, upside-down incentives and outrageous costs. Somehow, despite largely keeping citizens\u2019 skin out of the game, other rich democracies manage to have much lower costs per person \u2014 as well as greater utilization of physician and hospital services and better basic health measures.The fact is that people need insurance for the highest costs they face. They may be able to pay for Lasik, a nonessential, nonemergency procedure for which consumers have plenty of time to shop around. But the biggest-ticket items \u2014 cancer care, cardiac surgery, organ transplants \u2014 are beyond the reach of all but the richest, and not so easy to shop around for when they\u2019re needed. Just as we shouldn\u2019t blame the idea of mortgages for the financial crisis, we shouldn\u2019t blame the idea of health insurance for the health care crisis.The difference between the United States and other countries isn\u2019t the role of insurance; it\u2019s the role of government. More specifically, it\u2019s the way in which those who benefit from America\u2019s dysfunctional market have mobilized to use government to protect their earnings and profits. In every country where people have access to sophisticated medical care, they must rely heavily on the clinical expertise of providers and the financial protections of insurance, which, in turn, creates the opportunity for runaway costs. But in every other rich country, the government not only provides coverage to all citizens; it also provides strong counterpressure to those who seek to use their inherent market power to raise prices or deliver lucrative but unnecessary services \u2014 typically in the form of hard limits on how much health care providers can charge.In the United States, such counterpressure has been headed off again and again. The industry and its elected allies have happily supported giveaways to the medical sector. But anything more, they insist, will kill the market. Although this claim is in conflict with the evidence, it is consistent with the goal of maximum rewards to (and donations from) the industry. As a result, Medicare beneficiaries have prescription drug coverage (passed by Republicans in 2003), but Medicare administrators have no ability to do what every other rich country does: negotiate lower drug prices. In January, President Trump said drug companies were \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d because they had \u201ca lot of lobbyists and a lot of power,\u201d insisting he would get Medicare to bargain. Should we really be surprised that the dealmaker in chief dropped the subject after meeting with pharma executives earlier this year?Without a clear view of the political economy of health care, it\u2019s easy to see the problem as Justice Scalia did. If we could just start treating health care like broccoli, the market would solve the problem. But as Rosenthal\u2019s important book makes clear, the health care market really is different. Speaking of her Times series in 2014, Rosenthal told an interviewer her goal was to \u201cstart a very loud conversation\u201d that will be \u201cdifficult politically to ignore.\u201d We need such a conversation \u2014 not just about how the market fails, but about how we can change the political realities that stand in the way of fixing it.Jacob S. Hacker, a co-author of \u201cAmerican Amnesia: How the War on Government Led Us to Forget What Made America Prosper,\u201d is the Stanley B.

{"Headline": "Trump Reaches Beyond West Wing for Counsel", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Relationships have always been President Trump\u2019s currency and comfort, helping him talk his way into real estate deals over three decades in New York. Those who know him best say that his outer confidence has always belied an inner uncertainty, and that he needs to test ideas with a wide range of people.As Mr. Trump\u2019s White House advisers jostle for position, the president has turned to another group of advisers \u2014 from family, real estate, media, finance and politics, and all outside the White House gates \u2014 many of whom he consults at least once a week.The media mogul Rupert Murdoch is on the phone every week, encouraging Mr. Trump when he\u2019s low and arguing that he focus on the economy rather than detouring to other issues. The developer Richard LeFrak is a soothing voice who listens to Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints that cost estimates for the border wall with Mexico are too high. Sean Hannity tells the president that keeping promises on core Republican issues is crucial.Mr. Trump\u2019s West Wing aides, like President Bill Clinton\u2019s staff two decades before, say they sometimes cringe at the input from people they can\u2019t control, with consequences they can\u2019t predict. Knowing these advisers \u2014 who are mostly white, male and older \u2014 is a key to figuring out the words coming from Mr. Trump\u2019s mouth and his Twitter feed.Here, based on interviews with more than a dozen friends, top aides and advisers inside and outside the White House, are 20 of Mr. Trump\u2019s outside touchstones.Rupert MurdochMr. Trump\u2019s relationships depend on two crucial measures: personal success and loyalty to him. Mr. Murdoch excels in both categories. His New York Post vaulted Mr. Trump from local housing developer to gossip-page royalty, and his Fox News Channel was pro-Trump in the 2016 general election.Mr. Murdoch even called the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, to buck him up after Mr. Spicer was savaged for a remark about Adolf Hitler.Sean HannityPresidents always deploy surrogates to appear on television to spout their talking points, but Mr. Trump has expanded on that by developing relationships with sympathetic media figures like Mr. Hannity who also serve as advisers. Mr. Hannity, the Fox News host, defends Mr. Trump\u2019s most controversial behavior in public, but privately, according to people close to Mr. Trump, he urges the president not to get distracted, and advises him to focus on keeping pledges like repealing the Affordable Care Act.Chris RuddyThe chief executive of Newsmax Media is a longtime Mar-a-Lago member and was a Trump cheerleader among conservative media well before the website Breitbart joined the parade. He employs writers and editors who tracked Mr. Trump\u2019s career when they were at The New York Post. He recently visited the Oval Office, and he and Mr. Trump kibitz in Florida and by phone.Sheri A. DillonMs. Dillon seemed out of place when she spoke at a too-large lectern in the lobby of Trump Tower on Jan. 11, describing the steps Mr. Trump planned to take to separate himself from his business. But Ms. Dillon, a tax lawyer who worked out a highly criticized plan for Mr. Trump to retain ownership of his company but step back from running it, has repeatedly counseled the president about the business and made at least one White House visit. (Michael Cohen, a veteran Trump aide, has been serving as his personal lawyer.)Corey LewandowskiDespite his \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d slogan, the president dislikes dismissing people. Mr. Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s hot-tempered first campaign manager, was fired in June but never really went away. A New England-bred operative whose working-class roots and clenched-teeth loyalty earned him Mr. Trump\u2019s trust, he continued to be in frequent phone contact with Mr. Trump until the election and beyond. Friends of Mr. Lewandowski say that he can see the windows of the White House residence from his lobbying office on Pennsylvania Avenue, and that the view is even better during his visits to the West Wing, including when the New England Patriots were there this past week.Newt GingrichThe former House speaker talks more with Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers than he does with the president, but his presence permeates the administration. Mr. Gingrich\u2019s former spokesman is at the State Department, and two former advisers work in the West Wing. Mr. Gingrich has relentlessly promoted Mr. Trump\u2019s policy adviser, Stephen Miller, as the West Wing conservative ballast as the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, has been under fire.Richard LeFrakTheir fathers were developers together in New York, and the two men have been friends for decades. Mr. LeFrak is a Mar-a-Lago member, and he agreed to be part of an infrastructure effort that Mr. Trump hopes to put forward. Mr. Trump has turned to him to vent frustrations about the slow pace of bureaucracy.Thomas Barrack Jr.Mr. Trump divides the people around him into broad categories: family, paid staff and wealthy men like Mr. Barrack whom he considers peers. A sunny and loyal near-billionaire who has socialized with the president for years, Mr. Barrack is less a strategic adviser than a trusted moneyman, fixer and sounding board who has often punctuated emails to Mr. Trump with exhortations like \u201cYOU ROCK!\u201d He has urged Mr. Trump to avoid needless, distracting fights.Under Mr. Barrack\u2019s leadership, Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee raised a record $106.7 million, much of it from big corporations, banks and Republican megadonors like the Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson. Mr. Barrack also helped usher Paul Manafort, the international political operative now under scrutiny for his ties to Russia, into the Trump fold last year. The velvet-voiced Mr. Barrack does not seek out attention for himself, one of the most important and elusive qualities by which the president judges people.Stephen SchwarzmanThe chairman and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, Mr. Schwarzman is the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory council. He and the president don\u2019t speak daily, West Wing aides said, but do talk frequently. Mr. Schwarzman has counseled him on a number of topics, including advising him to leave in place President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order shielding young undocumented immigrants, known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d from deportation.Steve RothA good way to get on Mr. Trump\u2019s side is to do a deal with him, particularly if it means rescuing him from his own financial crisis. That\u2019s what Mr. Roth, a real estate tycoon, did a decade ago when he bought out Mr. Trump\u2019s share in a West Side real estate deal that went sour. Mr. Roth, head of Vornado Realty Trust and a longtime Democratic donor, also helped Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, when he injected $80 million into 666 Fifth Avenue, a Kushner family property in danger of defaulting on $1.1 billion in loans. Mr. Trump speaks with Mr. Roth frequently, and is leaning on him to help develop a trillion-dollar infrastructure package expected this year.Phil RuffinMr. Trump has 20-odd business partners, but none is closer to him than Mr. Ruffin, 82, a Texas billionaire who has lent his ear and private jet. The president was best man at the 2008 wedding of Mr. Ruffin to his third wife, a 26-year-old model and former Miss Ukraine. Mr. Ruffin has a knack for showing up when Mr. Trump needs him most and remains a die-hard defender. \u201cThis stuff about him having financial investments all over Russia \u2014 that\u2019s just pure crap,\u201d Mr. Ruffin told Forbes. \u201cI went to Russia with him. We took my airplane. We were having lunch with one of the oligarchs there. No business was discussed.\u201dCarl IcahnRounding out Mr. Trump\u2019s roster of wealthy octogenarians is this 81-year-old corporate raider and real estate mogul, who occupies perhaps the most respected perch in the president\u2019s circle of businessmen buddies. The affection is longstanding: The Queens-bred Mr. Icahn has known Mr. Trump and his family for decades. It\u2019s also numerical: Mr. Icahn is worth an estimated $16 billion, a major plus in the eyes of a president who keeps score. Mr. Icahn serves as a free-roving economic counselor and the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to reduce government regulations on business.Roger J. Stone Jr.Few alliances in politics are as complicated as the 40-year relationship between the Nixon-tattooed Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump. Mr. Stone won\u2019t say how frequently they speak these days, but he shares the president\u2019s tear-down-the-system impulses and is ubiquitous on cable news, radio and the website InfoWars defending Mr. Trump.Ike PerlmutterMr. Perlmutter, the chief executive of Marvel Comics, who is so reclusive that there are few public photographs of him, has been informally advising Mr. Trump on veterans issues. The two men are old friends, and Mr. Perlmutter has been a presence at Mar-a-Lago.Robert KraftThe owner of the New England Patriots is a Democrat, but his loyalty to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kraft once said, dates partly to the president\u2019s thoughtfulness when Mr. Kraft\u2019s wife died. Mr. Trump loved talking about the Patriots during the campaign, and Mr. Kraft has been a Mar-a-Lago presence since the transition.Melania Trump Mrs. Trump is uninterested in the limelight, but she has remained a powerful adviser by telephone from New York. Among her roles: giving Mr. Trump feedback on media coverage, counseling him on staff choices and urging him, repeatedly, to tone down his Twitter feed. Lately, he has listened closely, and has a more disciplined Twitter finger.Chris ChristieMr. Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and palace gatekeeper, has shown a capacity to hobble his rivals, but few have been finished off. The most durable has been Mr. Christie, whose transition planning, several West Wing aides now concede, should not have been discarded. He has been a frequent Oval Office visitor and has worked with the White House on the opioid addiction crisis.Paul D. RyanMr. Trump and the clean-cut and wonky Wisconsinite aren\u2019t exactly best friends forever. But their relationship is closer than in the bad old days of the 2016 campaign when Mr. Ryan delayed a hold-my-nose endorsement of Mr. Trump, whose morality he had long questioned. But as the president\u2019s agenda passes through the razor-blade gantlet of the House, where Mr. Ryan faces the constant threat of opposition and overthrow, the two men have become foxhole buddies.Donald Trump Jr. and Eric TrumpThe two sons and the president insist they no longer discuss company business. But the family is close, and Mr. Trump still speaks to his sons frequently, inquiring about their lives and searching for gut-checks on his own.An article on Sunday about people outside the White House whose advice is sought by President Trump referred incorrectly to one such informal adviser, Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots. Mr. Kraft\u2019s loyalty to the president dates partly to Mr. Trump\u2019s thoughtfulness when Mr. Kraft\u2019s wife died, not when his father died. The article also referred imprecisely to the legal credentials of Sheri A. Dillon. While she has advised President Trump on ethics issues, she specializes in tax law; she is not an \u201cethics lawyer.\u201dClockwise from top left; Kevin Hagen for The New York Times, Al Drago/The New York Times (2), Kevin Hagen for The New York Times, Emily Berl for The New York Times, Andy Kropa/Invision, via Associated Press, Marc Serota for The New York Times, John Minchillo/Associated Press, Al Drago/The New York Times, Michael Loccisano/Getty Images, Joshua Roberts/Reuters, Jemal Countess/Getty Images, J.

{"Headline": "In the Air, That Uneasy Feeling of Us vs. Them", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byUpdateHow the industry reached the unfriendly skies is a journey that goes back to 9/11, which ushered in greater security regulations and carry-on restrictions. In the aftermath of 9/11, \u201cnot following crew instructions immediately could be seen as a threat, and they take all threats seriously,\u201d Mr. Leff said. \u201cAirline employees are in positions of extreme power and authority.\u201d Noting that not all crews are authoritarian, he added, \u201cthe emphasis has shifted.\u201dAdding to the challenges were the global recession and the fuel price spikes of 2008, when the number of fliers dropped and the cost to fly them soared.Before the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, the government controlled airfares and routes, and airlines vied to differentiate themselves with meals and legroom. They hung on to these conventions, for the most part, until around 2008, when that reinvention introduced the idea of unbundling services like checked bags and meals, making them pay-per-use options.Airlines also cut capacity, flying fewer planes with more people aboard. When the economy rebounded, most carriers stuck with the practice or put more seats on bigger planes.But even a good deal can contribute to frustration in the air when a ticket on one carrier offers more or fewer services than another, making it hard to compare fares. Southwest fares, for example, include checked bags; Delta Air Lines charges most passengers to check a bag; and Spirit Airlines charges for checked and carry-on baggage.\u201cIt\u2019s not just between airlines but within the carrier, where different classes like economy or premium economy mean different things,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said.Still, a ticket guarantees a flight, right? Yes, but as the United case illustrates, not necessarily the one a passenger has booked.\u201cWhen you buy a ticket, you subscribe to a contract of carriage that says basically that they can remove you at any time for many reasons, from the government requesting the space to you not smelling good,\u201d said Mr. Kidd, of the airline passengers\u2019 association.The carrier is obligated to transport the passenger by rebooking the flier on a future flight. At that point, the airline must compensate the passenger based on the destination and length of delay.Normally these sorts of boarding decisions are made in the gate area and rarely occur on the flight. In the United case, forcibly bumping a passenger contributed to tension not just on that plane but across the industry.\u201cIt\u2019s important to follow the directions of flight crew members, but when they don\u2019t seem to make a lot of sense, it hurts aviation security as a whole,\u201d said Jeffrey C. Price, professor of aviation management at Metropolitan State University of Denver.\u201cThere is a lot of research in organizational settings that suggests perceptions of unfairness lead to anger, hostility and spiteful behavior,\u201d wrote Elizabeth Popp Berman, an associate professor of sociology at the University at Albany, in an email. \u201cWhen an airline\u2019s decision to remove passengers is seen as unfair because it does not conform to expectations about passengers\u2019 rights or the airline\u2019s obligations, it is not surprising that passengers will become less compliant.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank Lending Stalls on Doubts About Trump\u2019s Pro-Growth Agenda", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byMany business owners and corporate executives have expressed unbridled optimism that President Trump can fuel economic growth and increase their profits.Their borrowing habits, however, may tell a different story.Some of the nation\u2019s top bankers said on Thursday that businesses were feeling less certain that Mr. Trump can pull off his ambitious agenda to deregulate and cut taxes.\u201cThey all want to believe that there is more growth ahead, but they need to see something out there before they act,\u201d John Shrewsberry, the chief financial officer of Wells Fargo, said in an interview.Wells Fargo, a leading lender to American consumers and businesses, said its outstanding loans in the first quarter had increased just 1 percent from a year earlier.Citigroup, which has a large global presence operating in dozens of countries, said its lending growth wasn\u2019t that much larger, with overall loans rising 2 percent.Earnings reports on Thursday from three of the nation\u2019s biggest banks \u2014 Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase \u2014 offered the latest indications that corporate America and Wall Street were giving a more sober assessment to the feasibility of the growth-focused Trump agenda.The results followed recent signs that lending has been slowing, and in some cases declining more broadly in the banking industry. Data from the Federal Reserve showed that lending in February was flat, while lending to manufacturers and energy companies was in decline, after many months of growth.\u201cIf this continues, it is definitely concerning,\u201d said Leo Mourelatos, a United States country risk analyst with BMI Research. \u201cIt would signal that the U.S. economy is much weaker than the current consensus.\u201dYet the banking data may be sending out some mixed signals.Some economists said the lending decline reflected in the Federal Reserve data \u2014 particularly commercial and industrial loans \u2014 was driven not by any broad weakness or lack of confidence but by a decrease in energy lending because of low oil prices.Another factor was the paring of business inventories. Businesses typically borrow from banks to purchase inventories of goods and parts. With smaller inventories, businesses need fewer loans.Bank loans are also not the only way that companies can borrow. Large corporations in particular have also been able to tap the bond market for financing, which may also be taking a share from bank lending.Executives at the nation\u2019s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, played down concerns about slowing loan growth, noting that its loans had risen 6 percent from a year ago.\u201cU.S. consumers and businesses are healthy over all and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve,\u201d said the bank\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon.On a conference call with analysts on Thursday, Mr. Dimon said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t overreact to the short-term thing about loan growth.\u201dHe added that it took time for a new administration to push through an agenda and counseled patience. \u201cTo expect it to be to be smooth sailing would just be silly,\u201d Mr. Dimon said.It was just such optimistic expectations that helped drive a powerful rally in the stock market after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Recently, stock prices have been weaker as investors have grown a bit more pessimistic. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index fell 0.68 percent on Thursday, led by energy and financial shares. For the holiday-shortened week, the index closed down 1.1. percent.Mr. Shrewsberry of Wells Fargo noted that the optimism about a pro-growth agenda had buoyed the spirits of business community after the election and into February.But after the health care overhaul failed, he noted a change. \u201cThere is more waiting and seeing going on,\u201d he said.Citigroup\u2019s chief financial officer, John Gerspach, also said businesses might be looking for more certainty from Washington before ramping up their borrowing.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen concrete changes yet in policies,\u201d Mr. Gerspach said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday.The banks themselves are also waiting to see whether President Trump delivers on his promise to roll back the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a financial regulatory overhaul passed in the wake of the financial crisis that has required banks to hold increasingly more capital and restrict certain types of trading.At the same time, the Trump administration has thrown the banking industry a curveball by raising the possibility of restoring a version of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which required banks to separate their commercial and investment banking activities. The idea also has the support of liberals like Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and one of Wall Street\u2019s toughest critics.The Glass-Steagall law was repealed in 1999, paving the way for the creation of sprawling mega-banks like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.Big banks have argued that the current model \u2014 in which banks fund their investment banking activity with customers\u2019 deposits \u2014 has helped provide credit to companies and consumers across the world. It is at the core of the large bank\u2019s profits, giving them a big advantage over smaller competitors.Efforts to bring back Glass-Steagall \u2014 which would effectively break up the big banks \u2014 has left the industry slightly perplexed.\u201cI would have to wonder how that would be consistent with deregulation or boosting growth, which is the goal of this administration,\u201d Mr. Gerspach, the Citigroup chief financial officer, said on Thursday.Kate Kelly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Gina Gershon had on a black goat-hair bolero and made a beeline for Brooke Shields. Real Housewives hovered, students sketched live falcons, and an accordionist in a top hat serenaded the guests.A little more than a decade ago, this 100-student, two-year graduate program founded in part by Andy Warhol in 1982 seemed as timeworn as the creaky five-floor loft building on Franklin Street in which it has its headquarters.Donna Karan cupped his face in her hands. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute; how could you not love him?\u201d she said, as Mr. Kratz\u2019s husband, Greg Unis, smiled brightly. \u201cWe see each other every weekend, because he rides horses in the Hamptons. So I\u2019m used to seeing him at the stable. In full gear.\u201dStill, a fundamental question remained: How did a former public relations executive known primarily for working with blue-chip financial companies become such a well-connected art-world player? And if Mr. Kratz, the academy\u2019s president since 2009, has given the place a \u201cnew currency,\u201d as Mr. Fischl asserted, may something bigger be in store for him and the board chairwoman, Ms. Guggenheim?Running a successful arts nonprofit is difficult, even in a boom economy.Public arts funding has been declining. Faculty members and administrators are averse to change. Celebrities rarely give serious money, but benefits get little media coverage without them.For these reasons, it helps to have a guy at the top of a 501(c)(3) who both knows business and has the chutzpah to march up to an Oscar-winning actress at the dog run to ask if she\u2019ll come to a benefit. Which is exactly what Mr. Kratz did with Jennifer Connelly in Brooklyn in 2010, after which she became a fixture at his events.The son of a retail executive, Mr. Kratz grew up on Long Island, attended Dartmouth, received a law degree from Boston University, and did a brief stint at the Wall Street law firm Gould & Wilkie before realizing \u201cthis isn\u2019t for me.\u201dAt the time, Ms. Gabor was leaving marriage No. 7. \u201cShe said: \u2018My last husband was my divorce lawyer. Now we\u2019re getting divorced. What will I do?\u2019\u201d Mr. Kratz said in a pre-party interview.In 1983, Mr. Kratz founded his own firm, Kratz & Company; big-name clients included Starbucks, Mercedes and IBM. In the mid-1990s, he represented Stoli Vodka at an event at the academy. There he met Ms. Guggenheim, then a board member. The two became pals, and she recruited him to the board, where he served for a year.In 2000, Mr. Kratz sold his company to Havas in a deal estimated to be worth around $10 million. In 2004, he quit his job.With time on his hands and the luxury of not having to worry about the immediate future, he enrolled at the art academy as a student. \u201cI loved it from the minute I walked in,\u201d he said.As she saw it, Mr. Kratz knew the place from every angle. Also, she added, \u201cHe\u2019s highly creative, yet he\u2019s fully comfortable with the business end of the job.\u201dWhether there were a ton of prominent philanthropists eager to take over an institution with a $3 million annual budget, Mr. Kratz proved himself, partly by being smart enough to know what he didn\u2019t know.Given the academy\u2019s loosey-goosey-where-did-the-money-go history, Mr. Colacello was wary at first. But he came away from lunch with Mr. Kratz impressed.Recently, some have begun to wonder if the ambitious president will soon become restless. Mr. Kratz is not, according to Mr. Fischl \u201cthe best paid person\u201d in nonprofits. And a slew of arts organizations are currently in flux. But Mr. Kratz said he\u2019s not really looking for a museum gig.\u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m very happy,\u201d he added. \u201cIf something amazing came up, of course I\u2019d consider it, but it\u2019s hard to imagine something more tailored to what I love doing than this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facing Tough Odds in French Vote, Le Pen Assails Macron", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byNICE, France \u2014 France\u2019s far-right presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, came out swinging against her centrist opponent, Emmanuel Macron, on Thursday night, depicting him as an unpatriotic out-of-touch banker in a tough, slashing speech intended to fuel her uphill bid for an upset in the May 7 runoff.The showdown is a clash of opposites, a contest between her superheated anti-immigrant, xenophobic language and his cool and lofty formulas for restoring France\u2019s economy while upholding its global alliances. On Thursday, to an adoring crowd of thousands in Nice, Ms. Le Pen made the most of that contrast in her first speech since finishing second in the first round of voting on Sunday.Mr. Macron, a former economy minister and banker, was a \u201cglobalist,\u201d an \u201cimmigrationist\u201d and someone who is capable of cutting himself off from the country, Ms. Le Pen roared to flag-waving supporters at a vast auditorium at the edge of town. The boos for Mr. Macron lasted for minutes.Still, the odds are sharply against her. Polls show Ms. Le Pen trailing by more than 20 percent. But in the last few days, she has gained some momentum while Mr. Macron has stumbled since the first round.Mr. Macron has dropped slightly in some polls, and commentators have suggested that his campaign is stagnating.Ms. Le Pen came bounding onto the stage at the Palais Nikaia on Thursday night, evidently buoyed by the media attention of the last few days. She immediately lashed out at her younger and more inexperienced opponent, questioning his patriotism, and in one of the far right\u2019s oldest tropes, suggesting that his policies meant that he was not French enough.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to call himself a patriot,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said.\u201cIt\u2019s like the pyromaniac who wants to be called a fireman,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is a referendum for or against France. I ask you to choose France. His horizon is the devalorization of France.\u201d\u201cI think he could be a good banker,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the insensitivity of that profession, with no conscience for the human consequences of his decisions.\u201dAfter Mr. Macron was shown on Wednesday in television images sitting stiffly in a room with union officials while Ms. Le Pen was taking selfies with factory workers nearby, the former economy minister tried to show a more human side on Thursday, kicking a soccer ball around in an immigrant Paris suburb where \u201cMrs. Le Pen can\u2019t come,\u201d he said, because \u201cshe wants them all to get out.\u201dBut in a possibly ominous sign for Mr. Macron, thousands of people demonstrated against both candidates in several cities across France, shouting for the so-called neither-nor option. A low turnout in the second round would help Ms. Le Pen, and she appears to be acutely aware of that.

It\u2019s a place where the law of the strongest rules.\u201dAnd in Nice, a city still reeling from a terrorist attack in July that killed dozens, she painted a picture of an Islamist menace, vowing to confront \u201cprovocations from the Islamists in the cafeterias, in the hospitals, in the streets.\u201d As is often the case in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s speeches, this was linked to what she calls \u201cthe migratory submersion,\u201d identified with her opponent.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s aides said before Thursday\u2019s rally that they were convinced that she was gaining momentum, for the moment.

{"Headline": "California\u2019s Marrakesh: A Country Club That\u2019s Chic Again", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byPALM DESERT, Calif. \u2014 It was Jingle Mingle Night at the Marrakesh Country Club. Inside its serpentine pink walls, past the entry gazebo\u2019s cone roof, up the drive flanked by petunia beds and olive trees clipped like standard poodles, a line of cars disgorged guests swathed in Santa suits and stocking caps and sweaters with blinking LED lights.Sawing into a slab of prime rib, Stephen Drucker, the former editor of several lifestyle publications, announced that he had just spruced up the portico of his Marrakesh villa with a pair of white canvas drapes \u2014 an Old Hollywood touch, he said, that reminded him of \u201cthose birthday parties where \u2018Uncle\u2019 Gary Cooper would take little Christina Crawford for a pony ride.\u201d\u201cExactly the kind of thing I\u2019m excited the committee is making provisions for,\u201d said Steven Price, an architecture historian who wears his silver hair in a bob, referring to the club\u2019s Architecture and Landscape Committee.Patrick Dragonette, a modern furniture dealer from Los Angeles, concurred. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the house with the pushed-out columns,\u201d he said, his undertone the verbal equivalent of a raised eyebrow. \u201cNobody is happy about it.\u201d\u201cThe desert used to be driven by golf,\u201d Mr. Drucker said. \u201cNow the big engine of the economy in the desert, certainly Palm Springs, is style. You can\u2019t buy architecture of this quality, at this price, in Palm Springs.\u201dIn 1967, when Mr. Bono was still married to Cher, an amateur golfer and golf course architect named Johnny Dawson (he also developed Thunderbird Country Club in Rancho Mirage and Eldorado Country Club in Indian Wells) leased 155 acres in Palm Desert and, inspired by the property\u2019s similarities to the Atlas Mountains-ringed city of Marrakesh, conceived of a new club with a Moroccan theme. The community\u2019s salmon-pink palette was suggested by the rosy sandstone walls, and its hilltop clubhouse, introduced by a Middle Eastern-style water stair, was placed to overlook the villas like a casbah surveying so many riads.After that, the Moroccan trope kind of trails off. That is because John Woolf, hired to design the club in 1968, had a vernacular all his own. Mr. Woolf had come to Los Angeles from Atlanta to become an actor \u2014 he hoped his Southern roots would help land him a role in \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d But he had also studied architecture at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and when the acting career fizzled, he leveraged his Hollywood ties to become an architect to the stars.In the Los Angeles real-estate market, Woolf houses are considered trophies. Recent owners of the designer\u2019s homes include the producer John Goldwyn and his husband, the hotelier Jeff Klein; the designer Nate Berkus and the night life impresario Sean MacPherson. Last fall, Jill Tavelman Collins (the former wife of Phil Collins, mother of Lilly) bought a Woolf house in Beverly Hills for $12.5 million, 40 percent over the asking price.The one-, two- and three-bedroom duplex villas at Marrakesh, while more modest in both scale and price \u2014 units can still be had for under $400,000 \u2014 do not stint on Woolfian drama. They all have deep courtyards, tiered mansard roofs and tall, skinny front doors that make anyone passing through them feel like Loretta Young (who had a Woolf house). Inside there are 10-foot ceilings, closets the size of bedrooms and airy atriums off the master baths.\u201cThe kitchens were clearly designed for some sort of staff person to slip in every day through a side door,\u201d Mr. Drucker said. \u201cPrepare the chicken salad, read a magazine on a little stepladder and then come serve the ladies in the corner of the living room designed for bridge parties.\u201d Originally marketed to the local gentry (specifically members of the Los Angeles Country Club) as well as snowbirds from Canada and Chicago, Marrakesh memberships offered a slice of the good life early-1970s-style. Picture a Cadillac or a Lincoln, a station wagon and a golf cart in every oversize garage.The promise of that era is enshrined at a bougainvillea-draped condo between the eighth green and the ninth tee. The unit, which Ann Judy, a Santa Ynez Valley resident, inherited from her parents, has remained virtually untouched since it was first decorated over four decades ago. Its original color scheme of white and lime green extends from a white shag rug and floral print drapes to white and green dishes to a Zenith television encased in white lacquer trimmed with the drapery fabric. You can almost hear Karen Carpenter singing \u201cClose to You.\u201d\u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, why fix it?\u201d Ms. Judy said. \u201cIt\u2019s light, it\u2019s bright, it\u2019s fun. And unique.\u201dOne could argue that, despite the consistency of their exteriors, every residence at Marrakesh is unique. \u201cWoolf designed these clean Hollywood Regency shells that gave every owner the ability to adapt them,\u201d Mr. Dragonette said.In his home, Mr. Drucker channeled \u201cRobsjohn-Gibbings in Athens,\u201d he said, referring to the historicist designer\u2019s apartment overlooking the Acropolis. His soft voice echoed off his bare white terrazzo floors and largely unadorned pale walls (Benjamin Moore \u201cSimply White\u201d) as he identified pieces in his living room: a Billy Baldwin sofa and slipper chairs, a circa 1960 Klismos outdoor dining set, a pair of urn-topped white columns flanking the front door like something out of the Elizabeth Arden salon. All in the spirit, he noted, of \u201cthat early \u201960s Lincoln Center-\u2018Valley of the Dolls\u2019 Neo-Classicism.\u201dHis friend Ms. Selke, who recently completed a redo of her place next door, said: \u201cSteven\u2019s is this white gleaming palace. I\u2019m going for a really sassy riad look.\u201d Taking her cue from Shangri La, the tobacco heiress Doris Duke\u2019s Moroccan-themed outpost in Hawaii, she draped her living area with a paisley fabric in Yves Klein blue, wrapped the fireplace in mirror and hung massive Moroccan lanterns. The project inspired her latest furnishings line, the \u201cPalm Springs Collection.\u201dRod Youngson, an architect who knew the Woolf Pack (as well as Loretta Young and her daughter) and his partner, Bill Ruegge, a real estate agent and building contractor (and perhaps most usefully, as far as their business is concerned, a golf pro), have redone eight houses in Marrakesh between them. \u201cThey\u2019re just built so much better than anything else on the market,\u201d said Mr. Youngson, who likes to \u201cfreshen\u201d the condominiums by removing interior walls and putting in floor-to-ceiling doors.\u201cWe\u2019re getting a different kind of clientele since we\u2019ve gone \u2018fee land,\u2019\u201d he added. Until recently the club leased the property it sits on from a private owner, but in fall 2015, it bought the land. Since then, property values have surged \u2014 as have the ambitions of local remodelers. Marrakesh residents have lately been erecting high hedges against their neighbors, installing swimming pools in their courtyards and turning their atriums into outdoor showers. \u201cEveryone wants to be Walter Annenberg in Bungalow Five,\u201d said Mr. Price, brandishing his fan.Mr. Dragonette regularly takes his golf cart out to survey the changes. Usually he conducts his reconnaissance under the cover of night, but he was persuaded to take a visitor for a tour on a recent balmy afternoon. (Notwithstanding the names of its streets \u2014 Kasbah Drive, Minzah Way \u2014 Marrakesh can sometimes evoke Morocco less than the Caribbean, with its pastel buildings, mint-green fairways and swaying palms). He braked his Western 100 in front of a villa with a half-demolished back patio. \u201cThis guy is getting that all terraced out for himself,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen is he\u2019ll be assessed. As a committee member, you can\u2019t say someone can\u2019t have something just because it\u2019s ugly.\u201dBut such tensions are the exception in this pink Brigadoon. It\u2019s hard to walk or drive down Kasbah Drive or Minzah Way without being waved at, repeatedly. \u201cThe common pull of the design makes everybody mix well,\u201d said Daniel Nelms, a single father of two young boys who moved to Marrakesh from Los Angeles a year and a half ago. \u201cOne of my sons spent all spring in the pool playing Barbies with our 70-year-old neighbor. I wish I\u2019d had that growing up.\u201dMr. Price put it this way: \u201cMarrakesh self-selects. How seriously can you take yourself when you live in a pink house?\u201d As he spoke, his partner, Jeffrey Roberts, motioned from the couple\u2019s terrace overlooking the golf course: \u201cThe color\u2019s getting really good now!\u201d he shouted. Outside the winter sun was sinking toward the stately San Jacintos, casting a rich glow across the valley below. The effect, much like the play of light in the fabled Moroccan city, was dazzling.Or as Ann Judy\u2019s father used to say, \u201cWelcome to another damn day in paradise.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Well, most of us don\u2019t encounter the government on a daily basis. We do, however, live life as consumers. And our treatment is both increasingly disrespectful and reflective of our society\u2019s growing income divide.In 2017, it often seems that the customer is the least important part of the transaction \u2014 unless he or she is paying top, top dollar. Take medical care. While the wealthy can turn to the growing practice of concierge medicine, where for a fee of over a thousand dollars annually, their personal doctor will always return their calls promptly, the rest of us are ever more likely to be relegated to a narrow insurance network.Don\u2019t mistake me. There are a lot of other things you can take away from this sorry event. There is the increased militarization of American life, with authorities reacting to common disputes in increasingly aggressive ways. There is a positive lesson, too, in that ordinary Americans have access to more potential publicity \u2014 and, hopefully, recourse \u2014 than ever before, courtesy of social media. Finally, there is a narrative of privilege at play. More than a few pointed out this contretemps would likely not have received as much attention if the unwilling passenger were poor or African-American. Others noted that the doctor, who is Asian-American, might have been treated differently by officers or airline staff if he were white.But this isn\u2019t an either-or situation. Yes, we can tell people who perceive themselves as privileged to get used to the second-class treatment those poorer than them have been receiving for a long time. But it seems like a better bet, both ethically and for the sake of our futures, to improve conditions for all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Women Who Still Like Trump", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisNot one expressed concern that his administration might hurt women\u2019s rights \u2014 most dismissed objections of those on the left about how few women he had appointed to his cabinet; the potential defunding of Planned Parenthood, which several mistakenly believed received federal funding for abortions; and even the viral photos showing roomfuls of men proposing to remove maternity care and mammogram screenings from required health insurance benefits.They are willing to give President Trump time to deliver results, and uniformly blame Congress and out-of-line judges for blocking him on health care, immigration and other initiatives. Some are critical of his travel ban, his tweets and his impulsivity, and some worry about entanglements in foreign wars, but their biggest plea is that he remember they elected him to be an unconventional politician.Here are excerpts, condensed and edited, from their comments.I think it\u2019s going great. He\u2019s done exactly what he said he\u2019s going to do. I think that\u2019s amazing. I think we actually have a president who has balls. I feel like America\u2019s safer with him as president. I feel that he actually cares about America and will do what he says.I think our economy is making a turnaround. People are more confident because of him being president. The stock market\u2019s going up as well.I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s out for popular opinion. I think that he\u2019s going to do what he thinks is best. He doesn\u2019t care what you think. I\u2019m kind of that way, too, so I can respect that.Right away he was meeting with the Big Three; I remember feeling like my heart warmed. Somebody cares about us. Then I see him getting on the helicopter with his grandkids and that\u2019s very endearing.I\u2019m happy with the H-1B visa reform. A friend got laid off, he was watching all his co-workers get laid off sequentially; they\u2019re being replaced by H-1B visa people.We got to be able to get birth control if we don\u2019t have money. That was my love of Obama, my birth control was free. We need to care about 50 percent of the population and what they\u2019re going to do. Especially the group of women that don\u2019t have the means to pay for it. Jesus, say you\u2019re working at Walmart and then you have a baby, what are you going to do? You\u2019ve got to have the care.On his tweeting, it\u2019s almost like the sell talk \u2014 we\u2019re going to win. Trying to rally the troops. I think that\u2019s why he acts the way he does, the phrases he repeats, that\u2019s how he managed his companies. It makes sense, it\u2019s more of a corporate thing to do.Feminism feels very exclusive \u2014 if you don\u2019t vote the same or feel the same on these platform issues like pro-choice, you can\u2019t be part of their club. We have to give women voice and weave them into politics. We can have equality with men, and it doesn\u2019t have to be equal balance. I\u2019m all for women getting ahead in politics or business. I\u2019m not a self-hating woman.Now that I\u2019ve become a Republican, I\u2019ve heard a lot of outrageously racist things, from both sides, and I\u2019m not happy about that. I am very disappointed that there is so much of a divide. He\u2019s focusing a lot on crimes and gangs, law and order, but that\u2019s not the only facet when it comes to minorities in this country, specifically African-Americans. I\u2019m worried about mass incarceration rates and so on. A huge reason I didn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton: incarceration of minorities went up under Bill Clinton.I like how he\u2019s handling Syria, North Korea and China. I agree with the peace-through-strength idea. The gassing of innocent women and children is very disturbing to me.Especially after seeing what is going on in Syria, to turn them away, especially the women and the children, we\u2019ve got to figure out something. This area has a lot of Syrian refugees. I met a little girl. She was just a sweet beautiful child, you could tell by her face, she did not have it good where she came from. She just kept hugging me and grabbing on to me.I\u2019m not delusional to think that terrorist groups won\u2019t send in people with these large groups of refugees here. You have to figure out a good way to fix this and keep America safe as well. Why wasn\u2019t Saudi Arabia on that list? I know why they weren\u2019t. We all know why. There are countries that we don\u2019t want to upset or make angry because we think we need them. I was not a fan of the executive order, the way it was done.Well, I\u2019ve been pretty pleased. Kind of disappointed that we haven\u2019t really come together as a country yet.If they\u2019re sitting here spying on us in our homes, then why wouldn\u2019t they spy on a major candidate? They were spying on Hillary, why wouldn\u2019t they spy on him? I\u2019m saying it wouldn\u2019t shock me. Not one bit.I think, unfortunately, somebody needs to take away the Twitter. I like that he\u2019s able to talk to us, but for the love of God, somebody take away the phone. He would be a lot more effective that way. I don\u2019t have a filter, but I\u2019m not the president of the freaking United States.I would like to see, as far as talking about Ivanka\u2019s business, cut that out. Talking about \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d that kind of stuff, you\u2019re done with that, at least for the next four years. Stop. You got much bigger fish to fry. It doesn\u2019t help your case any at all. Of course, he\u2019s new to being president and he\u2019s new to politics. That just comes with learning a job, any job.He\u2019s allowing the states to do what they want on Planned Parenthood, not defunding it on a federal level. I would like Planned Parenthood to be funded, and I\u2019m sure in some states it won\u2019t be because of that. Being a Republican candidate, I don\u2019t see he has much choice on that.It\u2019s at least nice to see law enforcement given props during speeches and being supported \u2014 that\u2019s a nice change.I\u2019m disappointed in the fact that he\u2019s getting so much pushback on everything he tries to pass. He\u2019s good at wheeling and dealing and offering things, if that\u2019s what it takes. I\u2019d like to see him reach out to Democrats, and I\u2019d like to see them listening. There\u2019s got to be compromise on both sides. We don\u2019t have to like each other, but we have to work together. I\u2019d want to see something happen and quick with the A.C.A. \u2014 it\u2019s not going well. When that falters, people will be without insurance and without health care. I\u2019m concerned about that.What is Congress doing? They have failed on the health care bill. And they couldn\u2019t get one voted on when they had a majority. It\u2019s a little disgusting.Why people like me love Trump so much \u2014 he doesn\u2019t stand for it. We put someone in who\u2019s not necessarily so Republican, it was more that he was for common-sense government.I agree with what he did with the travel ban. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a Muslim ban. He\u2019s fulfilling his promise to protect the border and build a wall. Hopefully he\u2019s learned who to count on, who not to count on in the last 100 days.I love his tweets. He\u2019s holding the media\u2019s feet to the fire. He has a way to get his point of view out. I think Trump sometimes exaggerates things, but I don\u2019t think he outright lies. Most rational people know what he means.He wanted to prove he was different than Obama with one big mother bomb. But don\u2019t get us dragged into these wars. I hope he stays an American president, not trying to become a world president, just because McCain and neocons would praise him. I hope he\u2019s strong enough and stays thick-skinned enough. I imagine it\u2019s very difficult for him to stick true to what he promises. He doesn\u2019t always hear from us, the people.I really do want him to spend more time in the White House and not to go to Florida so much. The people that put him in office need him to be there, and not travel so much to where he\u2019s probably more comfortable. You\u2019ve got to suck it up. If that\u2019s my worst criticism, that\u2019s not so bad.I\u2019d give him an A-, B+, Congress a failing grade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brooklyn Moves to Protect Immigrants From Deportation Over Petty Crimes", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byThe Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office, promising to seek \u201cequal and fair justice\u201d for the borough\u2019s vulnerable foreign-born residents, has created a policy that tailors prosecutions to avoid, when possible, the deportation or detention of immigrants charged with certain misdemeanors or nonviolent crimes.The policy, which was to be announced officially on Monday, calls for hundreds of Brooklyn prosecutors to notify defense lawyers about the potential immigration consequences of their clients\u2019 cases and to try, without compromising public safety, to prosecute foreign-born defendants to achieve what the district attorney\u2019s office describes as an \u201cimmigration-neutral disposition.\u201d\u201cNaturalized citizens, lawful residents and undocumented immigrants, they are all integral to our local economy and vibrant culture,\u201d the policy says. \u201cThis office is unflaggingly committed to equal and fair justice for all the people of Brooklyn, and that unquestionably includes our immigrant population no less than any other.\u201dThe Justice Department has threatened to cut off federal aid to police departments in so-called sanctuary cities, which limit cooperation with federal immigration agents. On Friday, the Justice Department issued a scathing memo saying that New York City, one of those jurisdictions, \u201ccontinues to see gang murder after gang murder\u201d because of its \u201csoft on crime\u201d stance.The Justice Department\u2019s directive was met with outrage on Friday by Mayor Bill de Blasio and James P. O\u2019Neill, the police commissioner. Mr. O\u2019Neill said that it showed \u201ca willful disregard for the facts\u201d and that his \u201cblood began to boil\u201d when he saw it.The policy being adopted in Brooklyn seeks to mitigate the effects of criminal prosecutions of immigrants by ordering prosecutors there to do what they can to secure guilty pleas without invoking federal laws that could lead to detention or deportation, or could cause trouble for those hoping to obtain full citizenship.The office plans to hire two immigration lawyers in the coming weeks to train prosecutors in the relevant laws and to serve as consultants on individual cases.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to destroy communities or tear people away from their families for low-level offenses,\u201d said Eric Gonzalez, the acting Brooklyn district attorney. \u201cIf someone confronts a guilty plea that would automatically subject them to a harsh immigration penalty and there\u2019s another possible plea that would hold them accountable and ensure public safety, justice demands they be given the one that doesn\u2019t have immigration consequences.\u201dMr. Gonzalez added that his office was \u201cnot seeking to frustrate the federal government\u2019s function of protecting our country,\u201d but rather trying to \u201cenhance public safety and fairness in the criminal justice system.\u201d In a statement issued to formally announce the policy, he said, \u201cWe will not stop prosecuting crimes, but we are determined to see that case outcomes are proportionate to the offense as well as fair and just for everyone.\u201dBecause immigration matters are governed by their own legal code, immigrants can face far more serious consequences than citizens when being prosecuted for relatively minor crimes like petty theft or possession of a small amount of drugs. Those two offenses, for instance, are considered misdemeanors under New York State law but can be cause for deportation under federal immigration law. Even for legal immigrants, the charges can lead to problems in obtaining full citizenship rights.As an example of how the new policy would work, prosecutors cited the case of a Haitian man who arrived in Brooklyn in 1977 and obtained a green card in 1984. In 2000, prosecutors said, the man, whose name was not released to protect his identity, was arrested on trespassing charges. When the police searched him, they found a small amount of crack cocaine.The man eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge and did not serve time in prison. He stayed out of trouble for years, prosecutors said, caring for his mother and working as a parking garage attendant and a telemarketer.But in 2010, after a devastating earthquake struck Haiti, he returned there for a visit. Because of his drug conviction, he was not allowed back into the United States. Prosecutors said that if he had been allowed to plead guilty to the trespassing charge, rather than the drug charge, he probably would have been able to return to New York without trouble.The policy is one of the few, and perhaps the most robust, of its kind in the country issued by a district attorney, said Camille Mackler, the director of legal initiatives for the New York Immigration Coalition, which worked with Mr. Gonzalez to craft it.\u201cHaving law-enforcement officials understand how complex immigration issues are and how the consequences of them can often be devastating is critical,\u201d Ms. Mackler said in an interview on Friday. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t normally think of a district attorney as a partner in something like this, but he is stepping up at a moment when immigrants in New York are facing great concerns for their safety.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Market Stocks Have Come Roaring Back. Can They Go Any Higher?", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byFundamentallyPropelled by a rebound in commodity prices, emerging market stocks have roared back over the last year. But if the sector is to continue to prosper, many fund managers say, it will need to be fueled by other factors.Weak commodity prices, which contributed to emerging market mutual and exchange-traded fund losses in 2013, 2014 and 2015, helped these funds post double-digit gains in the first quarter of this year. The funds are now up almost 17 percent in the 12 months through March.\u201cWhat has been driving emerging market returns in the last year was the recovery in commodity prices, which led to a number of commodity producers\u2019 doing well,\u201d said Arjun Divecha, head of the emerging markets equity team at the asset management firm GMO.This explains why funds focused on oil-dependent markets have risen more than emerging market equities as a whole: iShares MSCI Russia Capped E.T.F., for instance, is up more than 28 percent over the 12 months through March, while iShares MSCI Brazil Capped E.T.F. is up nearly 39 percent as oil prices have climbed 37 percent.But commodity bets are notoriously volatile and will take you only so far with emerging market stocks, several fund managers say. Several other strategies may make more sense for the longer term.For example, Michael Kass, manager of the Baron Emerging Markets Fund, favors what he calls EM 2.0 \u2014 companies led by \u201cvalue creators\u201d working in cutting-edge areas like software development, machine learning, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and other health sciences. \u201cThe biggest profits will be found in high-profit-margin companies trying to gain market share in all those areas,\u201d he said.One such company is China\u2019s Alibaba Group, which like Amazon.com is branching out beyond online retail into areas like cloud computing, machine learning and robotic delivery mechanisms like drones and driverless cars. Alibaba is the top holding in the Baron Emerging Markets Fund.An added benefit of owning these types of high-quality growth stocks, Mr. Kass said, is that they are likely to hold up better than their peers if emerging markets take another spill \u2014 one set off, perhaps, by rising interest rates in China and the United States.Innovation is not the only factor that may determine the success of investments in the developing world. \u201cOne focus now is on structural reform stories,\u201d said Ben Kirby, co-manager of the Thornburg Developing World Fund. He points out that many countries have been trying to restructure their economies for more sustainable growth.China has embarked on \u201csupply-side reforms\u201d to tackle overcapacity in several crucial industries, including steel and coal. \u201cThey\u2019re shutting down idle capacity and high-cost producers,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. In fact, he said, this may be one reason commodity prices have started to lift as Chinese supply is being restricted.India has also embarked on an economic reform effort. It just passed a national goods and services tax, which will replace and untangle a web of local- and state-levied fees. The hope is that the tax shift will promote business activity across the vast country\u2019s different regions, while raising tax revenues.What type of company would benefit from that? \u201cOne stock we\u2019ve added to lately is ICICI Bank,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. ICICI is not the most dominant bank in India \u2014 that would be the Mumbai-based HDFC Bank, he said, which is a leading provider of mortgage loans.\u201cThe problem is HDFC is expensive,\u201d he said, noting that the stock trades at more than four times the company\u2019s book value. In contrast, ICICI trades at a small fraction of that multiple, Mr. Kirby said, and the bank\u2019s focus on corporate loans means it could benefit from any economic improvements in India brought about by reform.Another approach to emerging market investing, and a classic one, still works well, said James Syme, senior fund manager with J O Hambro Capital Management. Investors can focus on exporters \u201cthat benefit from demand in the developed world,\u201d he said.These can be companies like Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor, which supply components to Western technology manufacturers. But they can also be exporters that cater to consumers in the developed world, like the Hyundai Motor Company.\u201cIf you get a world where the U.S. and eurozone do well and China slows slightly,\u201d Mr. Syme said, \u201cyou want to be cautious with commodities, selective in the emerging-market consumer space, and look at this third way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is Said to Seek Cutting Corporate Tax Rate to 15 Percent", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has instructed his advisers to make cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent a centerpiece of his tax-cut blueprint to be unveiled this week, according to people with knowledge of his plans, even if that means a significant reduction in revenue that could jettison his campaign promise to curb deficits.The 15 percent rate is lower than what House Republicans proposed in the tax cut blueprint being pitched by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, and it could be difficult to move through Congress. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said on Monday that such a deep cut might not be well received by Mr. Trump\u2019s party because of its potential to increase the deficit.The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated last year that the corporate tax cut plan Mr. Trump had proposed, which at the time included the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, would cost $2.4 trillion over a decade. Still, Steven Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury, said on Monday that he was confident the administration\u2019s tax proposal would \u201cpay for itself\u201d through economic growth. He said a growth rate of 3 percent was achievable.Mr. Mnuchin also said the Trump administration would lay out plans to cut middle income tax rates, simplify the tax code and make American companies more competitive with foreign ones.White House officials declined to comment on the 15 percent target, which people close to the administration cautioned could change between now and the announcement on Wednesday, perhaps repeatedly. They warned that the details were sketchy at best, and others who have discussed the tax overhaul plan with administration officials in recent days said there was still indecision at the highest levels about what elements to include and in what form.The Wednesday deadline, set hastily by Mr. Trump last week in a comment that appeared to catch some of his closest advisers off guard, was an effort to showcase an ambitious plan for economic growth during his first 100 days in office. During the campaign, he promised to introduce a tax cut proposal to Congress in the first 100 days. But he has had no major legislative achievements to point to as evidence of an activist economic agenda.The 15 percent cut represents a return for Mr. Trump to the economic vision that animated his campaign, and a victory of sorts for Mr. Mnuchin, who has been a supporter of the plan. The cut also helps Mr. Mnuchin jockey for position as the driving force behind the tax overhaul effort.\u201cOur analysis has always shown that of all the economic bang for the buck from all of the changes that were in the original Trump plan, you get the most economic juice from cutting the corporate rate,\u201d said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.One question that Mr. Trump will have to answer, Mr. Moore said, is whether the 15 percent rate would apply only to corporations or to small businesses, as well. But there are plenty of other unknowns, he added.\u201cThey can change their minds,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been all over the map.\u201dMembers of Mr. Trump\u2019s team of economic advisers are set to meet with Republican leaders in Congress on Tuesday to discuss the plan.Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center who analyzed Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign tax plan, said its high cost would make it more difficult to push through Congress.\u201cIt\u2019s very expensive, and that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real heavy lift to get the revenue necessary to pay for these things.\u201dMr. Williams said the president\u2019s recent emphasis on tax \u201ccuts\u201d suggested that he was prepared to lose revenue and hope that economic growth will make up the difference. However, Mr. Williams said, such a plan could be difficult for fiscal conservatives to swallow.\u201cThat makes it a lot harder with the budget hawks in Congress,\u201d he said.Republicans are expecting to pass tax legislation without the support of any Democrats using the Senate\u2019s budget reconciliation procedure. That requires only 51 votes for passage. But if changes to the tax code add to the deficit, they would expire after 10 years, adding uncertainty for businesses and possibly hurting economic growth.Economic advisers from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign had been unhappy that he seemed to be drifting away from the tax principles that helped get him elected. But on Monday, Lawrence A. Kudlow, one of the economists who helped craft Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, said he was pleased that Mr. Trump appeared to be returning to those roots.\u201cWe were at 15 percent from Day 1,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, lamenting that Mr. Trump\u2019s new economic advisers had discussed scrapping the campaign tax plan. \u201cAll the noise in the last week or 10 days sounds like they haven\u2019t junked the plan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Great Overseas Cash Grab", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byFor years, corporate chieftains have spoken wistfully of wanting to bring home the more than $2 trillion in cash American companies have socked away overseas \u2014 if it weren\u2019t for tax rates of close to 40 percent.Under President Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress (even one divided over how to overhaul the health care law), these executives may finally get their wish for lower taxes on those funds.And, if so-called repatriation relief comes despite the current political uncertainty, deal makers say it could generate a fresh wave of corporate mergers and acquisitions in the United States.\u201cRepatriation, if it\u2019s actually put in place, will be an important driver of increased M&A activity,\u201d said Blair W. Effron, a co-founder of the boutique investment bank Centerview Partners.As Mr. Trump and Republicans turn their eyes toward reshaping the nation\u2019s tax code, corporate advisers are betting that lower rates will bolster what has already been a respectable level of deal-making. About $3.7 trillion worth of takeovers around the world were announced last year, according to Thomson Reuters, the third-best year for mergers in the last decade.Bankers are betting on one change in particular: repatriation, where American companies bring revenue generated abroad back to the United States. American companies have long kept those proceeds sequestered in bank accounts that are designated for foreign holdings because of how the federal government taxes that money. (It\u2019s worth noting that much of that cash is technically already in American banks.)Few other countries follow the United States rules, which tax revenue no matter where it is earned and subjects it to the standard corporate rates of as much as 39.1 percent.Both Republicans and Democrats have argued that the current system is broken, and that the best way to bring that money home is to lower the tax rate on it. Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York have said that revenue from at least a tax holiday could help finance a national infrastructure bank that could create new employment.And then there is Mr. Trump, who has been outspoken about overhauling the tax code. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, he proposed a one-time 10 percent tax on repatriated cash, followed by an end to the existing system.These proposals generally envision American companies taking those enormous sums and reinvesting them in operations back home, creating new jobs. But deal makers admit that much of the cash would probably go toward mergers, many of which end up leading to job losses.There is precedent for repatriation leading to deals. In the fall of 2004, Congress enacted a one-time \u201ctax holiday\u201d during which companies could bring money home at a tax rate of about 5.25 percent. The move was meant explicitly to promote job creation, and it prohibited using the money for buying back shares, though there was no real way to enforce that rule.What happened instead, according to several studies, was more mergers. The number of deals announced in 2005 was up 9 percent over 2004, while 2006 saw a 26 percent jump over 2004, according to Thomson Reuters. Bankers have conceded that not all of that increase was because of repatriation, but say the inflow of cash absolutely helped increase deal activity.Take Oracle, which told the Senate that it used nearly $11 billion of the money that it brought home to strike two sizable acquisitions, including the $10.3 billion takeover of the corporate software maker PeopleSoft.That would likely happen again under a new repatriation scheme, advisers say. The biggest impact would be in the number of deals struck within the United States, some of them added.\u201cDespite the tax cost associated with mandatory repatriation, U.S. companies who can access their accumulated offshore cash should be more open to U.S. acquisition targets that otherwise would be more difficult to finance,\u201d said Richard Casavechia, the head of mergers structuring at Barclays, although some companies, he added, would choose instead to use offshore cash to invest in overseas operations.Importing trillions of dollars would mesh with other conditions favorable to deal-making, including interest rates that remain low and a domestic economy that continues to perform well. And investors and politicians alike would put pressure on companies to use the money for growth, rather than simply buying back stock.\u201cIn the political environment we\u2019re in, companies will certainly be looked upon more favorably that make capital investments or do M&A,\u201d said Robert Kindler, the global head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley.Mr. Kindler added that the current rate of deal-making in 2017 has been held back because of uncertainties over tax issues.All of this optimism assumes that repatriation ends up inside a politically palatable tax package. Following the failure of the Republicans\u2019 health care bill, the viability of a broad tax overhaul is up in the air. Serious fissures within the Republican caucus emerged during the health care debate, while newly emboldened Democrats may choose to drive a tougher bargain in future dealings with Mr. Trump.Still, an issue like repatriation that has won bipartisan support in some form appears to be one of the more palatable options at the moment.\u201cComprehensive reform seems less likely,\u201d said William G. Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cSmaller tax reforms like tax holidays seem more likely.\u201dMr. Gale cautioned that the House\u2019s repatriation proposal was closely tied to the addition of a border adjustment tax on imported goods, a measure that has drawn strong opposition even among some Republicans.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an administration that has lost a lot of political capital, so it may be hard to get some of those reforms through,\u201d Kurt Simon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s global chairman of mergers and acquisitions, said at an industry conference last week, adding that he remained optimistic that changes to repatriation taxes were more likely than not to happen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking Insight Into Trump Voters", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:Nicholas Kristof asks, \u201cMaybe we all need a little more empathy?\u201d I think this question reaches the heart of why so many readers, including me, are upset at the Trump supporters he interviewed \u2014 their lack of empathy for others, which was demonstrated by voting for a man who clearly lacks empathy for anyone.I, too, grew up in Trump country (rural West Texas), and I, too, have family members and lifelong friends who voted for President Trump. Some are racists or misogynists or one-issue voters, but many are simply unwilling to think critically. Do I hate them? Never. Do I expect them to own up to the harm they\u2019ve done our country? Absolutely. They are the ones who taught me that we reap what we sow.KAREN COLLIER, AUSTIN, TEX.To the Editor:Nicholas Kristof\u2019s column brought a sigh of relief in the wake of perhaps the most polarized election in recent American history. Many of us Trump supporters on the ground have seen firsthand how our mere support of the president \u2014 no matter how reluctant or if we supported someone else during the primaries \u2014 resulted in our being characterized as \u201cdeplorables\u201d and shunned as \u201cirredeemables.\u201dThe unfair characterizations and moral condescension have disappointingly continued after the election. Many of those on the other side of the protest line, so to speak, would do well to remember how similar we are despite the fissures that this election has brought out between us. We will never agree on all the issues, but we are still one nation and one people.The writer was a Virginia elector in 2016 and served as a county co-chairman for the Trump campaign.To the Editor:What makes Nicholas Kristof think that Trump supporters can be recruited by the Democratic Party? Can you recruit people who continue to support a president whose legislation if passed would threaten their very existence? Can you recruit people who still believe that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States? Can you recruit people who cannot be persuaded by rational argument and scientific evidence? Can you recruit people who take the most preposterous lies of the right-wing news media as gospel truth?I am afraid that many if not most Trump supporters will stick with the president until the pain he will inflict upon them can no longer be tolerated.DAVID ARTHUR, BROOKLYNTo the Editor:Nicholas Kristof\u2019s column is one of a growing mass of articles featuring lower-class, white Trump voters lamenting the president\u2019s proposed cuts to social programs that have benefited them. However, Mr. Kristof\u2019s interviews make clear that these voters continue to favor cutting social programs that benefit other Americans. Keep programs that help me; cut programs that help others. This is a pretty miserable and ungenerous attitude, which seems based on these voters\u2019 belief that they are hardworking but unlucky and thus deserving of a helping hand, whereas other benefits recipients are lazy and unworthy. What underlies that perspective, I fear, is racial resentment.To the Editor:To the Editor:As enlightened intelligent readers of The New York Times we know better than to make sweeping generalizations, equating Islam with terrorism, for example, to justify a Muslim ban. We know how dangerous it is to dehumanize entire groups and make them the \u201cother,\u201d blaming them for our ills and holding ourselves high above them.Then why are we treating Trump voters this way? Trump voters are not the problem. They are just an easy target. It has been heartbreaking and disheartening to review reader comments about Trump voters.To the Editor:Nicholas Kristof\u2019s valuable column should signal what the Democratic National Committee is up against as it seeks potential candidates to defeat immoderate Republicans and earn, or regain, the support of the \u201cdeplorables,\u201d who so far are remaining loyal to Donald Trump even when doing so is proving not to be in their own self-interest.It might be useful to view such voters as similar to battered wives who excuse their husbands\u2019 violence and cruelty as their fault, or who stay with their abusers out of a twisted sense of loyalty or because they believe they have nowhere else to go. I choose to characterize these voters as suffering from \u201cbattered Trump-loyalist syndrome.\u201d Like battered women, these voters need a safe haven, a party that is genuine about having their backs.To the Editor:Nicholas Kristof\u2019s column is an intriguing portrait of Americans who have faced profound adversities and were able to restore some balance and dignity to their lives with the help of programs that receive federal funding. They also have unfettered loyalty to President Trump, who appears to have a callous, scorched-earth mentality when it comes to programs that may help victims of domestic abuse or workers cast adrift in a brutal, bottom-line economy.I understand that political loyalty \u2014 he may be a crook, but he\u2019s our crook \u2014 is found in the entire spectrum of political ideologies, but sometimes loyalty can have disastrous outcomes.To the Editor:In both of Nicholas Kristof\u2019s columns on Trump supporters, he gave little insight into why the Trump voters who are being hurt by the president\u2019s policies are still supporting him. I do agree, however, that the left needs to stop demonizing these folks. Generally, they are good, hardworking folks who are discontented with the current state of affairs.I understand that the comments from these voters may be inconsistent or even incoherent; however, I believe that it\u2019s important for readers to understand why these voters consistently vote against their own self-interest. Is it the constant right-wing drumbeat regarding the \u201cbloated\u201d federal government or overreaching regulations? Is it that they believe that other people deserve to lose federal support? Is it the nostalgia for the \u201cgood old days\u201d when they all had well-paying jobs? Or is it impossible to explain?Many of Mr. Kristof\u2019s columns go beyond the effects and help suss out the causes. I\u2019d love to read one that does the same for the Trump voter who votes against his or her best interests.BOB FREEMAN, PITTSBURGHTo the Editor:I have many liberal friends who believe all Trump voters to be deplorable and some have even cut off family members for it. The Democratic Party used to be the party of the working class, but we\u2019ve done little to show that in the past few decades. We should remember that Democratic presidents supported trade deals disastrous for the working class, deregulated the banks and bailed them out when they nearly destroyed the economy. By reducing Trump supporters to \u201cignorant deplorables,\u201d we only enhance our image as liberal elitists who couldn\u2019t care less about the working class. Fixing the problem of divisiveness doesn\u2019t rest solely upon the shoulders of Republicans in this country.To the Editor:It will take something cataclysmic to convince most Trump voters that he is not interested in their well-being. For the emperor to be naked, somebody or something needs to blast off his clothes, and the Democrats are perceived as the enemy. We do need to reach these voters with a sense that we care for their needs and respect their dignity.But how do we undo the lies and mistaken beliefs, like thinking that cellphones for the poor are paid for by the government? That people of color are either shiftless or here illegally? That the programs that benefit good, hard-working white people are worthwhile, while the programs that benefit \u201cothers\u201d are a waste? That Hillary Clinton is a criminal, and Donald Trump is a brilliant, compassionate, right-thinking businessman who will save the country?The task of unclothing one demagogue while detoxifying the image of his opponents seems complex and monumental to me. We had better begin it now.TAMA ZORN, BROOKLINE, MASS.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s Pick for Top Antitrust Cop May Shape Competition", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byAs a young Senate staff member years later, Mr. Delrahim found those early experiences had laid the foundation for his conservative views.In the interview with The New York Times, Mr. Delrahim declined to address AT&T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner, which is now undergoing regulatory review, or other large deals, saying he would \u201cexamine any matter according to evidence and economic analysis.\u201d But he gave other hints of how he might act as the department\u2019s top antitrust official.Specifically, Mr. Delrahim, a former lobbyist, said he would not go after a company just because it was big, and would do so only if there were violations of antitrust law. \u201cJust like any other industry, if there is wrongdoing, we would investigate,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said. But \u201cfederal laws should not be used as a fishing expedition by government.\u201dHe also intimated that he was skeptical of antitrust action against intellectual property rights holders, referring to some earlier comments on the matter. In a 2007 statement, for example, he had warned that cases that blended intellectual property rights with antitrust enforcement could hamper innovation.Legal experts have extrapolated that Mr. Delrahim is also likely to credit mergers with helping competition \u2014 not only reducing it \u2014 and to point out how big deals can promote the United States economy. That \u201cwould be a major change from his most recent predecessors,\u201d the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell recently said in a memo to clients.Mr. Delrahim\u2019s views contrast subtly with those of the Obama administration, which took a more aggressive approach in antitrust toward protecting innovation, especially in the technology industry.Mr. Delrahim would take over antitrust duties at a moment of profound economic transformation, with tech companies like Google and Amazon dominating search and commerce while extending their reach in transportation, media and other industries. Telecom companies are trying to morph into media powerhouses that control the distribution and creation of television and online content.With a wave of corporate mergers in other areas \u2014 chemicals, agricultural products and health insurance \u2014 some Democratic lawmakers have warned that industries have become too concentrated, putting consumers in danger of higher prices and giving them fewer options in vital services.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who will be at the Wednesday hearing, said in a statement, \u201cI plan to ask if Mr. Delrahim will enforce the laws to protect American consumers and if he will commit to being independent, focusing on the merits of each case, not on interference from the White House.\u201dMr. Delrahim has had years of experience in antitrust matters. He graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1991 with a degree in kinesiology and obtained a law degree at George Washington University in 1995. He then joined the law firm Patton Boggs before leaving to be a counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1998. There, he cut his teeth on antitrust working for Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. Mr. Hatch had pushed for an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s practice of tying its web browser, Internet Explorer, to its ubiquitous Windows operating system.In 2005, Mr. Delrahim left Washington and joined the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck in Los Angeles. Over the years, he was the lawyer or federal lobbyist for clients including Ultimate Fighting Championship, Comcast, Google, Johnson & Johnson, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield.Mr. Delrahim endorsed Mr. Trump relatively early in last year\u2019s presidential campaign. In an op-ed in The New York Post in March 2016, he called on conservatives to back Mr. Trump, even if he was not their \u2014 or his \u2014 top choice.Former Democratic and Republican colleagues at the Justice Department describe Mr. Delrahim as fiercely loyal to the Republican Party, though he has a reputation for forging bipartisan relationships. His wife was a Democrat when they met and has voted for Democrats; Mr. Delrahim said he still did not know how she voted in the 2016 election.Democrats recall when Mr. Delrahim became a crucial ally in 2000 to help pass amendments to an antitrust law. House Republicans were unwilling to sign on, but Mr. Delrahim worked to allay their concerns and brokered compromises between them and Senate Democrats, said Jonathan Leibowitz, a partner at Davis Polk who was then working on the bill for Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat. Mr. Leibowitz later was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cHe\u2019s a conservative but his instincts tend toward pragmatism and not ideology,\u201d Mr. Leibowitz said of Mr. Delrahim.\u201cI\u2019m seeing more complaints about enforcement motivated by protectionism, so that will be an important area of inquiry for antitrust enforcement and cooperation,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said.He emphasized that antitrust is intended to support free markets and that the government should intervene only when necessary. A monopoly is perfectly legal until it abuses its monopoly power, he said.Advertisement"}

They have been charged by French prosecutors in an elaborate campaign-finance scheme that has been crucial to keeping the National Front afloat for years.The financial scandals have not dented Ms. Le Pen in the polls before the first round of voting on April 23. Potentially more damaging may be the recent revelations about the people she has surrounded herself with, in particular Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau.\u201cThey have remained National Socialist,\u201d said Aymeric Chauprade, once Ms. Le Pen\u2019s principal adviser on foreign affairs until a falling out, partly over his pro-Israel stance.\u201cThey are anti-Semites, nostalgic for the Third Reich, violently anticapitalist, with a hatred for democracy,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cPeople think they\u2019re marginal. But in fact, I discovered, she protects them. She supports them. They are at the heart of everything.\u201dMr. Chauprade recalled a dinner with Mr. Chatillon and others in the spring of 2014 that was \u201cfull of anti-Semitic jokes.\u201d But he added: \u201cThey are not joking. They are real Nazis.\u201dSeparately, an affidavit filed in a 2014 defamation lawsuit (later dropped) offers a fuller portrait of Mr. Chatillon\u2019s extremist views from that era.In the affidavit, Denis Le Moal, once a member of G.U.D., described Mr. Chatillon\u2019s nostalgia for the Third Reich and his closeness to Holocaust deniers.Mr. Le Moal told of a 1993 rally Mr. Chatillon organized for the student group in Paris that resounded with \u201cSieg Heils\u201d and Nazi salutes.\u201cDuring that period, every year, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chatillon organized a dinner on the birthday of the \u2018fuhrer,\u2019 April 20, to pay homage to \u2018this great man,\u2019\u201d the affidavit states.It goes on to describe a gathering in a Paris restaurant when Mr. Chatillon brought a painted portrait of Hitler \u2014 \u201ca portrait Chatillon showed us during the dinner, saying, \u2018My beloved fuhrer, he is magnificent,\u2019 and kissing the picture.\u201dIt says he also organized \u201cstriped-pajama\u201d parties as a student, an allusion to the clothing Jews wore in death camps and concentration camps.\u201cThe only debatable point, in the use of the term \u2018neo-Nazi,\u2019 is the wrongful qualifier \u2018neo,\u2019\u201d the affidavit states.Requests to arrange interviews with Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau through associates of theirs were unsuccessful. The men have made no secret of their disdain for journalists.\u201cTo hell with Hitler and the Third Reich!\u201d Mr. Chatillon wrote in a recent Facebook posting. \u201cBut to hell also with these \u2018journalists\u2019 who write whatever the hell they want.\u201dOn Twitter, Mr. Loustau denounced \u201cthese activists hiding behind a press card, benefiting from all the means of state television to try to destroy us.\u201dThe National Front\u2019s treasurer, Wallerand de Saint-Just, defended the men. \u201cIn no sense are they nostalgic for the Third Reich,\u201d he said.\u201cThey were turbulent boys, but they have become true professionals,\u201d Mr. Saint-Just said. \u201cThey work closely with us and we have confidence in them, in the conception, printing and delivery of campaign materials.\u201dThat role has been at the center of a campaign finance scandal that has haunted the National Front for years.Mr. Chatillon\u2019s company, Riwal, served as the exclusive supplier of campaign materials to the National Front in elections from 2012 to 2015. Prosecutors suspect it of systematically overcharging for posters, fliers and the like sold in campaign \u201ckits\u201d \u2014 and then, milking giant reimbursements from the state.Under French law, the state reimburses the campaign expenses of candidates who earn more than 5 percent of votes. Mr. Chatillon had refined the system to an art, according to a high-ranking French campaign finance official and Mr. Chauprade, as well as two new books that closely examine the National Front\u2019s finances.A printer would charge Riwal, say, 180 to 220 euros, or $191 to $233, for 400 posters; Riwal would then charge a small front party affiliated with the National Front, called Jeanne, \u20ac500 for the posters. Jeanne, in turn, would charge the candidates the inflated price.After the election, the candidates would claim reimbursement from the state for the inflated amount, and that reimbursement would be turned over to Jeanne.At least some of that money would wind up in the coffers of the National Front, according to the French campaign finance official, who requested anonymity because of the continuing presidential campaign.\u201cThey\u2019ve constructed an economy out of reimbursements from the state,\u201d said Mr. Chauprade, who has been interviewed by prosecutors about the party\u2019s financial affairs.Mr. Chauprade said he had been pressured by Ms. Le Pen herself to buy a kit, but refused, to the fury of party officials.The system operated through a number of recent election cycles \u2014 regional, municipal, legislative \u2014 from 2012 on. And most National Front candidates went along with it, the official said.Once the government oversight agency began to see a pattern of excessive amounts benefiting the National Front, it began to challenge them \u2014 knocking off more than \u20ac1 million in just one campaign, the official said.The National Front treasurer, Mr. Saint-Just, who has himself been charged with embezzlement in the scandal, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done anything wrong, and we think they will be acquitted.\u201dAs for Mr. Chauprade, \u201cHe\u2019s a profound traitor,\u201d Mr. Saint-Just said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to avenge himself.\u201dThe historian, Mr. Lebourg, cast no doubt on the recent revelations about the party, but agreed that Mr. Chauprade was \u201cnot exactly the Virgin Mary.\u201dMr. Chauprade was elected in 2014 as a National Front deputy in the European Parliament. There he was pursued by human rights groups for hate speech for issuing an anti-Islamist diatribe after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris in early 2015.Now on the outside, he has been willing to say aloud what many critics have long suspected about the National Front.\u201cIt is a mafia-like system,\u201d Mr. Chauprade told the newspaper Le Monde last month. \u201cYou stick an arm into it, you are stuck yourself.\u201dHe has also spoken to the police about a phony National Front jobs scheme at the European Parliament, which gives deputies expense money that can be used to pay support staff members.The European Parliament is now demanding that more than \u20ac1 million be returned from six people, including Ms. Le Pen, who are associated with the party. Ms. Le Pen, a European Parliament member, has invoked her parliamentary immunity, although French prosecutors said on Friday that investigators had asked the European Parliament to lift it.All of that money could be applied to National Front operations in France, giving Ms. Le Pen\u2019s party yet another boost. \u201cHer system was illegal,\u201d Mr. Chauprade said.Philippe P\u00e9ninque, a leader of the student movement G.U.D. in the 1970s who remains close to Ms. Le Pen, said he was confident the National Front would be vindicated in its financial scandals.In a lengthy interview at an outdoor cafe in the moneyed 16th Arrondissement of Paris, he also heaped scorn on journalists and others for writing about Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau. And he defended Mr. Chatillon\u2019s visit to the aging SS man, Mr. Degrelle \u2014 \u201cHe didn\u2019t open any concentration camps,\u201d he said.\u201cMy friends\u201d were all about \u201cupside-down humor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t respect anything.\u201dThey were neither Third Reich nostalgists nor any danger to the party, he said. \u201cMarine kicked out her father, and she keeps the Nazis?\u201d Mr. P\u00e9ninque asked incredulously.Mr. Chauprade is not so sure. \u201cShe sacrificed her father, and yet they are much more radical,\u201d he said of her inner circle, making a comparison to President Trump\u2019s senior adviser, Stephen K. Bannon.\u201cIf she enters the Elys\u00e9e\u201d \u2014 the French presidential palace \u2014 \u201cthey will enter as surely as Bannon has entered the Oval Office,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elizabeth Strout\u2019s Lovely New Novel Is a Requiem for Small-Town Pain", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesAnd oh, how the characters suffer in Strout\u2019s latest novel, \u201cAnything Is Possible\u201d! The title seems a mean joke, given the book\u2019s army of hurting men and women, desperate for liberation from their wounds.To describe the plot, to the extent that there even is one, is pointless. Like \u201cOlive Kitteridge,\u201d \u201cAnything Is Possible\u201d is really a necklace of short stories about people in a small town, studded with clues about who\u2019s connected to whom. (Strout was born to be an omniscient narrator, born to flit and swoop from one crooked perch to the next.)It is most useful to think about Strout\u2019s work thematically. The same ideas continually preoccupy her, and her characters often behave in similar ways. They indulge in the petty comforts of gossip, their judgments disguised as concern, their desperation to reassure themselves of their luck \u2014 and virtue \u2014 disguised as pity. They throb with loneliness and fume with disappointment. (A lot of her characters are old, very old, and are bitter to discover where they have ended up.) Grown children defend parents who had done the indefensible, their mercy almost saintly in its bounty; or they do its opposite, clinging to righteous fury over parental infractions on a more human scale, driving their mothers wild with grief and remorse.And many characters walk around with great satchels of unexpressed love.\u201cBecause he was Charlie and not someone else,\u201d Strout writes of Charlie Macauley, a damaged Vietnam veteran, \u201che could not say to his son: You are decent and strong, and none of this has anything to do with me; but you came through it, that childhood that wasn\u2019t all roses, and I\u2019m proud of you, I\u2019m amazed by you.\u201dWhere this book sharply departs from Strout\u2019s previous work is in its frank, unapologetic emphasis on forbidden desire. Not a chapter spins by, practically, without the unveiling of some sexual secret. There are stories of voyeurism. Prostitution. A father\u2019s secret gay life. We discover, to our horror, that the husband of one of the most tender, largehearted characters, Patty Nicely, was repeatedly raped as a child. When she was a child, Patty herself walked in on her mother in flagrante delicto \u2014 with Patty\u2019s Spanish teacher, who was spanking her.The trauma of the primal scene, which may or may not involve both parents, is central in \u201cAnything Is Possible.\u201d It misshapes the psychosexual futures of many innocents. The best they can hope for in adulthood is not to recapitulate the crimes that were done to them.So where, you might ask, is the relief in such a book?\u201cAnything Is Possible\u201d is certainly more grim than Strout\u2019s previous work. It\u2019s more audacious, too, and more merciless, daring you to walk away. \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d assumes a mythic status among some of its characters. This book is its terrible opposite. No chirping families to be found among the swaying golden fields here.But the writing is wrenchingly lovely. It almost always is with Strout, whether she\u2019s knitting metaphors or summarizing, with agonizing economy, whole episodes of a life: \u201cHaving met in their late thirties, they\u2019d had only eight years together. No children. Patty had never known a better man.\u201dYou read Strout, really, for the same reason you listen to a requiem: to experience the beauty in sadness.But the most startling thing the reader discovers in this book is that \u201cLucy Barton\u201d wasn\u2019t the whole truth. You may think, having read it, that you know the Barton family. Trust me: You don\u2019t. Those children suffered cruelty of an astounding magnitude, far worse than Strout originally conveyed. That their father couldn\u2019t stop diddling himself in their presence, and on the job, is only the half of it. It was their mother who inflicted the most harm. Lucy was holding out on us \u2014 possibly willfully, or possibly because the complete truth, half-glimpsed, was all her adult self could tolerate.But her siblings have fuller memories. Her sister in particular can cite chapter and verse of her mother\u2019s crimes. \u201cYou want truthful sentences?\u201d she asks in the new novel, after a noisome litany of them rolls off her tongue. \u201cWrite about that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to write that story,\u201d Lucy replies.\u201cAnd who\u2019d want to read it?\u201d asks her brother.We would.

Its digital technology lets workers become entrepreneurs, we are told, freed from the drudgery of 9-to-5 jobs. Students, parents and others can make extra cash in their free time while pursuing their passions, maybe starting a thriving small business.In reality, there is no utopia at companies like Uber, Lyft, Instacart and Handy, whose workers are often manipulated into working long hours for low wages while continually chasing the next ride or task. These companies have discovered they can harness advances in software and behavioral sciences to old-fashioned worker exploitation, according to a growing body of evidence, because employees lack the basic protections of American law.But so far, experience with these companies shows that without the legal protections and ethical norms that once were widely accepted, workers will find the economy of the future an even more inhospitable place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "State and Local Tax Deduction: An Item Blurring Party Lines", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byBut to many taxpayers, the deduction is a cherished break that can save them thousands of dollars in double taxation.Mr. Trump and House Republicans, riding a wave of conservative and populist sentiment, are pushing to end the provision. Yet they must overcome a long tradition and powerful opponents, including Republican and Democratic officials in wealthy, populous states like California, New Jersey, New York and Texas.Congressional Republicans have indicated that they will go it alone on tax legislation, but taking on such an entrenched interest usually requires bipartisan support.\u201cIf Republicans do it by themselves, they put a big target on their backs,\u201d Mr. Gale said. Members of Congress generally take a \u201cpolitical Hippocratic oath\u201d to \u201cnever be seen to do obvious harm,\u201d he said, but eliminating the deduction, which would increase taxes and undermine the ability of cities and states to raise revenue, would violate that precept.Other interest groups have also registered their opposition, like the National Association of Realtors, which said that eliminating the state and local deduction would help \u201cnullify the current tax benefits of owning a home for the vast majority of tax filers.\u201dStriking a blow at the taxing power of cities and states has long appealed to conservative Republicans. They argue that the deduction works like a subsidy and encourages states \u2014 particularly those dominated by Democrats \u2014 to set higher rates and spend more taxpayer money.Like most other deductions, the state and local tax provision primarily benefits wealthier taxpayers who itemize deductions. The Tax Policy Center\u2019s report finds that households with annual incomes exceeding $100,000 would bear roughly 90 percent of the increase; those with incomes over $500,000 would absorb 40 percent. More precise calculations are impossible because other proposals \u2014 like eliminating the alternative minimum tax \u2014 would create savings for some of these taxpayers.For example, roughly 30 percent of taxpayers itemize deductions, but that number would certainly fall if the standard deduction were increased, as Mr. Trump proposed, or if various breaks were erased.While the upper middle class would feel the biggest hit, the wealthiest would mostly be unaffected because of limits on the value of deductions, said Edward D. Kleinbard, a professor of tax law at the University of Southern California. \u201cPeople affected are those with six-figure incomes, not seven-figure incomes,\u201d he said.Conservatives have complained that the deduction causes low-tax, often poorer, states to subsidize high-tax areas.But as Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the partnership, pointed out, even with those deductions, New York City still sent far more money to the federal government than it received back. City residents paid $96 billion in personal income taxes, and businesses paid $19 billion. In return, the city received about $61 billion from Washington.In any case, she said, ending the state and local deduction would hurt states like New York most. \u201cYou can say for sure,\u201d Ms. Wylde added, \u201cthat high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will not get as much benefit as states like Florida,\u201d where taxes are significantly lower.An article on Friday about President Trump\u2019s plan to end the federal deduction for state and local taxes misstated a reason some taxpayers can deduct sales taxes from their federal returns. In Nevada and Washington, it is because the states have no state income taxes, not \u201clow\u201d income taxes.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTPatrick McGeehan and Adam Nagourney contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, Narrowly Misses Outright Win in Georgia House Race", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byMr. Ossoff received 48.1 percent of the vote, just short of the 50 percent threshold needed to win the seat, and he will face Karen Handel, the top Republican vote-getter, in a June runoff.Mr. Ossoff released a statement early Wednesday after the race was called.\u201cThis is already a remarkable victory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe defied the odds, shattered expectations, and now are ready to fight on and win in June.\u201dEarly Wednesday, Mr. Trump, who had posted a number of Twitter messages on the contest in the last few days, claimed a victory for Republicans before the race was called.As Mr. Ossoff faces Ms. Handel in a head-to-head race on June 20, it is unclear whether he will be able to sustain the success he enjoyed on Tuesday, in an 18-person field. Ms. Handel, who received just under 20 percent of the vote, is a former Georgia secretary of state and is viewed as an establishment-friendly Republican. While she has struggled in her two most recent campaigns, losing primaries for governor and senator, she will receive the full support of a party that dominates Georgia politics, as well as nearly unlimited resources from Washington Republicans, in the runoff.Ms. Handel, 55, has portrayed herself as a Trump supporter, though she was less fervent in her backing for him than were the other Republican candidates in the race, who adopted Mr. Trump\u2019s catchphrases and style in an attempt to stand out.The intense Republican competition and liberal enthusiasm lifted Democratic hopes that they could snatch a surprise victory.\u201cWe are certainly going for an outright win here today,\u201d Mr. Ossoff told CNN on Tuesday before the polls closed.Here\u2019s how we analyzed Georgia\u2019s special election through about 11 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, which the Democrat Jon Ossoff, who just narrowly missed an outright win, had cast as a referendum on President Trump.Much as they did in last week\u2019s race in Kansas, Democrats initially got their hopes up after promising early-vote returns were posted soon after polls closed. But as the Election Day results trickled in, it became clear that those early and absentee ballots, reflecting their fired-up base, would not be sufficient to match the Republicans\u2019 structural advantage in the district.On Tuesday night, hundreds of Ossoff supporters crammed into a ballroom at a Crowne Plaza hotel. Cries of delight erupted as early returns flashed on big television screens. But many attendees were cautiously optimistic, with an emphasis on caution.Janice Owens, 60, a project manager who had been knocking on doors and making calls for Mr. Ossoff, said she and others would not feel the effort was wasted if Mr. Ossoff failed to avert a runoff.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody thinks it\u2019s for naught,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re not giving up.\u201d If anything, the Ossoff campaign showed how Democrats had been successful, even in this Republican-friendly chunk of suburbia, in converting an enthusiastic but inchoate anti-Trump movement into a real political force.Ms. Handel took the stage at a lightly attended victory party of her own shortly after 11 p.m. to claim her spot in the runoff \u2014 and urge Republicans to unify to stop Democrats\u2019 effort to \u201csteal a seat.\u201dThis year, there will be seven special House and Senate elections, five to fill vacancies left by members of the Trump administration.But she made no mention of Mr. Trump. Ms. Handel dismissed her opponent as a \u201cyoung man\u201d beholden to national liberals and vowed to \u201ckick a little Ossoff.\u201dFor all of the attention lavished on the working class \u2014 Rust Belt voters who flocked to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 voters who have flourished in the 21st-century economy will prove more crucial when it comes to the fight for control of Congress next year. If Democrats are to have a chance at recapturing the House, they will have to win over the dominant constituency here: suburbanites who only grudgingly cast a presidential ballot in November and have no deep affinity for either Mr. Trump or the Democrats.None of the major Republican contenders pointedly distanced themselves from the president \u2014 they did not dare anger the partisans most likely to vote in a spring special election \u2014 but most of them did not make him central to their appeals, either.Mr. Ossoff walked a careful line when it came to Mr. Trump. He opened his bid with donor-tailored appeals to \u201cMake Trump Furious\u201d and continued similar targeted advertising throughout his campaign. But he also sought to cast himself as a consensus-oriented moderate focused on the district, dismissing Mr. Trump\u2019s late intervention as so much noise from Washington.Sensing an opportunity to deliver an early blow to Mr. Trump, and nudged ahead by an animated base hungry to register its fury, Democrats aggressively competed to win outright on Tuesday and avert a more directly partisan runoff. In addition to Mr. Ossoff\u2019s astounding $8.3 million haul through the end of March, the House Democratic campaign arm poured money and staff into the district.Republicans were as fractured as Democrats were unified, with political veterans such as Ms. Handel on the ballot as well as newcomers who saw an opportunity at a moment when the party seemed to be in flux.In an illustration of how nationalized the race became, 95 percent of Mr. Ossoff\u2019s fund-raising haul was from out of state, and even more was from outside the district, where the candidate himself does not reside (though he grew up there).Republicans blistered him on this score and much else, a kitchen-sink campaign that totaled $5 million yet also stirred muttering within the party about why there had not been a more coherent approach to a district they knew would be competitive, given Mr. Trump\u2019s weakness here. But the unrelenting Republican assault eventually paid off, raising Mr. Ossoff\u2019s negative ratings and nudging conservative voters to show up for an unusual spring election.Jonathan Martin reported from Roswell, and Richard Fausset from Atlanta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will London Fall?", "Date": null, "News": "London may be the capital of the world. You can argue for New York, but London has a case. Modern London is the metropolis that globalization created. Walk the streets of Holborn, ride an escalator down to the Tube and listen to the languages in the air. Italian mingles with Hindi, or Mandarin, or Spanish, or Portuguese. Walk through the City, the financial district, and listen to the plumbing system of international capitalism. London is banker to the planet.London is ancient yet new. It is as much city-state as city, with a culture and economy that circulate the world. London manages to be Los Angeles, Washington and New York wrapped into one. Imagine if one American city were home to Hollywood, the White House, Madison Avenue, Wall Street and Broadway. London is sort of that.Modern London thrives on the idea that one city can be a global melting pot, a global trading house, a global media machine and a place where everyone tolerates everyone else, mostly. The thought is that being connected to the rest of the world is something to celebrate. But what happens to London when that idea unexpectedly falls away?It was both shocking and thrilling, at first, that you could catch a Eurostar from a platform in London, slide under the English Channel, hurtle through the French countryside and less than three hours later pull into the Gare du Nord in Paris. To ride the Eurostar was to marvel that the capitals \u2014 London so prosaic and straightforward, Paris so romantic and mysterious, the two with their long history of rivalry and discord \u2014 were part of the same larger enterprise.Eurostar symbolized an era in which London seemed to be inevitably rushing toward Europe, too. At least that was the idea until now, and the beginning of the process known as Brexit. The trains are still running, but the era that created modern London appears to be over.This article is part of a series examining whether \u201cBrexit\u201d will sink a great global city.\u201cWe\u2019ve made a horrible statement to the rest of the world, and it\u2019s very sad,\u201d said Martin Eden, a publisher waiting to catch the Eurostar to Paris the other day, to celebrate his 43rd birthday. \u201cWe should be moving together,\u201d he said of Europe, \u201cinstead of moving apart.\u201dI met Mr. Eden as I wandered around St. Pancras at the moment Britain officially filed for divorce from the European Union. It was lunchtime on March 29, Brexit Day, as you might call it, when Britain delivered a letter to Brussels and opened two years of negotiations over the rules of disengagement.But as Britain tries to bid farewell to its now-estranged partner of 44 years, London faces a different sort of challenge: how a great global city whose residents voted overwhelmingly against Brexit in last summer\u2019s referendum should adjust to an uncertain future governed by principles that feel antithetical to its very being. Brexit has divided Britain from Europe but also divided Britain from itself, with London on one side and much of England on the other (Scotland and Northern Ireland, which also voted to remain, are another story).To many people in the capital, the vote last year feels like a rejection not just of Europe but also of the values embodied by London, perhaps the world\u2019s most vibrantly and exuberantly cosmopolitan city: values like openness, tolerance, internationalism and the sense that it is better to look outward than to gaze inward. Even as a sense of melancholy seemed to descend on St. Pancras when I walked around the other day, much of the rest of Britain was celebrating.Brexit has thrown into disarray this great experiment in tolerance. Nobody can predict what the city will look like in 10, 20 or 30 years. If spontaneous travel between Europe and Britain no longer seems so simple, neither does the easy exchange of people, capital, jobs, businesses and languages. Perhaps more significant, it is no longer clear that these are meant to be admirable things, here or anywhere.\u201cLondon is a weird place at the moment,\u201d said the writer Nikesh Shukla, whose book \u201cThe Good Immigrant\u201d is made up of essays by nonwhite Britons about a country from which they feel increasingly alienated. He lives in Bristol now but grew up in London, and the city, he says, \u201cfeels like a uniquely encapsulated version of what Britain means to me.\u201d\u201cThe government says it\u2019s trying to get the country back, but in the process it\u2019s losing the heart of its people in London,\u201d Mr. Shukla said in a telephone interview. \u201cPeople feel uneasy because there are a lot of futures at stake. These are people who live in the city who contribute to society, who have families, social structures and financial commitments, whose futures are now in doubt.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t live in an island and call it your oasis,\u201d said Shirley Watkins, 83, who was waiting at St. Pancras the other day for a train to France. \u201cI think it\u2019s sad that we\u2019re pulling out.\u201dPeople have complicated feelings about what might happen to London. \u201cA lot of people my age are not happy \u2014 are they going to have to move back to France?\u201d said Antoine Nauleau, a dual French-American citizen who works here for now. But he said he can see another side to the argument in the country in general. \u201cIt seems that the U.K. is losing a lot of support, but also kind of defining itself.\u201dI lived in London for more than 15 years, returning home to New York in 2013. The city changed a great deal in that time, and the city I left felt markedly different from the one I found when I arrived. It felt more open, more international, more enthusiastic, more exciting. The food got better, and places stayed open later. My neighbors seemed to come from a United Nations\u2019 worth of countries, our differences somehow erased because we all shared them.The city also grew a lot richer, which was not necessarily a good thing: The center of town became all but unaffordable. Russian oligarchs and other members of the world\u2019s ultrarich elite dug up the streets to build subterranean complexes filled with swimming pools and parking garages for homes they planned to live in only a couple of weeks each year.Europe, which had seemed like a distant concept, suddenly seemed right there on the doorstep. Crowds of French people and then Poles and Spaniards and, later and more contentiously, Romanians moved in. Any time you went to an art gallery or a movie, you saw how British culture was benefiting from European financing. The rise of laughably cheap no-frills airlines made air travel to Europe almost easier than train travel. Tony Blair, prime minister for much of that time, liked to take his vacations in places like Tuscany, in Italy.I\u2019ve been back a number of times since I left, but it was during two visits in the past few months that I encountered something different: fear for the future and a questioning by many non-Britons of whether they even belong here anymore.\u201cEven for those that haven\u2019t talked about leaving, there\u2019s something fundamentally ruptured in their relationship with the country,\u201d said Ian Dunt, editor of the website Politics.co.uk. \u201cWhen people say they\u2019re very anti-immigration, no one thinks that\u2019s directed at German architects or French lawyers. But even those people are beginning to feel that the country is becoming cold and meanspirited and indifferent to their presence, if not openly hostile toward them.\u201dLondon is big and unwieldy and constantly changing. It resists easy definition.Here, despite the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant sentiments that helped fuel the Brexit vote, is London\u2019s first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, whose parents, a bus driver and a seamstress, came from Pakistan. Here are international financiers and playboys, Eurocrats and Eurotrash, as well as economic migrants from Spain and Portugal and other depressed European countries crowding into tiny flats on the edges of town and taking jobs in cafes, on construction sites, in hotels.\u201cIn London I never feel like an outsider, because everyone\u2019s an outsider,\u201d said Paolo Martini, 32, a hairdresser I met in Kentish Town who comes from Brazil and has a Polish wife and a British (by virtue of her birth) daughter. He has lived here for more than a decade; who knows what Brexit will mean for his family?Part of what makes London different is how closely it all knits together, people from different economic backgrounds as much as different ethnic ones. Every borough has its grand houses and its public housing projects, sometimes right around the corner from one another.\u201cIt\u2019s not just me and you and rich and poor,\u201d said Dara Djarian, 25, a real estate agent in Kilburn whose parents are French and Iranian. He compared the jumbled-up neighborhoods of London with the more uniform banlieues at the periphery of Paris, centers mostly for Arab immigrants. \u201cEveryone\u2019s all mixed up here.\u201dI looked down Kilburn High Road from his office and saw what he meant. A Polish delicatessen was next to an Italian restaurant across the street from a traditional London pub beside a Halal butcher shop. There was the Shah furniture store, a classic fish-and-chips place, a ladies-only hairdresser, a luxury bathroom-fixture store, some fancy coffee shops and the highbrow Tricycle Cinema, with a program that appeals to hipsters and cineastes.\u201cThe one thing we don\u2019t actually see a lot of here is English people,\u201d Mr. Djarian said. \u201cThey\u2019ve moved out to the countryside, or to the suburbs.\u201dThe Rupert Murdoch-owned Times of London, which is not a fan of the European Union or, for that matter, of France, sent the political columnist Patrick Kidd to write about the event.He could not tell his readers exactly what Mr. Macron said, however, because, as he boasted in the article, he does not really speak French, although he studied it in school. But why should he make an effort, seemed to be the idea, when it is so easy to ridicule the French for being French, and when to be English is to feel superior to your neighbors?\u201cMr. Macron did not ask for directions to la gare once,\u201d Mr. Kidd wrote, alluding to his French lessons in school. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even say \u2018zut\u2019 or \u2018bof.\u2019 One wondered if he was French at all.\u201dMr. Kidd\u2019s hauteur isn\u2019t surprising, given that Mr. Murdoch\u2019s papers and the rest of the country\u2019s right-leaning news media have spent decades nurturing an ancient anti-Europe narrative long reflected in the Conservative Party\u2019s Euroskeptic wing. If London, or at least much of London, has welcomed or tolerated all the changes, many people around Britain, particularly from older generations, have lamented that they no longer recognize the country of their childhoods.The populist tabloids stoked that anxiety and resentment, often veiling it in easy stereotypes and portraying anyone who objected to the coverage as tediously \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d They used crude World War II metaphors when England played Germany in soccer. They mocked Europe as a place of humorless Krauts and garlic-eating Frogs, deriding the European Union as an impenetrable, out-of-control bureaucracy sucking up British money and imposing risible, onerous laws on an unwitting populace. Multiculturalism, the zero-sum argument went, was causing Britain to lose sight of what it was meant to be.\u201cWe fly the British flag, not these awful things you are putting on tails,\u201d former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher snapped during the Conservative Party Conference in 1997, upon seeing a miniature British Airways 747 whose tail was decorated with an image from a foreign country, part of a short-lived effort to celebrate the airline\u2019s global reach. After unearthing a handkerchief from her handbag, she slapped it across the back of the plane. (\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, can\u2019t we have British designs?\u201d her husband, Denis, added.)It is an irony of history that it was Mrs. Thatcher who may have given birth to modern London, when her government deregulated the financial markets in 1985 in the so-called Big Bang, paving the way for the city\u2019s rise as a global financial behemoth. Nine years later, the Channel Tunnel opened, a victory for common sense (its detractors had argued, among other things, that rabid Continental dogs might use it to sneak into Britain) and a feat of engineering that seemed to defy the physical and metaphorical laws of the English Channel itself.Tony Blair\u2019s election as prime minister, in 1997, ended 18 years of Tory rule and ushered in an era when belonging to Europe felt like something verging on cool. Speaking a foreign language was suddenly, briefly, O.K. And then, in 2012, London hosted the Summer Olympics, advertising itself as a city for the world and proving how smoothly and joyfully this polyglot place worked when it put its mind to something, and how unusually well the people who lived here got along.\u201cPeople here are coming in from every single nation and just walking around so casually,\u201d Cristina Barba, who is 23 and Spanish, told me, \u201cand it all feels very natural.\u201dShe pays $750 a month for a room in a house on the edges of the city (affordable housing is unattainable closer to the center) with seven roommates who include recent arrivals from Italy and Romania. She works on Brick Lane, home to a large Bangladeshi population, in Absence of Colour, a shop selling expensive monochromatic clothing from an Icelandic designer.\u201cIn Spain you feel like there\u2019s a division between Spaniards and people who look differently,\u201d she said. \u201cBut here, there is no division. Everyone just coexists.\u201dIt is strange, the bustle. Construction crews are still putting up buildings, monuments to London\u2019s future, as if nothing has changed. But you can hear faint footsteps, too. Banks, investment firms and other companies are making contingency plans to move elsewhere, if necessary. What then?How do you define London? You don\u2019t, really. \u201cIt\u2019s an accordion breathing in and out,\u201d the Canadian author Craig Taylor wrote in \u201cLondoners,\u201d his portrait of the city, describing its ever-shifting population.Built in 1743 as a Protestant church by French Huguenots fleeing religious persecution, it became a Methodist chapel in 1819 and then, in the late 19th century, a synagogue for Jews fleeing a different sort of persecution in a different part of Europe. Finally, in 1976, it was transformed into a mosque to accommodate the newest wave of immigrants, from Bangladesh. No one seems to think there is anything strange about any of that.At the same time, no one is claiming that London is a utopia. Racism bubbles up, and so do the politics of race. Two years ago, the Bangladeshi-born mayor of the borough of Tower Hamlets was forced out of office after a court found that his campaign had committed election fraud in a number of ways. It was an ugly moment, awash in accusations (and denials) of racism. But people keep chugging along.\u201cLondon seems to work, whether by accident or design,\u201d said John Biggs, who took over as borough mayor afterward. Tower Hamlets encompasses not only Brick Lane but also luxury building complexes and some of the poorest housing estates in the country, so he has a lot of different constituencies to contend with. \u201cWe work because we\u2019re a pretty tolerant bunch and we knock along together.\u201dLike the Brick Lane Mosque, London is facing another incarnation, if an uncertain one. The terrorist attack in March became a Rorschach test of Britain\u2019s views not only on the causes of terrorism but on the city itself. Led by Mr. Khan, the city\u2019s mayor, many in London spoke of the diversity of the victims, from many different countries, and said it was wrong to vilify an entire religion for the actions of a Muslim extremist.Yet in The Daily Mail, the columnist Katie Hopkins wrote that London\u2019s reaction to the March attack only emphasized the chasm between the capital and the rest of the country.It is strange to me that some Britons who live outside London seem to mistrust and feel alienated from it, given how essential, and central, the city is to the country and how much people like it when they visit. But the things London is proud of also make it an easy target. In 2012, Theresa May, then the anti-Brexit home secretary and now the pro-Brexit prime minister, said that diversity of language in the capital was helping rip apart the nation.The rift between what she said and what Londoners think shows why London is struggling so much right now.\u201cThe idea is that we\u2019re all who we are, and we\u2019re all in it together,\u201d said Victoria Prescott, who teaches English and film studies at the Deptford Green School in Lewisham. The students speak 40 different languages at home but acclimate quickly, she said, through immersion courses in English.The school emphasizes strength in diversity, and to visit it during the morning recess is to see a playground full of students of different colors and cultures all intermingling as if their differences did not matter. But of course it\u2019s only part of the story. Rebecca Cummings, Deptford Green\u2019s deputy head teacher, mentioned one of her neighbors, an older Brexit supporter bitter at the very things the school celebrates.\u201cShe\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m sitting in the doctor\u2019s surgery waiting forever next to a Somali immigrant with four kids,\u2019\u201d Ms. Cummings said. \u201cThat\u2019s London, too.\u201dThose feelings are now taking root in the city. Pro-Brexit views are hardening, and many immigrants \u2014 rich as well as poor \u2014 are wondering if there is any point in staying. What London will look like then is anybody\u2019s guess.\u201cMy main concern is that when the E.U. migrants are kicked out, and the students are kicked out, and all the banks that use London as a hub leave because they are no longer part of the E.U., who\u2019s going to be left?\u201d said Mr. Shukla, the author. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be full of tourists who have come to see the queen, and Theresa May.\u201dBack at St. Pancras last month, nothing official happened to commemorate the moment the prime minister put Brexit into motion. The trains to Paris did not stop running. Nobody\u2019s passport was rescinded at the gate. But in the station concourse you could hear piano music, courtesy of a program in which pianos are installed in public places for anyone to play.Standing by the piano, Julie Walker and her husband, Simon, said they had chosen a piece of music that would express their joy that Britain was doing the Christian thing and, as they saw it, \u201ccutting all the ties\u201d to an outside world that threatens British self-determination. The song they requested from the pianist, Stewart Yeff, was Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah.\u201dIt seemed apt, because it sounds like a song of celebration, but it is really one of mourning.Produced by Craig Allen, David Furst and Matt RubyAn article on April 11 about London in the aftermath of the March 22 terror attack described incorrectly a point Katie Hopkins made in a column in the Daily Mail. She wrote that London\u2019s reaction to the attack emphasized the chasm between the capital and the rest of the country; she did not refer to \u201cbombings.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Trade, a Politically Feisty Trump Risks Economic Damage", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisAs political theater, the threat last week from the Trump administration that it would pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement effectively enhanced the White House story line. From the campaign through his first 100 days in office, President Trump adroitly exploited the most conspicuous downsides of trade in portraying himself as a hero to those who go to work in coveralls.It could cost jobs in the name of saving them.\u201cRe-creating trade barriers between the United States and Mexico will hurt many of the people Trump is ostensibly trying to help,\u201d said Pietra Rivoli, a trade expert at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown. \u201cWe can expect higher prices for many consumer goods, and we can expect negative effects for our many firms that rely on Mexico for inputs.\u201dNot that Nafta is sacred. Economists and advocates across the ideological spectrum have long criticized the landmark agreement with Canada and Mexico as being in need of updating.Nafta was negotiated in the elder George Bush\u2019s administration and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993 \u2014 before the web was a commercial force. It lacks rules for e-commerce. It is weak on labor and environmental protections, relegating them to unenforceable side agreements. It gives multinational companies rights to sue for compensation when local regulations damage their profits, tripping concerns about national sovereignty.An earnest renegotiation would afford an opportunity to address gaps.The Obama administration renegotiated some terms of trade with Mexico and Canada as part of a regional pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That deal enhanced the ability to enforce labor and environmental standards while adding rules for the digital age, though it maintained mechanisms allowing multinationals to sue.Mr. Trump revoked American participation within days of taking office.Whatever the merits, Mr. Trump has accelerated a fundamental reordering of global trade policy. Big trade deals involving multiple countries \u2014 long championed by reigning elites as a key to expanding prosperity \u2014 have become political liabilities shunned as toxic to the public interest.Labor groups in the United States and across Europe attacked it as a threat to job security. European watchdogs intoned that it would open the region to a flood of genetically modified Frankenfoods. On both sides of the Atlantic, those concerned about rising corporate power argued that the deal undermined national sovereignty by giving multinationals rights to seek compensation for costly regulations.Similar contentions fueled opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the Obama administration championed as a means of expanding commerce while checking China\u2019s growing stature.In place of these arrangements, Mr. Trump favors bilateral deals, those forged between two countries. This is a return to a previous era. During the administration of George W. Bush, the United States struck bilateral deals with smaller countries \u2014 among them Colombia, Panama and Peru.Those deals entailed major political acrimony for minimal economic gain. Whether the trading partner was South Korea (home to 50 million people, meaning a potentially large customer for American goods) or Panama (population four million), unions and industries vulnerable to competition waged war.President Barack Obama shifted the focus to multilateral deals, seeking to extract maximum expansion of markets for the political pain of trade negotiations.Mr. Trump\u2019s preference for bilateral trade pacts is in keeping with his deal-making style, cultivated in the rough-and-tumble world of real estate. In the Trump realm, negotiations are like boxing matches in which one side emerges with the golden belt.In any bilateral deal, the United States possesses unrivaled leverage because it owns the world\u2019s largest economy. Every country has greater incentive to gain expanded access to the American market than the other way around.Trade has contributed to economic growth, but changing dynamics have also prompted concerns about lost jobs and the trade deficit. But when something is manufactured in the United States, it is often made up of parts from around the world.But trade is not zero sum. More trade tends to enhance growth, yielding greater spoils.Trade does generate losers along with winners. The losers stand out, making them tempting fodder for politicians.When the United States opens its markets to dishwashers manufactured in Mexico, people who make appliances in Michigan become vulnerable to increased competition. When a factory transfers jobs to Mexico, the spectacle lends credence to the notion that trade is malignant. Abandoned workers have bills to pay and children to feed. Trade is a handy villain.The beneficiaries of trade are vastly more numerous, yet also diffuse.Homeowners who buy cheaper dishwashers may spend extra dollars on local contractors and restaurants. Auto parts imported from Mexico enable American workers to continue making cars in Michigan.But these realities can be hard to spot in the vastness of the American marketplace. Abandoned factory workers, on the other hand, are easily recognized. They appear on sidewalks waving placards, on television and \u2014 if they are fortunate \u2014 in the Twitter feed of @realdonaldtrump.When China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, gaining access to markets worldwide, millions of Americans suffered a shock. Entire communities absorbed the consequences \u2014 mass joblessness, bankruptcies, depression. Many have yet to recover.Mr. Trump is advocating policies that would make it harder for those who absorbed the economic blow. If he succeeds in repealing the Affordable Care Act, that will eliminate medical insurance options for laid-off factory workers. His proposed tax cuts would lavish breaks on the wealthiest households, while his budget plans would trim public services aiding those in distress, from housing support to food stamps.Mr. Trump has also reversed a frequently voiced campaign pledge to accuse China of manipulating the value of its currency, citing a need for Chinese cooperation in pressuring North Korea to yield on developing nuclear weapons.Now, Mr. Trump promises to deliver on a central trade promise: renegotiating Nafta.He may find agreement with Mexico and Canada in one area that could be meaningful \u2014 tightening so-called rules of origin, which specify the percentage of a finished product that must be made within North America to qualify for duty-free access within the region. That would prevent China from exploiting loopholes in Nafta, playing well to a blue-collar base.But the trouble with assessing Mr. Trump is that he has been stridently critical of decades of American trade deals while maddeningly nonspecific about what he would change. While Mr. Trump\u2019s election was propelled by his catering to the anxieties of Rust Belt workers, his time in office has seen greater emphasis on the concerns of groups that traditionally wield influence in American politics: major corporations, wealthy households and other interests with a clear stake in expanded trade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cuomo College Fiasco", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byDonald Trump sets the bar very high, but the award for the worst public policy idea of the year goes to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Cuomo presides over a state with a rich diversity of educational institutions. But he also presides over a state, like all states, where many students don\u2019t complete college and where many are unprepared for the information economy. For example, fewer than half of the African-American and Hispanic students in New York public colleges graduate within six years.Cuomo could have done many things to improve New York\u2019s higher ed system. He could have poured all available money into the Tuition Assistance Program, which is directed at poorer students. He could have spent more to help students become academically ready for college, which is the biggest barrier to graduation. He could have done more to help students pay room and board expenses. He could have massively improved overstretched mental health services. He could have massively improved career counseling.If he runs for president, this will be an outstanding talking point. Unfortunately, the law will hurt actual New Yorkers.First, the law is regressive. It does nothing to help students from families earning less than $50,000 a year. Their tuition is already covered by other programs. But it does pay for tuition for New Yorkers who make double the state\u2019s median income. The higher up the income scale you go, until the ceiling, the more you benefit.Second, it doesn\u2019t make a dent in reducing the nontuition fees, like living expenses, textbooks and travel, which for many students are far more onerous than tuition.Third, it doesn\u2019t cover students who don\u2019t go to school full time and don\u2019t complete in four years. In 2017 this is the vast, vast majority of all students, especially poorer students.Fifth, Cuomo\u2019s law threatens to destroy some of New York\u2019s private colleges. Cuomo could have championed a Pell-like program that subsidizes attendance at any accredited school. Instead, he pays for tuition only at state schools.This means that suddenly the state\u2019s 150 private colleges have to compete with \u201cfree.\u201d Many of these schools are already struggling to survive. If upper-middle-class students are drawn away to public colleges, private ones may close. That hurts the state\u2019s educational diversity, it destroys jobs and it hurts the state.These private colleges tend to have smaller classes, they tend to do a better job of graduating their students and they tend to spend heavily to subsidize poorer students.Sixth, the law may widen the gap between rich and poor. When state schools are \u201cfree,\u201d more people will apply. As more apply, selectivity will increase, as administrators chase higher U.S. News & World Report rankings. That will exclude students with lower credentials, who tend to be from more disadvantaged homes. Even Georgia\u2019s successful Hope Scholarship program had this unintended consequence, widening the college attendance gap between white and black and rich and poor.Seventh, over the long term the law could hurt the quality of New York\u2019s state system. Right now those schools rely on tuition to help fund programs. If New York moves more toward a purely publicly funded model, it may suffer from the slow decay that has hurt many state systems. State budgets are perpetually challenged by rising entitlement spending. Education gets squeezed. The universities will try to claw back the private money with dorm fees, activities fees and other charges that don\u2019t officially count as tuition, but still quality suffers.Even in Germany, where a generous welfare state is valued, per-pupil spending has dropped by 10 percent since universities became free. Germany is an extremely successful country, but lecture classes are huge and the country\u2019s universities are not generally ranked among the world\u2019s best.Finally, the law will hurt its recipients\u2019 future earnings. Students who receive free tuition for four years have to remain in New York State for four years after graduating, or pay the money back. This means they won\u2019t be able to seize out-of-state opportunities during the crucial years when their career track is being formed. They\u2019ll be trapped in a state with one really expensive city, and other regions where good jobs are scarce.This is a really counterproductive law. We\u2019re all focused on Trump, but one of the reasons Trump was elected was that many of the people who try to use government to do good just haven\u2019t thought things through.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018What Next?\u2019 an Uncertain Art World Asks, Sticking to Proven Brands", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The art market is almost as old as art itself. But it\u2019s only in the last decade or so, with increased globalization, digitization and the rise of art as a multibillion-dollar investment vehicle, that the market has been viewed as an industry. And where there is industry, conferences are sure to follow.\u201cIt\u2019s a pause-for-thought day about where the industry is at,\u201d said Louise Hamlin, the British-born organizer of the conference, whose company, Art Market Minds, has been holding similar events in London since 2014. Until recently, art was one of few industries without an annual conference in the United States, she added.In a session on the challenges of running art businesses in London and New York, the British dealer John Martin spoke of soaring rental bills (in the case of his gallery, totaling 250,000 pounds, or about $310,000, a year) and highly popular fairs threatening the existence of smaller galleries.The New York art adviser Lisa Schiff talked about how the \u201cnumbing saturation\u201d of the art world and the pressures of globalization had created an \u201cimpasse\u201d in today\u2019s market.\u201cIt\u2019s an endless cycle,\u201d Ms. Schiff said, referring to this year\u2019s ever-more-crowded calendar of art fairs, exhibitions and other events. \u201cThere\u2019s simply too much now. I want to shut off the noise.\u201dMarta Gnyp, an art adviser and writer based in Berlin, has, like many people in the art world, noted how conservative the tastes of collectors have become in these uncertain times.\u201cCollectors are looking for the new, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean young,\u201d said Ms. Gnyp, who was scheduled to present a paper on Friday on the burgeoning market for works by older or deceased female artists at the 43rd conference of the Association of Art Historians in Loughborough, England.Today\u2019s collectors concentrate their buying on a limited number of 20th- and 21st-century names, from a small number of international auction houses and galleries. That everyone is essentially buying the same thing pushes up prices, reinforcing the sense that doing so is a good investment.Doug Woodham, a former executive at Christie\u2019s and McKinsey & Company whose book \u201cArt Collecting Today\u201d was published on Tuesday, calls this process \u201chomogenization.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of new people who want to buy a sure thing,\u201d said Mr. Woodham, a New York collector and wealth manager who left Christie\u2019s in 2015. \u201cArt is so expensive now, and they are concerned about liquidity. If you buy a known name, you have a better chance to sell. It also reflects the prevalence of art advisers, and of the networked nature of the art economy.\u201dMr. Woodham\u2019s book contains startling information about the number of people in the market for the world\u2019s most expensive art. It was based on notes taken in 2015 by an unidentified collector, whom senior specialists at Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s tried to persuade to sell paintings by Picasso and by Warhol. They told the collector that about 140 people worldwide had the desire and means to spend $50 million or more on a work of art, that there were perhaps 300 potential bidders for pieces valued at more than $20 million, and about 1,000 for works worth more than $5 million.There were 124,000 people worth at least $50 million in 2015, according to data compiled by Credit Suisse.For all the Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s talk of global wealth coming into the market, buying art remains a niche activity.\u201cThe worldwide art scene has agreed these are good artists,\u201d said Jean Minguet, an art market analyst at the French auctions database Artprice. \u201cThese are safe investments. It\u2019s getting kind of boring.\u201dBut that is the nature of industry. It\u2019s all about global brands.An earlier version of this article misstated the publication date of the book \u201cArt Collecting Today.\u201d It was published on Tuesday, April 4, not in January.Advertisement"}

The new holding company would be based in Phoenix and operate about 23,000 trucks and have 28,000 employees.Founded in 1966, Swift Transportation, based in Phoenix, has a fleet of about 18,000 trucks driven by company and third-party drivers, and it operates more than 40 trucking terminals in the United States and Mexico.Knight Transportation, also based in Phoenix, has about 5,000 employees and operates a fleet of more than 4,000 trucks.The family of Jerry Moyes, the Swift founder, would own about 24 percent of the combined company after the transaction. The family also would be entitled to designate two directors to the combined company\u2019s board, which will include all of Knight\u2019s directors and four current Swift directors.Kevin Knight, the Knight executive chairman, would continue to serve as executive chairman of the combined company, while Dave Jackson, the Knight chief executive, would hold the same position at the combined company.

{"Headline": "Richmond Fed President Resigns, Admitting He Violated Confidentiality", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jeffrey M. Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond in Virginia, resigned abruptly on Tuesday, saying that he had broken the Fed\u2019s rules in 2012 by speaking with a financial analyst about confidential deliberations.Mr. Lacker said he also failed to disclose the details of the conversation even when he was questioned directly in an internal investigation.The confession and resignation shed light on a nearly five-year-old mystery. In October 2012, Medley Global Advisors, a firm that tracks policy developments for financial investors, sent a note to its clients describing previously undisclosed details of the Fed\u2019s plans for a new phase in its bond-buying campaign.The information was potentially valuable to investors, who could have made money by anticipating the market\u2019s reaction when the Fed\u2019s plans were publicly disclosed.The Fed conducted an inconclusive investigation into the source of the leak. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission opened an insider trading investigation and referred the matter to the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, which then began a criminal investigation, two people briefed on the matter said.But the investigation stalled in the past couple of years, one of the people said. As the various government authorities sought to resolve the matter, negotiations heated up about six weeks ago. The statute of limitations on the case was due to expire in the fall.Mr. Lacker decided to announce his resignation after being told by the authorities that they had completed their investigation into his role, a lawyer representing him said.\u201cDr. Lacker has cooperated with the Department of Justice and has been informed that no charges will be brought and that the investigation as to him is complete,\u201d said the lawyer, Richard Cullen, a partner at McGuireWoods. (Mr. Lacker has a doctorate in economics from the University of Wisconsin.)The episode occurred after the Fed said in September 2012 that it would begin to accumulate mortgage bonds until job growth improved substantially, a new chapter in its campaign to stimulate economic growth in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.On Oct. 3, a day before the Fed released an account of its deliberations, Regina Schleiger, a Medley analyst, sent a note to clients saying the Fed was likely to announce in December that it would buy Treasuries too. The note also said that Fed officials were considering a statement that the central bank would not raise interest rates before the unemployment rate fell below a threshold of 6.5 percent.Instead, he said that Ms. Schleiger mentioned the information and that he had failed to make clear that he could not comment. The next day, after seeing Ms. Schleiger\u2019s memo, Mr. Lacker said, \u201cI realized that my failure to decline comment on the information could have been taken by the analyst, in the context of the conversation, as an acknowledgment or confirmation of the information.\u201dHe added, \u201cI deeply regret the role I may have played.\u201dAfter the leak, the C.F.T.C. pursued an investigation under its \u201cEddie Murphy rule.\u201d This rule was a nod to Mr. Murphy\u2019s 1983 movie \u201cTrading Places,\u201d which humorously exposed the legality of insider trading in commodities.In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act adopted some restrictions on federal employees intentionally providing nonpublic government information to help other people trade in certain markets.Yet the investigation stalled as the agency and Manhattan federal prosecutors were unable to serve a subpoena on Medley because it considers itself to be a news organization, the people briefed on the matter said. The Justice Department generally avoids issuing subpoenas to news organizations.Separate from the insider trading rules, the Fed had announced a new policy in 2011 restricting contact between policy makers and market intelligence firms like Medley, which traded on the perception that analysts had access to inside information. Officials were instructed to avoid conversations that might contribute to such impressions.Mr. Lacker said Tuesday that in speaking with Ms. Schleiger he may have violated this policy, too, regardless of the contents of the conversation.

In 2016, three-quarters of the roughly 10,000 investor visas issued went to Chinese citizens.The program, sometimes referred to as a \u201cgolden visa,\u201d has helped attract billions of dollars of investment in hotels, highways, casinos and other projects in the United States.The program poses a dilemma for Mr. Trump, who has vowed to tighten immigration policies, but who is also eager to promote job creation.Since taking office, he has sought better economic relations with China after assailing the country during the presidential campaign. And as businessmen, Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, embraced the EB-5 program to help finance real estate projects.In China, many visa applicants hope that Mr. Trump will examine the issue from a business perspective. They say they agree with the president\u2019s call for stricter immigration policies, but they have said he should focus on illegal immigrants, not investors.Li Jing, an entrepreneur from Beijing who applied for an investor visa two years ago, said it was unfair that the United States let immigrants without authorization live in the country but turned away Chinese investors seeking visas through legal means.Ms. Li invested $500,000 in a highway project in Georgia, hoping to get a green card so she could join her son, who is studying at a military academy in the state. She said a booming real estate market in Chinese cities was making it easier for families to sell homes and use the money to invest.\u201cThe most important thing is education for the kids,\u201d she said. \u201cChinese parents are willing to spend anything. They\u2019re trying to give the next generation the best they can provide.\u201dThe program has been so popular that there is a backlog of more than 20,000 applications, resulting in delays of up to five years for green cards. Still, many Chinese say they are willing to wait.Wei Chi, 23, applied for an EB-5 visa two years ago after he was unable to secure a work visa through his employer. His parents in Guangzhou, a southern Chinese city, provided the $500,000 he needed to qualify for the program, which he invested in an apartment building in Washington.\u201cAll I can do now is wait,\u201d said Mr. Wei, a management consultant who lives in New York on a student visa.Ms. Feinstein said the program suggested American citizenship was for sale. \u201cIt is wrong to have a special pathway to citizenship for the wealthy while millions wait in line for visas,\u201d she said in a statement.Some lawmakers are concerned that the EB-5 program favors big cities at the expense of rural regions \u2014 an argument that Mr. Trump may be sensitive to, analysts say, given his political support in those areas.Rather than scrap the program, some have suggested raising the minimum amount required to invest, to $1.35 million from the current threshold of $500,000. Others support encouraging investment in rural areas by setting aside a block of visas for those who invest there.In anticipation of changes to the program under Mr. Trump, applications for investor visas in China have surged over the past several months, lawyers said.\u201cMany are motivated by the fear that this will be their last chance to get a better deal,\u201d said Gu Ouwen, an immigration lawyer in Beijing. Wealthy families also see the program as a way of shielding their assets from political winds in China, he added.Mr. Liu, the real estate executive, said he would continue to wait for a visa, though he said he worried about his 11-year-old son\u2019s health and education in Beijing.\u201cIf President Trump really wants to put America first,\u201d he said, \u201che has to let Chinese investors through the door.\u201dZoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Can Improve the Messy U.S.-Chinese Economic Relationship", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byImperfect PartnersThe United States and China are locked in a mutually dependent, frequently dysfunctional economic partnership. The world\u2019s biggest and second-biggest economies are like a married couple that complain about each other constantly yet can\u2019t even contemplate a divorce.The marriage enters a new phase Thursday, as President Xi Jinping of China visits for two days of meetings at the Florida estate of a president who made China a punching bag on the campaign trail.The question is whether President Trump can turn his bellicose language into concrete gains for American companies and workers. A look at the economics of the relationship between the nations, and conversations with former officials with battle scars from past negotiations, show a path for getting a better deal.That path to success may not include the kind of flashy, headline-generating announcements that the Trump administration has tended to celebrate.It is a view that is outdated. For years, China did intervene in financial markets to depress the value of its currency. But now it is intervening to keep the yuan from falling \u2014 actually doing the opposite of what Mr. Trump alleged. Economists generally think that the Chinese currency is close to the levels that would be set by purely market forces.That doesn\u2019t mean currencies shouldn\u2019t come up at Mar-a-Lago. This moment of relative peace between the countries on currency policy could be the ideal time to develop an understanding for the future.\u201cI think currency is still an issue, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to discuss it under the rubric of manipulation,\u201d said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cChina is managing its currency; it\u2019s just that it\u2019s managing it right now in a way that is relatively advantageous to the United States. That understanding of how China intends to manage its currency in the future remains a top-order issue.\u201dIn other words, Mr. Trump could use this moment not to beat China over the head about what happened in the past, or where things stand today, but to develop an agreement on what it will do in the future, if a day comes when market forces start pushing the yuan upward.Mr. Trump has similarly assailed the United States trade deficit with China and other countries, often characterizing it as a scorecard, evidence that China is winning at trade and the United States losing, to the tune of $310 billion a year.The reality is more nuanced. The persistent trade deficit is indeed problematic, but that\u2019s because of the factors that drive it and the imbalances they cause to build. Simply targeting a lower trade deficit could well leave both American and Chinese workers worse off, if carried out the wrong way. For example, a trade war that significantly reduces American imports from China while also reducing American exports to China would reduce the trade deficit but would mean lower incomes and fewer jobs in both countries.The U.S.-China trade imbalance is indeed driven in part by trade barriers that China enacts against American companies, including a 25 percent tariff on imported automobiles and various quotas and restrictions that reduce agricultural imports. If Mr. Trump can persuade China to loosen those restrictions, it might close the trade deficit by increasing American exports \u2014 the healthy kind of trade rebalancing.But the trade gap isn\u2019t driven just by the details of trade arrangements. It is also driven by the flow of capital between countries. To oversimplify, when a company sells more abroad than it buys, it has to do something with that money.The flip side of a current account deficit, as an economist might put it, is a capital account surplus. China\u2019s trade imbalances are a function not only of its trade practices, but also of its very high levels of savings, which are in turn invested around the world.For China to change that, it would have to change the very structure of its economy: away from savings and big-ticket infrastructure investments, and toward consumer demand \u2014 including for products made both domestically and abroad.If the Trump administration really wants the trade deficit with China to come down over time, it\u2019s not enough to look at only one side of the international economic ledger \u2014 flows of goods \u2014 while ignoring the flow of capital.In practice, this would mean making demands on some issues that might seem like purely domestic concerns only tangentially related to trade. That might include pushing China to allow more troubled state-owned enterprises to fail, so that their accumulated profits might be spread through the Chinese economy instead of funneled toward the purchase of foreign assets. A more generous pension system might spur demand among older Chinese citizens.If China allowed global financial companies more access to its market, it could both encourage more domestic spending and give a major American industry an opportunity it has long sought.President Trump prides himself on being a dealmaker, and his negotiating style is to lay out extreme requests in order to work back to agreement. But resetting economic relations with China will prove trickier than any real estate deal.One of the fundamental realities of the relationship is that while neither side is wholly comfortable with how it works, these are big, powerful countries that can\u2019t be easily swayed by what a country on the other side of the Pacific Ocean wants to happen. The leverage that each side has to deploy is limited \u2014 at least so long as neither country is willing to shoot itself in the foot.The United States could conceivably have more negotiating leverage by threatening punitive tariffs or other aggressive measures, as Mr. Trump did during his campaign, but those actions are just as likely to produce a painful blowback from China that damages the United States.Then there are noneconomic issues, which invariably could shape the contours of economic relationships.\u201cIn the Obama administration, China was a good citizen cooperating with us on Iran sanctions and on climate change, which I think made it hard for the U.S. to contemplate anything that harsh in the trade arena,\u201d said David Dollar, a former Treasury Department official in Beijing and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cYou could have something similar if the Trump administration wants China to cooperate more on North Korea. That could be hard to turn around and be harsh on them in the economic realm.\u201dMr. Trump likes to announce big splashy deals, and given that the Chinese are looking for places to invest their capital in the United States, it would be easy enough to find something along those lines to announce.But in the context of the two giant economies, that kind of thing is small bore. This flawed economic relationship has been building for a long time, and the fixes are unlikely to come overnight.It\u2019s unlikely that the first meeting between the new president and the Chinese leader will resolve issues that have been building for years or even decades. Rather, those who have worked in diplomacy advise looking beyond the current headlines to make progress on lowering Chinese trade barriers, increasing its domestic savings and committing not to return to the days of manipulating its currency lower.When you\u2019re talking about commerce between two superpowers, things don\u2019t change overnight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Key Questions on Trump\u2019s Plans for \u2018Maybe the Biggest Tax Cut\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump stunned members of Congress, and his own Treasury Department, when he said last week that he would unveil a plan on Wednesday to deliver \u201cmaybe the biggest tax cut we\u2019ve ever had.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump\u2019s plan is expected to be only a broad outline of his vision for overhauling the tax code, lawmakers, lobbyists and investors will be parsing every word. The key questions will be whether Mr. Trump is aligned with House Republicans, whether he is keeping his campaign promises and, of course, whether his proposal has any chance of turning into law.Here\u2019s what to watch for:Veterans of previous tax fights like to say that rewriting the tax code is the most complicated legislative challenge there is, creating winners and losers across the entire economy.He also wanted to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, and he proposed a one-time 10 percent repatriation tax to entice companies to bring their overseas cash back home.Many analysts think Mr. Trump will return to this framework so that he can say he kept his campaign promise. The simplicity of it might also help him avoid getting bogged down in Congress.Mr. Trump always says he likes to think big, so nipping a few points off tax rates will not satisfy his ambitions of making history. He proclaimed on Friday in an interview with The Associated Press: \u201cIt will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we\u2019ve ever had.\u201dBut Calvin Coolidge followed up with a further 33 percentage point cut.Mr. Coolidge is the president to beat.Mr. Trump is advising his staff to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent even if that means jettisoning his promise to reduce the budget deficit. Many Republicans in Congress would be unwilling to go along with a plan that piled on debt. According to the Tax Policy Center, a liberal-leaning research group, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign plan would add at least $7 trillion to the federal debt over a decade.Mr. Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has said the administration is confident that it can create a plan that \u201cpays for itself\u201d with economic growth.Analysts will be watching the growth estimates the White House provides. Mr. Trump has said he can envision growth as high as 6 percent. Economists scoff at that, but Mr. Mnuchin said Monday that 3 percent growth was attainable.Both Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress have said they want to pass tax legislation that does not add to the deficit. That would allow them to pass a bill with only Republican support in the Senate through a procedure called the reconciliation process, which requires only 51 votes.If Mr. Trump does produce a tax plan that adds to the deficit, and no Democrats get on board, the cuts would have to expire after 10 years. While this might be the easiest situation for Mr. Trump to put a win on the board, it would mean scaling back the ambitions of his tax plan and agitating business leaders, who like to be able to make longer-term investment plans.The biggest debate surrounding tax discussions has been about the \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax that is at the heart of the Republican plan drafted by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The concept of taxing imports while letting exports go tax-free has divided American industries and drawn a fierce response from lobbyists of companies that rely on imported goods.Mr. Trump has generally been cool to the idea, saying in recent interviews that it sounds like a bad deal. His economic advisers have also expressed concern about how taxing imports could affect consumer prices and the dollar, which would rise in value.The president has said he is more in favor of a \u201creciprocal\u201d tax that matches the tariffs other countries impose on American goods. But if Mr. Trump breaks with House Republicans on the border adjustment tax, which could raise about $1.2 trillion in revenue, it would essentially send tax negotiations with Congress back to square one.Bipartisanship has gone out of style in Washington, and it does not appear that a tax overhaul is going to change that.Democratic leaders in Congress lament regularly that they have been shut out of tax talks with their Republican counterparts and Mr. Trump. Democratic aides on the Senate Finance Committee said they were not invited to meet with the president\u2019s economic team when they go to the Capitol for a briefing on the White House tax plan on Tuesday.Thus far, Democrats have assailed Mr. Trump\u2019s tax ideas, arguing that they would help only him and his rich friends.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Is a Real Republican, and That\u2019s a Good Thing", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIn his three major public speeches so far \u2014 his remarks at the Republican National Convention, his Inaugural Address and his speech to a joint session of Congress \u2014 Mr. Trump did not mention conservatism at all. Even at the Conservative Political Action Conference, he claimed simply, and almost in passing, that his election was a victory for \u201cconservative values.\u201d What those were he did not specify, except to say that Americans believe in \u201cfreedom, security and the rule of law\u201d and in standing up for America, American workers and the American flag.These formulas are sufficiently broad to encourage both sides of the White House jostling between Stephen Bannon, the chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Rather than focus on the infighting, we need to look at the president\u2019s overall agenda and try to put it into a longer, and sharper, historical perspective. Granted, there has never been a president quite like Mr. Trump, but his positions are not as outr\u00e9 or as outrageous as they are often portrayed.Mr. Trump remains the kind of conservative president whom one expects to say, proudly and often, \u201cthe chief business of the American people is business.\u201d Although Calvin Coolidge said it first, Mr. Trump shows increasing signs of thinking along broadly Coolidgean lines, and of redirecting Republican policies toward the pre-New Deal, pre-Cold War party of William McKinley and Coolidge, with its roots in the party of Abraham Lincoln.He raised in that remark, glancingly, the possibility that conservatism ought to be measured by the standards of Republicanism, or at least ought to be defined in conjunction with Republican principles and history, rather than the other way around \u2014 that is, rather than simply taking today\u2019s conservatism as the standard to which to hold the Republican Party. Mr. Trump\u2019s policies suggest that what he calls his \u201ccommon sense\u201d conservatism harks back to the principles and agenda of the old Republican Party, which reached its peak before the New Deal.In those days the party stood for protective tariffs, immigration tied to assimilation (or what Theodore Roosevelt called Americanization), judges prepared to strike down state and sometimes federal laws encroaching on constitutional limitations, tax cuts, internal improvements (infrastructure spending, in today\u2019s parlance) and a firm but restrained foreign policy tailored to the defense of the national interest. Are these not the main elements of Trump administration policies?It\u2019s not that Mr. Trump set out consciously to return the Republican Party to its roots. By temperament and style he\u2019s more attracted to President Andrew Jackson, whose portrait now hangs in the Oval Office. \u201cI\u2019m a fan,\u201d he said after visiting Jackson\u2019s home, the Hermitage, near Nashville, in March. It\u2019s more likely that his own independent reading of our situation led him to similar conclusions and to similar ways of thinking. The bread crumbs he dropped at the joint session pointed in that direction. President Trump quoted a well-known statement by Lincoln in 1847 that \u201cthe abandonment of the protective policy\u201d will \u201cproduce want and ruin among our people.\u201d Lincoln was a great protectionist before he became the great emancipator.But Mr. Trump could have as easily quoted McKinley\u2019s 1896 platform (protection is \u201cthe bulwark of American industrial independence and the foundation of American development and prosperity\u201d) or Coolidge\u2019s in 1924. Mr. Trump praised Dwight Eisenhower not for ending the Korean War, say, but for building \u201cthe last truly great national infrastructure program,\u201d the Interstate System of highways.The old Republican Party stretched from Lincoln to Herbert Hoover and continued to influence Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. It dominated national politics to an extent that the modern conservative Republican Party, forged during the Cold War, could only dream of: Between Lincoln\u2019s election in 1860 and Hoover\u2019s loss to Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, the party elected every president but two (Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson) and controlled both houses of Congress for about 46 of the 72 years. Those halcyon days coincided with a determined embrace of Trump-like policies. It helped, to be sure, that the Democrats spent those decades living down their shameful support of slavery, secession and Jim Crow.Yet President Trump cannot simply ignore the modern conservative movement. For one thing, its two great successes, victory in the Cold War and reigniting economic growth (through Ronald Reagan\u2019s tax cuts, spending policies and regulatory reforms), have made plausible his own visions of post-Cold War foreign policy and a resurgent economy. After those successes, however, modern conservatism mostly marked time and dreamed of limiting government. It had vain imaginings of how to build a conservative majority in the electorate, but nothing more.Mr. Trump offers a way out of the stalemate, toward electoral success and ideological renewal that begins with a return to former Republican policies that put Americans first, on trade, immigration, infrastructure and more, which are attractive to millions of working- and middle-class voters.The old Republican Party also had a sizable progressive or liberal wing. As his fondness for Jackson shows, Mr. Trump is more a populist than a progressive, but in any case he will be fighting mostly over the party\u2019s definition of conservatism, trying to stretch an orthodoxy, or a clutch of orthodoxies, to accommodate a governing majority. Nonetheless, he will have some room to reach to his left, or to the center, and could invoke Theodore Roosevelt as a model, without necessarily following T.R. on his later Progressive Party bender.America today is a very different country from what it was in the 1920s or the late 19th century, when Republicans reigned. So the Trump administration\u2019s policies will have to be a mixture of old and new. It\u2019s too early to tell whether this mixture will evolve into a doctrine of Trumpism. Few presidents\u2019 policies, principles and persona are so distinctive that they congeal into an \u201cism.\u201dThe movement that brought him to power is, by Mr. Trump\u2019s own admission, almost spontaneous and still strangely nameless. It cannot fill the thousands of executive branch positions at his disposal; for that, he needs to rely mainly on the broad conservative movement and the Republican Party.It\u2019s likely, then, that his administration will have to maneuver between the older and the current strains of conservatism, and between the populist and establishment sensibilities. On foreign policy he has demonstrated a pugnacity easily exceeding the old Republican Party\u2019s. Though he will move trade policy toward greater protection, he will fall far short of McKinley\u2019s standards.Donald Trump\u2019s populism may be protean, but look for it to move both conservatism and the Republican Party closer to their former selves.Charles R.

While the rally attracted large crowds, it failed to mobilize poor Venezuelans, whom Mr. Maduro\u2019s leftist movement says it represents.Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court, full of Maduro loyalists, removed all powers from the legislature, finding it in contempt and giving the judges authority to write laws.

{"Headline": "Amtrak Plans to Close Several Penn Station Tracks for Major Repairs", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byAmtrak officials confirmed on Thursday that they were planning to close several tracks at Pennsylvania Station in New York this summer for major repairs, but the railroad\u2019s chief executive refused to say how many tracks would be closed or for how long.A federal official who had been briefed on the plans said Amtrak was trying to limit the number of closings to about three or four tracks at once. Amtrak officials want to avoid the chaos that ensued this month when they closed eight of the station\u2019s 21 tracks after a derailment, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the railroad\u2019s plans publicly.On Thursday, Mr. Moorman said Amtrak wanted to consult with New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road, the other railroads that use the station, before disclosing details about the track closings.\u201cIt is our goal to cause the least amount of disruption in that station that we can,\u201d he said in a call with reporters. \u201cThere are going to be some tracks closed during some weekdays. It doesn\u2019t mean that there are going to be lots of tracks closed every weekday for extended periods of time, and part of our goal is to make sure that we minimize that.\u201dMr. Moorman said Amtrak would defer spending on technological improvements to pay for the accelerated replacement of tracks in the station, which he estimated would cost \u201ctens of millions of dollars.\u201d He also announced several proposals to improve operations and safety at Penn Station, including creating a joint operations center to coordinate responses to incidents.Penn Station, North America\u2019s busiest train station, handles 600,000 passengers and 1,300 trains daily and is a major nexus in the busiest rail corridor in the nation. Closing several tracks is expected to disrupt service on all of the railroads that use the station.New Jersey officials reserved judgment on Amtrak\u2019s plan on Thursday, saying they awaited the details to gauge the potential effects on the state\u2019s commuters and its economy.Gov. Chris Christie, who had threatened to withhold payments to Amtrak for New Jersey Transit\u2019s use of Penn Station and other assets, said on Thursday: \u201cI\u2019m not happy that it should\u2019ve been done a long time ago and they didn\u2019t do it. But they\u2019re doing it now, and that\u2019s going to be good for the commuting public over the course of the next couple of years when these improvements are made and service becomes more reliable.\u201dMr. Christie said that Amtrak\u2019s admission proved that the recent troubles at Penn Station were \u201cpredominantly Amtrak issues\u201d and that he had been right to call Amtrak to account for them. \u201cNow this doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t times where New Jersey Transit makes mistakes,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cOf course they do.\u201dSteven H. Santoro, the executive director of New Jersey Transit, said in Trenton on Thursday that it was imperative that his agency have a chance to review Amtrak\u2019s plan to determine what impact it might have on New Jersey\u2019s commuters and economy. He also said that New Jersey was demanding \u201ca much greater voice\u201d in how Amtrak dispatches trains into and out of Penn Station and how it spends money on repairs and improvements.Mr. Santoro was scheduled to return to the Statehouse in Trenton on Friday to testify at a legislative committee hearing on the recent disruptions. Mr. Moorman and other rail officials were also scheduled to answer questions at that hearing.On Wednesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York called Penn Station a \u201cdebacle\u201d and said he had lost patience with Amtrak.\u201cI wish, frankly, that we controlled Penn Station,\u201d Mr. Cuomo told reporters. \u201cIt would be a much different situation.\u201dOfficials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the Long Island Rail Road, took a more measured tone at a board meeting on Wednesday. Fernando Ferrer, the acting chairman of the authority, said he had made it clear to Amtrak that Penn Station had to improve.\u201cWe\u2019d like to work collaboratively,\u201d Mr. Ferrer said. \u201cIt\u2019s in everybody\u2019s best interest.\u201dAmtrak also announced that Thomas F. Prendergast, the former chairman of the M.T.A., would oversee a review of operations at Penn Station. Mr. Prendergast, who left the authority in January and is widely respected in the transportation industry, will make recommendations about how the three railroads can improve coordination at the station, Amtrak said.On April 14, chaos erupted in Penn Station after false reports of gunfire. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said the incident had exposed security flaws at the station, and he called for Amtrak to create a centralized command center for police officers from different agencies.\u201cThe next Penn panic could be an actual disaster,\u201d Mr. Schumer, the minority leader, said at a news conference on Sunday. \u201cNot just a wake-up call.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The touch screen interface with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is well executed. Chevy Cruze wins the interior ambience contest, but Impreza finally loses the penalty box vibe.Let\u2019s not forget that the Cruze plus the Honda Civic, the Hyundai Elantra, the Toyota Corolla and the rest of this segment lack Impreza\u2019s standard all-wheel drive. Another Subaru advantage is the Boxer engine. Most engine pistons fire vertically; Boxer power plants pump in horizontal fashion. That allows the 2-liter 4-cylinder to lie deep in the engine bay for a low center of gravity. Subaru happily points out that Porsche takes this approach in its sports cars. Porsche does not reciprocate.With 152 horsepower and 145 pound-feet of torque, the Sport gets no additional power, but the suspension is upgraded with shock-absorbing Stablex dampers. The Sport\u2019s rear spoiler, red dashboard stitching, aluminum pedal covers and obviously faux carbon fiber trim create an impression of power that the engine can\u2019t deliver. Accelerating from a stoplight to 60 miles an hour takes about 9 seconds. A WRX this is not.The tested continuously variable transmission, an $800 option, generally mimics the feel of a 7-speed automatic unless the throttle is mashed against the carpet. Then, the usual gliding dynamic comes into play. Tug at the steering wheel paddle shifters and simulated gearshifts are convincing.The Sport model gets active torque vectoring. Bend into turns and the outer front wheel gets more power, giving the Impreza a more natural feel though the arc. Most cars achieve this by pulsing the inner rear brake.Add up the torque vectoring, suspension and the low center of gravity provided by the Boxer engine and the Sport is a fine companion on twisty roads. It\u2019s up there with Honda Civic Sport and Volkswagen Golf. Impreza provokes grins, even on those suffering from seasonal affective disorder after a long winter. It\u2019s moderately quiet, too.My car was equipped with a $2,945 package that included Subaru\u2019s EyeSight tech. Employing two cameras mounted near the rearview mirror, it provides Impreza with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning and blind-spot monitoring. Use the auto braking once and the investment is sound. And even if the braking never saves you, the package includes a respectable Harman Kardon sound system and a sunroof.All-wheel drive cuts into fuel economy. The Civic averages six miles per gallon more than the Impreza. In mixed driving, I saw 28 miles per gallon against the Environmental Protection Agency rating of 27 city, 36 highway.Complaints? Arguably, more seat side bolstering should come on a Sport branded car. The HVAC system lacks an automatic temperature setting. And while the price point explains the absence of a heated steering wheel, it would be perfect for Subaru drivers. Am I right or am I right?Impreza\u2019s back seat will welcome two adults with good foot, leg, knee and headroom. It\u2019s a basic space, though, lacking adjustable air vents, a power port, folding center armrest and a pocket on the back of the driver\u2019s chair.The sedan\u2019s trunk can take on a bike after dropping the 60/40 split seats. But really, the hatchback model, with its wide opening, is far better at that. You should know that the second-generation Crosstrek, essentially the Impreza hatchback with rugged body cladding and additional ground clearance, will be heading into showrooms soon. The scalable platform that Impreza rides on will also carry the new three-row Ascent sport utility vehicle in early 2018.The new Impreza is a solid effort by Subaru to add style and refinement to a car loved by loyalists. And with its sales increasing every year since 2007, the company is attracting new fans at a steady rate. Impreza is a smart proposition that looks even better on a stormy day.Advertisement"}

His father sent him to Nairobi, Kenya, where he began his career sweeping floors in his uncle\u2019s accounting office. In turn, his children moved, to America, to England, to Australia. In the 1970s my father stood for nine hours a day at the Diamond Dealers Club on West 47th Street in Manhattan because he couldn\u2019t afford an office. My grandfather\u2019s descendants are doctors, lawyers, public servants, corporate executives all over the world. Mobility is survival.If you were to believe President Trump, and even some supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, you would think that this is because every American has a divine right to a well-paid job in his own country.The 20th century was the American century; the 21st, not so much. A young person in Denmark or New Zealand has a better quality of life than a young person in the United States. There you can go to college free, not have to worry about money when you\u2019re sick, and enjoy two months\u2019 vacation even if you\u2019re only an intern. Partly this is due to the significant underinvestment by the government in education, health care and the arts, which has left sections of the United States looking like postwar Europe.Critics say this kind of globalization is only for the elite, those lucky and wealthy enough to have been educated at the best schools. But it\u2019s not just jobs requiring a college degree that Americans should consider doing overseas. A 150-peso-an-hour job in an automobile plant in Aguascalientes, Mexico, isn\u2019t the same as a $40-an-hour union job in Detroit; but you will live much better than if you made $8 an hour slinging burgers in Scranton, Pa. Maybe, instead of building a wall, President Trump should be demanding that Mexico open up its labor market to Americans.I certainly understand why Americans might be attached to their house, their friends and family, their home country. I\u2019ve made New York my home, the last home for those who have no other. The United States is a beautiful country, a safe country and, for most people, a comfortable country. It\u2019s true that we should fight for better-paying jobs at home; companies move jobs abroad so they can pay workers less, in countries with looser environmental and labor laws.But American jobs are disappearing not because they\u2019re moving to Mexico or China; it\u2019s because they are increasingly being done by robots. What we need is not tariffs, but training. We also need to gently teach our children: You might prefer to stay in the house you were born in all your life, but it\u2019s not a constitutional right.My family had to move because there was no future in rural Gujarat; 200 years of British colonialism had left the Indian economy in ruins. When we moved, we missed our vegetarian food, our family, the trees, the rivers and our language. Some of it we could take with us; some of it we couldn\u2019t. We returned to Gujarat when we could.Americans are more fortunate; the whole world looks like America now. Americans who emigrate don\u2019t have to go without cheeseburgers, \u201cSeinfeld\u201d or the English language.So go forth into the world with confidence, young American! Don\u2019t believe Mr. Trump\u2019s defeatist talk of \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d Americans have a spirit of enterprise, efficiency and honesty that is unparalleled in the world.

In India, their salaries can buy them an apartment, nice dinners, domestic help. Most of their peers in New York are still struggling in unpaid internships and have to be supported by loans or parents.For my college-going sons, there is no guarantee that there will be a job waiting after graduation in America. But they have already worked, with confidence, in Brazil and Indonesia. Growing up in New York has made them comfortable with the idea of living anywhere in the world.

China would almost certainly intervene, setting up a fraught confrontation with the United States. Without collaboration with Beijing, Washington could not achieve a surgical strike to eliminate Mr. Kim or his nuclear arsenal.The Trump administration has some leverage in making a deal with Beijing, which also has compelling reasons to work with the United States on hastening the end of the North Korean regime.First, a unilateral strike by the United States would be likely to drag China into the struggle anyway. Preparation and joint action would allow Beijing to protect its interests. With Mr. Kim out of the picture, Beijing would be free from the constant worry that the unpredictable Mr. Kim could set off a wider war in East Asia.Third, China could insist that United States military personnel leave a newly united Korean Peninsula, and that the united Korea be permanently neutral, like Austria after the withdrawal of Soviet and Western troops in 1955. American troops will not leave South Korea as long as Mr. Kim remains in power.Ideally, both Washington and Beijing would pledge aid to assist Seoul in the mammoth task of rebuilding the threadbare North Korean economy.It is easy enough to list the benefits to China and the United States of ending the Kim dynasty. Achieving a level of trust between the two rivals, capable of sustaining so momentous a joint operation, would be far more difficult.Washington and Beijing could start with agreements on other thorny problems. Mr. Trump would have to moderate his trade policy demands. Mr. Xi would have to acknowledge other nations\u2019 right to freely pass through the South China Sea and end China\u2019s militarization of the various islets there.But even if Mr. Xi were open to a Chinese role in taking down the North Korean state \u2014 and on balance, autocrats are not risk-takers \u2014 there are forces at home tying his hands for the immediate future. Mr. Xi appears to have no serious rivals for power, but cooperating with the United States could embolden potential detractors who see Washington as the enemy, especially if the cooperation ended in failure.The Chinese Communist Party will hold its 19th Congress this fall, and Mr. Xi is expected to consolidate his leadership by installing his closest supporters in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. Action against North Korea before then would be politically too risky for him.If Mr. Trump has any plan to enlist Mr. Xi to help bring down Kim Jong-un, he will have to wait. In the meantime, there would be much to negotiate and to plan to ensure that a strike against the North Korean regime and its weapons of mass destruction is foolproof.Roderick MacFarquhar, a research professor of history and political science at Harvard, is a co-author of \u201cMao\u2019s Last Revolution.\u201dThis article has been updated to reflect news developments.

{"Headline": "To Help Tackle Inequality, Remember the Advantages You\u2019ve Had", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewBut there is far less agreement on how to achieve that goal. Do we need to level the playing field so that people born to modest circumstances have a better chance? Should we be trying to instill a stronger work ethic in the United States, and build a more robust culture of hard work? Counterproductive and, at times, bitter arguments bog down the search for solutions.One metaphor is well represented, both in our imaginations and in our iconography, while the other is neglected.This asymmetry reflects a deeper psychological bias: We tend to remember the obstacles we have overcome more vividly than the advantages we have been given.This bias is embedded in our day-to-day lives. Most of our time and energy goes toward overcoming the challenges immediately in front of us. Headwinds demand attention because they must be overcome. Tailwinds may evoke a momentary sense of well-being and gratitude; but primarily, they free us to focus elsewhere, on challenges that must be overcome.Mr. Davidai and Mr. Gilovich show some of the broader social and political consequences of this psychological asymmetry. They find, for example, that both Democrats and Republicans believe that electoral maps are not apportioned to their advantage. The scholars also find that, within families, people tend to think their parents were tougher on them than their siblings recognize.Of course, we don\u2019t really know what is going on inside everyone\u2019s mind, but it does appear that many of us overrepresent the obstacles we face.In many autobiographies, for example, even fortunate people, born to rich, loving families, look back on life and remember all the things that stood in their way. Not only do we play the starring role in our own life stories, but those stories often revolve around struggle.I see this tendency in myself. When it comes to education, I have won not just one but several birth lotteries: Many children born next to me in rural India struggled to obtain anything beyond simple primary education and maybe a decent high school. Yet I had some of the best educational resources placed right in front of me all the way through my doctorate at Harvard.I would be foolish if I did not remind myself of these advantages every day. Yet it is telling that I do need to remind myself. My spontaneous thoughts are of the challenges I faced, not the advantages I had.This cognitive bias, I think, sheds light on persistent disagreements over inequality and opportunity that affect many of us in American society.When we see our own past in terms of the headwinds we managed to overcome, it is easy to attribute the failure of others to a lack of perseverance. When poor children drop out of high school, someone who complains that these children don\u2019t have an adequate work ethic may be remembering educational hurdles that she managed to surmount early in her own life.We often disagree over the source of our success: Those who emphasize the existence of birth lotteries point to the easy ride the well-off have had. Yet relatively privileged people may look at their own lives and feel, \u201cI\u2019ve struggled too.\u201dDuring these months, richer children benefit from summer programs and books around the house, and, more broadly, from the myriad advantages of having parents with the resources, knowledge and time to intellectually engage them. Even conversation around the dinner table can be a tailwind.From a public policy perspective, it may be easier to agree on creating tailwinds than on removing headwinds. Even people who take great pride in having gotten ahead through hard work can, if prompted and upon reflection, recognize the tailwinds that helped them. This recognition does not detract from their genuine effort. Instead, it can be a moment to be thankful, perhaps for a family member who believed in you, or an unexpected piece of good fortune at just the right time.By focusing on tailwinds, we can sidestep potential disagreements about the role of personal responsibility and initiative. Even with a tailwind, hard work is still needed; that work just yields more reward. A summer scholarship is not a substitute for serious effort.We could garner support for such programs by asking people to remember the tailwinds in their past: It is a small step from gratitude for one\u2019s blessings to the realization that everyone can use a little help, the poor most of all.Advertisement"}

Zsofi, a young girl, has just arrived in a new school, and she is excited by the opportunity to sing in its award-winning school choir. Erika, the music teacher, permits Zsofi to join but asks her to open her mouth without singing because she is not yet sufficiently skilled.Zsofi agrees. But when her best friend learns of this deal, she confronts the teacher, who says that it was in everybody\u2019s interest that only the best sing; the choir is competing for a trip to Sweden. As it turns out, Zsofi is not the only choir member Erika has silenced. Allowing only a few, talented students to sing is the teacher\u2019s winning strategy. However, Zsofi and her friends are not willing to be party to it. The day of the competition, all the students open their mouths without singing a note. They begin singing in earnest only when an ashamed Erika bolts from the stage.The 2008 financial crisis partly explains the spread of illiberal democracies in Central Europe. Economically damaged by the crisis and restrained by European Union strictures from financing efforts to jump-start their struggling national economies, ruling parties have focused on controlling the news media as a way to shore up power. If Italy\u2019s Silvio Berlusconi was a model of using a media empire to build political power, in Central Europe governing parties use political power to build media empires.The model has been quite simple: The government concocts schemes to channel public or European Union money to the owners of the \u201cfriendly\u201d media groups that side with the government and attack its critics. Those media organizations that are critical of the government don\u2019t get its money.But the model of a corruption-managed democracy creates problems of its own.In societies where political leaders fear that losing elections could result in jail time, any expression of weakness is noticedand any public initiative is viewed suspiciously. So the only outlet for citizens\u2019 voices is taking to the streets. That is why all over Central Europe, the young are loudly protesting.Most of these protesters are young \u2014 some quite so. They have no common ideology, only frustration and anger. It would be wrong to romanticize them too much, but it\u2019s safe to say that unlike older generations, they are dead-set against standing onstage and opening their mouths in some vain hope of winning modest social benefits. They want to sing. (What they want to sing we cannot exactly be sure.)But while ignoring the demands of the youth appears to be a promising electoral stratagem \u2014 it is easier to play on the fears of the old generations than to satisfy the hopes of the younger ones \u2014 it is ultimately self-defeating both socially and economically.

{"Headline": "When Solar Panels Became Job Killers", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported byWUHAN, China \u2014 Russell Abney raised two children on solar power. The 49-year-old Georgia Tech graduate worked for the last decade in Perrysburg, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo, pulling a good salary as an equipment engineer for the largest American solar-panel maker.On the other side of the world, Gao Song boasted his own solar success story. A former organic fruit retailer who lives in the dusty Chinese city of Wuhan, he installed solar panels on his roof four years ago and found it so lucrative that he went into business installing them for others. By last summer, he and a team of 50 employees were installing solar-panel systems on nearly 100 roofs a month.Then China shook the global solar business \u2014 and transformed both their lives.\u201cA small vibration back in China,\u201d said Frank Haugwitz, a longtime solar industry consultant in Beijing, \u201ccan cause an avalanche in prices around the world.\u201dLate last summer, Chinese officials began publicly toying with slashing the subsidies they offer domestic solar-panel buyers. Mr. Gao\u2019s business dried up, and he laid off half his workers. \u201cI have been working hard and was just off to a good start,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have to start over.\u201dChina\u2019s solar-panel makers cut their prices by more than a quarter to compensate, sending global prices plummeting. Western companies found themselves unable to compete, and cut jobs from Germany to Michigan to Texas and points beyond.Those points included Perrysburg \u2014 where Mr. Abney and about 450 other employees suddenly found themselves out of work. \u201cWithin just a few months, it all came crashing down,\u201d Mr. Abney said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a death in the family. People feel awkward talking about it.\u201dPresident Trump, who pressed President Xi Jinping of China on trade and other issues this week when they met at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., has vowed to end what he calls China\u2019s unfair business practices. Much of his oratory has involved old-fashioned smokestack industries like steel \u2014 industries in which the jobs were already disappearing even before the rise of China.But economists and business groups warn that China\u2019s industrial ambitions have entered a new, far-reaching phase. With its deep government pockets, growing technical sophistication and a comprehensive plan to free itself from dependence on foreign companies, China aims to become dominant in industries of the future like renewable energy, big data and self-driving cars.With solar, it has already happened. China is now home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s solar-production capacity. The efficiency with which its products convert sunlight into electricity is increasingly close to that of panels made by American, German and South Korean companies. Because China also buys half of the world\u2019s new solar panels, it now effectively controls the market.For much of the past century, the ups and downs of the American economy could spell the difference between employment or poverty for people like Chilean copper miners and Malaysian rubber farmers. Now China\u2019s policy shifts and business decisions can have the same kind of global impact once wielded by power brokers in Washington, New York and Detroit.The story of China\u2019s rise in solar panels illustrates the profound difficulties the country presents to Mr. Trump, or to any American president. Its size and fast-moving economy give it the ability to redefine industries almost on a dime. Its government-led pursuit of dominance in crucial industries presents a direct challenge to countries where leaders generally leave business decisions to the businesses themselves.Already, China is the world\u2019s largest maker and buyer of steel, cars and smartphones. While it does not necessarily dominate those industries, its government ministries are moving to replicate that success with robots, chips and software \u2014 just as in solar.Chinese panel makers \u201chave the capital, they have the technology, they have the scale,\u201d said Ocean Yuan, the chief executive of Grape Solar, a distributor of solar panels based in Eugene, Ore. Of American rivals, he said, \u201cthey will crush them.\u201dBefore he became one of the solar industry\u2019s most powerful players, Liu Hanyuan raised fish.According to Mr. Liu\u2019s authorized biography, he faced local criticism at first for his early embrace of capitalism, and responded by saying that his fish feed was an improved product that followed Deng\u2019s dictum. \u201cWhen my business grows bigger,\u201d he said at the time, \u201cI will build another floor for labs.\u201dPlans to shift into computer chips did not pan out, so by 2006, he shifted to solar technology, after taking control of a company that made chemicals for the production of polysilicon, the crystalline raw material for solar panels. That move proved fortunate: China was just then embarking on a concerted effort to become a solar-industry powerhouse.With ample assistance, China\u2019s solar-power production capacity expanded more than tenfold from 2007 to 2012. Now six of the top 10 solar-panel makers are Chinese, including the top two, compared with none a decade ago. The solar division of Mr. Liu\u2019s company, the Tongwei Group, which discloses few financial details, is one of the fastest-expanding players in the industry.That growth forced many American and European solar-panel manufacturers into a headlong retreat. Two dozen of them filed for bankruptcy or cut back operations during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, damaging the heady optimism then about clean energy.In 2012 and 2013, the United States and the European Union concluded that Chinese solar-panel makers were collecting government subsidies and dumping panels, or selling them for less than the cost of producing and shipping them. Both imposed import limits. Chinese manufacturers and officials denied improper subsidies and dumping, and still do.Several large Chinese manufacturers that had previously overexpanded and had been selling at heavy losses for years then closed their doors. But Western solar companies say Chinese banks still lent heavily to the survivors despite low loan-recovery rates from the defaults of big Chinese solar companies like Suntech, Chaori and LDK Solar.\u201cThe main subsidy is massive, below-market loans by Chinese state-owned commercial banks to finance new capacity and also the massive ongoing losses of Chinese companies,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Stein, the president of American operations for SolarWorld, a big German panel maker.Li Junfeng, a top architect of China\u2019s renewable-energy policies until he retired from that responsibility in early January, said that the West had exaggerated the role of the state in helping to finance Chinese solar-panel manufacturers. \u201cThe market can decide for itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good companies can get money, the bad companies cannot.\u201dLike the Chinese solar industry as a whole, Tongwei is thinking bigger.Mr. Liu\u2019s company bought an enormous solar-panel manufacturing complex in central China in 2013 from LDK Solar, which had run into severe financial difficulties. Now it plans to build factories of five gigawatts apiece in the Chinese cities of Chengdu and Hefei. By comparison, the entire global market is only about 77 gigawatts each year, while world capacity is 139 gigawatts.At the same time, Mr. Liu is dismissive of companies in the West that pioneered many solar technologies but have lost their market shares to China. \u201cThey are very jealous,\u201d he said, \u201cand cannot catch up with China\u2019s pace.\u201dFrom an environmental standpoint, China\u2019s solar push has been good for the world. Solar-panel prices have fallen close to 90 percent over the past decade. Many of the solar panels in America\u2019s backyards and solar power plants are made by Chinese companies.But for the solar industry, Chinese expansion could mean an extended period of low prices and cutbacks for everybody else.\u201cThe solar industry is facing again, I would say, a new winter,\u201d said Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, the chairman and chief executive of Total, the French oil and gas giant, which owns a controlling stake in SunPower, an American solar-panel maker.China now hopes to replicate its solar industry\u2019s growth in other areas.American and European business groups have warned that the China 2025 plan means that a much wider range of Western businesses will face the same kind of government-backed competition that has already transformed the solar industry.\u201cThe policies started in solar and are now starting to infect the higher reaches of the economy with Made in China 2025,\u201d said Jeremie Waterman, the president of the China Center at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington.In the end, China did not slash subsidies for rooftop solar panels, and cut them only slightly for large power-plant arrays. But prices barely rebounded from last year\u2019s slump.Mr. Gao, of Wuhan, is a slender 37-year-old whose dark hair is already thinning. He said that his business had depended not on homeowners but on profit-minded investors who made use of the subsidies.The investors would pay three-fifths of the cost of a homeowner\u2019s system. The homeowner would take only enough electricity from the panels to power the home. The investor would sell the rest of the electricity to the grid at a high, government-assisted price.The suggestion that the government might cut the subsidy, even though the government did not follow through on it, panicked his investors. So they stopped financing further deals.\u201cThey fear that the year after next, they may have nothing,\u201d he said. He recently hired four more employees to drum up sales, even as installations creep along at a small fraction of demand a year ago.In Perrysburg, Mr. Abney lost his job at First Solar, the largest solar-panel manufacturer based in the United States, and looked in vain for a job in the auto industry in the Toledo area.

{"Headline": "Scientists, Feeling Under Siege, March Against Trump Policies", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Thousands of scientists and their supporters, feeling increasingly threatened by the policies of President Trump, gathered Saturday in Washington under rainy skies for what they called the March for Science, abandoning a tradition of keeping the sciences out of politics and calling on the public to stand up for scientific enterprise.As the marchers trekked shoulder-to-shoulder toward the Capitol, the street echoed with their calls: \u201cSave the E.P.A.\u201d and \u201cSave the N.I.H.\u201d as well as their chants celebrating science, \u201cWho run the world? Nerds,\u201d and \u201cIf you like beer, thank yeast and scientists!\u201d Some carried signs that showed rising oceans and polar bears in peril and faces of famous scientists like Mae Jemison, Rosalind Franklin and Marie Curie, and others touted a checklist of the diseases Americans no longer get thanks to vaccines.Although drizzle may have washed away the words on some signs, they aimed to deliver the message that science needs the public\u2019s support.\u201cScience is a very human thing,\u201d said Ashlea Morgan, a doctoral student in neurobiology at Columbia University. \u201cThe march is allowing the public to know that this is what science is, and it\u2019s letting our legislators know that science is vitally important.\u201dThe March for Science evolved from a social media campaign into an effort to get people onto the streets.Its organizers were motivated by Mr. Trump, who as a presidential candidate disparaged climate change as a hoax and cast suspicions on the safety of vaccines.While traveling by motorcade to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Saturday, Mr. Trump passed dozens of demonstrators from the march holding signs, including one that said, \u201cStop denying the earth is dying,\u201d according to a pool report. Later, the White House released a statement from Mr. Trump for Earth Day that did not mention the March for Science by name, but appeared directed at its participants. Calling science critical to economic growth and environmental protection, he said, \u201cMy administration is committed to advancing scientific research that leads to a better understanding of our environment and of environmental risks.\u201d\u201cAs we do so, we should remember that rigorous science depends not on ideology, but on a spirit of honest inquiry and robust debate,\u201d he added.Organizers said they hoped the day\u2019s demonstrations result in sustained, coordinated action aimed at persuading elected officials to adopt policies consistent with the scientific consensus on climate change, vaccines and other issues.\u201cThis has been a living laboratory as scientists and science institutions are willing to take a step outside their comfort zone, outside of the labs and into the public spheres,\u201d said Beka Economopoulos, a founder of the pop-up Natural History Museum and an organizer of the march.Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician who helped expose lead poisoning in Flint, Mich., and who spoke in Washington, called the protest the beginning of a movement to ensure that governments do not dismiss or deny science.\u201cIf we want to prevent future Flints, we need to embrace what we\u2019ve learned and how far we\u2019ve come in terms of science and technology,\u201d Dr. Hanna-Attisha said in an interview.What began as a movement by scientists for scientists has drawn in many science enthusiasts, young and old.William Harrison, 9, from Washington, held up a waterlogged cardboard sign he drew with markers of a shark pleading with humanity to save him from global warming. He said science is important because without it, \u201cwe basically will not exist.\u201dOn the West Coast, Penelope DeVries, 69, carried a sign at the march in San Francisco that said, \u201cLove your mother,\u201d with a blue and green Earth, the paint still wet from when she made it on her kitchen floor.\u201cI have three grandchildren, and I want them to have a beautiful life like I have,\u201d she said.She was one of thousands of upbeat demonstrators who marched through the city\u2019s downtown under mild weather.A volunteer at that march, Bryan Dunyak, 28, was motivated to help improve science outreach and improve public understanding of science.\u201cThe vast majority of people will never have the chance to ask a scientist, \u2018Why do you do what you do?\u2019\u201d said Dr. Dunyak, who is a postdoctoral researcher in neurodegenerative disease at the University of California, San Francisco.Fearing that Mr. Trump may undermine public support for the sciences, many scientists at the marches said they believed now was the appropriate moment to express themselves politically.Dr. Oreskes said the closest parallel to Saturday\u2019s protests were the demonstrations for nuclear disarmament in the 1950s and \u201960s. But scientists were then marching against the use of science to build weapons of mass destruction.Thousands converged on the Boston Common in a cold rain, and children danced to a brass band. Students from Harvard and M.I.T. marched over the bridge from Cambridge, and a contingent from Boston University chanted, \u201cWhat do we want? Science! When do we want it? After peer review!\u201dIn a city and state where many work in hospitals and biomedical firms, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals to cut the National Institutes of Health\u2019s budget were on the minds of many marchers there.Dr. George Q. Daley, the dean of Harvard Medical School, said in a speech that the proposed cuts would have a \u201ccataclysmic effect\u201d on the economy in Massachusetts.\u201cThis is a shortsighted decision that will set the biomedical enterprise on a path toward devastation,\u201d Dr. Daley said.Julian Arthur, a product scientist who works on antibody production, agreed.\u201cI feel that science funding should not be up to the whims of a frugal government,\u201d he said.In New York, demonstrators stretched for 10 blocks along Central Park West, wedged between the park and a line of buildings on a gray and dreary day.Underlining the connection in the minds of many marchers between the science march, Earth Day and global warming, one participant, Christine Negra, 49, a chemist who works as a consultant on climate change issues, said she would attend next week\u2019s People\u2019s Climate March, too.\u201cIn the U.S., we\u2019re lagging in our recognition about how important climate change is,\u201d she said. \u201cThese public events are meant to shake people out of their daily lives so that people see how urgent the problem really is.\u201dMany messages at the New York rally took on a political hue. One demonstrator carried a sign with a diagram. \u201cBefore you dismiss science, Mr. President,\u201d it said, \u201chere is the molecular formula for hair spray.\u201d Another said, \u201cFund science, not walls.\u201d And along the marching route, some were heard chanting, \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go,\u201d as they passed the Trump International Hotel and Tower at Columbus Circle.For many marchers, especially those in the sciences who were demonstrating for the first time, political settings can be a source of discomfort. And critics of the march who are in the sciences expressed concern that such displays could be damaging.Although Dr. Young planned to support friends at a satellite demonstration, he said it would be easy for conservatives to say the march was really about supporting liberal policies.\u201cGoing to a march is easy,\u201d he said. \u201cSpending the next couple of years reinventing how we communicate with red-state America, that\u2019s hard.\u201dIn energy-rich Oklahoma, the home state of Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. chief who repeatedly sued the agency when he was the state\u2019s attorney general, a crowd estimated at more than 2,000 by law enforcement officials chanted \u201cscience is real.\u201dThe demonstrators gathered on a stone plaza before the State Capitol, which is fenced and scaffolded for renovation. They marched on a route that took them around a park that includes two restored oil derricks that once pumped oil from a source beneath the Capitol.Many at the Oklahoma City march seemed motivated by local issues. Lisa Pitts, a teacher, said she was marching because of concerns about the state\u2019s education budget and to support science education.\u201cWe are not a poor state,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should not be 50th in everything.\u201dBut concerns about the country\u2019s direction under Mr. Trump were present there, too.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to having dirty air and water,\u201d said Rene Roy, who formerly worked for the state\u2019s environmental regulator and was concerned about Mr. Pruitt\u2019s plans for the E.P.A.Back in Washington, Denis Hayes, who was the principal organizer of the first Earth Day in 1970, said concerns like Mr. Roy\u2019s were an important source of motivation for the science march, which was coordinated with the Earth Day Network.\u201cYou have a clear enemy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a president who along with his vice president, his cabinet and his party leadership in both houses of Congress have a strong anti-environmental agenda. He\u2019s basically trying to roll back everything that we\u2019ve tried to do in the last half-century.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly described when the White House put out a statement for Earth Day. It was after President Trump\u2019s motorcade left the White House, not before.An article on Sunday about the March for Science misspelled, in some copies, the surname of an astronaut whose picture was featured on some of the posters carried by marchers. She is Mae Jemison, not Jamison.Reporting was contributed by Emily Baumgaertner from Washington, Emily Palmer from New York, Ben Fenwick from Oklahoma City, Jess Bidgood from Boston and Stacey Solie from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Choice of Pro-Immigration Economic Adviser Riles Trump\u2019s Base", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The choice by President Trump of a pro-immigration economist to lead his Council of Economic Advisers is stirring a backlash among his most ardent supporters, who worry it is an abandonment of the tough stance he took on the issue during the campaign and the latest in a string of broken promises.To these supporters, the appointment of Kevin A. Hassett, announced late last Friday afternoon, as Mr. Trump\u2019s top White House economist is another sign that the president is succumbing to the swamp he promised to drain.Mr. Hassett, who currently works at the American Enterprise Institute, is a widely respected conservative economist who previously advised prominent Republicans like Senator John McCain and Mitt Romney.But for those who backed Mr. Trump because of his promises to build a wall and deport illegal immigrants, such notions are heresy.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.\u201cIt would be nice, considering how important the immigration issue has been to Trump, to have gotten an economist to this position who was at least not a booster for higher immigration,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigration think tank.Some leaders of the white nationalist \u201calt-right\u201d movement also interpreted the move as a sellout. \u201cThis is yet another betrayal, just like breaking his promise to deport all illegal immigrants and to repeal President Obama\u2019s executive amnesties,\u201d said Jared Taylor, the editor of the online magazine American Renaissance, who spoke highly of Mr. Trump during the campaign.Mr. Taylor said the choice of Mr. Hassett, combined with the recent airstrikes in Syria, made it \u201cvery hard to believe anything he says.\u201dSuch pronouncements amplified voices within the Republican Party that have been fearful about both illegal and legal immigration. Last month, Representative Steve King, an Iowa Republican who is a strong supporter of Mr. Trump, caused an uproar when he said, \u201cYou cannot rebuild your civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies.\u201dSome Republicans in the Senate, including Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, have also been focusing on limiting legal immigration. Mr. Cotton has proposed legislation that would narrow the scope of the permanent resident green card system and reduce access to visas.On Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to the border with Mexico and laid out a tougher approach the administration will be taking with people who sneak into the country. Those measures include federal prosecutions.But despite his tough tone as a candidate, Mr. Trump has shown some signs of moderation as president. He said he welcomed immigrants who love the country and bring valuable skills and strong work ethics. And he has yet to unravel President Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for the so-called Dreamers, as Mr. Krikorian ruefully noted.Economists who have been wary of the recent wave of anti-immigrant sentiment are hopeful that Mr. Hassett will be an influential voice in the administration to encourage a more welcoming approach.\u201cImmigration is really not a debatable issue,\u201d said James Miller, who led President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Office of Management and Budget and signed the letter. \u201cImmigration is a good idea if you control it the right way.\u201dMr. Hassett declined an interview request after his appointment was announced. A White House spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters, dismissed the negative reaction, pointing to his decades of experience in economics, and said, \u201cThe president is confident he will work tirelessly to improve the economy for all Americans and looks forward to welcoming him onboard following his confirmation.\u201dIt remains unclear, however, how much influence Mr. Hassett will actually have. Mr. Trump broke with recent tradition and removed the council\u2019s chairman from a cabinet-level position. He has also expressed skepticism about economics in the past by casting doubt on official government employment statistics and expert opinions about the health of the economy.For those reasons, some who have been critical of Mr. Trump are tempering their optimism about Mr. Hassett.\u201cHe might be a sign of some stability, but no one knows if the president is going to listen to him, so it\u2019s premature to say it is encouraging,\u201d said Austan Goolsbee, who was chairman of Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cRegarding his critics, there is not a single reputable economist they could find in either party that would support their worldview.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of President Trump\u2019s chief strategist. He is Stephen K. Bannon, not Steven.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: A Blueprint for Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported by\u2022 The 15 percent business tax rate will apply not just to corporations, but also to companies that pay taxes through the personal income tax code \u2014 including mom-and-pop businesses (and Mr. Trump\u2019s own real estate empire) \u2014 according to people briefed on the proposal.\u2022 There will be a bigger standard deduction for individuals \u2014 a modest cut for middle-income people that would also simplify the process of filing tax returns. But this is problematic for home builders and real estate agents, who worry about it diminishing the importance of mortgage interest deduction.What\u2019s not included?\u2022 As of Tuesday, there was no $1 trillion infrastructure program, two of the people briefed on the proposal said.\u2022 There was also no border adjustment tax to offset the cost of the tax cuts.The final plans remained in flux as late as midafternoon Tuesday.The biggest unknown? How will it be paid for. The plan puts off the closing of loopholes and other tax increases that could limit the impact on the budget deficit.But the business world has its concerns.The government\u2019s initial report on the economy\u2019s first-quarter performance is due on Friday and it is expected to be weak. And even if the tax overhaul goes through Congress and corporate profits boom, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean economic performance will improve.\u201cIt\u2019s more about closing loopholes than reducing rates because if you just go to 15 percent, you\u2019re going to leave a large hole in the federal budget,\u201d said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago, warning that long-term prospects would be undermined if they were not accompanied by policies leading to faster economic growth.Credit Suisse made a profit of 596 million Swiss francs, or about $599 million, in the first quarter, compared to a loss of 302 million francs a year earlier.\u201cFresh blood is needed to ensure that the board has sufficient independence.

{"Headline": "Lafarge Scandal Points to Difficulty for Businesses in War Zones", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 As Syria began to descend into a bloody civil war, a cement plant in the embattled northeast run by one of France\u2019s largest industrial companies was operating at full speed.While fighting among Syrian rebels, the Syrian army and the Islamic State drove other foreign companies out of the country, the plant, operated by Lafarge S.A., was curiously able to tough it out for years: From its opening in 2010 through to 2014, cement continued to pour from its mills in Jalabiyeh, a town near the Turkish border.The Lafarge scandal, as it became known in the French media, stoked ire among critics who accused the company of seeking to improve profitability despite growing danger for its employees. The situation underscores the difficulty of doing business in war-torn regions. The company has argued that its local managers saw little recourse other than paying off armed groups to guarantee the safety of staff members and keep the plant running in the midst of a worsening conflict.But it is a challenge faced by companies around the world, particularly those working in the energy and industrial sectors. They often grapple with large investments required to get operations running and an inability to pick and choose which geographies are most conducive. Oil companies, for example, have no control over where prized resources can be found.Lafarge has declined to publicize which local armed groups it funded, saying only that it involved \u201csanctioned parties.\u201dThe issue became a point of contention in the French presidential debates, with the far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon calling for the company to be sanctioned for \u201cplotting with the enemy,\u201d a plea also taken up by Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the Republican contender.Both men were edged out of the final run for the presidency Sunday by the centrist politician Emmanuel Macron and the far-right leader Marine Le Pen.Lafarge\u2019s difficulties began just months after it spent over 600 million euros, or $644 million, opening the facility.Protests against the Syrian regime broke open in 2011 in the area, previously controlled by the Syrian government. The plant had created about 200 jobs in the local economy, pumping out thousands of tons of cement every day and supporting the construction of roads, transportation and other businesses nearby.But the protests grew more violent, and by the end of that year, according to the company, employees at the plant began to face a growing security threat as local armed groups drove out the Syrian army and converged on the region. The groups interfered with employees moving between their homes and work, restricted access to supplies and harassed customers, Lafarge said.By the middle of 2012, senior expatriate employees were evacuated from Syria and relocated to Cairo, where they oversaw the plant\u2019s operations remotely. Lafarge said it brought in extra security personnel, and regular calls were held between managers in Cairo and the plant in Jalabiyeh to monitor the situation.As security continued to deteriorate, managers resorted to using intermediaries to contact the armed groups, saying they were concerned \u201cthat direct contact would create additional risk vis-\u00e0-vis the Syrian government or other armed groups,\u201d Lafarge said in a statement.\u201cVery simply, chaos reigned and it was the task of local management to ensure that the intermediaries did whatever was necessary to secure its supply chain and the free movement of its employees,\u201d the company added.That involved making payments to the armed groups through the intermediaries, \u201cwithout regard to the identity of the groups involved,\u201d Lafarge said.By 2013, the Islamic State had moved into the area and retains a presence today.Lafarge, in a statement, said it tried to \u201ckeep its doors open,\u201d although it declined to specify precisely how. Sherpa, the nongovernmental organization, has alleged it did so with payoffs to the Islamic State in 2013 and 2014 to obtain safe passage for employees, and by buying oil and other materials needed to make cement from regions of Syria controlled by the terrorist group.It is a point the French courts will be examining.Lafarge said it would create an ethics and integrity committee to strengthen compliance, internal controls and risk management. But in the meantime, the company is continuing to defend itself in the public eye, suggesting that its staff was motivated by a \u201ccan-do\u201d approach to maintaining operations in the chaos of war.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Surprise! Pro-Washington Declarations in Athens", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byATHENS \u2014 Before Donald Trump\u2019s election turned much geopolitical conventional wisdom on its head, if you were in the Greek government, you\u2019d have to be a fool to proclaim, \u201cOnly America can help us.\u201dAbove all, it suggests that in difficult times, old alliances become more precious.Yet Defense Minister Panos Kammenos, leader of the junior coalition partner, recently sang the praises of the United States \u2014 and the sky did not fall on his head.\u201cOnly America can help us,\u201d he declared in an interview with Greece\u2019s Ant1 television. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that in difficult times it was not the Europeans who helped us. The Marshall Plan, as part of the Truman Doctrine, provided aid to Greece without memorandums and without usurious interest.\u201dThe point was telling but his memory was selective: There were plenty of strings attached to United States aid, and Greece was under American tutelage; the European Stability Mechanism that loans money to Greece says that at the end of 2015, it charged below 1 percent interest for all beneficiary countries.Many Greeks do not share this view. A poll conducted for the Dianeosis think tank late last year found that only 10 percent of respondents believed Greece would be better off leaving the eurozone and forging a relationship with the United States, while 37 percent preferred the eurozone and 33.4 percent thought an alliance with Russia would be better. A poll conducted in February found that 66 percent of respondents had a negative opinion of Mr. Trump; 37 percent believed his election would probably have a negative effect on Greece, while 20 percent thought it would be positive and 30 percent said it made no difference. (In November, a poll by the same company, Public Issue, found that 71 percent of respondents had a positive opinion of President Barack Obama.)\u201cThis love of freedom and democracy has formed a lasting bond between our two countries,\u201d Mr. Trump said and, regarding the 1821 war of liberation against the Ottoman Turks, added: \u201cAmerican President James Monroe and the great American statesman Daniel Webster both supported Greece\u2019s struggle for independence. And it was a tough, tough struggle, you know that.\u201dTelevision footage showed Mr. Kammenos beaming and stretching out a hand to greet the president. He also met with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to discuss the two countries\u2019 alliance and common challenges, including migration, terrorism and instability in the Balkans, Northern Africa and the Middle East.Ambassador Porter commented on a \u201cwidespread belief that our job really is to bail out Greece irrespective of the cost.\u201d He concluded: \u201cWe will probably recommend in our final report that American financial aid be conditioned upon effective efforts of the Greek government to carry out minimum economic reforms such as foreign exchange controls and adequate taxation, and we will recommend that these efforts be judged by several Americans sent to Greece for that purpose. Not only should this lead to a wiser expenditure of the money, but it will give the Greek government the added benefit of absolutely necessary reforms, which it is apparently incapable of imposing itself.\u201dNikos Konstandaras, the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Persuasive Business Leaders Parade Through White House", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a meeting at the White House with business leaders two weeks into his presidency, Donald J. Trump turned to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase.Aren\u2019t the Chinese manipulating their currency? Mr. Trump asked, according to two people who were there.\u201cNo, Mr. President, they\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Dimon replied. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to be responsible.\u201dOthers at the meeting, including the former Boeing chief W. James McNerney, agreed. Their advice echoed arguments by members of Mr. Trump\u2019s staff and cabinet that he should abandon his campaign pledge to punish China over its currency.Mr. Trump was listening. Two months later, facing a strengthened United States dollar and the need for Chinese support against a pugilistic North Korea, he reversed his position.The meeting with Mr. Dimon and other corporate executives was just one of dozens of sessions Mr. Trump has convened with top businesspeople since becoming president. Nearly 300 executives have visited the White House this year, according to a New York Times tabulation, an open-door policy that is a sharp break with the Obama administration and puts corporate chieftains on par with senior lawmakers in the pecking order of who has influence in Washington.Frank and occasionally confrontational, the conversations have become a defining feature of Mr. Trump\u2019s young presidency, inspiring policy debates and in some instances 180-degree shifts by the president, according to White House officials and executives who have participated in the discussions.And while some Democrats and other critics complain business leaders are being granted unfettered access to Mr. Trump \u2014 who ran as a businessman planning to apply executive principles to Washington\u2019s problems \u2014 the White House is unapologetic. The relationship-building is acting as a welcome substitute for a lack of legislative accomplishments, and presidential aides suggest the rapport positions Mr. Trump for future success.\u201cThe whole idea is, do something with all of this communication and feedback,\u201d said Chris Liddell, the president\u2019s assistant for strategic initiatives and a former chief financial officer at Microsoft and General Motors. \u201cAnd some of that happened in the first hundred days, but we\u2019re really setting ourselves up for the next thousand days.\u201dMany executives said that they were rarely given face time with President Barack Obama, and that even when they were, they sensed he wasn\u2019t fully engaged. \u201cThe feedback from the Obama White House was, \u2018We\u2019ll listen to what you have to say, but we know what we\u2019re doing,\u2019\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group.The parade of chief executives has included familiar Republican faces, like Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone and Jack Welch, the former chairman and chief executive of General Electric.But it has also included Democrats. Larry Fink, the chief of BlackRock, was a potential Treasury secretary had Hillary Clinton won the presidency; on Friday, he blasted the administration\u2019s approach to immigration and cast doubt on the economic models underpinning its proposed tax cuts, saying, \u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty due to the new administration.\u201dEric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, was a Clinton supporter who predicted in January that Mr. Trump would do \u201cevil things\u201d as president. And Charles Phillips, chief executive of the software company Infor, sat on Mr. Obama\u2019s Economic Recovery Advisory Board.\u201cAs he\u2019s shaping his view, he is kind of learning a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Phillips said of Mr. Trump. \u201cSo this is a good time, in this first six months, to go in there.\u201dAlcoa\u2019s chief executive, Roy Harvey, experienced that firsthand on Thursday, as he watched Mr. Trump sign a memorandum directing the Commerce Department to investigate the effects of aluminum imports on national security.\u201cWe appreciate the support of the administration to try to make a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Harvey said.Mr. Trump\u2019s dialogue with business leaders has at times been freewheeling, and at times focused on topics that were first dissected in small sessions with staff or cabinet members. At the gatherings, some executives, who have been cowed by the president\u2019s itchy Twitter finger and tendency to take quick offense to perceived slights, have found Mr. Trump open to disagreement.At the meeting when the Chinese currency was discussed, Elon Musk, the South African-born chief of Tesla and SpaceX, attacked a newly signed executive order banning travel and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Not only did Mr. Trump welcome the criticism, said the people who were present, he calmly defended his position, noting that public-opinion polls supported his viewpoint before sharing the floor with John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary.Some business leaders have parlayed their White House access into support for specific causes. In a TED talk on Friday, Mr. Musk said, \u201cI\u2019ve used the meetings I\u2019ve had to argue in favor of immigration and climate change,\u201d according to a Twitter post published by the organization. Mr. Schwarzman of Blackstone encouraged Mr. Trump to soften his hard-line stance on deporting so-called Dreamers \u2014 the young, undocumented foreigners living in the United States.\u201cBecause of these conversations, it really became a significant focus of the administration,\u201d said Reed Cordish, assistant to the president for intergovernmental and technology initiatives.Executives are hoping the White House will support putting federal education grants toward skills-training programs rather than just traditional college. So far, however, the administration hasn\u2019t taken a public stance on the legislative efforts to do so.Mr. Trump\u2019s unofficial business cabinet was handpicked, in many cases, by influential companies and trade associations. On the president\u2019s first full weekday in office, he welcomed a dozen industrial executives who had been convened by Andrew Liveris, head of the Dow Chemical Company. A senior staff member at the Retail Industry Leaders Association put together a panel of executives drawn from her group\u2019s ranks.Mr. Schwarzman recruited a range of business leaders, economists and policy experts for the president\u2019s strategic and policy forum, which regularly meets at the White House and has emerged as the most elite outside counsel.To be invited to the policy forum, there were a few criteria, according to someone who was briefed on the selection process: Be an expert in your field who is respected by Mr. Schwarzman, be a United States citizen and don\u2019t be vetoed by Mr. Trump.The task of dealing day to day with the chief executives falls largely to Mr. Liddell, a New Zealander by birth, and Mr. Cordish, a Baltimore real estate scion, who share a cramped office in the West Wing. It is decorated with a laminated United States map and a full-page ad, ripped from The Wall Street Journal, that thanks Mr. Trump for agreeing to reconsider fuel-economy standards. It was purchased by auto trade groups.During a recent interview, Mr. Liddell and Mr. Cordish were upbeat. Since the White House \u201clistening groups\u201d began, Mr. Cordish said, they\u2019ve been barraged with ideas from executives and trade groups for deregulation, job creation and the streamlining of services.In a meeting in early April, a group of 50 or so chief executives involved with the Partnership for New York City proposed adding public housing to Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure initiative. The idea was recirculated at another trade group meeting about a week later, suggesting that the White House was seriously considering it.Some of the infrastructure changes under consideration would improve the government\u2019s own inner workings, including at the White House itself. \u201cA lot of technology here is 20 years out of date,\u201d Mr. Liddell said.But even with all the access, some chief executives are frustrated with what they describe as well-intentioned but so far fruitless talk \u2014 and a public environment that can be leery of any cooperation with the Trump administration.Robert Hoopes, a consultant who advises nonprofit groups and large companies and has done work for prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said executives were making a careful calculation when they traveled to Pennsylvania Avenue. If the topic for discussion is core to your business, Mr. Hoopes said, \u201cyou want to be a part of that conversation.\u201d But if the session is peripheral or unrelated to your business, he said, the \u201crisk calibration\u201d is very different.Two dozen trade-group officials and chief executives, some of them suggested as potential interview subjects by the White House, either refused to speak for this article or didn\u2019t respond to messages. Others declined to be quoted on the record, citing the toxic environment and the potential fallout among the public and their own employees for being regarded as an ally of Mr. Trump.\u201cUsually, when a campaign is over, things settle down and people feel they can work with the president without having a backlash,\u201d Ms. Wylde of the Partnership for New York City said. \u201cIn this case, there continue to be divisive forces that don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d C.E.O.s, she said, \u201cfeel pressure from all sides.\u201dLandon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting from Chicago.

{"Headline": "The Wrong Move on Student Loans", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe Obama administration made the right call in 2015 when it barred debt collectors from gouging borrowers who default on student loans and then agree to payment plans that let them make good on the debt and rebuild their ruined credit.Federal student loan defaults are dragging on the economy \u2014 making it impossible for people to buy cars or homes \u2014 and are increasingly following people into old age, where their Social Security benefits are being garnished for loan payments.People who default often do so because they do not know about income-based repayment plans that might cost as little as zero dollars per month. The guaranty agencies, which collect defaulted federally guaranteed loans made through banks, share some responsibility. But the loan servicers, which collect direct student loans and are supposed to guide people through the repayment process, can be especially destructive.The Education Department\u2019s decision to let guaranty agencies gouge struggling people is indefensible \u2014 not least because the additional fees bear no relationship at all to the expenses incurred by the companies. In addition to being unfair on its face, the decision to allow these fees will be likely to make the default problem worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Investigates Regulator of Fast-Moving Insurance Industry", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s anti-corruption investigators are targeting the country\u2019s top insurance regulator, throwing doubt over an industry that has been behind a wave of blockbuster global deals but has raised concerns about financial risk in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s anti-corruption investigation agency said Sunday afternoon that the regulator, Xiang Junbo, had been placed under investigation for \u201csevere violations of discipline.\u201d In China, that language is commonly used in reference to a corruption inquiry.Mr. Xiang oversaw an industry that has gone from a cash-rich but sleepy backwater to a major player on the global deal-making scene in recent years. Chinese insurers have bought up a large number of properties, including big developments, European financial institutions and the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. Since last year, Chinese regulators have moved to curtail what have been widely seen as some of the insurance industry\u2019s riskier practices.It is not clear whether the investigation into Mr. Xiang is related to any of those matters. The anticorruption agency, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, provided no details. Mr. Xiang, 60, could not be reached for comment on Sunday, and no one answered the phone at the press office of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, which he oversees. As of Sunday afternoon, the insurance commission\u2019s website still listed him as its chairman.Mr. Xiang is just the latest top Communist Party official to fall afoul of President Xi Jinping\u2019s yearslong anti-corruption campaign. He is a member of the party\u2019s Central Committee, a group of about 200 officials who make major decisions about how the party is run.He is also the top regulator of a vast industry that has undergone major changes in recent years.China has pushed to energize its long-sleepy insurance industry as part of an effort to modernize its financial system and nurture a rising culture of middle-class spenders who might want financial security. But under Mr. Xiang, the industry \u2014 which boasts 15.1 trillion renminbi, or $2.2 trillion, in assets \u2014 has also become more daring in what it invests in, defying the image of insurers as conservative stewards of wealth.Chinese insurers have also become aggressive over the past several years in selling investment products that were regulated as life insurance but promised high rates of return with maturities of as little as a year. These products allowed insurers, particularly smaller insurers, to raise large sums of money quickly, which they then used to speculate in bonds, real estate and other investments.By the standards of top Chinese financial regulators \u2014 indeed, by the standards of financial regulators in any country \u2014 Mr. Xiang led an uncommonly varied and creative life.According to state-controlled media, he joined the army and fought Vietnamese forces in a border war in 1979. He then became a successful television writer and producer, writing the screenplays for at least two TV series on the perils of corruption and a third on kung fu combatants.Along the way, he also found time to climb the ranks of the country\u2019s financial elite. He became chairman of China\u2019s third-largest bank, the Agricultural Bank of China, in 2009 and of the insurance commission two years later.Mr. Xiang\u2019s continued leadership of the insurance commission was a subject of considerable discussion on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress in Beijing early last month, but he was not seen as a possible target of an anti-corruption investigation. Questions instead had revolved around whether insurance regulation would be consolidated with other agencies as part of an overhaul in how China oversees its financial system.Asked during a news conference right before the congress whether financial regulation might be consolidated under the China Banking Regulatory Commission, Guo Shuqing, China\u2019s newly named top banking regulator and an official with a reputation as a reformer, said only that financial regulatory agencies needed to coordinate their activities.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter @KeithBradsherAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Venezuela Protests, G.M. Plant Is Seized, and Company Exits", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byVenezuela was once among the most lucrative markets in Latin America for foreign businesses, a country oozing in oil and blessed with an emerging middle class hungry for everything modern, from new cars to snug-fitting disposable diapers.But the good times are long gone, and on Thursday, General Motors became the latest in a wave of international companies that have shut their doors voluntarily or under duress.In G.M.\u2019s case, the Venezuelan authorities seized the company\u2019s local vehicle assembly plant. America\u2019s largest automaker said it had been forced to cease operations in Venezuela because of an \u201cillegal judicial seizure of its assets\u201d and would lay off its 2,700 workers there.Political tensions, corruption, high crime rates, a restrictive investment law and interruptions of electric service have made doing business in Venezuela akin to running an obstacle course en route to bankruptcy. Especially burdensome have been harsh currency restrictions and repeated devaluations of the bol\u00edvar, the local currency, which have limited imports of vital machine parts and goods, while shrinking the value in dollars of company revenues.Much if not most business is done with the government and state-owned companies, and invoices can go unpaid for months on end. The government has expropriated more than 1,400 private businesses since 1998, according to the State Department.\u201cNowadays, there is no country in Latin America more difficult for a company to operate in,\u201d said Luis Giusti, a former chief executive of Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, the national oil company, who also worked for Shell Corp. of Venezuela. \u201cThere is uncertainty for the future of the economy, and companies have long periods to wait for cash.\u201dCoca-Cola, long one of the most successful companies in Latin America, suspended production in Venezuela last summer because of a scarcity of sugar in a country that once was one of the prime producers in the region. Bridgestone, Clorox, Ford Motor, General Mills, Kimberly Clark and Procter & Gamble have all left Venezuela or scaled back production sharply in the country amid political hostility and a general shortage of necessary raw materials in recent years.In the economy\u2019s most vital sector, oil production, the international companies that remain are barely hanging on. Scores of international and domestic oil service companies have been expropriated since President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who was elected in 1998, came to power. Under Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, the government took a majority stake in four giant oil projects in 2007, prompting Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips to leave the country. Chevron has chosen to stay as a minority partner to PDVSA.Several international service companies are keeping staff members, offices and equipment, including rigs, in the country despite a lack of payments from PDVSA in hopes that Venezuela will return to its traditional place as South America\u2019s leading oil producer.But Baker Hughes, Halliburton, Schlumberger and Weatherford have all reduced their activities in the country. PDVSA has tried to appease the service companies by paying old bills with bonds and promissory notes.Schlumberger announced last year that it would reduce its presence in Venezuela because PDVSA was $1.2 billion in arrears. Halliburton was owed $756 million as of last spring, according to Oilprice.com, a trade publication.Venezuelan oil executives said that PDVSA\u2019s partners were now making marginal profits or losing money outright. These executives said that when the price of oil was over $100 a barrel, money could still be made despite the mismanagement of PDVSA and the revolving door of state-run company officials they had to work with. But now taxes and royalties are killing profits, and making long-term investment unviable.\u201cEverybody is waiting for a change of government, and hopefully they will recoup some of their accounts payable due to them,\u201d said Jorge R. Pi\u00f1on, former president of Amoco Oil in Latin America. \u201cThey cannot afford to leave because they are deeply invested in the country. They don\u2019t want to pack up and then have to repack their boxes and go back to Caracas.\u201dThe worsening political and economic situation has left many foreign companies debating whether to stay or to go.A third option is known as \u201cdeconsolidation.\u201d Under United States accounting laws, a company may assign market value to a subsidiary\u2019s assets and afterward consider it an investment rather than a separate operation. The move allows multinational corporations to take one-time charges, but remain in Venezuela.Many companies have deconsolidated their Venezuelan operations in the past two years, including the tire-maker Goodyear, which took a $646 million charge for its Venezuelan business last year. Bridgestone and Pirelli announced similar measures, with Bridgestone writing off $360 million and Pirelli $614 million.Pepsi, citing the breakdown of the country\u2019s foreign-exchange market, took a $1.4 billion write-off for its Venezuela business in 2015. Procter & Gamble took a $2.1 billion write-off in 2015 for its Venezuelan operations.The move against G.M. comes as Venezuela\u2019s auto industry has nearly ground to a halt amid the political instability, currency issues and economic failure that have led to the violent protests across the nation.Last year, automakers sold only about 3,200 new vehicles compared with more than 17,000 in 2015, with plants closing for months at a time because of a lack of demand.Five years ago, automakers made more than 100,000 cars and trucks in Venezuela, according to the research firm Wards Auto. But production has declined steadily since then, primarily because of currency issues that have choked off the flow of parts into the country. Last year, automakers made only 4,900 vehicles, including heavy-duty pickups, down from 31,000 the previous year.The G.M. plant, on the central coast in the state of Carabobo, had not been producing cars for an extended period of time, said a company spokeswoman, Dayna Hart.Other automakers, including Ford and Toyota, have closed plants for several months because of the low demand and an inability to get necessary parts.Two years ago, Ford took an $800 million pretax charge to cover accounting changes for its Venezuelan operations.In a statement, G.M.\u2019s Venezuelan division said it was ceasing operations in the country after its plant was \u201cunexpectedly taken by the public authorities, preventing normal operations.\u201d It said the government had taken other company assets, including vehicles, from the plant.Venezuelan news reports said the seizure stemmed from a lawsuit that dated to the early 2000s with a company in the western city of Maracaibo. But a spokesman for G.M.\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary said the plant had been shut down for the past 42 days as a result of a takeover by members of one of its unions.The spokesman said that G.M. had asked the government for help taking back the plant, but that the government had taken over the factory itself instead. Union members can now enter, he said, but not managers.\u201cG.M. strongly rejects the arbitrary measures taken by the authorities and will vigorously take all legal actions to defend its rights,\u201d the company said in a statement.Patricia Torres contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Rides a Market Wave, but Business Looks for Results", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byThe investor enthusiasm that began with President Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in November has burst out anew on Wall Street, even as Washington remains gridlocked and evidence of any real pickup in the economy is scarce.Stocks have surged 5 percent since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. And that is on top of the 6 percent rally that followed his win in November.The cause for bullishness on Tuesday was Mr. Trump\u2019s new call to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent \u2014 deficits, perhaps, be damned.\u201cC.E.O.s are pragmatists,\u201d said Bill George, a Harvard Business School professor who formerly ran Medtronic, the giant medical-device maker. \u201cIf you cut my taxes and ease up on regulations, then I will like you. The bigger question is, can he get anything done?\u201dThe market impact of the Trump presidency is based so far on prospects \u2014 with details and congressional dynamics left to be sorted out \u2014 rather than accomplishments.But plenty of other factors are providing a tailwind for traders, including unexpectedly strong earnings reports from blue-chip companies like Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s and the receding chances that French voters will turn their backs on Europe.Technology giants like Apple, Facebook and Amazon have shown robust growth, lifting the Nasdaq index past 6,000 for the first time on Tuesday, a 26 percent gain from a year ago.Blair Effron, a founder of Centerview Partners, a prominent independent investment bank on Wall Street, said he believed that beyond any immediate policy shift in Washington, investors had taken their cue from signs of healthier growth globally.\u201cEurope and emerging markets are doing better,\u201d Mr. Effron said, \u201cand there is an underpinning of global stability and growth that are having much more of an impact than people think.\u201dNot all the signals domestically are coming in strong, however. The government\u2019s initial report on the economy\u2019s first-quarter performance is due Friday, and it is expected to be weak.And even if Mr. Trump manages to get Congress to pass a tax overhaul, and corporate profits then boom, that will not necessarily translate into better overall economic performance, warned Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago.\u201cWe have to distinguish between pro-profit and pro-growth policies,\u201d she said. \u201cA pro-profit approach increases the share of the pie going to corporate earnings and shareholders. Pro-growth policies increase the size of the pie.\u201dSo far, Ms. Swonk said, the Trump administration seems to favor the former. And while Wall Street will always reward rising corporate profits with higher share prices in the short term, the country\u2019s long-term prospects will be undermined if that trend is not accompanied by policies that lead to faster economic growth.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to cut taxes, but reform is harder,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about closing loopholes than reducing rates because if you just go to 15 percent, you\u2019re going to leave a large hole in the federal budget.\u201dWhile the prospects for a tax overhaul are murky on Capitol Hill, especially in light of the failure of House Republicans in March to agree on a replacement for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, executives say they are encouraged by the business-friendly stance of the White House.Bruce Van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, said he was initially concerned by Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements on trade and immigration when he took office in January.\u201cI feel better because in the first 100 days, the president\u2019s tone on those issues has moderated,\u201d Mr. Van Saun said.At the same time, executive actions, like requiring government agencies to roll back two existing regulations for every new one, have also played well with business leaders, especially in the financial services industry.\u201cThat\u2019s caused some of the regulatory apparatus to pause and appreciate there is a new sheriff in town and the rules of the game are changing,\u201d said Mr. Van Saun, who took over at Citizens, a regional banking chain based in Rhode Island, after more than two decades on Wall Street.What is more, Mr. Van Saun added, \u201cthe commitment to the positive elements of the platform \u2014 lower taxes, less regulation and pro-energy policies \u2014 continues to be there.\u201dEnergy industry executives are hoping that Mr. Trump will deliver on his promises to reduce regulation in their sector and open up new areas for drilling and development.\u201cIf you watch what he does as opposed to the noise around him, so far so good,\u201d said Charif Souki, chairman of Houston-based Tellurian and a leading industry spokesman for increasing natural gas exports from the United States.Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major oil and gas independent, echoed Mr. Souki\u2019s cautiously optimistic assessment of President Trump.\u201cI think generally he\u2019s doing well,\u201d Mr. Sheffield said. \u201cI think the Republicans have to get together and get something done.\u201dTo be sure, Mr. Trump has spent more time listening to business leaders in the first few months of his presidency than actually delivering on what they want.\u201cIn the first 100 days of his presidency, Trump has given more attention to C.E.O.s than Obama did in eight years,\u201d said Mr. George, who is not a supporter of Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat he does is a whole different story. But they do feel like he\u2019s listening, and there\u2019s a lot of ego gratification in having the president listen to you.\u201dIf the president cannot deliver, or the economy fails to pick up speed, investors may be setting themselves up for a fall, warned Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank.A look at the business backgrounds of Trump administration appointees and advisers.\u201cExpectations for the future are wild,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cThere is quite a disconnect between what the data suggests and where the stock market is trading.\u201dStill, even if it looks frothy, the euphoria is not approaching tech-bubble levels circa 2000.\u201cIn 2000, the price-to-earnings ratio for Nasdaq was 170; today it is trading at 26 times,\u201d Charlie Bilello, the director of research at the investment advisory firm Pension Partners, said, referring to a common gauge for measuring stock valuations. \u201cThat is not cheap, but it\u2019s not crazy. We are definitely not at the level where the average guy quits his job to trade stocks.\u201dThat may be true, but there is no doubt that the explosion in the market value of these companies has taken many investment professionals by surprise, even if most investors agree that their corporate fundamentals are solid.With the rollback of the health care law put off and big infrastructure spending plans still up in the air, bulls and bears alike on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms will be focused on the prospects for a tax overhaul in the coming months.But within the business community itself, there are sharp differences between industries that stand to gain and those that stand to lose as the tax code is redrawn.A low overall corporate tax rate would be great but would not be worth giving up provisions like the mortgage interest deduction or homeowners\u2019 ability to write off state and local taxes, said William E. Brown, the president of the National Association of Realtors.At the same time, smaller manufacturers and others worry that they might still be subject to a nearly 40 percent rate even if larger corporations use their political clout to guarantee a hefty cut.Suku V. Radia, the chief executive of Bankers Trust, Iowa\u2019s largest independently owned bank, said he was eager to learn more details, like the impact of a major tax cut on the budget deficit.\u201cIt is obviously a significant drop from where we are currently, and I\u2019d like to at least be able to better understand what do we do to make up for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the loss of revenues going to be, and how are we trying to fill the gap?\u201dWhatever details come out of the White House, getting a tax bill passed will be anything but easy.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is such a thing as \u2018tax simplification,\u2019\u201d Mr. Radia said. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently complicated.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Amid Trade Tensions, Ford Pushes Pickup Trucks in China", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Liu Qipeng has a passion for rock climbing and camping, but for those activities, a Chinese-branded vehicle just won\u2019t do.So even in this era of rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, Mr. Liu, 38, a chemicals recycling entrepreneur in southeastern China, chose to wait for the chance to buy what might be the most American of rides: a Ford F-150 Raptor pickup truck imported from the United States.\u201cI like this model because it is very masculine and powerful,\u201d Mr. Liu said, adding that his friends \u201cstart to lean toward Ford when they plan to change their cars.\u201dFord Motor is putting the premium version of the F-150 on sale on Saturday in a country where pickup trucks are virtually unheard-of except on farms. Detroit\u2019s automakers see a potential new world of Chinese drivers, who in recent years have embraced sport utility vehicles and want to drive bigger, beefier cars.Fords and Chevrolets \u2014 mostly made in China, but profitable either way for Detroit \u2014 are common sights on the streets. \u201cThey think American-brand vehicles are reliable, strong and tough,\u201d said Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a consulting firm in Shanghai.Ford, which will import the pickups from Dearborn, Mich., is not alone. General Motors this year began to import Chevrolet Silverado full-size pickup trucks from Flint, Mich., and the Chevrolet Colorado midsize pickup from Wentzville, Mo. Ford plans to start importing the Ford Ranger midsize pickup next year as well. Both have modest expectations compared with the United States, where nearly 2.7 million pickup trucks were sold last year, almost eight times as many as in China last year, according to LMC Automotive, a global consulting firm.For years, Chinese consumers saw pickup trucks as polluting rural rattletraps suitable only for bringing in produce from the farm. Pickups made in the country sell for as little as $7,000. Many provinces ban trucks, including pickups, from being driven in cities by day.Interest in the cars began to grow early last year, when central government officials urged Chinese provinces to lighten restrictions on pickups as part of a broad plan to encourage consumption in the economy, including purchases of automobiles. Chinese-brand automakers had also called for a relaxation of the rules as a way to develop their pickup truck businesses.Ford plans to introduce its \u201cBuilt Ford Tough\u201d marketing campaign in China this spring, said Peter Fleet, the company\u2019s vice president for marketing, sales and service in Asia and the Pacific. Its marketers experimented with various Mandarin translations of the phrase before concluding that the English version worked.\u201cThe research came back resoundingly clear: No, we understand \u2018Built Ford Tough,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fleet said.The price could be even higher if Ford were importing cars from the United States instead of pickup trucks. China classifies pickup trucks as trucks and not as passenger vehicles, a category that in the country encompasses cars, sport utility vehicles and minivans. That truck classification exempts pickups from a Chinese consumption tax on passenger vehicles with large engines that can go as high as 40 percent.Mr. Liu said that if he faced a consumption tax like that, he would not buy the Ford pickup.\u201cIf it has a 20 percent tax, I wouldn\u2019t consider buying it, because one of the major motives for me to buy it is that it\u2019s a very cost-effective model,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a toy for me after all, not a must-have.\u201dChina also exempts pickup trucks entirely from fuel economy averages. It sets a much higher corporate fuel-economy average \u2014 38 miles per gallon \u2014 than the United States for all the cars, minivans and S.U.V.s that each automaker sells in the country.This has forced manufacturers to design and sell models with engines that are much smaller and less powerful than in the United States but also more fuel efficient.Attitudes toward pickups are softening in parts of China. Ford said six provinces had exempted pickups from urban driving restrictions widely imposed on trucks in the country.Mr. Liu lives in the southern city of Guangzhou, in Guangdong Province, which has not changed its rules. He said that while he owned other vehicles, he planned to drive his pickup around town sometimes as though it were a car and would see whether the police tried to stop him.\u201cAs long as the local authorities don\u2019t ban me from driving it here,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll drive it.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher at @KeithBradsherCarolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Policy Advisers Urge Trump to Keep U.S. in Paris Accord", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byMr. Trump plans to make a final decision on the fate of the Paris agreement before a meeting of the Group of 7 leading economies at the end of May, according to Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. A team of Mr. Trump\u2019s principal advisers was scheduled to meet Tuesday afternoon at the White House to discuss the decision with the aim of recommending a path forward, but the meeting was canceled after some of the planned attendees flew with Mr. Trump to an event in Wisconsin, according to a White House spokeswoman.The spokeswoman, Kelly Love, said the meeting was still expected to take place, although the exact timing was unclear.Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has also spoken in favor of \u201ckeeping a seat at the table\u201d in the climate pact, and in recent days, major corporations have stepped forward to embrace that position.While no decision has been made, experts tracking it say that view is gaining traction.\u201cWe do not currently believe the Trump administration plans to withdraw from either Paris agreement,\u201d wrote Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington firm, in a memo to clients on Monday.Besides, keeping the United States\u2019 name on the accord does not obligate the Trump administration to abide by the ambitious emissions-control pledges of Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama. At least one senior White House climate policy adviser, George David Banks, has advocated staying in the agreement while replacing the Obama plan with a weaker, more industry-friendly pledge.Over recent weeks, Mr. Banks has asked top officials at several major corporations, including Exxon Mobil, who have similar views, to submit letters to the White House confirming their support for staying in the Paris deal, even if in a modified form.In response, Peter Trelenberg, the manager of environmental policy and planning at Exxon Mobil, wrote to Mr. Banks, \u201cExxon Mobil supports the Paris agreement as an effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change.\u201dRoyal Dutch Shell and BP, European companies with significant investments in the United States, have also endorsed the accord.Last month, Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican from oil-, gas- and coal-rich North Dakota, wrote, \u201cThe U.S. should present a new pledge that does no harm to our economy.\u201d Mr. Cramer, an early supporter of Donald J. Trump, advised Mr. Trump on energy issues during his presidential campaign.Colin Marshall, the chief executive of Cloud Peak, a major coal producer in Wyoming, the nation\u2019s largest coal-mining state, also wrote to Mr. Trump: \u201cBy remaining in the Paris agreement, albeit with a much different pledge on emissions, you can help shape a more rational international approach to climate policy.\u201dRegardless of his decision, Mr. Trump has already undermined the United States\u2019 ability to meet its Paris pledge. Mr. Obama declared that the United States would reduce its planet-warming carbon pollution about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Its primary policy for meeting that target would be the Clean Power Plan, a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations designed to shutter hundreds of heavily polluting coal-fired power plants, the nation\u2019s chief source of greenhouse emissions.Mr. Pruitt has emerged as a leading voice for withdrawal from the Paris deal. Last week, he told Fox News, \u201cIt\u2019s something we need to exit.\u201dThat reflects the views of powerful conservative political advocacy groups such as Americans for Prosperity, which is funded by the influential libertarian brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch.\u201cWhat we say to the White House is that it\u2019s clearly a terrible agreement for the American people,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity.That view is also backed by economists at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that has supplied the Trump administration with many of its policy proposals.Harold G. Hamm, the chief executive of Continental Resources and a Trump campaign adviser, has also condemned the pact. \u201cCancel the Paris climate treaty and any other agreements entered into unilaterally and without the consent of Congress,\u201d Mr. Hamm wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump before his inauguration.Bob Murray, the chief executive of the coal company Murray Energy, who is personally close with the president, has also strongly criticized the deal.\u201cIf the U.S. were to pull out, it would do so in the context that would invite trade reprisals,\u201d Mr. Book said. \u201cIt could lead to a carbon tariff trade war.\u201dDaniel M. Bodansky, an expert in international environmental agreements at Arizona State University, said that remaining in the Paris deal but weakening the United States\u2019 commitment could still have the effect of generating some ill will \u2014 but without the repercussions of trade sanctions.\u201cThey could just submit a new plan,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople internationally would not be happy, but they\u2019d be a lot less unhappy than if the U.S. actually pulled out.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From N.F.L. Owners to Florida Retirees, a Who\u2019s Who of Inaugural Donors", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Blue-chip American companies, kings of \u201cdark money,\u201d titans of professional football and even a Florida retirement community.But if any bitterness between Mr. Trump and the league lingers, it was not evident on Inauguration Day.A seventh donor appears to be Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys. Although his name does not appear in the documents, Mr. Jones is listed as the president of a corporation that controls a group, Glenstone Limited Partnership, that contributed $1 million to the committee.Edward Glazer, whose family co-owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, contributed $250,000.But it was not just team owners who chipped in. N.F.L. Ventures L.P., a wing of the National Football League, gave $100,000.Not to be outdone, the office of the commissioner of Major League Baseball also wrote a check for $100,000, and Marlene M. Ricketts, whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, handed over $1 million.Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest inaugural donor by far was Sheldon G. Adelson, the casino magnate and philanthropist, who gave a record $5 million to support the festivities. But he is far from the only gambling industry magnate to support the cause.Frank J. Fertitta, the chief executive of Fertitta Entertainment and Station Casinos, gave $207,000. Fertitta Entertainment, a different corporation by the same name that owns casinos and restaurant chains, gave another $500,000.Phil Ruffin, a friend of the president\u2019s with investments in the casino industry and a seat on the inaugural committee, gave $1 million. Mr. Ruffin teamed up with Mr. Trump to build the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas. His wife, Oleksandra Nikolayenko-Ruffin, a former Miss Ukraine, gave another $25,000.Wynn Resorts, one of the world\u2019s largest casino companies, contributed $729,217 in in-kind musical performances for the week\u2019s events, according to the disclosure. The company was started by Steve Wynn, a friend and sometimes rival of Mr. Trump\u2019s who was also on the inaugural committee.The donor rolls are almost a who\u2019s who of oil, gas, coal and energy companies. Many of the country\u2019s largest oil companies, including Chevron, Valero and BP\u2019s North American arm, gave hundreds of thousands of dollars each.Checks also came from companies that support drilling, mining and transporting fossil fuels. Anadarko Petroleum, of Texas, and Continental Resources, of Oklahoma, both oil exploration and production companies, chipped in $100,000 each. Kelcy L. Warren, the head of the company building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave $250,000.Liquefied natural gas and ethanol were represented, too, with $100,000 from Cheniere Energy Shared Services and $1 million from Green Plains Renewable Energy.Among many contributions from the oil and gas industry, one, from Houston-based Citgo Petroleum, stood out. That is because Citgo is the American affiliate of Venezuela\u2019s state oil company, known as PDVSA.Several large contributions came from companies with seemingly inscrutable names, some of which are easier to untangle than others. That is because while presidential campaigns cannot take donations from companies that are not specifically tied to individuals, inaugural committees can.An entity identified as LMC IP, for instance, gave $1 million. It lists its location in the disclosures as the same Bethesda, Md., address as Lockheed Martin, the aerospace and defense giant.The ownership and operations of other entities are more difficult to discern. BH Group L.L.C., for example, gave $1 million and lists its address as an Arlington, Va., office tower across the Potomac River from Washington.The list includes several names more commonly associated with prominent Democrats. One is Scott Bessent, who for years helped invest George Soros\u2019s personal fortune. He gave $1 million to the committee. Another is a trust associated with Jennifer N. Pritzker, a member of the prominent and mostly left-leaning Illinois family, which gave $250,000. Ms. Pritzker, who is also a retired Army lieutenant colonel, is the world\u2019s first openly transgender billionaire.And while residents of the Villages, a planned retirement community northwest of Orlando that advertises itself as \u201cFlorida\u2019s Friendliest Hometown,\u201d were divided on whom to support in the presidential election, the Villages put $250,000 toward Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities.An article on Friday about donors to President Trump\u2019s inauguration described incorrectly Fertitta Entertainment, which contributed $500,000. The company owns casinos and restaurant chains, not the Ultimate Fighting Championship. (A company also named Fertitta Entertainment owns the UFC.)An article on April 21 about donors who contributed to President Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremony misstated the amount given by Nicholas A. Mastroianni III. It was $100,000, not $1 million.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scouring 11 Time Zones for a Contemporary Russian Art Show", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 It was an old Soviet tradition: No national art exhibition in Moscow was complete without at least one work from every region.Never mind that geographical balance often resulted in kitsch. Look at \u201cThe People\u2019s Friendship Fountain,\u201d for example, which dominates a major park here that is still called the Exhibition of the Achievements of the National Economy. (Soviet, or what?) The fountain consists of 16 gilded maidens, each in the national costume of one republic of the Soviet Union, proffering local bounty like wheat or corn.\u201cThe country is so huge that we do not always understand it,\u201d said Daria Kotova, the spokeswoman for Garage. The museum was developed by the art collector Dasha Zhukova and her oil billionaire husband, Roman A. Abramovich.Six curators scoured some 40 cities, from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok, examining works by hundreds of artists and whittling the selection down to 68 works in seven representative categories.\u201cWe discovered criteria, categories, optics and dimensions that we could not have in any way imagined before our trips,\u201d said Tatiana Volkova, one of the curators.\u201cI would have liked to see more new, but maybe there is none,\u201d Olga Kabanova, the art critic for the Vedomosti newspaper, said in an interview. \u201cThe Triennial does give an understanding of contemporary art in Russia \u2014 there are national stars and there are unknown artists worthy of attention and support.\u201dA total of 200 portfolios are to be displayed eventually on the Triennial\u2019s website.Russian plutocrats buy plenty of pricey Western art, too, but like a dowager who wears only her paste jewels in public, they tend to stash their Picassos, Bacons and Richters abroad. Given the fickle hand of Russian law, expensive art serves not least as Midas-like savings accounts out of reach over the border.The curators excavated some unexpected works in unexpected places.Yet Ekaterina Inozemtseva, one of the curators, discovered two striking works there. One included in the \u201cCommon Language\u201d category is a short video by a budding filmmaker, Zaurbek Tsugaev, 33, titled \u201cHands-iPhone.\u201d In it, an elderly grandmother runs her hands over an iPhone, seemingly trying to figure out how it works. \u201cWhat a contrast between the landscape of her hands and the flatness of the new gadget,\u201d Ms. Inozemtseva said during a tour of the show.Another piece from Chechnya in the \u201cFidelity to Place\u201d category consisted of black-and-white metal house numbers from a Grozny street, with half missing at random. The artist, Aslan Gaisumov, 25, said he searched for artifacts from old Grozny and the 50 battered plaques were all he could find from one of the many streets leveled during recent wars with Russia.\u201cTo me that was like a counter-memorial that brought back a certain memory before the war,\u201d said Roxana Marcoci, a senior curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, who was in Moscow for the Triennial\u2019s opening. \u201cIt was done in a way that was postconceptual, but dealt with history.\u201dMs. Marcoci found the \u201cArt in Action\u201d category \u2014 basically political art \u2014 especially intriguing because Russian domestic politics rarely make headlines abroad. Much of the art in this section, often created by collectives, focused on the plight of Russian women.For example, a piece by the Nadenka Creative Association in Omsk, in southern Siberia, took everyday objects like pot holders or panties and embroidered them with important dates or facts related to women.The panties, for example, read \u201c1920 1936 1955 my right for an abortion,\u201d referring to the years when abortion laws came into effect. One embroidered oven mitt read: \u201cAs a result of domestic violence in Russia more than 14,000 women die per year. Legislation in domestic violence has been adopted in 140 countries but not Russia. Happy New 2016!\u201dMs. Inozemtseva said that she had seen so many photography portfolios that by the time she reached Kaliningrad and someone mentioned a talented photographer, her first reaction was, \u201c Please, God, no!\u201dOne portfolio, \u201cMy Friend the Street Musician,\u201d focused on Oleg Fomin, a Novosibirsk musician. Here is Mr. Fomin performing in the subway. There he is soaking in his bathtub.\u201cHe is a Siberian playboy with a star\u2019s face,\u201d said the photographer, Evgeny Ivanov, 58.\u201cHe was the soul of the city, everyone knew him.\u201dMr. Fomin died soon after the series was completed, and the next set of photographs showed his apartment swept clean by relatives of all the bric-a-brac he had amassed over decades. \u201cThat is the cycle of life,\u201d shrugged the photographer.Given the country\u2019s history, periodic references to Soviet life were inevitable.The choreographer Sasha Pirogova, 31, created the video \u201cQueue,\u201d of a dance piece based on a famous novel by Vladimir Sorokin.The book focused in detail on the almost biological life of the endless lines for everything in the Soviet Union. In \u201cQueue,\u201d some performers inked their position in line \u2014 No. 1,227, for example \u2014 right on their bodies as the line appeared to continue for eternity.Ms. Pirogova will be among the artists representing Russia in the next Venice Biennale.The \u201cMaster Figure\u201d category grouped artists with long-established reputations. Ilgizar Khasanov, 58, from the Kazan in the south, presented a trilogy, \u201cFemale, Male, Red,\u201d addressing gender issues.The striking centerpiece, \u201cRed,\u201d was inspired by starkly different gender roles in the Soviet Union. It consisted of a giant mobile made up of dozens of ordinary objects \u2014 all Communist red \u2014 used by the two sexes as they matured. Objects like a hairbrush and a dress are on one side; male icons like boxing gloves and toy cars on the other.Mr. Khasanov said that he was struck by the growing nostalgia for the Soviet Union despite its many problems, so he wanted to explore why people \u201cwant to become Soviet again.\u201dThe plethora of work disguised just how hard it is to become an artist, noted Taus Makhacheva, 33, whose work \u201cThe Way of an Object\u201d consisted of three puppets, modeled on museum objects from her native Dagestan, which take on a life of their own.The Soviet Union treated artists well, she noted, granting them subsidized apartments, studios and vacations, and helping to distribute their work. No art scene in any Russian city receives any remotely similar support, she said.\u201cAll these scenes exist \u2018despite\u2019 \u2014 despite the reality, despite no support, despite everything,\u201d Ms. Makhacheva said. \u201cIt is art despite, which makes it incredibly real and incredibly beautiful.\u201dOver all, both locals and outsiders find the Triennial uneven, but ultimately an engaging start toward exposing contemporary Russian art to the world.Ms. Marcoci, from MoMA, called the exhibition \u201can eye-opener\u201d with a \u201cconversational feel.\u201d\u201cIt is the first triennial of Russian art, but what is Russia?\u201d she said. \u201cRussia is a place grounded in multiple cultures \u2014 it is uneven, but it felt like an exhibition with a lot of energy and an element of disruptiveness.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified Daria Kotova, a spokeswoman for the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art. She is not Roman A. Abramovich\u2019s wife. Mr. Abramovich is married to Dasha Zhukova.Advertisement"}

The answer: No, most are made in China, but there\u2019s one Canadian option. Given your article about China\u2019s formidable lead in this industry, we shouldn\u2019t have been surprised.If President Trump really wants to bring back manufacturing jobs in large numbers, why aren\u2019t we taking the lead in the sustainable fuel industry, with solar panels and wind turbines? Admittedly, our first effort at supporting solar was less than successful, but the industry has matured dramatically in a few short years.Rather than trying to turn back the clock on coal, why not repurpose abandoned factories to manufacture products for the energy format of the future? We could boost the economy and help the planet at the same time.But perhaps we should keep that last part to ourselves, and just keep it simple for this administration: Looks as if China is winning.NANCY HALLBERG, WACCABUC, N.Y.Advertisement"}

On five\u00a0days, Mr. Trump went golfing,\u00a0and on two\u00a0he\u00a0made\u00a0limited\u00a0public statements. Here\u2019s an assessment.Jan.\u00a020Mr. Trump\u00a0overstated his support.

A\u00a0vetting\u00a0system\u00a0has existed since the 1980s and was modified after\u00a0the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\u00a0Refugees undergo multiple rounds of background checks from several federal agencies, in a process that\u00a0can take up to two years.Jan.\u00a027Jan.\u00a028Jan.\u00a029According to news reports, Mr. Obama\u2019s State Department temporarily stopped processing refugee applications from Iraq in 2011\u00a0after two Iraqi refugees were arrested on charges of trying to send money and supplies to Al Qaeda. But records from the State Department show that Iraqi refugees were still admitted to the United States every month in 2011.Jan.\u00a030Jan.\u00a031Feb.\u00a01 Feb.\u00a02Feb.\u00a03Feb.\u00a04Feb.\u00a05Feb.\u00a06Feb.\u00a07Mr. Trump inaccurately described the trend in the murder rate, which was much higher in the 1990s.Feb. 8This is cherry-picked. Mr. Trump linked to an Emerson College poll in which 48 percent called him dishonest compared with 53 percent for the news media. In other polls, a majority of respondents have characterized Mr. Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.Feb.\u00a09Feb.\u00a010Feb.\u00a011Feb.\u00a012Feb.\u00a013Feb.\u00a014Feb.\u00a015Feb.\u00a016Feb.\u00a017Feb.\u00a018Feb.\u00a019Feb.\u00a020Sweden processed a record number of asylum applications in 2015.

About 20 million have gained insurance because of the heath care law.March 14March 15Blaming Nafta\u00a0(the North American Free Trade Agreement)\u00a0for manufacturing job losses since 1994, as Mr. Trump did in Detroit,\u00a0ignores other, arguably more important factors\u00a0like automation, gains in productivity\u00a0and China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization.March 16March 17Mr. Trump emphasized the need to reform health care by cherry-picking the highest premium increases in the country. In 2017, premiums for the benchmark plan increased by 22 percent on average. Some places had higher increases (116 percent in Arizona, the only state in triple digits) and some lower (9 percent in Wyoming).March 18Following a news conference with\u00a0Chancellor Angela Merkel\u00a0of Germany, Mr. Trump tweeted a misleading critique of Germany\u2019s NATO\u00a0obligations. While Germany does fall short of allocating 2 percent of its G.D.P. to military spending, that money is not intended to be paid to NATO\u00a0or\u00a0the United States.March 19No false or misleading statements.Mr. Trump went golfing.March 20Mr. Trump overstated the trade deficit. The United States had a total goods trade deficit of $750 billion in 2016, but a services trade surplus of $250 billion\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a net deficit of $500 billion.March 21Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential directive requiring the use of American steel in pipelines\u00a0applies\u00a0only\u00a0to new projects. Construction for the two pipelines had already begun, and the executive orders greenlighting them do not require\u00a0use of\u00a0American steel.March 22March 23March 24Mr. Trump often promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act \u201cimmediately\u201d and listed\u00a0it as a legislative priority in his 100-day plan.March 25March 26A variation on\u00a0one of his most repeated claims, Mr. Trump again took\u00a0outsize\u00a0credit for savings in a contract for F-35 fighter jets. The Defense Department announced $600 million in cuts before Mr. Trump\u00a0had\u00a0jumped into\u00a0the negotiation project.March 27March 28March 29March 30Mr. Trump linked to a New York Post column that argued that a Jan. 20 article in The Times validated his accusation that Mr. Obama\u00a0had\u00a0wiretapped him. This is false.March 31Mr. Trump again touted many companies\u2019 job creation plans as a direct result of his election, but many of the investments were planned or announced before the election.April 1The Fox News report, which was based on one anonymous source, is not evidence for Mr. Trump\u2019s initial accusation that Mr. Obama spied on him. When Americans are caught in surveillance of foreign targets, their names are typically hidden unless a top official asks for the names to be revealed or \u201cunmasked.\u201d This does not mean that the names were leaked publicly.April 2In an interview with\u00a0The Financial Times, Mr. Trump continued to insist falsely that he had been validated because he meant \u201cwiretapped\u201d in a broad sense. Mr. Trump did use the word \u201cwiretap\u201d in quote\u00a0marks in two Twitter posts, but he specifically accused Mr. Obama of ordering his phones to be tapped in two other posts.April 3At a meeting with\u00a0the\u00a0Egyptian\u00a0president,\u00a0Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Mr. Trump again exaggerated his defense budget request.April 4Mr. Trump uttered versions of this claim twice in the same day, and it is misleading. The United States reported an overall trade deficit of about $92 billion in the first two months of 2017, which is on par with the last two months of 2016. Mr. Trump may have been referring to reports that the trade deficit declined by 9.6 percent from January to February\u00a0of this year, but month-to-month fluctuations are common.April 5April 6Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Mr. Trump again claimed\u00a0undue\u00a0credit for over $728 million in savings on F-35 fighter jets.April 7Border apprehensions, the best gauge for border crossings, declined 64 percent from March 2016 to March 2017. But Mr. Trump\u2019s statement gives the impression that he was talking about a month-to-month decrease, which was about 35 percent from February to March 2017.April 8 to April 10No false or misleading statements.Mr. Trump went golfing.April 11April 12A\u00a0personnel shortage is largely his own doing, even by his own account. As of the day of his interview, Mr. Trump had yet to nominate anyone for 478 positions out of more than 533 key appointments. He told Fox News in February he didn\u2019t want to appoint \u201cbecause they\u2019re unnecessary to have.\u201dApril 13During a meeting with emergency medical workers, Mr. Trump boasted that he had done more against the Islamic State than Mr. Obama\u00a0had\u00a0in a fraction of the time. Under the Obama administration, a military coalition recaptured several major cities from the Islamic State and launched more than 17,000 airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration,\u00a0the Islamic State\u00a0had lost no major cities, and the coalition had conducted about 2,000 airstrikes.April 14No false or misleading statements.Mr. Trump went golfing.April 15No false or misleading statements.April 16Tens of thousands across the country took to the streets as part of Tax March to demand Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, which he has not released. Ezra Levin, a member of Tax March\u2019s executive committee, called Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet \u201cbogus and flat-out false.\u201dApril 17This is false. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly promised to declare China a currency manipulator,\u00a0and\u00a0he\u00a0labeled China that in an\u00a0interview with The Financial Times\u00a0in early April. But he told The Wall Street Journal later that month that he would no longer do so.April 18The gang in question, Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, precedes Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency by decades. By 2005, four years before Mr. Obama took office, the F.B.I. reported that MS-13 had 10,000 \u201chardcore members\u201d active, the same number cited by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the day of Mr. Trump\u2019s claim.April 19April 20April 21In an interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Trump misleadingly suggested NATO\u00a0had\u00a0changed after he\u00a0accused\u00a0it\u00a0of\u00a0not focusing on terrorism,\u00a0and cited a Wall Street Journal article from June 2016 about the alliance\u2019s creation of a new counterterrorism position.\u00a0NATO\u00a0has been engaged in counterterrorism efforts since 1980, and the position isn\u2019t considered a significant step.April 22No false or misleading statements.April 23Mr. Trump falsely suggested on Twitter that he had beaten Mrs. Clinton in the popular vote. In the April ABC/Washington Post poll\u00a0referred to\u00a0by Mr. Trump, 46 percent of voters said they voted for\u00a0Mrs.\u00a0Clinton and 43 percent for Mr. Trump. This is similar to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s popular-vote margin\u00a0from November.April 24Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall would not address several modes of drug trafficking from Mexican criminal networks. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s 2016 report, the most common method\u00a0of\u00a0transporting drugs is in concealed compartments in vehicles crossing ports of entry. Other methods\u00a0rely on\u00a0tunnels, drones and commercial cargo trains and buses. None of these\u00a0methods\u00a0would be prevented by a wall.April 25There are at least a dozen countries that have trade deficits with the United States, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil and Egypt.April 26Judge William H. Orrick of the United States\u00a0District Court blocked Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order to withhold money from sanctuary cities. While he is in\u00a0California,\u00a0the same state as the Ninth Circuit, he does not sit on the Ninth.April 27April 28On the eve of his first 100 days in office, Mr. Trump claimed unprecedented progress. Of course, any productivity comparison is subjective, but his claim is off by a few metrics.During Mr. Trump\u2019s first 90 days in office, he signed 28 bills into law and the Senate confirmed his nominee for Supreme Court justice. Mr. Trump had not signed into law any of the 10 pieces of major legislation in his 100-day plan. The White House has also pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s rollback of Obama-era regulations. At the same point, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had signed 76 bills into law, Mr. Obama had enacted a stimulus package and President George W. Bush had enacted major tax cuts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Moment of Truth", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byEditorialBut want it or not, that\u2019s where South Korea finds itself. And it need not prove disastrous: The fall of the president, Park Geun-hye, over arrant corruption marked the coming-of-age of a democracy that had hitherto regarded political malfeasance as a necessary adjunct of economic development. The challenge now is for the election of her successor to be an equally responsible exercise in selecting a president who can both advance the deep reforms demanded by the protesters and provide the intrepid leadership demanded by the military threat.The popular uprising against Ms. Park reflected more than indignation over the bribes she is accused of extorting with a shadowy confidante, Choi Soon-sil; it was a demand to end the cozy and sometimes collusive relationship between government and the family-controlled conglomerates that has dominated the economy for decades. In the best of times, that would be a tough task; the next president will enter office with Ms. Park on trial and Mr. Kim rattling missiles.The candidates have advanced similar programs: Both have promised reforms; both have emphasized the importance of the alliance with the United States while stressing the need for dialogue with the North. Yet many South Koreans, especially conservatives, seem to think that Mr. Ahn would be more likely to work well with the Trump administration than the left-leaning Mr. Moon.

{"Headline": "\u2018This Is Deadly Serious\u2019: French Parties Set Sights on Marine Le Pen", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisThe first-round showing by Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen represented an earthquake, as they effectively broke the French political establishment. On the right and the left, the two parties that have governed France for more than 50 years suffered a severe defeat. They have been pushed aside in a wave of popular anger over the country\u2019s stagnant economy and shaky security.The rapid-fire endorsements of Mr. Macron, coming from across the political spectrum, represented a dynamic that has always prevailed in France when the National Front approaches executive power \u2014 the cross-party, anti-far right alliance the French call the \u201cRepublican Front.\u201d The question now is whether that front can hold this time, as well.That sentiment was widely evident on Sunday in declarations from the political class, and from voters themselves. True, polls and prognosticators failed to predict Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, or the American presidential victory of Donald J. Trump. It is because of these unexpected shocks to the political status quo that many analysts are wary of prematurely writing off Ms. Le Pen. But early polling for the second round in France shows that Mr. Macron\u2019s margin over her is as high as 25 percent.One after another on Sunday night, and in quick succession, the grandees of the established parties urgently called for an anti-Le Pen vote, as if the real stakes of this year\u2019s election had suddenly been revealed.Fifteen years ago, when Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, shocked his compatriots by breaking through to the second round and again knocking out the Socialist Party, some Socialist voters went to the polls with clothespins on their noses, as they voted for the scandal-plagued candidate of the center-right, Jacques Chirac. Mr. Le Pen was dealt a crushing defeat.\u201cShe\u2019s clearly done better than in 2012,\u201d said Jo\u00ebl Gombin, a Front expert at the University of Picardy Jules Verne, calling it a half-victory. \u201cBut at the same time, the result is below what the Front was hoping for, and what the polls were saying.\u201dMr. Gombin said the results suggested the Front could also fare poorly in crucial legislative elections in June. In order to prevail against Mr. Macron, Ms. Le Pen must gain the votes of over half the Fillon supporters, Mr. Gombin has said. But no poll shows her as achieving that result within a Fillon electorate that is conservative but hardly radical.\u201cThe Front was unable to get voters on the right,\u201d Mr. Gombin said. \u201cAnd it does seem as though the dynamic of the Republican Front will prevail,\u201d he added. \u201cFor the moment, I can\u2019t say there will be any cracks in it.\u201dMr. Gombin predicted a rejection inside the Front of the centrist-oriented turn pushed by technocrats like Ms. Le Pen\u2019s closest adviser, Florian Philippot, and a return to its hard-right roots.Mr. Philippot was in television studios on Sunday night, ostensibly relishing the sharp ideological battle to come with Mr. Macron, who rejects Ms. Le Pen\u2019s economic protectionism and is strongly in favor of France\u2019s European partnerships.\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to impose this idea of patriotism at all levels,\u201d Mr. Philippot said. \u201cIt\u2019s really going to be about private interests\u201d \u2014 the Front regularly derides Mr. Macron as the candidate of the \u201cbanks,\u201d as he is a former investment banker \u2014 \u201cagainst the interests of the nation.\u201dBut at polling places on Sunday in Paris, voter after voter expressed fear of a Le Pen victory, even if there was no great enthusiasm for the youthful, untested Mr. Macron. Many said they had difficulty even stomaching the prospect of the National Front making it to the second round.\u201cThat Marine Le Pen is not in the second round \u2014 that\u2019s what I want,\u201d Fabienne Zellner, who runs a youth-aid agency, said outside a polling station in Paris\u2019s heavily immigrant 18th Arrondissement. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want.\u201dMyriam Bellehigue, a university professor in the more bourgeois Ninth Arrondissement, voted for Mr. Macron \u201cwithout much\u201d enthusiasm. \u201cBut, and I\u2019ve been saying it for weeks,\u201d she said, \u201cthe extremes are just not possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "French Markets Surge as Euro Withstands Attack From the Right", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The euro has avoided another existential crisis that might have wreaked havoc on Europe and the global economy. That was the conclusion investors divined from the first round of voting in the French presidential election, prompting exuberant buying on markets around the world on Monday.Those in control of money looked beyond the fact that Marine Le Pen, a far-right candidate bearing intense hostility to the euro, claimed a spot in the second round of balloting on May 7. Instead, they focused on polls showing that she was likely to be defeated, and by a lopsided margin, at the hands of her sole remaining opponent \u2014 Emmanuel Macron, a pro-European figure trusted by business leaders.For markets anxious about the prospect of a Le Pen presidency, it was as if a fire-breathing dragon hovering over the kingdom had been slain.Stocks on French exchanges surged to a nine-year high as a wave of relief washed over the commercial realm. The value of the euro climbed nearly 2 percent against the dollar before yielding some of those gains. The gap between interest paid on French sovereign debt and rock-solid German government bonds narrowed, an indication that investors were seeing diminishing risks. The optimism spread to the United States, with American stocks up more than 1 percent and investors selling off safe havens like Treasury bonds.The manic swings of the markets \u2014 first spooked by the possibility of a Le Pen presidency, then ecstatic over the apparent unlikelihood of that possibility \u2014 attest to the gnawing fear that the euro could still succumb to whatever blow history delivers next. The euro confronts a chronic shortage of faith in its ability to persevere, along with a surplus of threats to its existence.In recent years, the euro has survived enough Greek tragedy to fill an Aeschylus trilogy and has had sufficient brushes with Italian banks for an opera. It has endured a global financial shock, years of regional economic stagnation and no end of cross-border political accusations.As Ms. Le Pen appeared to see her electoral fortunes expand in recent months, the markets construed yet another direct threat to the euro\u2019s sustainability.Ms. Le Pen, the leader of the National Front party, has long disdained the euro as a threat to prosperity. She has pledged to convert French debt into a new national currency, an undertaking that could begin the euro\u2019s downfall. And she has vowed to renegotiate France\u2019s relationship with the European Union, threatening to upend the project of European integration that has prevailed on the Continent as an antidote to the brutalities of World War II.Her strength in polls in recent weeks prompted investors to demand greater returns on French government debt, a sign that the odds of default \u2014 however minute \u2014 were multiplying. Investors had been aggressively purchasing options that offered protection against a precipitous plunge in the value of the euro.Few gave credence to the prospect that Ms. Le Pen could actually deliver on her radical promises. Even if she were to shock pollsters and win, her party would almost certainly fall well short of claiming a majority in the French Parliament after legislative elections in June. She would be relegated to figurehead status, with governing handled by a prime minister selected by the party in command.Still, concern in the markets underscored the fundamental defects that have long compromised the euro. It is a structurally flawed currency, one adopted by 19 nations \u2014 known collectively as the eurozone \u2014 that operate without a unified political organization.Many argue that the euro was doomed from inception. It was conceived more as an idealistic reach for European cooperation than as a reasoned plan to manage a currency. The assumption was that shared money would spur greater European political integration.Instead, the euro has devolved into a major source of political acrimony across the Continent.In countries with their own money, bad economic times typically prompt governments to spend more to generate jobs and spur growth. Their currencies fall in value, making their goods cheaper on world markets and aiding exports.But countries in the eurozone cannot fully avail themselves of those benefits. The currency comes with rules limiting the size of budget deficits. Faced with hard times, governments using the euro have been forced to intensify the hurt on ordinary people by cutting pensions and other public outlays.As Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have slid into debt crises in recent years, they have accused Germany of self-serving inflexibility in demanding strict adherence to debt limits while refusing to transfer wealth to those in trouble. Germany and other northern countries have accused their southern brethren of failing to carry out changes \u2014 like making it easier to fire workers \u2014 that would make them more competitive.The crises have time and again exposed the structural flaws of the eurozone, and its tendency to generate more recrimination than action.\u201cYou have a basic situation in the eurozone now where it\u2019s like a half-built house,\u201d said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cAs long as that persists, a large number of investors are going to have existential doubts about the euro.\u201dThe latest alarm was being set off by France, one of the euro\u2019s charter members, and a pillar of the European Union. This was playing out against a backdrop of destabilizing events that once seemed impossible \u2014 the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States and the vote in Britain to abandon the European Union, also known as Brexit.In the same interview, she confirmed her desire to yank France free of the euro.\u201cIf we don\u2019t all leave the euro behind, it will explode,\u201d she said.Ms. Le Pen has since muted talk of renouncing the euro in favor of adding a parallel currency, the franc. But the threatened act of redenominating French debt would almost certainly lead to a downgrade of France\u2019s credit rating, bringing severe market consequences, said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy based in London.Mr. Rahman traced a potentially calamitous string of events that could play out after a victory by Ms. Le Pen. Even before parliamentary elections, she could appoint a temporary government while serving notice that France intended to renegotiate the terms of its membership with the European Union.\u201cHer room for maneuver is greater than people believe,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cShe will have interpreted her election as a massive mandate. It flows from Brexit, it flows from Trump, and she\u2019ll try to get as much of her agenda done while she is unrestrained.\u201dEven if she is stymied by political backlash, she could cause a volatile reaction in financial markets. Around the globe, central banks, sovereign wealth funds and asset managers hold some 700 billion euros (about $760 billion) in French government debt. A Le Pen presidency could scare them into unloading some of it, increasing borrowing costs for the French government and the business world.French banks could see consumers pull euros out of their accounts to be saved elsewhere. If that became a bank run, the consequences could become global, given that France\u2019s four largest banks are deeply intertwined in the international financial system.Most analysts dismiss such talk as apocalyptic. The French Parliament and Constitution would severely constrain a President Le Pen. Investors would grasp that. Still, in the run-up to the first round, the costs of protecting assets against government default grew in Italy, as well as in France.The fear was that if Ms. Le Pen were to win the presidency, the risks would proliferate. That would increase the costs of borrowing for businesses and households in Italy, Spain and Portugal, impeding job creation and economic activity, while perhaps forcing governments to cut services.That could generate public anger, stoking the fires of populism as Italy goes to the polls early next year. Enhanced electoral prospects in Italy for the Five Star Movement, which favors scuttling the euro, could result.In short, a victory by Ms. Le Pen would add momentum to Europe\u2019s crisis of confidence. It would inject greater dysfunction into European institutions, rendering them even less capable of alleviating economic troubles. And more strife has in recent times has translated into more support for the populist movements seeking to dismantle those institutions.\u201cIt would be devastating for the eurozone and the E.U. if she won,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said. \u201cIt would certainly paralyze the eurozone in terms of almost anything for at least five years.\u201dBut on Monday, as stock markets exulted and the euro climbed, that possibility had seemingly been rendered hypothetical.The euro \u2014 perpetually afflicted by doubt \u2014 had dodged the latest immediate threat to its permanence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Chinese Navigate Urban Sprawl", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Bike sharing is the latest obsession to grab the Chinese. In the past year, bike-sharing stations have popped up throughout major cities, helping fuel a resurgence of bike riding in the country\u2019s ever-expanding metropolises.The tech-driven bike-sharing companies have given China\u2019s smog-shrouded cities a bright new identity, one that their increasingly cosmopolitan, environmentally conscious dwellers are embracing, after enduring years of overcrowded public transportation and streets dominated by reckless car drivers. Anyone with a smartphone in most major cities can pick up a bike, drive it across town and drop it off, at a very low cost.For a society in breathless pursuit of progress and sophistication, the return of bike riding might seem like a turning back of the clock.Cycling\u2019s first wave of popularity began in the late 1970s, when economic reforms gradually eased the country out of the Mao-era destitution. Bikes were the earliest luxury goods, private property that, along with watches and sewing machines, was considered a must-have of affluent families. The limited supply was rationed. A bicycle cost more than twice the average monthly income of an urban family.The bicycle eventually became the main means of private transportation among urban dwellers and a potent symbol of personal freedom. A bachelor with a sturdy, stately Flying Pigeon \u2014 the most popular bike brand in the early days \u2014 was one with whom a girl could start a life, the saying went.The soaring number of bikes on the streets established a new order to city life. Crowds of pedestrians gave way to steady flows of riders. A small space of privacy in an otherwise rigidly controlled society had been opened up. Surrounded by a sea of bikers, young couples floated on two wheels, one steering and the other on the crossbar, whispering into each other\u2019s ears.This taste for liberty and prosperity helped engender greater expectations. In the spring of 1989, calls for a pro-democracy protest summoned tens of thousands of students and workers to Tiananmen Square, many on their bikes. After the declaration of martial law brought public transportation to a halt, messengers cycled from one university campus to the next, delivering strategies and updates. Sympathetic citizens turned their bikes into food stalls and water stands to serve protesters.In the aftermath of the massacre, images of piles of bikes, crushed and burned beyond recognition, were played repeatedly on state television. A lesson of freedom having gone too far.By the early 2000s, the Chinese began spending their newfound wealth on cars, the latest symbol of middle-class success, and bicycles were pushed off the roads. Cars flooded the streets and took over bike lanes, and bicycle riding became dangerous.Economic forces have helped fuel the comeback. The global wave of tech entrepreneurship has reached China. Backed by a state intent on increasing domestic innovation, flush investment firms are looking for the next big thing. And the public is increasingly accustomed to the comfort and free choice of a capitalist economy. Meanwhile, cities keep growing, and public transportation can\u2019t keep up.There have been some negative side effects of the bike-sharing boom. In many urban areas, carelessly parked bikes encroach on limited sidewalk space already crowded with pedestrians and street vendors. Bikes with missing wheels and shattered frames pop up in bushes and rivers. Cases of theft and accidents have made newspaper headlines.Some city governments have responded with new regulations. Some, such as parking rules and time limits for companies to return customers\u2019 deposits upon request, have been met with applause. But others are clear examples of bureaucratic overreach.The southern city of Shenzhen, for example, plans to record all individuals who violate its bike-user code in a state-run social credit database. Shanghai asks shared bikes to be scrapped after three years of use and places strict age and height limits on riders. Beijing has declared much of its historical district off-limits to shared-bike parking.These efforts to regulate bike sharing are misguided \u2014 and risk sapping the vitality from the industry. In the past decade, China\u2019s transportation ecosystem has shaped itself around the automobile boom, with roads constantly widened to accommodate the cars, to the detriment of sidewalks and bike lanes. It\u2019s time the government turns its attention to more cycling-friendly development. Working with, not against, bike-sharing companies is a good first step.Users of shared-bike apps typically say that bike-sharing helps them solve their \u201clast mile\u201d problem by offering a way to cover the distance between public transportation stops and their final destinations.City planners need to do their part. Chinese urbanites, having gained the material freedom to travel in style, now desire a habitat hospitable to biking.Helen Gao is a social policy analyst at a research company and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Caused the Depression? A New Overview Spreads the Blame.", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.For scholars and popular writers alike, the Great Depression has long been a kind of economic Rorschach test. Free marketers look at the economic disaster and blame the Smoot-Hawley tariff, which inaugurated a global trade war; monetarists attack the Federal Reserve for its tight-money policies; Keynesians berate Herbert Hoover for his attempts to balance the budget as the crisis worsened.The divergence of opinions concerning the Depression makes the task of writing a comprehensive history about it difficult. Add to that the fact that it played out on a global stage, with very different consequences for different countries, and it\u2019s understandable why we don\u2019t have more books on the subject.These challenges haven\u2019t deterred Charles R. Morris, a writer of popular but rigorous works of economic history. In \u201cA Rabble of Dead Money\u201d \u2014 a title borrowed from Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2019s description of the stock market crash \u2014 Morris aims to give the reader a full account. He also offers an overview of the policy response, though here the story is largely restricted to the United States.While many works of popular history tend to shy away from discussing the scholarship that informs their writing, Morris does a splendid job of introducing the fierce academic debates over the Depression\u2019s causes. These excurses, scattered throughout the book, help illuminate why it is so hard to identify a single cause of the catastrophe.One area where Morris avoids placing blame is Wall Street, and he cites scholars who believe the crash of 1929 had almost nothing to do with the ensuing crisis. Morris concedes that the stock market was due for a correction, but he plays down the kind of financial shenanigans that have occupied other writers, save for a detailed account of the mountains of leverage amassed by the public utility magnate Samuel Insull.Morris instead turns his attention to the other side of the Atlantic. \u201cAll of the tangled threads that twisted together to create the catastrophe of the Depression originated in Europe,\u201d Morris declares, though he concedes that the policy response of the United States (along with that of Britain, Germany and France) didn\u2019t help matters. \u201cIt is hard to conceive of the Great Depression absent World War I,\u201d he says, and he begins his book with the colossal military miscalculations that sent Europe into the abyss. Most of the remainder of the book dwells at great length on the \u201cdisordered aftermath\u201d of this conflict overseas, which he believes set the stage for the collapse.This is refreshing, and Morris traces in considerable detail the economic effects of the war, beginning with Europe\u2019s abandonment of the gold standard and, even worse, the attempts to return to it at all costs (France gets particular blame for its \u201csemi-messianic drive \u2026 to force a gold-based deflation on the rest of Europe\u201d). His argument derives in no small part from the economist Barry Eichengreen\u2019s \u201cGolden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919-1939,\u201d and it\u2019s good to see these ideas given such prominence.Still, the average reader may not delight in being subjected to discussions of the nuts and bolts of war reparations and the endless negotiations in Europe over the gold standard. Morris does cover simultaneous developments in the United States, but these tend to showcase the underlying strength and resilience of the American economy. Though Morris acknowledges that the agricultural sector was a \u201claggard,\u201d and grants that the stock market was getting a little frothy by 1929, he insists it was \u201cinternational developments that pushed the United States over the brink\u201d and into the Great Depression.Indeed, if there\u2019s a culprit here, it\u2019s Europe, especially Germany with France a close second. At times, Morris goes out of his way to pillory Germany. \u201cThe Germans paid the reparations by borrowing from the war\u2019s victors, and rubbed it in by defaulting on the loans,\u201d he notes in a typical comment. In this account, Weimar Germany comes across as a nation of hypocritical deadbeats.More than a few historians might quibble with such a characterization, but the focus on Europe also distracts us from what was going on in the United States. Morris offers a quite comprehensive account of the American economy in this decade, but it is one that tends to emphasize the positive. To be sure, there was much to celebrate: The decade witnessed significant gains in productivity, driven by the automobile industry and \u201cthe marriage of electricity with mechanical production.\u201d He does an excellent job sketching these developments without succumbing to a simplistic entrepreneur-as-hero narrative.But there was more going on at this time. Two related trends merit more than a mention. The first was the enormous and growing role of finance. Thomas Philippon, an economist at New York University, has published papers on the financial service industry\u2019s share of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, or G.D.P. In the 1920s, finance\u2019s share of G.D.P. doubled, with most of the growth taking place in the second half of the decade.A comparable boom in the financial services industry took place in the lead-up to the 2008 crisis, and in both cases it\u2019s hard to read these as anything but a misallocation of economic resources. In each instance, the metastatic growth of finance, along with staggering amounts of debt, yielded towers of leverage that came crashing down. And then, as now, this had real effects on the larger economy.As in our own age, the growing dominance of finance in the 1920s went hand in hand with another trend: rising inequality. While Morris grudgingly acknowledges this fact, his claim that \u201cthe good times of the 1920s were such that even people on the bottom rungs of the ladder \u2026 could claim a modest share of the booming consumer economy\u201d is more typical of his rosy view.So, too, is his account of a black sharecropper buying a Model T with cash, to which he devotes three pages. But this was an anomaly. Yes, more people could afford more things, but most of those things came by purchasing on credit, not rising wages. Inequality skyrocketed in the 1920s, and the reason that this unpleasant fact could be ignored was because of the increase of personal debt and financial intermediation, much like the years preceding 2008.There is a growing literature within economics that examines the possibility that inequality, household debt and financial crises may be related, but Morris shows little interest in this kind of work, and he dismisses Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez\u2019s groundbreaking analysis of inequality as a \u201choary theory,\u201d a breezy rejection of some of the most widely discussed work in economics in recent years.Generally, however, Morris is remarkably evenhanded, giving both sides of scholarly debates in deep detail. This is particularly the case in his coverage of the New Deal, where he weighs the practical effects of the dizzying array of policies begun by Roosevelt, from his devaluation of the dollar to the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps. And Morris explains in accessible prose how economists have used modeling to study the New Deal (he wryly notes that this \u201cis still a work in progress \u2014 if only because results are often suspiciously consistent with the political dispositions of the modeler\u201d).\u201cA Rabble of Dead Money\u201d is a deft synthesis, blending colorful accounts of the past with the scholarly literature of the present. It may not be the last word on the Great Depression, but it is hard to imagine a more accessible and entertaining introduction to the subject.A picture caption on April 23 with a review of Charles R. Morris\u2019s \u201cA Rabble of Dead Money\u201d referred imprecisely to the location of the crowd of speculators shown on Oct. 24, 1929. While the speculators were indeed gathered at the New York Stock Exchange, they had spilled across the street to what is now the Federal Hall National Memorial, which is the building shown in the picture \u2014 not the stock exchange.Stephen Mihm is the author of \u201cA Nation of Counterfeiters: Capitalists, Con Men, and the Making of the United States\u201d and, with Nouriel Roubini, \u201cCrisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance.\u201d He teaches history at the University of Georgia.Advertisement"}

During his final illness, my wife and I visited him, though it was hard to travel to his remote home. We flew cross-country again to pay our respects at his funeral. But my sister-in-law excluded me from everything. I was refused admission to the pre-service meeting with the clergyman. I was omitted from printed obituaries (though there was room for his dog), and none of the eulogies mentioned a surviving brother. Given this disrespect, how should I behave toward his family?ANONYMOUSI am sorry for your loss. But let\u2019s remember that the disrespect you feel came from a woman who was grieving the fresh loss of her husband and daily companion. I don\u2019t minimize your loss; you grew up with your brother. But after 20 years of more perfunctory contact, your pain is probably more existential than focused on him. Your sister-in-law lost her mate.Your assessment may also be on the money. She may resent your failure to keep in closer touch. (She may also have been exhausted from caretaking during his illness and zonked out with grief.) But after such a long absence from his life, did you really expect a meaningful voice in creating his funeral service? Your omission from his obituary and eulogy seem like more pointed slights. Still, I direct you to the high road.In answer to your question \u2014 \u201chow should I behave?\u201d \u2014 I hope you choose compassion and sympathy, even if your sister-in-law was mean. My first choice is for you to call her and ask how she\u2019s getting along. But I\u2019ll settle for your ripping up that poison-pen letter that you, and many of us, would be composing in our heads.The woman seated next to me on an airplane asked if I would switch seats with her friend, who was in the middle seat of the row behind us, so they could sit together. I had an aisle seat, which I greatly prefer, so I said no. The woman began to yell at me and make a scene. I try to be kind; I would have switched for a parent with a small child. But how much of my convenience should I sacrifice for a stranger? Would you have switched seats?ROBINProbably not. In the micro-economy of airplanes, everyone knows that an aisle seat trumps a middle one. The unpleasant woman next to you asked you to downgrade for her sole convenience. You were not obliged to accommodate her. I too might have acceded to her request if it involved a small child or an elderly person or the prospect of sitting next to Joan Didion. But these exceptions would be ad hoc and require a level of charm in the asking.The moment the woman next to you began raging (or frankly, became even mildly unpleasant), I would have disengaged and pressed the call button for the flight attendant. Flight crew can sometimes be helpful in facilitating multipronged moves that allow friends to sit together, while respecting the economy of aisle-, middle- and window-seat values.I recently took a job, working for a person I\u2019ve known for several years. She recruited me heavily. Now that I\u2019ve been here for six months, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good fit. It\u2019s a new organization, and my responsibilities keep shifting. And I\u2019ve just received an offer that would allow me to live in the same city as my partner (we\u2019ve been living apart since I began graduate school). But I don\u2019t want to leave my boss in a bad spot. Your thoughts?ANONYMOUSTake the job in the city where your partner lives, assuming it\u2019s a better fit with your skills and personality. And use all your might to negotiate the longest notice period possible (or that your boss would like from you). I admire your concern for her, but you are also responsible for developing your career and relationship with your partner. Even if you play this perfectly, your boss may still be annoyed with you. But as long as you behave with integrity, you can\u2019t ask more of yourself.As usual, I went to Passover Seder at my older sister\u2019s house. I love her, but she was as controlling as ever. She micromanaged everything from the minute we walked in the door. I am beginning to feel that I can no longer celebrate the freedom of the Israelites at a home where I am imprisoned by my sister\u2019s bossy hostessing. May I stop going?JENNYWhile I applaud your personalized dramatization of Passover, I am afraid that I cannot play Moses in leading you out of your sister\u2019s Egypt. Take a look at the first question in this column. Do you want to end up like that? Speak to your sister (gently) about loosening the reins. Offer to help with the music or some other feature she doesn\u2019t care much about, and keep nudging until she makes a space for you.For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com or SocialQ on Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen Advance in French Election", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Supported byThe result was a full-throated rebuke of France\u2019s traditional mainstream parties, setting the country on an uncertain path in an election that could also decide the future of the European Union.It is the first time in the nearly 59-year history of France\u2019s Fifth Republic that both of the final candidates are from outside the traditional left-right party structure. Together, they drew less than half the total votes cast in a highly fractured election.Even before the official tallies were announced, the political establishment was rallying behind Mr. Macron, warning of the dangers of a victory by Ms. Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front, though few analysts give her much of a chance of winning the May 7 runoff.\u201cThe French people have decided to put me at the top in the first round of the vote,\u201d Mr. Macron told jubilant supporters at a rally in Paris. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the honor and the responsibility that rest on my shoulders.\u201dDetailed maps show sharp differences between the bases of support for Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s success was a victory for people who oppose the European Union and for those who want to see more \u201cFrance first\u201d policies to restrict immigration, protect French industry and limit public signs of Muslim faith, including the wearing of head scarves.\u201cThe great debate will finally take place,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said on Twitter. \u201cFrench citizens need to seize this historic opportunity.\u201dPolitical experts said the vote showed a new, profound cleavage in French politics around globalization, as well as France\u2019s relationship with the European Union.It is not that the left-right divide no longer matters \u2014 after all, voters gave roughly 40 percent of the vote to various versions of the traditional left and right \u2014 but that it is now complicated by the crosscutting politics of globalization versus anti-globalization.With 97 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Macron had 23.9 percent, Ms. Le Pen had 21.5 percent, the mainstream right candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon had nearly 20 percent, and the far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon had 19.6 percent.When Ms. Le Pen spoke to supporters in the small town of H\u00e9nin-Beaumont in northern France, although the results were not yet definitive, she sounded victorious.She not only made it to the second round for the first time, but also got a higher percentage of votes than she did in 2012, and a higher percentage than her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, did in 2002, when he made it to the second round as the National Front candidate and faced Jacques Chirac.Ms. Le Pen said the outcome was \u201can act of French pride, that of a people who are raising up their heads, that of a people sure of their values and confident of the future.\u201dThat future would be a perilous one under the National Front, others warned. Bernard Cazeneuve, the sitting Socialist prime minister, called Ms. Le Pen\u2019s project \u201cdangerous and sectarian\u201d and said it would \u201cimpoverish, isolate and divide\u201d the country.\u201cIt will inevitably lead to the end of Europe and of the euro, and, eventually, to France\u2019s relegation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe National Front cannot be the future of our country.\u201dFor now, voters narrowly embraced Mr. Macron\u2019s centrist calls for change over more strident appeals from the far left and the far right for France to fortify itself against immigration and globalization.In contrast, Mr. Macron, in his address to supporters as the returns were still being tabulated Sunday night, emphasized that he wanted to be the president of all of France. He promised \u201cto bring together the French people,\u201d clearly recognizing that if he wins the runoff, as is expected, he will have to lead a politically fractured country.Four candidates with markedly different views came within a few points of one another in the vote on Sunday, suggesting that the fight about what vision of France will dominate the future is far from over.Both Mr. Macron\u2019s supporters and those of Ms. Le Pen were cheering madly at their respective candidates\u2019 headquarters, with Ms. Le Pen\u2019s loyalists dancing in the street outside the place where she was speaking in H\u00e9nin-Beaumont.The two finalists could hardly be more different on the big questions facing France: globalization, immigration and French identity. Beyond that, they represent completely different faces of France.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s voters want a government that protects them from the vicissitudes of the marketplace and closes its borders to outsiders, re-establishing the frontiers that have been largely erased by the European Union.Although Ms. Le Pen has younger, more high-tech voters, she also represents the France that feels left behind: the workers whose jobs have moved to cheaper countries, such as those in Eastern Europe and Asia.She represents young people who have to go to work early in life to help support their families, and who do not have the advanced degrees that afford them a good income. And she represents people who feel threatened by the immigrants thronging to Europe.\u201cHe is the candidate of the financial part of the world,\u201d Ms. Lahondes, 19, said in an interview at a bar that had been rented out by the local National Front federation. \u201cHe is the candidate of the European Union.\u201dMr. Macron represents a more educated and cosmopolitan France. His voters are not all privileged by any means, but they believe that looking beyond the country\u2019s borders will enrich them in every way, economically and culturally. Mr. Macron\u2019s challenge will be to convince more of the French that globalism has as many rewards as it does costs.\u201cGlobalism has positive effects, but it also increases precariousness and inequalities,\u201d said Thomas Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, a political-science professor at Sciences Po.\u201cThe obstacles put on my path were too numerous, too cruel,\u201d he said, conceding defeat Sunday night.In the meantime, Mr. Macron appears to have been in the right place at the right time, with mainstream candidates falling on either side and a far-right candidate whom many in France cannot imagine having represent the country.That does not mean that people favor him, but rather that he was the \u201cleast worst\u201d vote: an especially weak position for a candidate with no real party base behind him.\u201cI chose a \u2018useful vote\u2019 for the first round, and it really breaks my heart \u2014 it\u2019s the first time I\u2019m doing this,\u201d said Monica Craignou, 40, who works in digital development in Paris.Others saw in Mr. Macron the possibility for France to keep up with global changes. \u201cWe need someone young,\u201d said Karine Filhoulaud, a 45-year-old web editor, who was at Mr. Macron\u2019s victory party and danced alone long after the crowds had left. \u201cHe lives the transition: the environmental one, the digital one, the societal one.\u201dReporting was contributed by Beno\u00eet Morenne from Paris and Fontainebleau; Elian Peltier from H\u00e9nin-Beaumont; Lilia Blaise, Pamela Rougerie, Aurelien Breeden and Liz Alderman from Paris; and Camilla Schick from Angers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Economy May Be Stuck in a Near-Zero World", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewWhen the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to close to zero during the financial crisis, it was an extraordinary move. The central bank had hit the limits of conventional monetary policy, leaving the recovery to sputter along with less help than it needed.Now, with that crisis at last behind us, the Fed has begun raising interest rates, and it may be tempting to view its brush with rock-bottom rates as a once-in-a-lifetime experiment and to assume that we are entering a more normal world.That\u2019s troubling for many reasons. If the Fed can\u2019t cut rates as much as required to fight a slowing economy, then recessions will become more common and more painful. It suggests an urgent need to reconsider how we will counter the next bout of bad economic news, preferably before it arrives. If monetary policy won\u2019t be enough, perhaps fiscal policy will be. Certainly, this is no time for complacency.In a nutshell, the American economy appears to have changed in a way that undermines the effectiveness of monetary policy but not fiscal policy, which may need to be wielded more actively.Put these pieces together, and a conservative guess is that in \u201cnormal times,\u201d the nominal interest rate \u2014 the neutral real interest rate plus inflation \u2014 has fallen from around 6 percent to 3 percent.That creates a serious problem for the Fed. Here\u2019s why: Most recessions can be cured by lowering rates by several percentage points. When interest rates were closer to 6 percent, the Fed could lift the economy with plenty of interest-rate leeway.This dynamic can feed on itself. The less ammunition the Fed has to blast the economy out of its malaise, the weaker and slower will be the recovery, making it more likely that the next bad shock will require the Fed to cut rates more than is feasible.In one set of simulations that you might call the good old days, they set the normal interest rate at 6 percent, and then let the Fed adjust rates as economic conditions evolved. In that environment, interest rates hit zero only around 2 percent of the time. This accords with the reality that the lower limit on interest rates simply was not a problem until recently.But times have changed. When the economists set the normal interest rate at 3 percent and let the Fed adjust interest rates as conditions warranted, rates moved down to zero percent and could not move any lower roughly a third of the time. In some of these cases, the economy didn\u2019t need much extra punch, and so this slowed the recovery only a little. In others, it was a more telling constraint, and it took years for the economy to return to normal.The problem is that a lower bound on interest rates creates a sharp asymmetry in how the economy works: It\u2019s relatively easy for the Fed to cool an overheating economy by raising rates. But when the economy is already cooling down, the central bank may not be able to cut rates enough to prevent a recession or to spur a strong recovery. Downturns will be deeper and more common than upswings. This means that, on average, output will be lower than it needs to be \u2014 perhaps more than a percentage point lower \u2014 and inflation will be lower than the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target. Joblessness will be more common, particularly during slumps.It is crucial, therefore, that macroeconomic policy adjusts to these problems before the next downturn hits.The Fed has already been experimenting with monetary policy, but it hasn\u2019t been enough. In the wake of the financial crisis, for example, it bought bonds in a program known as quantitative easing, cutting long-term interest rates once short-term rates were near zero. The resulting stimulus was relatively small, reducing long-term rates by only a fraction of a percentage point, and the program was politically unpopular.The authors suggest an alternative approach in which the Fed makes up for \u201cmissing stimulus\u201d by promising to keep rates lower, for longer periods. In their view, the Fed needs to make up for the interest rate cuts that it wishes it could have made, but couldn\u2019t. Promising this in the depths of a downturn would offer businesses reason to be optimistic, they say, boosting the recovery. The Fed would need to keep rates low, even as inflation overshot its target.It\u2019s a promising approach, but would people really believe the Fed\u2019s promises? I know a lot of central bankers, and I fear they are incapable of sitting still while inflation rises above their stated target.Perhaps the answer lies outside the Fed. It may be time to revive a more active role for fiscal policy \u2014 government spending and taxation \u2014 so that the government fills in for the missing stimulus when the Fed can\u2019t cut rates any longer. Given political realities, this may be best achieved by building in stronger automatic stabilizers, mechanisms to increase spending in bad times, without requiring Congressional action.There\u2019s an opportunity to wed this to President Trump\u2019s desire for more infrastructure spending. Rather than building more roads today as the economy approaches full employment, we should spend more when the economy is weak and the Fed is unable to provide enough stimulus. One way that this could be done is by automatically increasing the Highway Trust Fund when the federal funds rate hits zero and perhaps ramping up spending the longer that rates are stuck there. More roads would be built when they do the most good for the economy.This idea reverses a decades-long trend away from active fiscal policy. The general distrust of fiscal policy may well have made sense; many economists are more likely to trust the technocrats at the Fed to manage the business cycle than the election-driven politicians on Capitol Hill. But in a world of low interest rates in which the Fed is frequently hamstrung, we may not have that choice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s Next After Turkey\u2019s Referendum?", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey thought that Sunday\u2019s referendum on a set of amendments to the country\u2019s constitution would allow him to solidify his grip on power, uncontested. It\u2019s not proving as easy as he and his supporters might have hoped.Despite an uneven playing field, the \u201cyes\u201d campaign in support of the constitutional amendments failed to win with the wide margin that the president expected, and that he believed would legitimize his rule. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s side won with a slim 51 percent. Drastic regime change \u2014 like moving from a parliamentary system to a presidential one, with no checks and balances \u2014 should normally require a clear national consensus. The 49 percent \u201cno\u201d vote to the proposed constitutional amendments, especially when there is major concern over foul play, denies that consensus.Sunday\u2019s vote also proves that despite years of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authoritarian tactics, Turkish democracy still has a pulse. In fact, given the circumstances, the outcome of the referendum is a major victory for the opposition. Voters went to the polls under a state of emergency; the main opposition party was not allowed to mobilize its supporters; the most charismatic opposition leader is behind bars; and Mr. Erdogan has branded opponents of the presidential system as terrorists. The \u201cyes\u201d campaign received overwhelmingly more airtime, thanks to the government\u2019s tight grip on the news media. The ruling party in many places took down posters and billboards advocating a \u201cno\u201d vote.Independent election observers were not allowed to monitor the polls, and observers from opposition parties had their applications to observe polling procedures rejected by the election board. The same board made a last-minute decision on Sunday to make it harder to file allegations of ballot-box stuffing. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe said on Monday that \u201clate changes in counting procedures removed an important safeguard.\u201dDespite all of this \u2014 just the latest acceleration in Turkey\u2019s rapid descent into authoritarianism over the last few years \u2014 voters proved that they still believed in the democratic process enough to go to the polls.That could change, though. Many Turks fear that Sunday\u2019s vote was the last chance for their country\u2019s democracy. The constitutional amendments have now passed, and Turkey officially has a presidential system with no checks and balances. Mr. Erdogan can rule until 2029 and has the authority to pick judges and ministers; directly appoint the heads of the military and intelligence agencies, university rectors and senior bureaucrats; and issue laws by decree with very little oversight.How Mr. Erdogan will use his new powers will determine the fate of Turkish democracy. Will he listen to his polarized nation and try to heal the country by moving to the center? Or will he double down and continue his populist drive toward anti-Western nationalism? The razor-thin majority Mr. Erdogan captured calls for a reversal in his strategy ahead of presidential elections in 2019.First, Mr. Erdogan might have to strike a deal with the Kurds, whom he has been demonizing since 2015. After his party lost its parliamentary majority that June, he sidelined the legitimate Kurdish political movement by jailing its leaders and pursued a heavy-handed military response to attacks by the Kurdistan Workers Party, better known as the P.K.K. That helped him win the support of hard-line Turkish nationalist voters who have a strong antipathy to the Kurds.But Mr. Erdogan\u2019s nationalist allies seem to have disappointed him on Sunday, as large numbers of them across the country voted against the constitutional amendments. He did, however, get more support than expected from Kurdish voters, among whom many conservatives believe Mr. Erdogan is the only politician who can broker a peace deal. If the freshly empowered president decides to return the favor in order to keep some of this Kurdish support, negotiations with the Kurds might resume before 2019.Peace with the Kurds would not only bring votes \u2014 it would also stabilize Turkey\u2019s shaky economy, and in the process rehabilitate Mr. Erdogan\u2019s popularity. After several years of strong growth, chronic political risk and uncertainty have hampered Turkey\u2019s development in recent years as foreign investors and domestic consumers both lost confidence in the country. Turkey\u2019s tourism industry has been hit hard by the wave of terrorist attacks. Mr. Erdogan has plenty of incentive to want to fix this situation.Sunday\u2019s referendum also proved that Mr. Erdogan lost support in almost all major urban centers, including Istanbul, where he has never lost an election since he ran for mayor in 1994. Mr. Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., need a new strategy to lure back the urban, educated people who used to support them but now feel alienated by the president\u2019s authoritarian policies.This will not be easy. Throughout his career, Mr. Erdogan has thrived on polarization. After his party lost its parliamentary majority in June 2015, he managed to once again consolidate power by injecting fear, demonizing the Kurds and lashing out at the West. The failed coup attempt last summer helped him purge his opponents from state institutions as he projected himself and the presidential system as the only alternative to further chaos.He seems to have succeeded in this objective. But Sunday\u2019s vote also proves that he has lost ground. To be able to run a deeply divided country and ensure a comfortable win in 2019, he has to move to the center, set a less polarizing tone and heal the wounds the other 50 percent of the country has been suffering under his 15-year rule. Otherwise, more instability and chaos await.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Harvard Business School Has Reshaped American Capitalism", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.When the Harvard Business School was founded in 1908, the first entirely graduate-level professional business program in the country was described by the future Harvard president Abbott Lawrence Lowell as a \u201cgreat\u201d but \u201cdelicate experiment.\u201d Today the school is indisputably great, but hardly delicate. It accepted just 12 percent of nearly 10,000 M.B.A. applicants in 2016. Eighty-nine percent of those who were accepted attended, which means that Harvard remains the overwhelming first choice among graduate schools of business, despite occasional rankings that put Stanford, Yale or Northwestern ahead of it. There are more than 76,000 living Harvard M.B.A. alumni, 33 percent of whom live outside the United States, forming what is very likely the most potent network of any graduate school.The marriage of Harvard\u2019s prestige and intellectual pedigree to overtly moneymaking pursuits has yielded an institution that not only teaches the fundamentals of business education but also provides its soon-to-be-wealthy graduates with \u201cunrivaled opportunity,\u201d and has become a \u201cmoney machine unto itself,\u201d as Duff McDonald puts it in his sweeping survey of the school\u2019s history and influence.But how and why that might be the case isn\u2019t really what interests McDonald, the author of previous books about McKinsey, the consulting firm, and JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon. In \u201cThe Golden Passport,\u201d he\u2019s determined to call the Harvard Business School to account, citing its founding doctrine, which was to develop \u201ca heightened sense of responsibility among businessmen\u201d (and eventually women) who \u201cwill handle their current business problems in socially constructive ways.\u201d In that regard, McDonald is scathing in his critique: Harvard Business School has not only \u201cproven an enormous failure,\u201d but its very success has made it positively \u201cdangerous.\u201dHe drives home the point in chapter after chapter, picking up steam in more recent decades: Harvard, he maintains, provided the ideological underpinnings for the junk-bond-induced takeover mania and resulting scandals of the 1980s; the corporate scandals of the 2000s; the egregious increase in the pay gap between chief executives and ordinary employees; the real estate mortgage bubble and ensuing financial crisis; even the election of Donald Trump. In McDonald\u2019s view, the school has contributed to pretty much every bad thing that has happened in American business and the economy in the last century. In the wake of whatever scandal or financial collapse or recession to which it has contributed, it wipes its hands, distances itself and still has the nerve to put forth its experts as the solution to problems.In virtually every instance, McDonald contends, Harvard has obsessively pursued money, sending a disproportionate number of its graduates to consulting firms beginning in the 1950s (it was all but synonymous with McKinsey), to Wall Street in the 1980s and to entrepreneurial start-ups once initial public offerings became the rage in the 1990s \u2014 and provided intellectual justifications for its actions. Much of that wealth found its way back to the school itself. Its professors earn enormous sums as consultants to businesses populated by their former students, who also give generously to their alma mater: Its endowment stood at $3.3 billion by 2015, a dedicated portion of the university\u2019s enormous $32.7 billion.McDonald\u2019s criticism of Michael Jensen, now an emeritus professor, is especially withering. As he sees it, Jensen bears major responsibility for the rapacious hostile takeovers and the obsession with stock prices and short-term results that led to the Enron and WorldCom scandals, as well as for the emergence of outlandishly high chief executive pay.Jensen came to the business school in 1984, just as the junk-bond-fueled takeover boom was gaining steam, and he became a full-time faculty member in 1989. Undeniably one of the most influential business theorists of modern times, he advocated an \u201cagency\u201d theory of management in which management\u2019s sole duty was to maximize shareholder value. This upended the long-held \u201cstakeholder\u201d model, in which management was seen as having broader obligations to a corporation\u2019s workers, customers and communities.Jensen\u2019s theories had simplicity and consistency: If all that matters is shareholder value, then hostile takeovers, leveraged buyouts and other forms of financial engineering are fine as long as they boost share prices, no matter that battalions of workers have to be fired and community relations damaged. Jensen also championed share-based executive compensation on the grounds that no matter how much executives were paid, shareholders benefited. This was an idea that swept corporate America. McDonald notes that in 1992, the C.E.O.s of Fortune 500 firms made an average of $2.7 million a year. By 2000, the average was $14 million.Just about every premise of the \u201cagency\u201d model, McDonald says, has now been punctured, but only long after the damage has been done. An obsession with stock prices and short-term results was the motive for many of the accounting scandals of the 2000s, which were designed to prop up share prices, and as a result, high executive pay. Even Jensen eventually had to concede that the liberal use of stock options as executive compensation had become \u201cmanagerial heroin.\u201dJensen is just one of many examples of the insidious relationship between Harvard Business School theory and real-world calamities in \u201dThe Golden Passport,\u201d but it seems worth asking: Is McDonald\u2019s broadside fair? Apart from a few brief quotations from his published work, we don\u2019t hear from Jensen himself, or any of the other still-living culprits McDonald identifies. It\u2019s hard to fault McDonald, who reports that Harvard Business School \u201cshut me out entirely\u201d when he sought cooperation, and pretty much shut down everyone who works there. That seems a shame. McDonald insists he isn\u2019t \u201canti-business-school\u201d (he attended Wharton), nor is he \u201canti-wealth.\u201d Nonetheless, he says he found the rejection \u201cliberating.\u201dBut I missed a greater sense of balance. It doesn\u2019t seem fair, to take one major example, to blame Harvard for the recent financial crisis. While their actions remain a subject of spirited debate, the H.B.S. graduates assembled by McDonald \u2014 starting with former President George W. Bush, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and former S.E.C. Chairman Christopher Cox \u2014 are credited by many with mitigating the damage and saving the country from an even worse catastrophe. To take just one counterexample, the young former Goldman Sachs investment banker Fabrice Tourre, one of the few Wall Street figures actually found guilty of civil fraud for his role in the kind of complex mortgage deals that contributed to the crisis, is a graduate of France\u2019s \u00c9cole Centrale and Stanford University. (France\u2019s prestigious \u201cGrandes \u00c9coles\u201d \u2014 not H.B.S. \u2014 appear to have generated a disproportionate number of the financial engineers who unwittingly helped cause the crisis.) Given the large number of Harvard Business grads in high-ranking executive positions, it\u2019s inevitable that many would be ensnared in what turned into a global catastrophe. It\u2019s a shame that some of them didn\u2019t see the looming disaster and sound an alarm.

Gerald turned his back on a lucrative career in private equity to co-found a public interest organization to connect M.B.A. graduates with mission-driven businesses.

{"Headline": "Is Russia Testing Trump?", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsThis week Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is making his first diplomatic visit to Russia, where he\u2019s likely to press Moscow on its handling of Syria, which he has called \u201cincompetent.\u201dBut Mr. Tillerson should recognize that Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria is only one example of the increasingly active, and disruptive, role that President Vladimir Putin has been playing on the world stage since Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.In January, Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, most likely at the direction of Mr. Putin, ramped up their fight against Ukrainian government forces, bringing the violence there to its highest level in a year and a half. This is a direct challenge to the Minsk Agreements \u2014 signed by Russia and Ukraine, engineered by Germany and France, and backed by the United States \u2014 designed to freeze the war and pave the way to restoring peace.In mid-February, Mr. Putin decreed that Russia would recognize the passports issued by two separatist governments in eastern Ukraine. Later that month, in a move approved or at least condoned by Mr. Putin, the breakaway territory of Luhansk in Ukraine announced that the Russian ruble would become its official currency. Both actions are examples of the creeping assertion of Russian sovereignty over parts of eastern Ukraine.Again in January, Russia moved troops near the border with Belarus, designed to pressure Belarus to accept an increased Russian military presence on its territory. And in March, the Kremlin ordered the incorporation of the armed forces in South Ossetia, one of two breakaway territories in Georgia, into the Russian military.Meanwhile, last month Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the top American general in Europe, told Congress that Russia and the Afghan Taliban are growing increasingly close, suggesting that the Kremlin is supplying the insurgent group with weapons. Mat\u00e9riel support would be a significant escalation of Russia\u2019s involvement with the Taliban, and it would undercut American efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. It would also put the 9,000 American and 5,000 NATO troops there at increased risk.Two weeks ago, the commander of American forces in Africa, Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, observed that Russia\u2019s role in Libya is deepening, with its special forces on the ground in Egypt just over the border with Libya. He noted Russian support for the powerful Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, who is resisting the United Nations-recognized government in Tripoli.And of course, last week Russia denied that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used sarin gas against his own people. This is the latest in Russia\u2019s broad and deep diplomatic and military support for the Syrian dictator, who has killed some 200,000 of his people and displaced half his population.All of these steps have a common thread. Mr. Putin, who wants political control over neighboring countries and to be seen as a great global power, is testing President Trump. He wants to see how far he can go until we say \u201cenough.\u201d While Mr. Putin must realize the Trump administration is unlikely to be able to roll back Western sanctions on Russia, as Mr. Putin originally hoped, he may think Mr. Trump\u2019s still unexplained infatuation with him will allow him to move aggressively, without American resistance.What has the Trump administration done to respond to all of the above? There have been strong words from Vice President Mike Pence and Defense Secretary James Mattis, and particularly from the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. But so far there has been no condemnation from Mr. Trump and, most important, no action.The administration needs to set out a clear policy toward Russia. It must communicate clearly what is unacceptable and strengthen its deterrence, and in that way establish its negotiating position, so that it can effectively and realistically explore areas for cooperation.The signaling needs to start with the president. He must deliver a speech asserting American interest in trans-Atlantic security and speak resolutely on the right of states to choose democracy, a free-market economy and membership in NATO or the European Union.America\u2019s Russia policy must include continued funding for troop presence and exercises on NATO territory, and training and equipment for non-NATO partners at risk from Moscow. At the same time, it should restart discussions with Russia on nuclear, conventional and now cyber-arms control to lower the temperature in areas of potential danger.The president must also condemn Russia\u2019s continued support for Mr. Assad and the deliberate Russian bombing of civilians in Syria, and press for Russia to support a transition in Syria. Bombing an airfield isn\u2019t enough.And of course, the administration must denounce Russia\u2019s interference in American elections and make clear that such behavior will not be tolerated again.Whether the president likes it or not, Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia views the United States as its adversary, and it is working to undermine America around the world. Mr. Putin has accomplished a great deal in only a few weeks. President Trump needs to say \u201cenough.\u201d He can start by having his secretary of state deliver that message when he visits Moscow this week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration to Take Harder Tack on Trade With China", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byPALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 The Trump administration is planning to roll out its first concrete measures against China on trade, administration officials said on Thursday, hardening its position toward America\u2019s largest trading partner just as President Trump welcomed President Xi Jinping of China to his seaside club here for their first face-to-face meeting.Sometime after Mr. Xi leaves the United States, these officials said, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order targeting countries that dump steel into the American market, an aggressive measure aimed mainly at China.It is unclear exactly what the order would do or how harsh it would be, but it would be designed to begin to make good on Mr. Trump\u2019s promise during the campaign to redress China\u2019s huge trade surplus with the United States.In addition, an official said, the White House is moving out a senior economy policy official, Andrew Quinn, who had helped negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature trade initiative.Mr. Quinn had become the subject of a battle between two camps in the White House: economic nationalists, who wanted him out, and more mainstream backers of free trade, who defended him.Taken together, these developments constituted a potentially significant victory for the hard-liners, coming off a string of setbacks in their efforts to persuade the president to deliver on the most combative anti-free-trade planks of his presidential campaign.But the ultimate outcome of this policy debate is still far from clear, several officials said. Mr. Trump does not plan to confront Mr. Xi with the most aggressive of his campaign threats: a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods.Nor is the United States likely to designate China a currency manipulator, something he promised to do as a candidate. Holding back those moves suggests Mr. Trump is also heeding the more moderate voices among his advisers, who argue that the United States cannot afford to ignite a trade war with China.\u201cThe nativist and nationalist forces certainly have influence,\u201d said Nicholas Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson International Institute for Economics. \u201cBut it looks like it\u2019s dwindling rapidly.\u201dMr. Lardy said anti-dumping cases on steel were mostly symbolic, since American imports of steel from China accounted for only a few percentage points of the trade deficit. The Obama administration filed multiple anti-dumping cases with the World Trade Organization.Still, the pitched battle over trade policy, on the eve of Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Mr. Xi, injected an unpredictable note into an encounter that has been billed mostly as a get-acquainted session for the two leaders.Mr. Trump made it clear the informal setting would not prevent him from confronting his guest with the chronic imbalances between the United State and China.\u201cWe have been treated unfairly and have made terrible trade deals with China for many, many years,\u201d he said to reporters on Air Force One. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things we are going to be talking about.\u201dMr. Xi arrived in Florida on Thursday afternoon, stepping off his Air China flight into the humid air of Palm Beach. On Thursday evening, he attended a formal dinner at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate. A series of meetings were scheduled for Friday morning, followed by a working lunch.Ethics experts say Donald J. Trump\u2019s visits to properties owned, managed or branded by the Trump Organization amount to free publicity for the company and blur the line between his family business and presidential duties.Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson greeted Mr. Xi and his wife, who walked on a red carpet, flanked by an honor guard carrying flags of both countries. Mr. Trump, who arrived from Washington later, greeted Mr. Xi in an arrival ceremony at the front steps of the estate.Speaking to reporters afterward, Mr. Tillerson said the president was prepared to demand an \u201ceconomic relationship that is fair on both sides\u201d and said the chief goal of the nation\u2019s trade policy would be fashioned after the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d credo.\u201cTo that end,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will pursue economic engagement with China that prioritizes the economic well-being of the American people.\u201dFor weeks leading up to this meeting, China has served as a kind of proxy for Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers to play out their clashing worldviews. The hard-line contingent \u2014 led by the president\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and the director of the National Trade Council, Peter Navarro \u2014 squared off against the more traditional group, which included two former Goldman Sachs executives, Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. Mr. Mnuchin, one official said, has gravitated in recent days toward a tougher line on China.Mr. Bannon, officials said, pushed hard for the removal of Mr. Quinn, a special assistant for international trade, investment and development.Mr. Quinn had the support of his boss, Mr. Cohn, a Democrat who has emerged as an influential voice with Mr. Trump on economic policy. But he was unable to save Mr. Quinn, who will return to his previous post with the Office of the United States Trade Representative.In a conciliatory gesture, the two countries are expected to announce they will continue to hold an annual high-level dialogue on strategic and economic issues, which began during the George W. Bush administration and continued under Mr. Obama, though there has been some talk of elevating the session to the level of Vice President Mike Pence.Among the sensitive topics that may come up is American concern about the possibility that Chinese investors might seek to purchase the nuclear power business of Westinghouse Electric Co.Westinghouse, once a symbol of America\u2019s leadership in nuclear energy, was forced to file for bankruptcy in late March, in the face of mounting losses. Though many of its wounds were self-inflicted \u2014 a disastrous deal for a construction business proved too costly \u2014 broad market and industry forces have also changed the economic calculus for nuclear energy.American officials are profoundly concerned about the potential national security implications of a purchase of Westinghouse by interests with ties to the Chinese government, including the danger that a sale could deliver sensitive nuclear secrets to that nation.A White House official said Thursday that the administration is watching the potential sale closely but declined to comment on options that the United States government might have to block the sale to Chinese interests.Bloomberg News first reported about the government\u2019s concern about the sale. Discussions about the issue are underway among top American officials at the Department of Energy, the State Department and the Treasury Department.Even before the bankruptcy, Westinghouse\u2019s Japanese parent was already moving away from the business of building nuclear power plants, focusing instead on maintaining existing reactors and developing reactors.It follows a broad pattern in the business, as big companies reassess the viability of nuclear and the field of players shrinks. General Electric has pared its nuclear operations, while the French builder Areva is going through a major restructuring.China has been moving to fill the void, as it increasingly develops its nuclear abilities and pushes homegrown players to look for opportunities beyond their borders. But China\u2019s increasing presence in nuclear energy has raised security concerns in some countries.Advertisement"}

But now, on opposite sides of the globe, sun-creased fishermen lament as they reel in their nearly empty nets.\u201cYour net would be so full of fish, you could barely heave it onto the boat,\u201d said Mamadou So, 52, a fisherman in Senegal, gesturing to the meager assortment of tiny fish flapping in his wooden canoe.A world away in eastern China, Zhu Delong, 75, also shook his head as his net dredged up a disappointing array of pinkie-size shrimp and fledgling yellow croakers. \u201cWhen I was a kid, you could cast a line out your back door and hook huge yellow croakers,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the sea is empty.\u201dBut China, with its enormous population, growing wealth to buy seafood and the world\u2019s largest fleet of deep-sea fishing vessels, is having an outsize impact on the globe\u2019s oceans.\u201cChinese fleets are all over the world now, and without these subsidies, the industry just wouldn\u2019t be sustainable,\u201d said Li Shuo, a global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia. \u201cFor Senegal and other countries of West Africa, the impact has been devastating.\u201dThe sea\u2019s diminishing returns mean plummeting incomes for fishermen and higher food prices for Senegalese citizens, most of whom depend on fish as their primary source of protein.\u201cWe are facing an unprecedented crisis,\u201d said Alassane Samba, a former director of Senegal\u2019s oceanic research institute. \u201cIf things keep going the way they are, people will have to eat jellyfish to survive.\u201dThe nation\u2019s fishing industry employs more than 14 million people, up from five million in 1979, with 30 million others relying on fish for their livelihood.\u201cThe truth is, traditional fishing grounds in Chinese waters exist in name only,\u201d said Mr. Zhang of Nanyang University. \u201cFor China\u2019s leaders, ensuring a steady supply of aquatic products is not just about good economics but social stability and political legitimacy.\u201dBut as they press toward other countries, Chinese fishermen have become entangled in a growing number of maritime disputes.For Senegal, which stretches along the Atlantic for more than 300 miles, the ocean is the economic lifeblood and a part of the national identity. Seafood is the main export, and fishing-related industries employ nearly 20 percent of the work force, according to the World Bank.Ceebu jen, a hearty fish stew, is the national dish, and sawfish \u2014 once plentiful but now rare \u2014 grace bank notes. No Senegalese postcard is complete without an image of pirogues, the exuberantly painted boats fishermen use.\u201cForeigners complain about Africa migrants coming to their countries, but they have no problem coming to our waters and stealing all our fish,\u201d said Moustapha Balde, 22, whose teenage cousin drowned after his boat sank in the Mediterranean.\u201cWe always thought that sea life was boundless,\u201d he said while patrolling the coastline. Now, he added, \u201cwe are facing a catastrophe.\u201dMr. Sall became a local hero after he single-handedly detained the captains of two Chinese boats that were fishing illegally. These days, residents curse him under their breath because he has expanded his campaign against overfishing to include Senegalese boats that flout fishing rules designed to help stocks rebound.\u201cI understand why they hate me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are just trying to survive from day to day.\u201dStill, most of his ire is directed at the capacious foreign-owned trawlers. These days, more than 100 large boats work Senegalese waters, a mix of European, Asian and locally flagged vessels, according to government figures. That number doesn\u2019t include boats that fly Senegalese flags but are owned by Chinese companies.Also uncounted are the ships that fish illegally, often at night or on the fringes of Senegal\u2019s 200-mile-wide exclusive economic zone \u2014 well out of reach of the country\u2019s small navy.According to her estimates, Chinese boats steal 40,000 tons of fish a year from Senegalese waters, an amount worth roughly $28 million.The problem is magnified across West Africa. Some countries, like Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone, have just a handful of boats to police their national waters..In Senegal, recent legislation has drastically increased fines for illegal fishing to $1 million, and officials pointed to the two impounded foreign-owned boats in Dakar, the nation\u2019s capital, as proof that their efforts are bearing fruit.His agency cannot afford speedboats or satellite imagery; it could also use a functioning airplane. \u201cStill, we have more than many other countries, and we have to help them, too,\u201d he said.Most of the small pelagic fish that swim in Senegalese waters \u2014 and make up 85 percent of the nation\u2019s protein consumption \u2014 migrate in enormous schools between Morocco and Sierra Leone. Along the way, they are scooped up by hundreds of industrial trawlers, at least half of them Chinese-owned, experts say.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say no to China when they are building your roads,\u201d said Dr. Samba, the former head of Senegal\u2019s oceanic research institute.Then there is the lack of transparency that keeps national fishing agreements with China secret.Beijing has become sensitive to accusations that its huge fishing fleet is helping push fish stocks to the brink of collapse.\u201cThe era of fishing any way you want, wherever you want, has passed,\u201d Liu Xinzhong, deputy general director of the Bureau of Fisheries in Beijing, said. \u201cWe now need to fish by the rules.\u201dBut criticism of China\u2019s fishing practices, he added, is sometimes exaggerated, arguing that Chinese vessels traveling to Africa were simply responding to the demand for seafood from developed countries, which have been reducing their own fleets.\u201cPeople come to me and ask, \u2018If China doesn\u2019t fish, where would Americans get their fish to eat?\u2019\u201d he said.Here in Joal, the dwindling catches have prompted the closing of three of the town\u2019s ice factories, with the fourth barely holding on. On the town\u2019s main quay, where women wade into the surf to meet arriving pirogues, the competition for fish has become intense.\u201cWe used to have big grouper and tuna, but now we are fighting over a few sardinella,\u201d said one buyer, S\u00e9nte Camara, 68. On a good day, she makes $20; on a bad day, she loses money. \u201cThe future is dark,\u201d she said.To catch anything, fishermen have to venture out farther, putting their lives at risk if an engine stalls or a late summer storm barrels through. Sometimes the danger is a super trawler whose wake can easily swamp a pirogue.At Joal\u2019s vast outdoor smoking center, the lack of fish was apparent in the empty racks normally stacked with yellow-tailed sardinella and millet stalks smoldering below.Daba Mbaye, 49, one of the few people working, said the smokers could no longer compete with the fishmeal factories.\u201cThey leave us with nothing, and we are powerless to stop them,\u201d Ms. Mbaye said. \u201cNow we are forced to catch juvenile fish, which is like going into a house and killing all the children. If you do that, the family will eventually disappear.\u201dKiki Zhao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.M.F. Torn Over Whether to Bail Out Greece Once Again", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the International Monetary Fund approaches the seventh anniversary of the contentious Greek bailout, it is torn over whether to commit new loans to a nearly bankrupt Greece.For more than a year, I.M.F. officials have been saying \u2014 loudly \u2014 that they cannot participate in a new rescue package for Greece unless Europe agrees to ease Greece\u2019s onerous debt burden.The fund\u2019s reluctance to commit additional money to Greece also highlights a widely held view among I.M.F. officials \u2014 and in the Trump administration \u2014 that the fund overextended itself in Greece. They also see the responsibility for restoring the country\u2019s economic health as resting primarily with Europe, which currently holds 80 percent of Greek debt.At the same time, Greece, which has acceded to demands from the fund to cut spending and bring in more revenue, faces a 7 billion euro debt repayment in July, which it may not be able to meet if the I.M.F. and Europe cannot reach a new bailout agreement.In many ways, the situation in Greece has become an existential question for the I.M.F.The fund has been criticized for overcommitting financial resources to the European debt crisis.For example, the \u20ac30 billion the fund lent to Greece in 2010 was 30 times more than the sum of Greece\u2019s financial contribution to the fund as a member, which is called a quota. The loan is one of the largest in the history of the fund, which was formed in 1944.Yet the I.M.F. has an obligation to lend to countries that are in financial need as well as to safeguard global financial stability.\u201cThe fund is digging in its heels, but if the pattern of brinkmanship that the Europeans and the Greeks have practiced in the past prevails, you will see more instability in the markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is definitely creating anxiety \u2014 both within the fund and within national governments.\u201dUnlike at previous spring meetings, questions about Greece did not monopolize the public discourse this week as finance ministers, central bankers and financiers from around the world gathered in Washington to assess international economic trends.But behind closed doors, how to proceed with Greece consumed a lot of time, as usual, participants said. Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister, met with an array of officials, as he usually does at I.M.F. meetings, but little progress was made according to people who were briefed on the discussions but were not authorized to speak on the record.Publicly, the mantra of fund officials, starting with Christine Lagarde, the managing director, was the same: The numbers had to add up before the fund could consider disbursing new cash.\u201cWe had constructive discussions in preparation for the return of the mission to discuss the two legs of the Greece program: policies and debt relief,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said in a statement on Friday after meeting with Mr. Tsakalotos.That means that for the I.M.F. to lend, Greece must prove that it can be financially responsible over a sustained period, and Europe must address the country\u2019s substantial debt overhang with some combination of interest rate reductions and maturity extensions.Germany and other northern European creditor nations, who are deeply suspicious of Greece\u2019s ability to manage its finances over the long term, have promised voters that they will only agree to another Greek bailout if the I.M.F. provides its imprimatur.Still, despite an unusual economic performance by Greece, which ended 2016 with a budget surplus of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 the highest in recent memory for the notoriously profligate nation \u2014 I.M.F. officials conceded last week that they were not close to a deal.The paper, which addresses the thorny question of how much debt relief Greece actually needs, was published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics this month, and has become required reading for policy makers on all sides of the Greek talks.It made two critical points. It questioned Greece\u2019s ability to consistently deliver large enough budget surpluses to allow it to pay down its debt \u2014 which now stands at \u20ac326 billion, or 180 percent the size of the Greek economy.And while the document accepted that Europe had proposed feasible measures to reduce the debt, such as extending maturities and lowering rates, it argued that for these steps to make a difference, Europe might have to commit as much as \u20ac100 billion in additional loans to keep Greece afloat.As someone who has worked on both sides of the divide \u2014 Mr. Zettelmeyer was also an economist at the I.M.F. \u2014 his goal in producing the paper was to find that elusive common ground that would allow Greece, Europe and the I.M.F. to reach an agreement.But after 53 pages and countless hours of brainstorming, he came to the same conclusion as many others before him: There is no simple way out of the Greek mess.\u201cIt\u2019s dispiriting \u2014 while there are technical solutions there are big political problems attached to all of them,\u201d Mr. Zettelmeyer said in an interview. \u201cThere is a presumption that there will just be more procrastination. And that is hard to swallow because things could get out of control.\u201dThat is why some analysts believe that the I.M.F. and Germany will find a way to compromise, with Europe agreeing to just enough debt relief to allow the fund to come back on board.\u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d Mr. Henning, the author, said. \u201cWith these European elections, the last thing anyone wants is another Greek crisis.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is American Retail at a Historic Tipping Point?", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byAlong the cobblestone streets of SoHo, Chanel handbags and Arc\u2019teryx jackets are displayed in shops like museum pieces, harking back to the height of the neighborhood\u2019s trendiness. But rents there are softening, and the number of vacant storefronts is rising.Today, some of the most sought-after real estate by retailers is not in SoHo, but five miles away in Red Hook, a gritty Brooklyn enclave with a shipbuilding past. E-commerce merchants are vying to lease part of a huge warehouse space, spanning 11 acres, that would allow them to deliver goods the same day they\u2019re ordered online.The profound reordering of New York\u2019s shopping scene reflects a broad restructuring in the American retail industry.E-commerce players, led by the industry giant Amazon, have made it so easy and fast for people to shop online that traditional retailers, shackled by fading real estate and a culture of selling in stores, are struggling to compete. This shift has been building gradually for years. But economists, retail workers and real estate investors say it appears that it has sped up in recent months.Between 2010 and 2014, e-commerce grew by an average of $30 billion annually. Over the past three years, average annual growth has increased to $40 billion.\u201cThat is the tipping point, right there,\u201d said Barbara Denham, a senior economist at Reis, a real estate data and analytics firm. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Doppler effect. The change is coming at you so fast, it feels like it is accelerating.\u201dThis transformation is hollowing out suburban shopping malls, bankrupting longtime brands and leading to staggering job losses.More workers in general merchandise stores have been laid off since October, about 89,000 Americans. That is more than all of the people employed in the United States coal industry, which President Trump championed during the campaign as a prime example of the workers who have been left behind in the economic recovery.The job losses in retail could have unexpected social and political consequences, as huge numbers of low-wage retail employees become economically unhinged, just as manufacturing workers did in recent decades. About one out of every 10 Americans works in retail.\u201cThere is a sea change happening in the retail industry,\u201d said Mark Cohen, a former executive at Sears, who now runs the retail studies program at Columbia Business School. \u201cAnd that is bringing a sea change in employment.\u201dStore closures, meanwhile, are on pace this year to eclipse the number of stores that closed in the depths of the Great Recession of 2008. Back then Americans, mired in foreclosures and investment losses, retrenched away from buying stuff.The current torrent of closures comes as consumer confidence is strong and unemployment is low, suggesting that a permanent restructuring is underway, rather than a dip in the normal business cycle. In short, traditional retail may never recover.The reordering should come as no surprise to anyone who has enjoyed the instant gratification of receiving that book or garden hose within 24 hours of ordering it. Or to anyone who has encountered the tired-looking mannequins and haggard sales associates at many department stores.Modern-day retail is becoming unrecognizable from the glory era of the department store in the years after World War II. In that period, newly built highways shuttling people to and from the suburbs eventually gave rise to shopping malls \u2014 big, convenient, climate-controlled monuments to consumerism with lots of parking.Over time, malls grew to be the size of indoor cities. Minnesota\u2019s Mall of America opened in 1992 with a footprint so large that it could fit nine Yankee Stadiums inside.Now, many of these once celebrated malls are emptying out or being turned into trampoline parks and community colleges. \u201cThe retail industry built too much space,\u201d said Bruce Batkin, chief executive of Terra Capital Partners, a commercial real estate lender.Last week, Mr. Batkin got a call from a landlord looking to refinance his shopping center with a 10-year loan. Mr. Batkin passed on the deal because it was too difficult to predict what might happen to occupancy in the property 10 years from now.\u201cThings are changing so fast in retail that a year needs to be measured in dog years,\u201d he said.Still, there are many investors who are not giving up on the notion that online retail and traditional stores can coexist and even thrive together. Retailers have hoped that their traditional stores, by offering catchy displays and top-notice service, can lure shoppers away from their screens. Some of the best evidence that brick-and-mortar retail is still viable may be Amazon\u2019s experimentation with operating physical stores of its own.In reality, however, some workers say that they will often spend time helping out a customer on the shop floor, only to have that person leave the store and order a product online. That often hits salespeople in the wallet: Many are paid on commission, but only on sales they complete in person in the store.At Bloomingdale\u2019s, employees who are members of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union are arguing that the company should improve how sales staff are compensated for helping facilitate e-commerce business \u2014 like helping customers pick up goods in the store that were ordered online.\u201cYou want an in-store experience that will make customers want to come into the store,\u201d the union president, Stuart Appelbaum, said. \u201cThat requires highly motivated employees.\u201dA Bloomingdale\u2019s spokeswoman said the company is negotiating with the union over a new contract in \u201cgood faith\u201d and was taking steps to invest in its work force..The retail industry has always had its ups and downs. Workers frequently hop from one store to another, as styles and brands fall out of fashion. But even to many experienced retail workers, who are used to losing their jobs based on the seasons, this downturn feels different.Hilda Awuor, 27, lost her job at the Saks Fifth Avenue store in Lower Manhattan last month. After bouncing between jobs in different clothing stores, she said she is now done with retail and is trying to find a different career entirely.\u201cI really like helping customers create a new style,\u201d said Ms. Awuor, who was paid $16 an hour. \u201cBut there is no job security anymore.\u201dSome economists say this is how the market is supposed to work. After the recession, retail hiring was a big driver of the recovery. But now that the economy is stronger, retail workers theoretically should be pushed out into potentially higher paying jobs that offer more chances to create wealth.\u201cThis is creative destruction at its best,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWe are downsizing a part of the economy that is uncompetitive. While painful for those in the middle of it, this is how we grow and wealth is created.\u201dBut Mr. Cohen, of Columbia University, said the upending of an entire industry will not be so tidy. Warehouses like the one in Red Hook typically employ a few hundred people, according to Sitex Group, a private equity firm that is expected to close on the property in a few weeks.While these distribution centers could replace some of the work lost in stores, they likely won\u2019t make up the entire difference. That is because much of the operations are automated and require different skills and sensibilities than selling jeans.\u201cThere is a rolling crisis that has emerged in the last couple of years as store closings are being announced,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cPeople are losing their jobs and have no other place to go.\u201cTheoretically this is the marketplace rationalizing itself, but in the interim how do people survive?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Charleston Elite Brought on the American Civil War", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Readers of a popular travel magazine recently ranked Charleston as their favorite American city. Northern Democrats visiting the place in April 1860 for their party\u2019s national convention would have demurred. Democrats had settled on Charleston in order to mollify Southern members and ensure a united front heading into the fall presidential election. The opposite occurred. Southern disunionists, emboldened by galleries packed with supporters, rigged the convention to split the Democratic Party \u2014 the only national party competing that year. The breakup would inevitably result in the election of the yet-to-be-named Republican candidate. A Republican victory, the radicals theorized, would galvanize white Southerners to form a new nation secure from the economic predations and racial terror that the new administration would inevitably unleash upon the South if the slave states remained in the Union.\u201cMadness Rules the Hour,\u201d Paul Starobin\u2019s fast-paced, engagingly written account of the hysteria that descended on lovely Charleston \u2014 where the unthinkable became the inevitable \u2014 is as much a study in group psychology as it is in history. Charleston\u2019s course to secession a mere seven weeks after the election of Lincoln and more than two months before he took office was not a willy-nilly, mob-inspired dash to disunion, but rather a well-orchestrated movement (controlled chaos, if you will), extending from John Brown\u2019s raid on Harpers Ferry in October 1859 to the fateful Secession Convention in late December 1860 that took South Carolina out of the Union.The conductors of this movement were the city\u2019s elite, whom Starobin presents in finely drawn portraits. Mobilizing the news media, especially the widely read Charleston Mercury (even Lincoln was a subscriber), staging boisterous military displays and mass meetings, and establishing secessionist organizations, the disunionists advanced their cause. If you were not with them, you remained silent. The elite ensured solidarity with the white working class by tightening restrictions on the city\u2019s free black population, many of whom fled.Secession was not a new fever in Charleston in 1860. Agitation had flared before: in 1832 in opposition to an allegedly punitive tariff, and in 1850 in the midst of the debate on the admission of California as a free state and related issues. But as Starobin notes, the itch to leave the Union was hardly a widely shared view elsewhere in the South, neither on those earlier occasions nor even in 1860.Why was Charleston so in advance of its neighbors? Starobin, the author of \u201cAfter America: Narratives for the Next Global Age,\u201d does not precisely answer this question, but part of the explanation lies scattered in his book. Charleston was one of the most prosperous cities in the country, a major port and a center for the lucrative Sea Islands cotton trade. But its economy was beginning to ebb, as ports to the north eclipsed the city. And a Republican regime that promoted economic nationalism would surely enrich its friends and beggar its enemies. Charlestonians viewed the Republicans as an existential threat not only to their livelihood, but also to their lives. Disunion was an opportunity to regain sovereignty, prosperity and security. Honor, the history of secession agitation and the memory of the failed Vesey slave rebellion of 1822 also figured into the equation.But, as Starobin concludes his story, the equation blew up. Fast-forward to April 1865, and the ruins of this once beautiful city stood as testimony to folly. He appropriately leaves the coda to the Union general William Tecumseh Sherman: \u201cAnyone who is not satisfied with war should go and see Charleston, and he will pray louder and deeper than ever that the country may, in the long future, be spared any more war.\u201dDavid Goldfield, the Robert Lee Bailey professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, is the author of \u201cAmerica Aflame: How the Civil War Created a Nation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Economic Crisis, Low Birthrates Challenge Southern Europe", "Date": "2017-04-16", "News": "Supported byCouples insisting on only one child. Women tearfully renouncing plans to conceive. And a surge in single-child parents asking him to destroy all of their remaining embryos.Like women in the United States and other mature economies, women across Europe have been having fewer children for decades. But demographers are warning of a new hot spot for childlessness on the Mediterranean rim, where Europe\u2019s economic crisis hit hardest.As couples grapple with a longer-than-expected stretch of low growth, high unemployment, precarious jobs and financial strain, they are increasingly deciding to have just one child \u2014 or none.Birthrates in the region have slid back almost to where they were before the crisis emerged in 2008. Women in Spain had been averaging 1.47 children per household, up from 1.24 in 2000. But those gains have all but evaporated. In Italy, Portugal and Greece, birthrates have reverted to about 1.3.Maria Karaklioumi, 43, a political pollster in Athens, decided to forgo children after concluding she would not be able to offer them the stable future her parents had afforded. Her sister has a child, and Ms. Karaklioumi is painfully aware that her grandmother already had five grandchildren at her age.Although she has a good job and master\u2019s degrees in politics and economics, \u201cthere\u2019s too much insecurity,\u201d Ms. Karaklioumi said.Unemployment among women stands at 27 percent, compared with 20 percent for men.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have this job in two months or a year,\u201d Ms. Karaklioumi added. \u201cIf you don\u2019t see a light at the end of the tunnel, how can you plan for the future?\u201dOver time, he added, \u201cit suggests that the already divergent economic performance between Northern and Southern Europe may become structural rather than cyclical.\u201dThe lower birthrates have been aggravated by fiscal pressures that constrained countries from offering robust family support programs. Whereas France offers a monthly family benefit of 130 euros (about $138) per child after the second child, Greece provides just 40 euros.Greece, as the weakest economic link, does not have the same options.Struggling to manage a recovery after nearly eight years of recession, the government cannot make the fertility drop a top priority. Child tax breaks and subsidies for large families were weakened under Greece\u2019s austerity-linked international financial bailouts. State-financed child care became means-tested and is hard to get for women seeking work. Greece now has the lowest budget in the European Union for family and child benefits.\u201cWe need to allocate more money to create the services needed for families and children,\u201d Mr. Karellas said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to do amid the crisis.\u201dThe impact is evident in communities across the European south, where smaller towns are increasingly hollowed out and schools emptied.In Tempi, a verdant region in central Greece, many primary schools and kindergartens have closed since 2012 as parents had fewer children and young Greeks left the country, said Xanthi Zisaki, a municipal councilor. Kindergarten enrollment has also slumped elsewhere in Greece and around Spain and Italy.While migration from small towns is nothing new, \u201cthe financial crisis is clearly the problem,\u201d Mrs. Zisaki said. \u201cThere are simply fewer children every year.\u201dAs the crisis persisted, Anastasia Economopoulou, 42, pushed back her dream of having several children. She was fearful of losing her job as a saleswoman at a retail branding company after managers said they did not want women who would get pregnant.Eventually, she turned to in vitro fertilization treatments at Dr. Mastrominas\u2019s clinic. But her salary slumped by 30 percent as company sales fell, and her husband\u2019s by more, cutting the number of treatments she can afford.\u201cI asked them not to put in many embryos because we can only manage one,\u201d she said.For a country like Greece, some see the shifting demographic trends as a blessing in disguise.\u201cAs long as Greece has high unemployment, it may be good luck that there\u2019s not a baby boom,\u201d said Byron Kotzamanis, a demography professor at the University of Thessaly.\u201cIf there was,\u201d he added, \u201cwe might have more problems right now.\u201dBut such optimism will not make up for the frightening consequences for countries struggling to replenish people.\u201cIf we don\u2019t fix this, in 20 years we\u2019ll be a country of old people,\u201d said Mr. Karellas, the welfare official. \u201cThe fact is, it\u2019s a disaster.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens, and Rachel Chaundler from Zaragoza, Spain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bigger, Faster, More Lavish: Americans Crave S.U.V.s, and Carmakers Oblige", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byAmericans want bigger, faster and more luxurious sport utility vehicles \u2014 and automakers are more than happy to fulfill the booming demand.New S.U.V.s dominated media previews on Wednesday at the New York International Auto Show, the latest sign that the shift away from traditional cars is more than a short-term trend.And the new vehicles are all about muscle. Ford Motor released a more powerful version of its extra-large Lincoln Navigator. There were high-octane offerings in the Jeep and Mercedes-Benz lines. And General Motors moved to cement its leadership in the category with a midsize model capable of towing a 20-foot speedboat.In short, with oil prices half what they were three years ago, and President Trump vowing to cut back on fuel-economy regulations, automakers are raising the stakes in the S.U.V. segment.\u201cWe don\u2019t think that the rate of growth of S.U.V.s will necessarily continue, but we do believe the shift to them is permanent,\u201d said Mike Manley, head of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Jeep division.Pickup trucks and S.U.V.s have accounted for about 62 percent of all new vehicles sold in the United States so far this year, compared with 57 percent in the first quarter of 2016, according to the research firm Autodata.That extends a trend line that has inched upward since gasoline dropped below $3 a gallon in 2014.The big American auto companies have been the greatest beneficiaries of the public\u2019s appetite for high-riding, spacious S.U.V.s, which generally earn bigger profits for manufacturers than mainstream cars.In March, more than 70 percent of the vehicles sold in the United States by General Motors and Ford Motor were trucks and S.U.V.s. The proportion was even higher, about 85 percent, for Fiat Chrysler.All three Detroit automakers and their foreign rivals are working overtime to add new or updated sport utility vehicles to their lineups.The trend worries environmentalists because S.U.V.s generally burn more gas than smaller cars, generating more of then harmful emissions believed to cause global warming.Some automakers are also adding electric cars to their portfolios, but not in volumes equal to the proliferation of S.U.V.s.And while companies are committed to electric-car programs, their earnings are heavily dependent on feeding consumers\u2019 appetite for new and improved S.U.V.s.\u201cThe fact is these larger vehicles have been extraordinary profit centers, especially for the domestic manufacturers,\u201d said Jack Gillis, public affairs director for the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit group that supports stringent fuel-economy rules.As long as gas prices remain low, he said, the S.U.V. boom is likely to continue. But once prices begin to rise, consumers may become less enamored with the larger models.\u201cEconomic conditions are going to drive improvements in fuel efficiency more than environmental considerations,\u201d Mr. Gillis said. \u201cConsumers will rethink their decision to buy a larger vehicle when it starts costing more to fill their gas tanks.\u201dFor now, the market for S.U.V.s is seemingly growing by the day.Some brands have been completely revitalized by the proliferation of S.U.V.s, which now come in sizes ranging from compact to extra-large.The Buick division of General Motors, for example, is introducing a new version of its midsize Enclave S.U.V. at the New York show.That follows the addition of two smaller sport utility models to the brand\u2019s lineup. And where Buick was once synonymous with cushy sedans, it is now tilted heavily toward S.U.V.s.\u201cUp to three-quarters of our sales now are S.U.V.s,\u201d said Duncan Aldred, head of the Buick division. \u201cThat\u2019s how much Buick is on the track with the market.\u201dAnd though it is considered a midsize S.U.V., the Enclave is large enough to accommodate three rows of seats.Mr. Aldred said the typical customers drawn to Buick S.U.V.s included families with young children who required considerable space and older drivers who appreciated the rugged capability and utility of a high-riding model.He said that fuel economy was rarely a major consideration for consumers shopping for an S.U.V.The existing Enclave model gets about 17 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving, but the new version shown in New York is expected to improve upon that performance, once it is certified by federal regulators.New technology, for example, allows for the engine to shut down and restart when the vehicle is idling, saving fuel. \u201cThe old perception that S.U.V.s are terrible on fuel economy is going away,\u201d Mr. Aldred said.Some of the newest S.U.V.s also cater to consumers interested in prestige, luxury, and, above all, comfort.One such vehicle, Ford\u2019s new Lincoln Navigator, is bigger and more powerful than the model it will replace, and is packed with features like a dial that selects from six modes set for varying weather conditions and terrain.The new Navigator also has upgraded leather seats, plusher carpeting and running boards that appear automatically along the side to provide the driver and passengers a step for entering. The transmission is laid out like piano keys to be touched gently when putting the vehicle into park, drive or reverse.\u201cIt is the most spacious and luxurious Lincoln S.U.V. yet, and will elevate family travel to what we call first class,\u201d said Mark Fields, Ford\u2019s chief executive.Ford, which virtually created the full-size luxury S.U.V. segment 20 years ago with the Navigator, has been eclipsed recently by the popularity of G.M.\u2019s Cadillac Escalade. The redesigned Navigator is intended to reclaim its place as the flagship for the Lincoln brand and to serve notice that Ford is no longer willing to settle for second place to its Detroit rival.And while Ford is pushing luxury, other automakers are taking S.U.V.s to new levels of speed and performance.Mercedes-Benz announced plans to produce powerful new versions of its big GL sport utility vehicle that can achieve as much as 500 horsepower.Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Jeep brand is going even further with its Grand Cherokee Trackhawk edition, which can generate more than 700 horsepower and hit a top speed of 180 miles per hour.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Be a Genius, Think Like a 94-Year-Old", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byIn 1946, a 23-year-old Army veteran named John Goodenough headed to the University of Chicago with a dream of studying physics. When he arrived, a professor warned him that he was already too old to succeed in the field.We tend to assume that creativity wanes with age. But Dr. Goodenough\u2019s story suggests that some people actually become more creative as they grow older. Unfortunately, those late-blooming geniuses have to contend with powerful biases against them.\u201cYoung people are just smarter,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg pronounced at an event at Stanford in 2007, when he was the 22-year-old chief executive of Facebook. He added, according to a VentureBeat writer, \u201cI only own a mattress,\u201d and then expounded upon the putative correlation between youth and creative power. His logic didn\u2019t exactly make sense (and he later apologized), but his meaning was perfectly clear: Middle-aged people are encumbered by boring possessions (gutters, dental floss, orthopedic shoes) and stale ideas.Since that speech, Silicon Valley\u2019s youth worship seems to have grown even more feverish. Recently, a 12-year-old inventor named Shubham Banerjee received venture-capital funds from Intel to start his own company.In such a climate, it\u2019s easy for us middle-aged folk to believe that the great imaginative leaps are behind us, and that innovation belongs to the kids.John P. Walsh, one of the professors, joked that the Patent Office should give a \u201csenior discount\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s clear evidence that people with seniority are making important contributions to invention.\u201dThe more I talked to Dr. Goodenough, the more I wondered if his brilliance was directly tied to his age. After all, he has been thinking about energy problems longer than just about anyone else on the planet.He grew up in the early days of the petroleum age, in a Connecticut farmhouse with a kerosene stove and an icebox for food. As a kid he rode in some of the early cars pioneered by Henry Ford. \u201cThe first car the family owned was a Model A,\u201d he told me, with running boards and a lead-acid battery.He believes the lithium-ion battery is too liable to explode, too expensive and too weak to bring us into that future.Years ago, he decided to create a solid battery that would be safer. Of course, in a perfect world, the \u201csolid-state\u201d battery would also be low-cost and lightweight. Then, two years ago, he discovered the work of Maria Helena Braga, a Portuguese physicist who, with the help of a colleague, had created a kind of glass that can replace liquid electrolytes inside batteries.Dr. Goodenough persuaded Dr. Braga to move to Austin and join his lab. \u201cWe did some experiments to make sure the glass was dry. Then we were off to the races,\u201d he said.Some of his colleagues were dubious that he could pull it off. But Dr. Goodenough was not dissuaded. \u201cI\u2019m old enough to know you can\u2019t close your mind to new ideas. You have to test out every possibility if you want something new.\u201dWhen I asked him about his late-life success, he said: \u201cSome of us are turtles; we crawl and struggle along, and we haven\u2019t maybe figured it out by the time we\u2019re 30. But the turtles have to keep on walking.\u201d This crawl through life can be advantageous, he pointed out, particularly if you meander around through different fields, picking up clues as you go along. Dr. Goodenough started in physics and hopped sideways into chemistry and materials science, while also keeping his eye on the social and political trends that could drive a green economy. \u201cYou have to draw on a fair amount of experience in order to be able to put ideas together,\u201d he said.He also credits his faith for keeping him focused on his mission to defeat pollution and ditch petroleum. On the wall of his lab, a tapestry of the Last Supper depicts the apostles in fervent conversation, like scientists at a conference arguing over a controversial theory. The tapestry reminds him of the divine power that fuels his mind. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the doors that have been opened to me in different periods of my life,\u201d he said. He believes the glass battery was just another example of the happy accidents that have come his way: \u201cAt just the right moment, when I was looking for something, it walked in the door.\u201dLast but not least, he credited old age with bringing him a new kind of intellectual freedom.

{"Headline": "It Could Be Worse", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byBut it could be worse. Really, it could. Let me count the ways.Second, the administration has failed to push through Paul Ryan\u2019s Obamacare replacement. Sure, this isn\u2019t good news for Trump on the usual presidential metrics, where big legislation counts as promises kept, points on the board, the building blocks of a legacy and so forth. But it is good news for the country, because the proposed Obamacare replacement was so flawed that its passage would have achieved little or nothing for the common good. And it\u2019s quite possible to imagine that pattern repeating itself going forward: Good right-of-center legislation under Trump may be a pipe dream, but better no legislation at all than bad legislation, and with a Republican Party that\u2019s both internally divided and incompetent at policy making, Trump\u2019s inability to close the deal could save the country from a great many lousy bills.Third, Trump\u2019s personnel choices have improved. For a time it looked as if his administration would have some reasonably competent people in its cabinet but that the White House itself, the zone of crucial decision making, would be reserved for cranks and cronies. But since the swift departure of Michael Flynn from the National Security Council, Trump\u2019s immediate circle of advisers has, well, normalized to a certain extent.As economic advisers go, Gary Cohn and Kevin Hassett are not likely to forge the sort of populist-conservative synthesis that would make the Trump experiment a roaring success. But if a financial crisis strikes tomorrow, better to have them with Trump\u2019s ear than some of the fools and opportunists who were attached to his campaign.This drop-off is a good thing, period, because it means that fewer people are undertaking a dangerous journey that falls afoul of United States law, and because it suggests that America might actually be able to establish more control over migration than many of our supposed wise men have long claimed. But it\u2019s a particularly good thing given Trump\u2019s tendency to demagogue the issue: If illegal immigration weren\u2019t declining, he would face increasing pressure to turn ever-more-draconian, which would set off a dangerous cycle of protest and backlash in an already polarized environment.Which leads me to the fifth piece of good news: As fraught and strange as our political moment may be, thus far the anti-Trump side has not yet fallen into the kind of madness that swept through our politics in the 1960s and 1970s.Yes, there is a lot of Trump-induced panic on the left and in the media, and yes, the environment around some college campuses is hysterical and illiberal, with the spasms of violence at Berkeley and Middlebury particularly ugly case studies. But given the fears that Trump\u2019s election stoked, the threads of violence that ran through the campaign season and the attacks on his legitimacy that followed, it was possible to imagine something much more insurrectionary and destructive arising to oppose him.So far that hasn\u2019t happened; so far the biggest protests have been restrained, and pro-Trump counterprotest mostly absent; so far we still have the grace of relative civil peace. That, too, is something to be thankful for.Of course any thanksgiving is highly provisional. One hundred days is nothing, and the Trump White House has not yet faced the kind of challenge, domestic or foreign, in which a thoughtless response from the president could lead to spiraling disaster. If we end up in a full-scale war in the Korean Peninsula on Day 117 of this administration, the fact that the stock market rose and the cities didn\u2019t burn during Trump\u2019s first weeks in office will not look like that much of an achievement.But if these first months set the pattern for the Trump presidency \u2014 some success curbing illegal immigration, a decent-enough economy and stock market, a Carter-esque inability to pass major legislation and an opposition that\u2019s unhinged on Twitter but not in days-of-rage territory \u2014 well, given the possible scenarios in play, I\u2019ll take it, and be grateful that my worst fears didn\u2019t come to pass.Only about 1,360 days to go.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Balance Court Ruling in China Is Rare Win Against Piracy", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 New Balance has won a rare legal victory in China in an intellectual property dispute: A court has ordered five shoe manufacturers and sellers to pay the state $250,000 for using the American shoemaker\u2019s signature slanting \u201cN\u201d logo.In previous years, the company has battled legions of counterfeit manufacturers, taken on a rogue supplier who exported its shoes at a deep discount and, most recently, struggled in court to win the use of its Chinese name.In a preliminary decision, the Suzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court on Monday fined the five companies for breaching an injunction issued in September prohibiting them from selling shoes with the logo, according to a report in China Intellectual Property Magazine. The $250,000 in fines will go to the state. The court will issue its final judgment at the end of May, at which time New Balance could get damages.Amy Dow, New Balance\u2019s senior global corporate communications manager, confirmed the penalty, saying the brand used by all five was called New Boom.Ms. Dow said New Balance sued under China\u2019s Anti-Unfair Competition Law because the country\u2019s trademark laws \u201ccurrently provide slight loopholes for these brands to exist.\u201d\u201cThese actions are significantly more costly than traditional counterfeit enforcement measures, but New Balance believes strongly in the protection of our intellectual property,\u201d she said.The case offers a high-profile example of how doing business in China can feel like a Wild West shootout.For years, foreign brands have been battling low-quality manufacturers that churn out cheap copies of everything from iPhones to Louis Vuitton bags. But piracy in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, has a new twist: Manufacturers copy everything about a product but with a slight modification of the brand name.For New Balance, that meant consumers ran into New Boom, New Barlun, and New Bunren \u2014 brands that are protected under China\u2019s trademark law.\u201cParasite brands are fast becoming the scariest form of \u2018counterfeit\u2019 within China,\u201d Ms. Dow said in an emailed response.Ms. Dow said another Chinese court had awarded New Balance $550,000 this month in a judgment against companies making New Bunren brand shoes. Separately, New Balance has an outstanding case against manufacturers using the brand New Barlun.In China, trademarks are generally awarded to those who first file paperwork with the government. That has given rise to a crush of people registering the names of well-known brands, a practice known as \u201ctrademark squatting.\u201d Unlike in the United States, people who file for the trademarks do not have to give a reason for their application.Trademark lawyers said companies rarely obtain preliminary injunctions in China, making this case an unusual one.Douglas Clark, an intellectual property lawyer who has practiced in Greater China for the last 25 years, said he could not recall a Chinese court imposing such a substantial fine for breaching a preliminary injunction.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely significant because until now, defendants have very commonly in China just ignored court orders,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cThis is sending a message that if you don\u2019t obey them, you will get into trouble.\u201dGuizeng Wayne Liu, a senior partner at Yuanhe Partners, said Monday\u2019s decision underlined China\u2019s willingness to protect intellectual property rights.\u201cThis is a good sign for New Balance in future trial cases,\u201d Mr. Liu added.Trademark lawyers say Beijing has started taking intellectual property rights seriously because Chinese companies now have valuable intellectual property to protect.Charles Feng, head of the intellectual property division at the law firm East & Concord Partners, said the injunction was particularly important because Chinese courts typically don\u2019t award much in the way of damages in trademark infringement cases. An injunction helps them minimize the losses from trademark infringement, Mr. Feng said.He cited statistics from the Chinese courts that show that in the past 10 years, only 5 to 10 percent of companies that applied for preliminary injunctions obtained them.The decision comes 10 months after a Chinese court upheld an earlier ruling that New Balance\u2019s Chinese trademark had infringed the rights of a businessman who had registered it first. The court ordered the company to pay the businessman $730,000, reducing the fine from $14 million.Edward Lehman, from Lehman, Lee and Xu, one of China\u2019s top law firms, said the punishment in this week\u2019s case implied that the courts had monitored the enforcement of the injunction. That was a good sign, he said, but much is left to be done.\u201cFrom an intellectual property portfolio management perspective, this is a Band-Aid on cancer,\u201d Mr. Lehman said.Zhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Erdogan: Democracy\u2019s Savior or Saboteur?", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byANKARA, Turkey \u2014 The political career of Yasar Yakis, a former foreign minister of Turkey, offers a telling look at the trajectory of the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.But less than four months later, Mr. Yakis lost his cabinet post. In the years since, he has been increasingly at odds with Mr. Erdogan, as the leader\u2019s policies grew increasingly authoritarian.Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Yakis remarked, once compared democracy with a tram: You can leave it once you reach your stop. Today, Mr. Yakis said, Mr. Erdogan \u201cis not any longer on the tram.\u201dOn Sunday, Turkish voters will decide whether to vastly expand the powers of the president, who has overseen the firing of about 130,000 people and the arrest of about 45,000 after a failed coup last year.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters view the constitutional referendum as a necessary response to the chaos in Turkey. They say the proposed constitutional changes would give the president the tools needed to quell Turkey\u2019s many crises.But Mr. Erdogan\u2019s critics insist that he is trying to take advantage of the turmoil to shroud a major power grab. They say that granting enormous new executive powers to the presidency, when the current office holder has already shown authoritarian tendencies, just might sound the death knell for Turkish democracy.The economy is struggling. Nearly one in four young Turks is out of work \u2014 the highest percentage since the peak of the financial crisis in early 2009. And beyond Turkey\u2019s southern border, Mr. Erdogan has dwindling influence on shaping the outcome of the Syrian civil war, should it finally be settled.His favored Syrian proxies have failed to oust Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, while Kurdish militias \u2014 which Mr. Erdogan sees as terrorists \u2014 have established autonomous statelets in two parts of northern Syria, with the implicit backing of the United States and Russia.Adding to this mess, Mr. Erdogan has a toxic relationship with Europe, accusing countries like the Netherlands and Germany of Nazism after they barred his surrogates from holding referendum rallies for expatriate Turks on their territory.According to Mr. Yakis, the scale of the diplomatic fallout, which has probably ended any remaining hopes of Turkey\u2019s joining the European Union, has few parallels.\u201cI don\u2019t remember an era in the recent decades and scores of years in which Turkey was isolated to this extent,\u201d said Mr. Yakis, 78. \u201cI don\u2019t remember periods where Turkish public opinion was as divided\u201d within the country, he added.To Mr. Erdogan, the answer to all these challenges is the expansion of his mandate.For now, he is by law, though not in practice, an impartial head of state who lacks full executive authority. The new system would allow him both to lead his own party and to formally hold full executive power \u2014 power that he has informally exercised since moving from prime minister to president in 2014, despite not having the constitutional right to wield such clout.The post of prime minister will be scrapped, giving only the president the power to form a government while reducing the ability of other institutions to scrutinize his decisions. The president would be limited to two five-year terms, with the option of running for a third term if Parliament truncated the second one by calling for early elections.\u201cThe referendum reorganizes the fundamentals of the state,\u201d said Ertugrul Yalcinbayir, who served alongside Mr. Yakis as deputy prime minister in the A.K.P.\u2019s first cabinet, and who is now campaigning against expanding the president\u2019s powers.Under the new system, the president would have the power to issue decrees, appoint a vast array of top officials and set the national budget, all with limited legal oversight. If Parliament rejects the president\u2019s budget, the previous year\u2019s program would continue with minor adjustments, unlike in the United States where lawmakers can ensure a government shutdown.Under the proposed measure, the president would appoint 12 of the 15 judges on the constitutional court, the body with the ultimate authority to scrutinize the legality of his decrees. He would appoint six of the 13 members of the country\u2019s higher judicial authority, which oversees the appointment of Turkey\u2019s 14,000 judges and prosecutors. Three of the rest would be selected by Parliament, making it likely that he and his party would appoint most of the members of the two most important judicial bodies in the land.\u201cChecks and balances will be extraordinarily weak and difficult to apply,\u201d Mr. Yalcinbayir said. \u201cWe are not saying it will necessarily be an authoritarian state. But this new package could lead the way to that, and we can\u2019t live with that fear.\u201dOne amendment would even allow the president to order disciplinary inquiries into any of Turkey\u2019s 3.5 million civil servants, said Metin Feyzioglu, the head of the Turkish bar association. This means that the local branch of the president\u2019s political party \u201cin a particular town would have de facto power over the public servants in that town,\u201d Mr. Feyzioglu said. \u201cIt leads to a total party state.\u201dYet, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters see things differently. They highlight how the new constitution would abolish army courts, further diminishing the influence of the military, which has ousted four elected governments in less than 60 years.The constitution would also give the opposition the power to override the president\u2019s decrees with its own legislation, and to call for early presidential and parliamentary elections, as long as opposition parties managed to win a majority in Parliament.But even if they cannot, the prospect of an all-powerful Erdogan presidency is still palatable to many Turks.\u201cIf it is going to give him more power,\u201d said Merve Kavakci, a political scientist who supports Mr. Erdogan, \u201cand if it is what the Turkish people want, so be it.\u201dUnder Mr. Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s economy was, for a time, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing. He upgraded infrastructure, built roads and bridges and improved health care and social services. A stronger presidency might allow him to accelerate this progress, his supporters say.\u201cHe\u2019s a doer,\u201d said Professor Kavakci, a former lawmaker who lectures at Uskudar University in Istanbul. \u201cThings will get done in an easier way.\u201dCould a \u201cyes\u201d vote also calm a chaotic Turkey? Nasuhi Gungor, a confidant of the president and a former head of news at the Turkish state broadcaster TRT, thinks so.Once clear of the divisive referendum campaign, political discourse might become more measured, Mr. Gungor said. The president might seek a fresh rapprochement with the Kurds. \u201cTurkey will relax after April 16,\u201d he said.For this section of society, Mr. Erdogan represents the protection rather than an erosion of democratic values. He provides a buffer for those previously sidelined by the Kemalist hierarchy, the nationalist, largely monocultural and staunchly secular elite, named after Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, that oversaw Turkey for much of the 20th century.But in a sign of Turkey\u2019s deep divisions, some members of other marginalized groups fear that Mr. Erdogan and his party care only for their conservative base.In reality, Mr. Demirbas argues, \u201cthey just did all this to consolidate their own power. Kemalism has gone, and in its place has come Green Kemalism,\u201d a reference to the color commonly associated with Islam.Nevertheless, few think Mr. Erdogan would use a referendum victory to establish a religious state.But despite the departure of figures like Mr. Yakis, the A.K.P. still bears little resemblance to most Islamist parties elsewhere in the region. Unlike the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s political wing in Egypt, for example, its lawmakers include women who do not wear head scarves, politicians who have never called for Shariah law and others who portray themselves as conservatives rather than Islamists.\u201cThere are, in the inner court of the A.K. Party, those who think that Turkey has to turn away from the West and embrace Middle Eastern countries,\u201d Mr. Yakis said. \u201cBut in the long run, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s possible\u201d because enough of the electorate would not stand for it, he added.Whatever the result on Sunday, little may change immediately, Mr. Yakis reckons. Win, and Mr. Erdogan simply bestows constitutional legitimacy on the status quo. Lose, and he will continue to act as a de facto executive president.In the longer term, however, a \u201cyes\u201d vote will accelerate Turkey\u2019s authoritarian descent, Mr. Yakis said. \u201cThere is a general rule in the social sciences: Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201dBut such a power grab, he said, might ultimately be unsustainable. \u201cThe Turkish electorate,\u201d he said, \u201cis capable of resisting or going against a strong leader when it is necessary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Jaguar Figures Out the Compact Sport Sedan", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byDrivenThere\u2019s nothing simple in the world today. Even bread. It\u2019s one of our most basic foods and yet the journey from farm to table is a daunting process. And the choices, from Wonder to artisan, are practically limitless.Cars should be simple and mostly about conveyance. But that\u2019s just the beginning of what some of us expect from them. Good ones can add elements of pop culture icon, status symbol, environmental statement and art object. Oh, and the truly desirable ones must entertain discriminating drivers.Jaguar finally gets the compact sport sedan recipe right with its newest four-door, the quietly handsome XE. It is Jaguar\u2019s most affordable machine, starting at around $36,000. More important, it competes nicely with the established players \u2014 the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Cadillac ATS, Infiniti Q50, Lexus IS and Mercedes C-Class. Jaguar\u2019s forgettable X-Type was never a real contender.Jaguar engineers didn\u2019t start from scratch. XE rides on the same robust architecture as the larger XF sedan and F-Pace sport utility vehicle (which is selling like the proverbial hot cakes). The structure is mostly bonded and riveted aluminum, much of which is gleaned from recycled material.Complicating things, XE buyers must choose from three power plants. For maximum velocity, there is the supercharged V6 35t. Fuel misers will choose the 20d, a 4-cylinder turbocharged diesel that the Environmental Protection Agency rates at an average of 36 miles per gallon.I drove the 25t Prestige model, optioned up to $47,000. That moniker means a gas-powered 2-liter turbo 4-cylinder is tucked under the bonnet. On the specified premium gas, it produces 240 horsepower and 251 pound-feet of torque.No loafer, it scoots this rear-wheel-drive machine to 60 miles an hour from rest in 6.5 seconds. The slightly slower diesel and high-performance V6 are available with all-wheel drive. All XEs change gears with an 8-speed automatic transmission.Starting a Jaguar means a bit of theater. Hop into the well-sculpted (but not overdone) driver\u2019s seat and the start button pulses crimson in heartbeat fashion. Upon ignition, the rotary transmission selector rises from the console like a rock star. Manual shifts are executed with steering wheel paddles. Drive modes adjust transmission mapping, throttle response and steering weight.My car lacked the $1,000 adaptive suspension, but Jaguar engineers have baked up a satisfying blend of comfort and sport without it. The XE is proof that electric power steering can provide satisfying road feel to driving connoisseurs. Body movements are well tamed during hard romps in tight turns. Without driving them back-to-back on a closed course, it is tough to know which sporty sedan is tastier, XE, ATS or the 3 Series.The E.P.A. rates the 25t\u2019s fuel economy at 21 city, 30 highway.Still, there are some caveats, which you may notice during a test drive. Throttle response can lag at times. Mash the accelerator and it\u2019s as if the ship\u2019s wheelhouse has called down to the engine room for full power. This lull can provide unwanted drama at intersections with heavy cross traffic. Also, the fuel-saving automatic engine start-stop system makes itself known when firing back up. In rush-hour traffic, drivers will end up switching off the system if the front passenger hasn\u2019t beat them to it.XE\u2019s cabin uses quality ingredients, but the other competitors rise above here. Those riding shotgun face a large swath of grained plastic. The wood veneer is so well done, it appears synthetic. For audiophiles, there is the excellent Meridian system with its accurate and detailed soundstage. But storage cubbies are on the skimpy side since the transmission knob takes up a good slice of the center console.There are some hard buttons to adjust the automatic climate system and such. But getting to the heated seat controls or radio presets means heading into the InControl touch-screen. The interface operation was moderately quick, fluid and trouble free for me during my week with it, but I\u2019ve heard of the occasional hiccup from other auto journalists.Those lugging child-safety seats in and out will find the rear door openings on the small side with back seat space somewhat meager. Average adults will be fine but foot room is tight. A sunshade and heated rear seats are part of a $2,235 package (not on my tester) that adds a vented feature to the front chairs. The raised drive shaft tunnel discourages a third passenger from riding in the rear.The back seats split 40/20/40. That\u2019s good because the trunk is not cavernous. Most sedans in the class will haul five carry-on suitcases. The XE stops at four.My eye sees the XE as handsome, though it can be mistaken for any number of brands without the signature open-mouth Jaguar grille. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s bland. In a week\u2019s time, both my passengers and I noticed this Jaguar turned a lot of heads.For those concerned about reliability, Jaguar Land Rover offers not just a five-year 60,000-mile warranty, but the scheduled maintenance as well.It took Jaguar awhile to find its way in this popular segment, proving how difficult and complex it is to bring something worthwhile to the table. The sedan market is ceding sales to S.U.V.s, but the nuanced XE should be able to slice off some sales from its challengers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade After the Trans-Pacific Partnership", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 In mid-March, ministers and high-level representatives from nations that have signed on to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as well as China, Colombia and South Korea, met for the first time since the Trump administration withdrew from the trade accord. The signal from Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Chile, where the meeting took place, was clear: Multilateral trade and Pacific integration are alive and kicking.The meeting, hosted by Chile as president pro tempore of the Pacific Alliance trade bloc (Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru), was a needed symbol of stability in increasingly uncertain seas. Protectionism, nationalism and populism are sadly on the rise worldwide. Indeed, multilateralism and the very concept of economic collective security are being challenged. The fears that drive retrenchment on trade must be reckoned with. Social and economic inequities resulting from trade are real.The countries in the Pacific Alliance will continue to work with the United States on a bilateral basis, but the Asia-Pacific region is ready to lead the new age of globalization in the 21st century by continuing the pluralistic approach to trade envisioned in the T.P.P., even though the accord no longer exists as we knew it.The 15 Pacific Rim nations in attendance in Chile three weeks ago signaled a strong and stable consensus across the Asia Pacific region that open economies, free trade and regional integration represent the way forward for achieving inclusive and progressive development. We remain committed to working pragmatically with its core principles and contents to advance open commerce, coupled with socially and environmentally inclusive domestic policies.Chile, for instance, has used economic integration and trade deals to drive growth, which in turn allowed the country to adopt smart, socially responsible policies regarding infrastructure, education, health care and labor rights to ensure the benefits are seen by all Chileans, not just an elite. The Chilean economy has grown 4 percent on average over the past 10 years, largely on the back of growing trade, while the poverty rate has decreased steadily to 11.7 percent in 2015 from 39 percent in 1990, when under a restored democracy Chile began negotiating trade deals.To that end, the Pacific Alliance agreed in Vi\u00f1a del Mar to begin trade negotiations with Asia- Pacific partners with the aim of quickly concluding comprehensive, balanced agreements that meet the high standards set by the T.P.P., such as improved services access, stronger labor rights, enhanced environmental protections and common guidelines for e-commerce. This commitment represents a major shift, as the emphasis is no longer on what will happen to the T.P.P. but on advancing its vision by using the Pacific Alliance as the platform for future trade agreements.Trade, particularly intra-hemispheric and with its Pacific partners, gives countries like Chile access to potentially billions of consumers and to previously unavailable lower-cost goods and services. But it also facilitates the advent of new small and medium-size businesses, which help societies to develop equitably and fairly, and provides a unique opportunity to learn from the experiences the region has accumulated in the field of production and productivity.Chile is an example of how trade makes developing nations prosper. Today, it leads Latin America in competitiveness, while it continues to make improvements in income equality and poverty reduction. Regional economic integration has played a key role in these achievements. Ninety-seven percent of Chilean trade is conducted through free trade agreements, and its exports to, and from, its partners with such agreements have performed better than those without.The Pacific Alliance alone represents over one-third of Latin America\u2019s gross domestic product, accounts for approximately half of the region\u2019s trade with the world and includes a growing consumer market of over 214 million people committed to free and fair trade, working together to achieve the free flow of goods, services, people and capital.To take even one step back from integration and open trade would mean sacrificing the progress we have made so far.We don\u2019t need to agree on everything to gain from trade. The way different countries see bilateral, regional or multilateral agreements might differ, but their leaders owe it to their citizens to set out constructive trade agendas that advance development and well-being for all.A good example is the bilateral United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement, which has produced benefits for both countries. Since this agreement went into effect in 2004, United States exports to Chile have increased to more than $10 billion from $2.7 billion, and Chilean exports to the United States have increased to $6.7 billion from $3.7 billion. The United States now enjoys a substantial annual trade surplus with Chile.Multilateral cooperation is an effective way to expand our economies, ensure security and promote the exchange of knowledge and talent. United States participation in such integration would certainly benefit all involved.However, trade is not a zero-sum game, as some would say. For too long, the countries driving economic globalization have taken public support for free trade as a given. With rapidly changing economies, we must now acknowledge the real dangers of people being left behind. At the same time, we must not pretend that closing borders and raising tariffs will reverse the continuing march of technology that has created an increasingly globalized and interconnected world. Instead, we must check ideologies of fear at the door, and build public support by working to harness trade and integration as an engine for inclusive growth and opportunity for billions.It is time to begin reshaping the future of trade. The Vi\u00f1a del Mar meeting has set us on our way. We can all win or lose together.Heraldo Mu\u00f1oz is the minister of foreign affairs of Chile.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Nostalgia for Main Street", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:I have also observed, in my visits to those Main Streets, that there is a tenacity of industry everywhere. Small factories hum with productivity, support local workers and contribute to the nation\u2019s gross national product. There is no reason, in a nation of more than 300 million people, that these remarkable assets cannot be rebuilt into a network of decent jobs and quality goods. This is a much better option for the nation\u2019s health than revisiting piecework, however gussied up by being on an online platform.The writer is a professor of urban policy and health at the Milano School for International Affairs, Management and Urban Policy at the New School.To the Editor:Louis Hyman seems O.K. that many town centers are now composed of nail salons, karate studios and boarded-up windows, while \u201cthriving\u201d cities have turned their centers over to luxury condos and stores.Mr. Hyman dismisses small businesses as \u201cinefficient.\u201d He values lower prices as the greatest good. My father-in-law drove autos from the town\u2019s Studebaker dealership. When the dealer changed to Dodge, he drove Dodges. Small business used to help bind communities. Now, such community support is quaint.Even considering its new hires, opening a Walmart Supercenter leads to up to 14 locally owned businesses and 150 retail jobs disappearing, property crime and obesity rising, and tax revenue dropping.Modern consumers rarely consider how their obsession with paying rock-bottom prices is driving labor sources abroad. Business\u2019s primary value has shifted from serving as a community\u2019s backbone to enabling fire-sale prices.JOHN PETERS, WAYLAND, MASS.To the Editor:The wealth that built Main Street gave us a distinct physical legacy that should not be allowed to die. There are thousands upon thousands of late-19th-century brick and stone Main Street post offices, firehouses, libraries, theaters, churches, mixed-use buildings and town halls, all set close to the sidewalk within walking distance of each other and the surrounding houses. Main Street was not just a place for making a living; it was the civic heart of town, formed to enable gathering and learning as well as commerce.Chain stores may change economics, but they need not change the essential form of these walkable places. Woolworth\u2019s and Kress contributed handsome urban buildings that still stand, many reoccupied by newer chains like CVS and Dollar Tree, or independent businesses. Some, of course, are derelict. A Works Progress Administration-style federal program could put locals to work repairing their Main Streets and renovating adjacent downtown factories for, say, clean energy jobs and training. But that would require a different president and Congress entirely.SANDY SORLIEN, PHILADELPHIAThe writer is a photographer and urban planner working on a book about main streets.To the Editor:Louis Hyman\u2019s suggestion that people left behind by today\u2019s economy can find work in what he calls global freelancing platforms like Upwork raises some serious questions. Although some in rural and small-town communities might be able to find work through those means, what security, if any, do those platforms provide for their workers in terms of paid sick leave, vacation and health insurance? And how are such workers going to be able to have access to a secure retirement?Of course, these questions are also appropriate with respect to those workers still employed by traditional, Main Street-style businesses, but I would surmise that those businesses might be more likely to extend greater loyalty (and with it, more security) than those who employ workers through freelancing platforms. The sense of nostalgia many feel is not merely for lost jobs, but also for the benefits and sense of security that used to come with them.AMY LAIKEN, CHICAGOTo the Editor:Louis Hyman misreads how Main Streets function in today\u2019s small-town America.Green Bay, my home, is the third largest city in Wisconsin. And although we don\u2019t have one \u201cMain Street,\u201d we have, through the deliberate efforts of our mayor and community leaders, allocated many resources into maintaining the city center as a place for all residents to congregate. Other communities like Appleton, La Crosse, Oshkosh, Fish Creek and Grafton have similarly focused on creating Main Streets that attract local businesses, cultural events, institutions and national chains.In this way, Wisconsinites are reclaiming and maintaining all that is good about a city center with a true local identity. These places have retailers and ubiquitous coffee shops. But they also have businesses participating in the new economy that Mr. Hyman describes in the last part of his article. In Green Bay and other Wisconsin cities, these businesses choose to locate in the city or town center to take advantage of the community vibe already created there.Maintaining a center or Main Street is an essential element to staying vibrant and relevant.The writer is chief of staff for the City of Green Bay.To the Editor:I suspect that the writer of \u201cThe Myth of Main Street\u201d has never tried to make a living through Upwork or selling on Etsy, as he suggests at the end of his article. On Upwork, you are competing with people from all over the world, including low-wage countries, and it\u2019s the predictable race to the bottom, often amounting to well under minimum wage. On Etsy there are too many gorgeous and beautifully photographed handmade goods chasing too few buyers.It was a great and uplifting note for the article to end on, but it doesn\u2019t hold up under even the briefest reality check.TRICIA BORG, ITHACA, N.Y.To the Editor:Louis Hyman says, \u201cMain Street requires shoppers who don\u2019t really care about low prices.\u201d In truth, independent businesses depend on people wise enough to distinguish between price and value. Value isn\u2019t merely cheapness, but a combination of cost, service, intangibles, and (for retail goods) product quality and durability. People\u2019s desire to bring back Main Streets is, in part, a growing recognition that craftsmanship and the personal relationships fostered by doing business in our own community are valuable things.Even Mr. Hyman\u2019s claims of chain superiority on price are too broad, as national buying cooperatives like IGA and Unified Grocers (for supermarkets) or Ace, True Value and Do It Best (for hardware) now enable independent businesses to compete against the largest chains in many sectors.Far from being a relic, Main Streets and community-rooted businesses will endure long after most of today\u2019s chains have been forgotten.JEFF MILCHEN, BOZEMAN, MONT.The writer co-directs the American Independent Business Alliance.To the Editor:Louis Hyman claims that a vibrant Main Street isn\u2019t an option in small-town America. South Berwick, Me., a still rural New England town (population 7,500) and not a tony suburb, supports an independent pharmacy, grocery store, home appliances store and several restaurants despite bordering sales-tax-free New Hampshire and its strip malls.We don\u2019t want to drive miles for basics, and we appreciate the personal attention and social networking of shopping local. Many of us also realize we are keeping money in our community.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Shouldn\u2019t Focus on Job Growth. The New Numbers Show Why.", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsIt\u2019s not just that the economy gained a mere 98,000 jobs in March, or that the Labor Department revised earlier months\u2019 gains down by a combined 38,000 (though that apparent volatility alone is an argument for why government officials should be cautious in promoting any given month\u2019s numbers).More broadly, the United States economy has arrived at a place where job gains, one of hundreds of data points released as part of the monthly report, are not really the best indicator of how things are going.When the economy is at risk of falling into a recession or struggling to grow out of one, the change in the jobs numbers really is the best single number to understand the state of the economy. While it has a lot of month-to-month statistical variance, it is a fairly reliable indicator \u2014 especially if you average a few months together \u2014 of whether the economy is growing, contracting or stagnant.But there are no signs now that the United States is in recession or close to one. And once the economy is close to full employment, gains in jobs take on lesser importance. A few years ago, when the unemployment rate was at 7 or 8 or 10 percent, the level of job gains was driven by employers\u2019 confidence about the economic outlook.Now, with the jobless rate at 4.5 percent, the binding constraint is the number of available workers. Over the long run, employers can add jobs only as quickly as there are people to fill them. That is determined by a mix of demographic factors like birthrates and immigration levels, along with choices people make like whether to work, retire or stay home with a child.It\u2019s true that a more booming economy can tend to pull more people into the work force. As President Trump has often noted, there are indeed millions of people not in the labor force who might be in a more robust economy.But we don\u2019t know how many of those can be coaxed back to the work force as the economy looks stronger, or at what pace. That being the case, it\u2019s hard to know with any certainty what, in 2017 and beyond, would constitute a good level of job growth and what would be a poor one.Instead of focusing on job growth numbers, which are poised to decelerate anyway thanks to the economy\u2019s near-full-employment status, it would behoove the Trump administration to focus on job market metrics that shed more light at this stage of the recovery and that speak directly to the president\u2019s goal of getting more people back in the job market.There are two particularly obvious ones.\u25a0 Wage growth \u2014 more specifically, average hourly earnings for private-sector employees \u2014 seems poised to grow, and this would represent true progress for American workers. It rose 0.2 percent in March, a solid reading, and is now up 2.7 percent over the last year. That\u2019s pretty good given that inflation is low, but there\u2019s plenty of room for it to rise further as employers get into bidding wars for talented workers.In fact, if wage growth were stronger, you would expect it to have the positive effect of pulling people on the bench into the labor force. People who don\u2019t see the value in working for $10 an hour might do so for $15.\u25a0 Then there is the direct measure of how many Americans are working, the employment-to-population ratio. You can refine it to include only those who are between 25 and 54 to filter out students who aren\u2019t working because they are in school and retirees who are on the golf course.That number showed a bit of progress in March as well \u2014 it rose to 78.5 percent from 78.3 percent. But it remains below the 80.3 percent recent high in 2007, and well below the 81.9 percent record high in April 2000.If the Trump administration sets its foremost goals as improvement in those numbers, wage gains and prime-age employment-to-population ratio, it will be focused on the issues that truly bedevil the United States economy in 2017, and have a considerably better chance of success.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Bangladesh Makes Second-Class Citizens", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 For most of my life, I had one, troublesome passport. It was green, for one thing, even though the leather cover was titled \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh.\u201d My green passport made me nervous at airports; every time I handed it over to an immigration officer, I braced myself for the frown, the close inspection, the questions about how long I was staying and how much money I had with me.I was always that person who held up the line while people behind me shuffled impatiently. I carried a file of documents with me whenever I traveled \u2014 my student ID, bank statements, even college transcripts. It was impossible to go anywhere on a moment\u2019s notice: Once, to get a visa for a family trip to Barcelona, I camped out overnight in front of the Spanish Embassy in Dhaka, where I watched the sun rise with South Africans, Jordanians, Pakistanis and Indonesians \u2014 all bearers of problem passports like mine.But the passport was precious because it was hard-won. My grandparents were born in colonial India, my parents in East Pakistan. Bangladesh didn\u2019t gain its independence until 1971, and the memory of this struggle was raw throughout my childhood. I was frequently reminded of how close we had come to being second-class citizens of Pakistan and how fortunate I was to have been born in a country that guaranteed my rights at birth.It now appears that those rights are not inalienable. In February, Bangladesh\u2019s cabinet approved a draft of the Citizenship Act, 2016, a law that proposes to create two tiers of citizenship. At the heart of the new law is a distinction that many countries make between resident citizens and dual citizens.Bangladesh has, in the past, placed no restrictions on dual citizens. The new law changes that. People with dual citizenship won\u2019t be able to join political organizations, work in the Civil Service or stand for office. Worse, their children will be subject to a bizarre and bureaucratic set of rules that, if not adhered to, will deny them citizenship altogether.To answer this question, the government proposes to empower a group of unnamed officials (we don\u2019t know whether they will come from the Civil Service or the army, or whether they will simply be random government appointees) to make decisions in individual cases. These officials\u2019 decisions will be final, and no court will be able to overturn them. This confirms what can already be inferred from the language of the proposed law: that creating tiers of citizenship opens the door for the state to pick and choose which rights to confer on its subjects, making citizenship conditional and at the discretion of the state.Ultimately, this law is not about dual citizens; it is about the assertion and consolidation of state power in determining what makes a worthy citizen and what acts will result in the denial, or annulment, of citizenship.There is a deep irony here. The Bangladeshi state wants to restrict the rights of those who are already citizens and place limits on those who can claim citizenship in the future. But this belies a basic fact, which is that many millions of us have left our country of birth for economic, social and political reasons. We have knocked on the doors of other countries; we have married and had children in distant lands; we have worked as peacekeepers, builders, housemaids and cabdrivers. We have been the refugees and the immigrants.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Woman\u2019s Death Sorting Grapes Exposes Italy\u2019s \u2018Slavery\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported bySAN GIORGIO IONICO, Italy \u2014 Her husband can still recall how Paola Clemente used to set two alarms to make sure she woke in the middle of the night \u2014 1:50 a.m. \u2014 to catch the private bus that would take her and dozens of other women to the vineyards.There, she would pick and sort table grapes up to 12 hours, taking home as little as 27 euros a day, about $29, after middlemen skimmed her pay. Sometimes she was so exhausted, she fell asleep in the midst of conversation.Her death of a heart attack at 49 in the fields has set off nearly two years of soul-searching in Italy over what the authorities, labor experts and union organizers described as an elaborate system of modern-day slavery \u2014 involving more than 40,000 Italian women, as well as migrant and seasonal laborers \u2014 that remains at the core of Italy\u2019s agricultural economy, especially here at the country\u2019s jagged heel.After months of investigation, this year the authorities arrested six people, accusing them of using their recruiting and transportation agencies to extort wages from women so poor and desperate they dared not speak up and worked under extreme conditions.\u201cWe are back to the situation we were in in the 1950s \u2014 the rights acquired by workers through the land reform have been crippled, if not nixed,\u201d said Leonardo Palmisano, author of various books on agricultural workers and a native of Apulia. \u201cThis is a phenomenon that is pervasive everywhere, not only in Apulia, and it affects Italians as well as foreign workers.\u201dIn Ms. Clemente\u2019s case, farm owners regularly paid middlemen to pick up and transport her and the other women. Sometimes, the middlemen pocketed two-thirds of the women\u2019s pay and deducted transportation costs. Five-hour trips were not counted on the clock.If the women complained, the recruiter would threaten not to call them anymore. \u201cAnother woman can take your place,\u201d one recalled being told, according to a court document.Even now, no woman who worked through a recruiter would speak for attribution for fear of losing her job. Investigators faced the same challenge.\u201cWhen we started interviewing Ms. Clemente\u2019s colleagues, we faced a wall of silence,\u201d said Nicola Altiero, provincial commander in Bari for Italy\u2019s financial police. \u201cWe see this system as exploitation, but workers see it as a chance, an opportunity that they dread losing.\u201dIndeed, in court records, several women declared that their recruiters were benefactors and that they considered themselves \u201cfortunate\u201d to have the work, as difficult as it was.Today, Stefano Arcuri, 62, Ms. Clemente\u2019s husband of 27 years, with whom she had three children, sometimes still sets the alarm for the same time she used to wake, or calls her cellphone, when he misses her. \u201cI want to feel that she is still alive,\u201d he said.Two months after Ms. Clemente died, the financial police searched her fellow workers\u2019 homes and found calendars on which many of them marked the days they had worked over past years. The number of days far exceeded what was listed on company contracts.It is a measure of Italy\u2019s lingering economic crisis and scarcity of work that the women accepted almost any working conditions and would not go to the authorities even as middlemen siphoned off their hard-earned pay.Moreover, mafia organizations take part in the workers\u2019 exploitation, feeding what Mr. Palmisano, the author, defined as a \u201csystem of slaves that impoverishes small farmers, enriches the large retailers and favors money laundering.\u201dItaly\u2019s new law has raised jail sentences for exploiting workers to up to six years, and it imposes harsh sanctions against employers who use underpaid labor. Goods and even companies can be seized by the authorities, with the proceeds going to a fund used to benefit the victims.But many farmers say the law\u2019s strict new requirements in terms of health checks and equipment are a serious burden for small companies, favoring large producers.\u201cI am very glad we have a law against the exploitation of workers in the fields, because these practices damage healthy companies, creating unfair competition,\u201d said Donato Fanelli, sales manager at a small agricultural co-op in Rutigliano, near Bari.But \u201clarger producers with seasonal workers can offer better prices,\u201d Mr. Fanelli said. \u201cThe new law should also help the hundreds of small and medium producers.\u201dThe authorities praised the legislation as a first step. But a scarcity of work is driving a race to the bottom, union organizers warn.\u201cThe problem is that enslaved workers don\u2019t take advantage of the gains,\u201d said Assunta Urselli, general secretary at the Flai Cgil union in Taranto. \u201cThe only thing that increases is competition among workers.\u201dThe constant threat of being replaced compelled Ms. Clemente and her co-workers to push themselves mercilessly. Women later told the police that, despite the summer heat, they even tried to drink water only if strictly necessary, to avoid asking permission to relieve themselves.Women were preferred because their thin fingers and skill made them perfect for picking and cleaning table grapes. They would do it for hours and hours.One day, buyers from Northern Europe came to visit the fields and were impressed with Ms. Clemente\u2019s ability to remove the tiniest grapes from the rest of the cluster, without leaving marks, Ms. Clemente once told her family.\u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d she told them with pride, Mr. Arcuri recalled.Before she died in mid-July 2015, Ms. Clemente was showing signs of malaise on the bus, her fellow workers told the police. She worked anyway \u2014 if anyone missed a day, the bosses would no longer call them.Every workday, she woke in the middle of the night to wash up and prepare a backpack with crackers and a thermos bottle of coffee.\u201cShe was afraid of being late,\u201d Mr. Arcuri said in an interview on a recent afternoon, looking out over a vineyard, covered with nets to protect against hail, near their home in San Giorgio Ionico, a town east of Taranto in western Apulia. \u201cIf you are late, they don\u2019t let you get on the bus.\u201dMs. Clemente worried so much about not working that if she did not get a call, she arose anyway and had her husband drive her to pickup points to see whether the group really did not have work that day, he said.The private bus usually came around 3 a.m. More than two hours later, as the sun rose, she and the other workers were ready to start sorting or picking table grapes. After the day was over, the bus drove them home again, over miles of poor roads.Sometimes, Ms. Clemente\u2019s co-workers would tease her because she fell asleep while they were talking to her.Ms. Clemente collapsed and her heart stopped beating about 8 a.m., as she was sorting grapes under a plastic tent in a field.\u201cThe difference between how my wife worked and how migrants work is that Italians make more money, and the fact that we have a house to sleep in,\u201d Mr. Arcuri said.\u201cI trust justice. The truth will come out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I do hope that the law that her death triggered will help migrants and Italians alike.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the Kremlin Influence the French Election?", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPARIS \u2014 Never, it is being said, has a presidential election in France seemed so uncertain. And never has there been so much concern about possible attempts by the Russian leadership to shape \u2014 perhaps even interfere with \u2014 the outcome.Last month, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France denounced the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to \u201cinfluence public opinion\u201d through \u201cideological operations\u201d and its \u201cstrategy of influence, of networks\u201d in France. His comments followed another accusation, by Richard Ferrand, the national secretary of the En Marche! (Onward!) movement, who claimed that the Kremlin was responsible for a series of cyberattacks against the party\u2019s website and that it was seeking to undermine Emmanuel Macron, En Marche!\u2019s presidential candidate, for being, among other things, too pro-European Union. The Kremlin has denied this.The French government is worried that hackings or cyberattacks may occur during the upcoming elections \u2014 for president, in April and May, and for the national legislature, in June. Partly as a result, French nationals living abroad will not be allowed to vote electronically in the legislative election. (The option is never available for presidential elections.)Computer breaches, propaganda, disinformation \u2014 even campaign financing \u2014 there are indeed many reasons to worry. And all the more so because the Kremlin\u2019s sapping offensive in France is a vast and long-running project.L\u2019Institut de la d\u00e9mocratie et de la coop\u00e9ration (the Institute of Democracy and Cooperation) was set up in Paris in 2008. Its stated purpose is to create \u201ca bridge of solid friendship between two great European nations, France and Russia.\u201d Yet in numerous interviews its director, Natalia Narochnitskaya, has put forward very hostile views. The West wants to subjugate Russia, impose its rules on it, even \u201cdismember\u201d it, she has said, and to these ends it makes opportunistic use of human rights issues. For Ms. Narochnitskaya, Russia offers \u201can alternative to the West.\u201dThe Kremlin\u2019s third main proxy organization in France is the much less formal Forum des compatriotes (the Compatriots\u2019 Forum). It first convened in 2011 and brings together Russian-speaking \u00e9migr\u00e9s and descendants of \u00e9migr\u00e9s in meetings held at the Russian embassy in Paris. This forum, and others like it in other countries, are at the heart of Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201cRussian World\u201d initiative: an effort to mobilize the Russian diaspora for various linguistic, cultural or economic projects but also to build support for the Kremlin on such geopolitical questions as the war between Russia and Ukraine.The leaders of these three organizations appear regularly in French news outlets and various media, in French and other languages, that the Kremlin has created and is wholly funding. The two most important of these, both active on social-media networks, are Sputnik and RT (Russia Today), which is to begin broadcasting in French this year.Sputnik and RT have published numerous articles about, say, the problems ostensibly caused by immigrants, thereby reinforcing the fear and the backlash triggered by recent terrorist attacks. They do not hesitate to distort facts and even invent some. That technique, which used to be taught in some journalism schools in the former Soviet Union, seeks to create an emotional shock and suppress all capacity for analysis. By suggesting that facts don\u2019t matter, it also fuels conspiracy theories.When it comes to the presidential election, Sputnik and RT attack Mr. Macron while supporting the candidacies of Marine Le Pen, of the far right, and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, of an increasingly hardening mainstream right. It was on Sputnik News (in English) that Nicolas Dhuicq \u2014 a member of the Dialogue franco-russe\u2019s bureau and a representative from Mr. Fillon\u2019s party, Les R\u00e9publicains, in the French National Assembly \u2014 recently accused Mr. Macron of being \u201can agent of the big American banking system\u201d and receiving the support of \u201ca very wealthy gay lobby.\u201dBacking from Russia can also be more concrete, particularly financial. So far only one such case is known in France, but it may not be unique. In 2014 Ms. Le Pen, the leader of the Front National party, received a loan of 9 million euros from the First Czech Russian Bank. (The bank, now in bankruptcy, counted Vyacheslav Babusenko, a former senior official in the K.G.B., among its principal directors.) A Cypriot company gave 2 million euros to Cotelec, the micro-party of Jean-Marie Le Pen, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father and the Front National\u2019s former leader. The company appears to belong to a Russian national who owes his career to connections with the secret service, according to the Russian edition of Forbes magazine.Were those transactions loans, or were they quid pro quos? The Front National has actively supported the Kremlin lately and stated that it is \u201copposed to sanctions against Russia.\u201d Mr. Putin welcomed Ms. Le Pen to Moscow recently, saying he was \u201cvery happy\u201d to see her. She has called him \u201ca man committed to values,\u201d in particular \u201cthe Christian heritage of European civilization.\u201dFrench people, for their part, seem to be skeptical. In a 2015 poll (the most current on this issue), 85 percent of respondents did not trust Mr. Putin or his judgment in foreign policy. Between 2003 and 2015, respondents\u2019 level of trust in him plummeted from 48 percent to 15 percent.Its goal is to build the \u201cpost-West world order\u201d that Sergey Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, called for in a speech he gave in Munich in February. And anyone who is aware of Russia\u2019s internal situation \u2014 generalized corruption, a nonperforming economy, widespread poverty, the obvious deterioration of political and civil liberties \u2014 cannot but tremble at the prospect that Mr. Putin may have any influence on the presidential election in France.C\u00e9cile Vaissi\u00e9 is a professor of Russian studies at Rennes II University and the author of \u201cLes R\u00e9seaux du Kremlin en France.\u201d This essay was translated by John Cullen from the French.Advertisement"}

But responding to Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s desire for a political rebirth might require a more finessed response, analysts said.The hard-liners have seized on popular discontent over the economy, and they tried to undermine and pressure Mr. Rouhani where they could. About a dozen pro-Rouhani activists who oversaw social media pages have been arrested in recent weeks. Mr. Rouhani\u2019s brother, Hossein Fereydoun, was summoned to court last week on allegations of corruption. Morality police officers, whom Mr. Rouhani had promised to remove from the streets during the 2013 presidential campaign, are back and arresting women deemed to be wearing their Islamic scarves improperly.Mr. Ahmadinejad, meanwhile, has been quietly trying to rebrand himself. Ever since his falling-out with Ayatollah Khamenei, which was over the selection of the minister of intelligence, a position that requires the supreme leader\u2019s approval, Mr. Ahmadinejad has been presenting himself as an anti-establishment figure \u2014 someone who is not afraid to ignore the will of Ayatollah Khamenei.At a news conference last week, Mr. Ahmadinejad was reminded of a remark last year by Ayatollah Khamenei in which he hinted that he had told Mr. Ahmadinejad not to run again for office. \u201cThis was only an advice, not an order,\u201d Mr. Ahmadinejad told reporters.Supporters of Mr. Rouhani carefully welcomed Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s decision to register as a presidential candidate.\u201cAhmadinejad registering is a big plus for Rouhani,\u201d said Hossein Ghayoumi, a cleric who supports Mr. Rouhani. \u201cHe is planning to fight with the hard-liners, not us. Let them be.\u201dIn their election calculations, hard-liners have been lining up behind Ibrahim Raeesi, a former judicial official. Many of them hope that Mr. Raeesi will one day succeed Ayatollah Khamenei as the supreme leader, and they think having executive experience would increase his chances. Mr. Raeesi heads the extremely powerful Imam Reza Foundation in Mashhad, in the east of Iran. But his credentials are tainted by accusations that he was involved in a so-called death committee that issued verdicts that led to the executions of thousands of political prisoners in 1988.Many Iranian news outlets had been predicting that the presidential race would fundamentally pit Mr. Rouhani, the incumbent, against Mr. Raeesi, the challenger favored by hard-liners. But Mr. Ahmadinejad, at his news conference last week, suggested a three-way contest.Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line political analyst who supports Mr. Raeesi, noted that an aide to Mr. Ahmadinejad, Hamid Baghaee, had also registered as a candidate on Wednesday.\u201cIn his dreams he might envision a sort of Putin-Medvedev interplay, where he or one of his aides can hold power,\u201d Mr. Taraghi said of Mr. Ahmadinejad.The Guardian Council, a 12-member committee that vets the candidates, will announce on April 26 which candidates it determines are qualified to run. Usually, hundreds of hopefuls are disqualified because the council decides they are insufficiently Islamic or because their plans are not in line with the Islamic republic\u2019s ideology.Most analysts think Mr. Ahmadinejad is not likely to make the cut, unless he can make a significant show of support. He would have to mobilize his supporters over the next two weeks, said Hojjat Kalashi, a sociologist who is critical of the establishment.\u201cIf he can\u2019t show that he still has supporters, they will easily disqualify him,\u201d Mr. Kalashi said.Mr. Ahmadinejad has called upon his supporters to gather on Friday in East Tehran, a middle-class area where he has lived most of his life. But the authorities seldom allow large gatherings, and the area around his house can easily be cordoned off by the security forces.Whatever the outcome, Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s decision to seek another run for the presidency presents a dilemma to Iran\u2019s establishment.\u201cBoth a qualification or a disqualification will be costly for the ruling establishment,\u201d Mr. Taraghi, the hard-line analyst, said. \u201cJust how costly remains to be seen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Invokes Internet Freedom While Trying to Kill It", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byEditorialHere we go again. The Federal Communications Commission, now led by an anti-regulation ideologue appointed by President Trump, wants to gut the net neutrality rules that keep powerful broadband companies from calling the shots on the internet, at the expense of consumers.Under the cynical guise of \u201crestoring internet freedom,\u201d the new F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, wants to give big telecom companies carte blanche to treat the content of their subsidiaries and partners more favorably than information from other companies \u2014 a practice that AT&T, Comcast and Verizon are already starting to employ. They would also be able to demand fees from companies like Netflix and YouTube to deliver videos and other content to customers.If the commission, which has a 2-to-1 Republican majority, approves Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, there will be little stopping the broadband industry from squelching competition, limiting consumer choice and raising prices. The previous F.C.C. chairman, Tom Wheeler, helped put the rules Mr. Pai is attacking in place in 2015, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld them last year.Large telecommunications companies have been raking in profits in recent years. And they have been making multibillion-dollar acquisitions \u2014 not something you see from an industry that is withering from senseless regulations. Charter spent more than $65 billion last year to buy Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. AT&T bought DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015 and is trying to buy Time Warner, the media company, for $85 billion.Not only is Mr. Pai\u2019s lament for the broadband industry based on alternative facts, it misses the bigger point. Net neutrality is meant to benefit the internet and the economy broadly, not just the broadband industry. That means the commission ought to consider the impact the regulations have on consumers and businesses. In particular, the commission has a responsibility to protect people with few or no choices; most Americans have access to just one or two companies for residential service and just four big operators for wireless.Mr. Pai argues that if the Wheeler rules are revoked, some safeguards will remain. For example, he says, broadband companies would refrain from blocking or slowing the content of competitors. He has not said how he would ensure that. But the F.C.C. is considering using voluntary commitments from the industry.Under that approach, officials at the Federal Trade Commission would have the power to fine or sue companies that make pledges and then fail to uphold them. But it is hard to believe that voluntary standards would be strong enough. It also puts the onus on individuals and small businesses to complain to regulators and request investigations.Big internet businesses like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix will probably be fine under Mr. Pai\u2019s plans, because they are well established and have the money to cut special deals with broadband companies.Smaller firms and start-ups \u2014 some of which may never get started \u2014 will not be as lucky.Ultimately, though, the real losers will be all Americans, because there will be fewer choices and less innovation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Wants to Rule the World. First It Must Conquer India.", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byBANGALORE, India \u2014 Nandini Balasubramanya\u2019s office here on the southern edge of India\u2019s technology capital does not look as if it would play a key role in the world\u2019s most valuable start-up\u2019s plans for global conquest.On many days, the tiny space has no electricity. So Ms. Balasubramanya keeps the door open, the noise and dust of Bangalore\u2019s traffic-choked streets streaming in. On one wall, next to a table where she greets a stream of neighborhood job seekers, is a large menu of the documents she asks of each applicant \u2014 driver\u2019s license, proof of insurance, vehicle registration permit, proof of bank account, and a half dozen other chits to pass through India\u2019s bureaucracy.There is also a framed photograph of a smiling Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of the American ride-hailing company, Uber.Ms. Balasubramanya, 32, does not work for Uber, though. She is an \u201cUberDost\u201d or \u201cfriend of Uber,\u201d an independent recruiter who is paid by the company for each driver she brings on. The work is rewarding but often difficult, she said.After all, this is India, and some drivers have little actual driving experience. Ms. Balasubramanya has trained people who have never worked before, and those with little experience managing money or interacting with middle-class customers. Many also don\u2019t know how to use a smartphone app \u2014 the beating heart of the Uber ecosystem \u2014 or they struggle with basic map reading.\u201cI show them how to use Uber, teach them about how to use navigation, or how to use a phone,\u201d Ms. Balasubramanya said.She has a team of recruiters constantly out scouting for new drivers. And she recently hired a few more employees to call those drivers, making sure that the ones she has found are sticking with Uber, not quitting the service out of apathy or confusion.Uber is famously aggressive, and that trait shines through in its ambitions for India. Relatively few people own cars here, so Uber\u2019s long-term goal is to leapfrog Western-style car-ownership culture and move directly into a society where people don\u2019t buy cars, they hail Ubers.India is also where Uber\u2019s vision of itself as a lean software company has come crashing into the sobering realities of analog life in a rapidly developing country. Its aim of blanketing the world in hail-able cars remains complex and daunting.\u201cThe way to think about it is that India is a super-important place in the world that has huge cities, with huge transportation needs, that we want to serve,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said in an interview. \u201cWe want to be there, and want to be there in a big way.\u201dThe troubles have cast a shadow over any plans the privately held company, which is valued at nearly $70 billion, might have had to launch a public stock offering. The particulars of its operation in India also highlight the fact that, for a business dependent on global domination, Uber still has a long way to go.Uber, which hung up a sign in India in 2013, now operates in 29 cities, including some of the most congested on the globe. Throughout the country, the roads tend to be terrible; clogged with traffic, potholes and pedestrians, marked by ever-shifting routes and a freewheeling interpretation of automotive rules that is almost balletic in its lawlessness.It\u2019s not just the roads. India\u2019s cellular networks can be spotty and slow, and banking, credit cards and other financial mainstays cannot be taken for granted. More than that, vast differences in education and wealth create a social dynamic between riders and drivers that cannot be smoothed over by improving an app interface.Not only are many of Uber\u2019s drivers here unfamiliar with smartphones, some are illiterate. Often, drivers and riders don\u2019t speak the same language. Many drivers need financial help to purchase or lease cars, and then require continuing help to manage their finances and other details of their small businesses.Both Uber and Ola argue that the long-term payoff for their efforts in India could be transformative. Ride sharing is already changing Indian urban life; getting around cities has become cheaper and safer, especially for women. It is also altering life for hundreds of thousands of drivers, many of whom are drawn from India\u2019s poorest ranks.Yet Uber\u2019s quest toward remaking transportation in India, which the company sees as a template for other developing nations, is bound to be long, expensive and complicated. Uber said on Friday that it lost $2.8 billion in 2016. The company did not break out losses in India, but Mr. Kalanick said the company\u2019s investment here is \u201can order of magnitude lower\u201d than the spending on its misadventure in China.\u201cWe are not profitable in any of the cities we\u2019re in now,\u201d Amit Jain, the president of Uber India, said in a phone interview. \u201cWe have a path to get there, and we are confident we will.\u201dIn San Francisco, where Uber has its headquarters, hailing a car is simple: You open the app and press a button. A Prius, or something like it, pulls up in less than two minutes, with the payment and mapping handled by the app.Such supreme ease of use was Uber\u2019s founding stroke of genius. Everything unpleasant about using a cab \u2014 finding one, getting one to stop for you, figuring out a way to pay if you didn\u2019t have cash, and fretting about whether you were being ripped off \u2014 had been improved by software.In India, too, Uber saw a transportation sector ripe for remaking. As India\u2019s economy grew over the last 40 years, hundreds of millions of people have moved to urban areas from villages. India now has three cities \u2014 Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata \u2014 with more than 15 million residents, and it has dozens more with more than a million.Yet India\u2019s urban infrastructure has not kept up. By the turn of the last century, transportation scholars began warning of an urban transportation crisis that had driven air and noise pollution, traffic, and road fatalities to some of the highest levels in the world.It is especially difficult for India\u2019s poor to get around. A tiny slice of the wealthiest Indians can afford private cars and drivers to ferry them. Others make do with an array of lesser choices: bicycles, scooters, bicycle rickshaws, motorized rickshaws, buses so crowded that passengers hang out the door. Most Indian cities lack adequate public transportation, and because of the foul air and the dearth of sidewalks, walking itself can be perilous. In Bangalore, three pedestrians are killed on the roads every two days.For both Uber and Ola, this presented an opportunity. Both thought technology would enable them to provide rides that were cheaper than other forms of transportation and more accessible to a wider swath of Indians.\u201cBefore we existed, getting a cab in most Indian cities was expensive and difficult,\u201d said Pranay Jivrajka, a founding partner of Ola. \u201cYou\u2019d have to call one day in advance. We started booking cabs with 12 hours notice, then four hours, and then we started on-demand. And today, if an E.T.A. is more than five minutes, people start complaining.\u201dUber had a grander goal. Mr. Kalanick has long said Uber\u2019s primary competition is private car ownership; if Uber can give you a cheap ride instantly, it could conceivably beat the cost and associated hassles of owning your own vehicle. In developed countries like the United States, car ownership is entrenched, but not in India. There was a chance, then, for ride-hailing companies to vault over private car ownership entirely.\u201cYou can\u2019t have every resident of Delhi driving a car \u2014 that just wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t have the infrastructure to support it, so why build it out? So that will be a big deal.\u201dThe leapfrogging of private car ownership remains far off. At this point, Uber has 200,400 active drivers on its platform in India. Ola said it has 640,000. Those numbers sound large, until you consider that nearly 400 million people live in India\u2019s cities.Still, citizens of a certain professional class \u2014 tech workers, frequent travelers \u2014 said Uber and Ola had become part of the fabric of Indian urban life.Before Uber, \u201cfolks were rather locked up at home,\u201d said Christian Freese, the general manager for Uber\u2019s Bangalore office, where the company has placed its only dedicated engineering center outside of San Francisco. \u201cNow you can see people go out, especially on the weekend. You just press a button and the car is there.\u201dWell, sometimes. Often in India, you open the Uber app, press a button, and then \u2014 nothing. The app selects a driver, but the driver does nothing. His car\u2019s icon just sits there, unmoving.This is something of a cultural mystery. \u201cDrivers in India take forever to start, and we are still trying to figure out why,\u201d said Apurva Dalal, Uber\u2019s head of engineering in Bangalore. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to do research on it, but we don\u2019t know why it happens.\u201dOne reason may be the drivers: Many are unaccustomed to smartphones and may not trust the digital notification that comes in over the app. Most Uber rides in India involve riders phoning drivers to confirm that the ride is for real.On top of that, Uber\u2019s digital maps sometimes don\u2019t match India\u2019s ever-shifting road patterns, so riders may have to tell drivers how to find them.For instance, just outside one of Uber\u2019s offices in Bangalore, two roads meet in a Y-shaped junction. The junction is often snarled with traffic, so in January, someone \u2014 either a local authority or a concerned citizen, it\u2019s not clear \u2014 placed a makeshift concrete median in the road to better manage the flow. A two-way street was turned into two one-way streets, but because the Uber app\u2019s map didn\u2019t know about the change, Uber\u2019s cars entering the area suffered long delays, for several days.\u201cWhen we look at the average time to begin a trip \u2014 from the time a driver accepts a trip to when he picks up the rider and starts the trip \u2014 that is the highest in the world for Uber here in India,\u201d said Mr. Jain, the president of Uber India. \u201cSo our task is, how do you reduce that time?\u201dAbout half the Uber cars I tried in Bangalore were pleasant, and seemed in good physical and mechanical order. Others had no seatbelts, or lacked air-conditioning.The drivers were uniformly friendly, if sometimes unschooled in the ways of customer service. On a trip from the airport, one driver suddenly pulled off the road without a word. I panicked until I saw he was just heading for a gas station.Compared to other options available to most Indian riders, Ola and Uber represent an improvement in access to transportation, and a steep drop in price. In Bangalore, a 22-mile Uber ride that lasted nearly an hour cost me 548 rupees, or about $8.50. That was on UberX, the company\u2019s middle-tier service; with UberGo or OlaMicro, which use smaller cars, it might have been a dollar or two cheaper. A taxi taking the same route might have cost more than $10.At these prices, Ola and Uber are becoming everyday options for India\u2019s rising middle class.Uber has made several adjustments to its practices to get along in India.An even bigger change came in how it recruits drivers. In the United States, so-called sharing economy companies depend on untapped labor and capital: You\u2019ve got a decent car, a phone, and you need money? Why not spend your weekends driving for Uber?But the dynamics of untapped supply don\u2019t line up in the same way in India. Lots of people need work, but relatively few have cars or know how to drive. Drivers must also secure a commercial driver\u2019s license and special registration status for their cars.Most of Uber and Ola\u2019s losses in India stem from their vast operations used to attract drivers \u2014 for example, the network of UberDost contractors. Both companies have also set up leasing deals with banks and car manufacturers to get special terms for drivers in need of vehicles.The companies must also spend time educating drivers on the social dynamics of working for themselves. Many drivers arrive after working as private drivers for middle- and upper-class Indians; those jobs can be grueling \u2014 drivers work long hours, are expected to be constantly on call, and often aren\u2019t accorded much respect for their work. When they come to Uber and Ola, the same drivers have to adjust to a job in which they finally have some agency, and the change can be terrifying.\u201cMost of these guys used to work as private drivers, and they weren\u2019t treated that well \u2014 they were almost invisible to their employers,\u201d said Kalpana Behara, the head of Uber\u2019s driver training center and customer service in Hyderabad. \u201cBut now they have their car, and it\u2019s their business, and they\u2019ve never been in this sort of a role before.\u201dAll this money created a new economy surrounding the car business in India. Several Uber and Ola drivers described the services as life-changing. They make 30,000 to 60,000 rupees a month, or $450 to $900, far above the median income.Lokesh N., a driver who lost his business and who now owns a fleet of cars on the Ola platform, said, \u201cIn India, there is a social stigma about driving, but now the public is starting to accept it. People who come into my car accept the dignity of my labor.\u201dThe ecosystem these drivers depend upon rests on a shifting economic calculus controlled entirely by two companies. In the last few months, both Uber and Ola have begun substantially reducing incentive payments, sparking protests and strikes by drivers. Uber has said the subsidies will continue to decline.Betraying his famously obsessive manner, Mr. Kalanick showed a ready command of Uber\u2019s Indian operations. When I asked if India was Uber\u2019s second-biggest market, he rolled his eyes to the ceiling, as if accessing a spreadsheet stored behind his eyelids.\u201cHold, let me check, let me think,\u201d he said, and then made a \u201cboop boop boop\u201d sound as the numbers came to him. \u201cWe\u2019ll say India\u2019s No. 2,\u201d he declared.At other times during the 40-minute conversation, Mr. Kalanick seemed to grow agitated at questions about some of the difficulties of working in the Indian market.Indian cities do not present any problems that Uber couldn\u2019t overcome, he said, or that it hadn\u2019t seen anywhere else in the world.What about the traffic, the low ownership of cars, the local competitor?\u201cI\u2019m losing your angle,\u201d Mr. Kalanick responded. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m getting asked the same question over and over again. I don\u2019t get it.\u201dThen he excused himself to get a second iced tea. A few minutes later, he returned and I asked again if he was sure Uber would be profitable in India.\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t elaborate, so I prodded him on how he might know that to be true.\u201cI mean, I know all the data,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the operations at Uber\u2019s Bangalore office. The company\u2019s only dedicated engineering center outside of San Francisco is there; it is not the case that it has only one engineering team outside of San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reaching Out to the Voters the Left Left Behind", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byThe devastating recession that began at the end of 2007 and officially ended in June 2009 was the most severe downturn since World War II.The fact that people living outside big cities were battered so acutely by the recession goes a long way toward explaining President Trump\u2019s victory in the last election.The greater Los Angeles region \u2014 like other densely populated metropolitan areas such as Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, and Dallas County in Texas \u2014 recovered strongly and swiftly and supported the Democratic Party in Nov. 2016, from candidates for local office to the president.The chart shows that since the bottom of the recession in the fourth quarter of 2009, metropolitan areas have fully bounced back and are now significantly above their pre-recession employment levels. In contrast, employment in non-metro areas remains well below its pre-recession level.From another vantage point, Trump did best in regions where economic growth was the worst \u2014 where jobs are disappearing and where middle-aged white men and women are dying at younger ages.In the period from 1992 to 1996, communities of 100,000 or less were engines of growth, producing 27 percent of the nation\u2019s new jobs. The large metropolitan areas with populations of over one million produced 16 percent.By 2010 to 2014, the share of new jobs in the lowest population counties shrank to 9 percent, while the share produced in the largest counties grew from 16 to 41 percent.Put still another way, counties with populations below one million have seen their share of job creation drop from 84 percent of the national total in 1992-96 to 78 percent in 2002-06 \u2014 and then abruptly plummet to 59 percent in 2010-14.The pattern of net new business creation (new firms minus firms going out of business) reveals an even sharper reversal of fortune. In 1992-96, counties with fewer than 100,000 people produced 32 percent of new enterprises, while the biggest counties produced 13 percent.By 2010-14, very rural counties saw zero net growth in new firms, while the biggest counties boomed with 58 percent of new firms. All counties with populations under a million created 87 percent of the nation\u2019s new businesses from 1992-1996, but the number was 42 percent in 2010-14.In other words, the centuries-long shift of economic activity from country and small town areas to populous urban regions has sharply accelerated over the past 10 years. The result is that \u201cAmerica faces a small-county crisis of dire proportions,\u201d as Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings put it, \u201cand a period of opportunity in cities, the bigger the better.\u201dThere is a combination of forces driving these trends, according to Muro, most especially the growing importance of the high tech and digital industries. \u201cUrbanization,\u201d he wrote me,has become a major trend in the last decade or so, driven by the clustering of workers and firms in larger cities. The increased digitization of the economy has accelerated this dynamic, and ensured that changing skills demands have changed what places are best valued.At the same time, Muro noted by email:Rural America has been hammered by the end of the immediate post-crisis commodity boom and now there is precious little relief there: Agricultural prices are low, coal prices and automation are hammering coal country, natural gas prices are suffering from glut conditions, and meanwhile, no subdivision of the economy is suffering from more moribund employment growth.The rural crisis, according to Muro, \u201cisn\u2019t just economic but is now compounded by the rising mortality rates\u201d described in detail by the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton.a more complete picture of midlife mortality \u2014 by sex and education group, over the full age range of midlife, using shorter age windows, over time, by cause, and by small geographic areas.The Case-Deaton description of rising midlife mortality \u2014 especially an increase of \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d from alcohol, opioids and suicide \u2014 is, in effect, a demographic portrait of many of Trump\u2019s core supporters: whites with a high school degree or less living in rural to medium-sized towns and cities.Case and Deaton show that from 1999 to 2015 mortality rates among non-college whites rose in every age group, most especially among younger whites aged 25-34.The accompanying chart shows the rising \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d rates for whites without college degrees, compared to the virtually unchanging rates for whites with degrees.Case and Deaton found that mortality rates for whites were stable or declining in all counties with populations of one million or more \u2014 the counties, in other words, that voted decisively for Clinton. Conversely, white mortality rates rose by roughly one percent a year in all counties of less than a million \u2014 the counties that voted for Trump.In an email, Bishop noted thatoutside of cities of a million or more \u2014 and really outside of the 56 central city counties of these large metros \u2014 Democrats lose.Bishop argued in his email to me that \u201cthe split isn\u2019t just about politics. It\u2019s about lifestyle and identity.\u201d Increasingly, where you liveis tied into lifestyle and lifestyle aligns with politics. Politics, like lifestyle, is one way we construct our identities.The accelerated shift toward urban prosperity and exurban-to-rural stagnation reinforces polarizing disagreements between city and country on matters ranging from family values to education to child rearing practices to religious faith.Much attention has been paid to one daunting task facing Republicans: the need to prevent liberal values and ideas from seeping beyond large, urban counties into red counties and states.As the last election demonstrated, the compact geographical distribution of Democratic voters with liberal or progressive ideologies in states that were already blue allowed Trump to win in the Electoral College despite a sizable Democratic victory in the popular vote.Democrats, in turn, must figure out a way to extend their reach beyond the mega-population centers located mostly on the coasts, where cosmopolitan, globalist and post-materialist values dominate.Trump supporters\u2019 politics may be filtered through the perverse lenses of racial anxiety and cultural reaction. But they are not wrong to look upon cities as distant and alien metropolises that have benefited at rural America\u2019s expense.\u201cSo what\u2019s the fix?\u201d Spross asks.Return to the old ways of robust public investment, antitrust enforcement, and tax and regulatory policy to force money back down the income ladder. Stop treating deficit reduction as a goal in itself; rather whatever deficit level maintains full employment is the right one.The technological revolution poses a major problem for Democrats seeking ways to make economic outcomes more equitable by geography and class.McAfee noted that, given current trends,We\u2019ll continue to see the middle class hollowed out and will see growth at the low and high ends. Really good executives, entrepreneurs, investors, and novelists \u2014 they will all reap rewards. Yo-Yo Ma won\u2019t be replaced by a robot anytime soon, but financially, I wouldn\u2019t want to be the world\u2019s 100th-best cellist.Brynjolfsson argued, however, that the economic consequences of technological advance can be shaped by policy:Our one confident prediction is that digital technologies will bring the world into an era of more wealth and abundance and less drudgery and toil. But there\u2019s no guarantee that everyone will share in the bounty, and that leaves many people justifiably apprehensive. The outcome \u2014 shared prosperity or increasing inequality \u2014 will be determined not by technologies but by the choices we make as individuals, organizations, and societies. If we fumble that future \u2014 if we build economies and societies that exclude many people from the cycle of prosperity \u2014 shame on us. Technological progress is an extraordinarily powerful force, but it\u2019s not destiny. It won\u2019t lift us into utopia or carry us into an unwanted future. The power to do that rests with us human beings. Technologies are merely our tools.For the moment, the Democratic Party is forced to stand by and watch the Trump spectacle, unable to enact policies to address the issues Spross, Brynjolfsson, and McAfee raise. Would better candidates help to enlarge the electorate to appeal to voters whose primary concerns are economic?All three have been elected and re-elected in competitive states where to survive politically they have had to balance urban and non-metro bread-and-butter interests.Shifting the focus of attention onto politicians like these would be a modest first step, but for a party struggling to regain its foothold, a modest first step would be a major achievement. The question going forward is whether Democrats can compete more effectively and more efficiently for the votes of those who have been left behind. They should set themselves this challenge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bull Markets Don\u2019t Mean Extra Jobs for Wall Street", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byBull markets aren\u2019t what they used to be, at least when it comes to New York\u2019s economy.Although the stock market is surging and profits on Wall Street last year hit their highest level since 2012, the good times are not translating into jobs the way they did a decade ago, before the financial crisis and the Great Recession hit.Employment in the securities industry in New York City has risen for three straight years. But, at 177,000, there are still 10,000 fewer jobs in the sector than in 2008. And even if the stock market keeps rising and shares of behemoths like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continue to hit postcrisis highs, don\u2019t expect a surge in hiring on the Street.\u201cThe securities industry is still a pretty important source of very highly paid, very highly skilled jobs, but it\u2019s not really contributing to growth in the number of jobs,\u201d said William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.To be sure, financial services and banking remain a key part of the overall economy in the tristate area. The financial services and securities industry is the largest private-sector contributor to tax revenue in New York State.What economists call the \u2018\u2018multiplier effect\u2019\u2019 is especially high for finance jobs, since annual bonuses for bankers end up in the pockets of people like contractors, gardeners, jewelers, car dealers and real estate brokers.What is more, Wall Street remains crucial for the region\u2019s tax base, especially for New York State. The securities industry accounted for 18.5 percent of Albany\u2019s tax revenues last year, and about 7 percent of the city\u2019s tax haul.But as is the case for the rest of the country, the financial sector is no longer quite as dominant as it once was in New York, Mr. Dudley said. Finance has not gotten smaller; instead other sectors, like technology, have grown much faster since the financial crisis.Mr. Dudley added that \u201cNew York\u2019s economy has become more diversified,\u201d citing strong growth in the technology, hospitality and tourism sectors. He said that with roughly 150,000 workers, the tech sector in New York City is quickly catching up with total employment in the securities industry.\u201cNew York is no longer a one-horse town when it comes to what drives the economy,\u201d said Chris Jones, senior vice president at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit research group that focuses on the tristate area. \u201cTourism and technology have generated more jobs in the last decade and helped to diversify the economy.\u201dAnd while bonuses on Wall Street still dwarf those in other industries, annual payouts are also well below what they were before 2008, when Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns still existed.The average bonus for the securities industry in New York City last year stood at $138,210, compared with a high of $191,360 in 2006, according to New York State\u2019s comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli.The sector\u2019s healthy profits ($17.3 billion in 2016) come at a price. \u201cPart of how they\u2019ve kept profits up is that they\u2019ve kept head count down,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said.In fact, the securities industry accounted for just 6 percent of newly created high-paying jobs from 2010 to 2015, compared with 25 percent in the 1990s and 2000s. \u201cWall Street is still an important contributor to the economy, but I wouldn\u2019t expect a lot of growth in employment,\u201d Mr. Dudley said.Very low interest rates for years have also taken a toll, reducing profit margins at big banks, and forcing them to trim head counts and become more efficient.Some jobs also disappeared because the go-go days of huge leverage and light regulation are over, thanks to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms. With higher capital requirements, riskier activities have been pruned back.Even if some of that regulation is reversed, as President Trump has promised, memories of 2008 are likely to curb a return to the days of big bets and crowded trading desks.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of pressure on trading jobs,\u201d said Laila Worrell, a partner at The Boston Consulting Group. \u201cSince 2009, the regulatory climate hasn\u2019t been superconducive for trading volume growth at big financial institutions.\u201dTrading by humans negotiating over the telephone has been replaced by trading via computers transacting in milliseconds.And for jobs that can\u2019t be done by machines, greener and cheaper pastures beckon. While New York State recorded a 5 percent rise in securities industry jobs from 2010 to 2015, employment in the sector increased by 50 percent in Pennsylvania and 33 percent in Texas over the same period.On the other hand, New York could stand to benefit if financial firms exit London in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote last summer to exit the European Union, the so-called Brexit.New York and London have been rivals in the financial world for decades, with London\u2019s location and especially its time zone an advantage for traders dealing with Europe and Asia. Hedge funds expanded in the British capital, too, and some American policy makers feared London might overtake Wall Street.Experts cite locales like Paris, Luxembourg and Frankfurt as alternatives to London, but Mr. Dudley said, \u201cNew York is a potential place where people could ultimately move jobs, and the city could absorb them relatively easily.\u201dThere are also a few niches in New York where head count is growing rapidly, like financial technology, with new hires creating software and applications for banks and brokerages, and designing trading strategies using algorithms and artificial intelligence.\u201cNew York has become the world\u2019s leading center for financial tech innovation,\u201d Ms. Worrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s surpassed Silicon Valley because the financial institutions these companies serve are in New York. Proximity is very important.\u201dWhile the packed trading desks portrayed in 1980s classics like Oliver Stone\u2019s movie \u201cWall Street\u201d or the book \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d by author Michael Lewis may be a thing of the past, not everyone misses that world.Indeed, Mr. Dudley, an economist who joined Goldman Sachs in 1986 and spent more than two decades at the firm, said Wall Street\u2019s flatter trajectory is fine with him.\u201cThe financial services industry is in a pretty good place right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite rock \u2019n\u2019 roll like we had in 2005 and 2006, but I don\u2019t think we want to go back to that period. I would take a more boring financial industry if it helped create a more stable U.S. economy.\u201dMr. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, acknowledged that nearly a decade after the financial crisis, Wall Street remains unpopular in some quarters. But even if the big banks employ fewer of the masters of the universe than they once did, their outsize paychecks still ultimately benefit residents of the city and state.\u201cPeople have mixed opinions about Wall Street, but love \u2019em or hate \u2019em, it\u2019s still a big part of the city\u2019s economy,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said. \u201cWe want New York to continue to be the capital of global finance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Can Solve His Chinese Puzzle", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorGetting tough with China is a central part of Donald Trump\u2019s plan to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d During the election campaign, he claimed that China was \u201craping\u201d American industry. Since the election, he and senior aides have denounced Chinese policies over trade, North Korea and the South China Sea.These facts alone would make President Trump\u2019s summit meeting this week with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, very difficult. It is not that confrontation with China should be feared for its own sake. The real danger is that Mr. Trump\u2019s China policies are likely to be counterproductive, damaging America\u2019s prosperity and endangering its security, while hastening the rise of China.Mr. Trump\u2019s erratic approach to security issues scares American allies, making them less likely to stand with the United States if it confronts China over North Korea or the South China Sea. At the same time, the president\u2019s protectionism, demonstrated by his decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, will reduce America\u2019s economic role in Asia. As a result, America\u2019s traditional partners in the region will increasingly be tempted to look to Beijing, rather than Washington, for a lead.The underlying problem is that a tough-guy approach to Asia belongs to a bygone age when America\u2019s economic and strategic dominance was unquestioned. The rise of China has changed the balance of power in the region. The United States needs the help of allies and trading partners to manage a more assertive China \u2014 the very allies Mr. Trump\u2019s policies threaten to alienate.China is now the world\u2019s largest manufacturer, largest exporter and largest market for vehicles, smartphones and oil. In 2014, the International Monetary Fund announced that China had become the largest economy in the world, measured by purchasing power. By then, China had also become the biggest export market for 43 countries in the world; the United States was the biggest market for just 32 countries. And this year, Germany announced that China is now its largest trading partner.This shift of economic power, a process I call \u201cEasternization,\u201d has increased China\u2019s geopolitical clout. All of America\u2019s most important partners in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, Australia and South Korea, still look to the United States for protection. But their most important economic relationships are all now with China. That gives Beijing real leverage, which Mr. Xi\u2019s government is increasingly prepared to use.Some traditional American allies show signs of defecting. During a visit to Beijing last year, the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, announced a \u201cseparation\u201d from the United States and a new relationship with China. Filipino officials cite Chinese loans, infrastructure investment and fruit imports to explain why their country has modulated its criticism of Beijing\u2019s maritime claims in the South China Sea. As the defense minister said this week, \u201cany product that we produce, they will buy.\u201dChina is also more prepared to use economic and diplomatic threats against American allies. To put pressure on Seoul not to cooperate with the deployment of an American antimissile shield, Beijing recently canceled contracts with prominent South Korean companies.Even Australia is feeling the heat. On a recent trip there, China\u2019s prime minister, Li Keqiang, warned Australia not to take sides in any dispute between America and China \u2014 a remarkable intervention, given that Australians fought alongside Americans in two world wars, as well as the Korean and Vietnam wars. But no Australian government can afford to ignore Beijing\u2019s wishes, given China\u2019s significance as a trading partner and investor. In 2015, a Chinese company bought a 100-year lease on the port of Darwin on Australia\u2019s northern coast \u2014 to the consternation of the Obama administration, which had chosen the location for a new Marine Corps training facility.Neither South Korea nor Australia has yet gone as far as the Philippines, but there is a serious debate in both countries about their future relations with the United States. Their doubts will only increase thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent questioning of such alliances.\u201cI believe in relationships,\u201d he told The Financial Times last weekend. \u201cAnd I believe in partnerships. But alliances have not always worked out very well for us. O.K.?\u201dFaced with a delicate situation in Asia, America must adopt intelligent policies that reassure its partners. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump has done the precise opposite: targeting countries that run big import surpluses with the United States with a review of \u201ctrade abuses\u201d and threatening retaliatory measures. That move is a threat not just to China, but also to vital allies like South Korea and Japan.The president has also shown an unnerving unpredictability on security issues. His strong hints that the United States would entertain the idea of a first strike on North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities will not be welcome in Seoul, which is just 35 miles from the North Korean border and could be devastated by retaliatory strikes. Mr. Trump has also demonstrated a willingness to risk war with China over both Taiwan and the South China Sea, conflicts that none of America\u2019s allies (with the possible exception of Japan) would welcome.As tensions mount, nations in the region must feel able to trust Mr. Trump\u2019s judgment and his word. So far, the president has given them little reason to do so. Any suggestion now of a trade war with China \u2014 or worse, a shooting war \u2014 would horrify most of Asia. So, too, would any hint of a grand bargain with Beijing that involved trading away American allies\u2019 interests in return for trade concessions for the United States from China.In his meeting with Mr. Xi this week, Mr. Trump needs to send a carefully balanced message \u2014 not easy for a president who doesn\u2019t do nuance \u2014 to reassure America\u2019s Asian allies that it will stand by them, and stand up to China without taking reckless steps. If the president fails to offer such reassurance, America\u2019s position in Asia will continue to erode.Gideon Rachman is the chief foreign affairs commentator for The Financial Times and the author of \u201cEasternization: Asia\u2019s Rise and America\u2019s Decline From Obama to Trump and Beyond.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Multi-Pronged Attack on the Internet", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIf there\u2019s one thing that brings Americans together, it\u2019s our hatred of the giant companies that sell us high-speed data services. Consumers routinely give Comcast, Charter (now Spectrum), Verizon, CenturyLink and AT&T basement-level scores for customer satisfaction. This collective resentment is fueled by the sense that we don\u2019t have a choice when we sign up for their services.By and large, we don\u2019t: These five companies account for over 80 percent of wired subscriptions and have almost total power in their territories. According to the Federal Communications Commission, nearly 75 percent of Americans have at most one choice for high-speed data.It\u2019s about to get worse: President Trump\u2019s F.C.C., under the leadership of its fiercely deregulatory chairman, Ajit Pai, wants to let these companies become even more powerful by letting them do whatever they want and allowing them to merge with one another.Mr. Pai has already pushed Congress to erase rules that would have constrained these companies from using and selling our sensitive online information. And he is getting ready to wipe out the classification of high-speed data services as a utility \u2014 even though, without this legal label, the F.C.C.\u2019s authority to require these five companies to treat their customers fairly will be fatally undermined.Mr. Pai is responsible for a sector that accounts for a sixth of the American economy. But even that is an understatement: Everything we do, from manufacturing to governance, requires reliable, inexpensive, world-class data transmission.Perhaps the most immediate concern is the commission\u2019s so-called net neutrality rule, which treats internet providers as utilities and requires them to handle all data the same. The Big Five would love to get rid of this oversight, in part because they have become big players in providing content themselves, and Mr. Pai has put dismantling this structure at the top of his agenda.It\u2019s not just that the existing giants want free rein over their customers. They also want even greater scale and even greater involvement in content as well as distribution \u2014 and they\u2019re likely to get a green light from the F.C.C. Comcast bought NBCU a few years ago. Now behemoth AT&T, which already swallowed up DirecTV, wants to buy HBO\u2019s and CNN\u2019s programming through an $85 billion merger with Time Warner. Verizon already bought AOL, is about to absorb Yahoo and is rumored to be considering the purchase of Spectrum, the second-largest internet service provider in the country.Combining untrammeled power over distribution with must-have content gives a network operator both the incentive and the ability to use its network to benefit itself, whether or not its actions are good for the public. This has been true of communications networks from the telegraph forward, and we\u2019re seeing this same pattern play out with high-speed internet access.And the big picture is an even bigger problem. Other countries \u2014 South Korea, Sweden, even China \u2014 have made the widespread adoption of universal, inexpensive, high-speed data transmission a priority. They believe such access is necessary for their competitive positions on the global stage and understand that markets, if left to their own devices, won\u2019t deliver this benefit to all citizens.Mr. Pai, on the other hand, clearly believes that unconstrained companies, unthreatened by competition, will magically provide the networks we need. Given their track record, it\u2019s hard to go along with him.The one bright light in this dismal story is the power of local authorities to encourage the construction of the communications equivalent of a street grid: fiber-optic networks running to every home and business. Hundreds of local governments, fed up with the existing network providers, have done exactly that.According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, most Americans approve of this kind of local government effort. But the halls of state legislatures swarm with telecom lobbyists, and, amazingly, about 20 states already bar municipalities from making this choice. Not surprisingly, Mr. Pai has vigorously opposed federal proposals to block those state laws.We have always relied on private providers to sell basic telecommunications services, but they have historically been subject to public obligations and the watchful eye of a regulator looking ahead for abuses of power. No one could possibly think it is reasonable to leave a few companies operating in the centrally important, highly concentrated internet-access industry, free to do whatever they want. We dislike these companies for good reasons.Susan Crawford is a professor at Harvard Law School and the author of \u201cCaptive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Risen From the Grave, Keystone XL Pipeline Again Divides Nebraska", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byPAGE, Neb. \u2014 The fight seemed over. Plans to bury an oil pipeline in the Nebraska dirt, through hilly grazing land near the Elkhorn River and flat expanses of corn farther south, had been halted. Farmers and ranchers who spent years opposing the project moved on with their lives.Jeanne Crumly, who sees Keystone XL as a dire threat to this land, believes Mr. Trump is supporting it without \u201creally giving a hoot of how there are people and livelihoods at stake here.\u201d\u201cIt was going to be where he flexed his muscle,\u201d she said.If Ms. Crumly and her allies prevail, several dozen rural landowners will have triumphed over a transnational energy company and the wishes of their president and governor. If they fail, oil will flow through the Crumly property, in a grassy strip between where cows wander and corn grows.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re in that friendly of a political atmosphere.\u201d \u2014 Jenni HarringtonSo far there have been no mass encampments on the Nebraska prairie, no tense standoffs with the police, no highway blockades. But Jane Kleeb, a leader of the pipeline opposition, said the more muted tactics in Nebraska should not be mistaken for a lack of organization or tepid sentiments.Some supporters of the pipeline acknowledge the concerns of opponents, but say the pipeline will be safe \u2014 and economically beneficial. \u201cI think the state is ready to move on from this issue,\u201d said Jamie Karl, a vice president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which for years has supported the pipeline. \u201cI think this project shines the light on the fact there\u2019s a large disconnect between energy production and the average American,\u201d said Mr. Karl, whose family owns land not far from a different oil pipeline. \u201cYes, we all want no risk when it comes to energy production. We understand that. But gas doesn\u2019t magically appear in your car tank. Asphalt doesn\u2019t magically appear on the road you drive on.\u201d\u201cI am hopeful,\u201d said Jenni Harrington, one of four sisters who grew up on this farm along the southern portion of the proposed route. \u201cI think people in Nebraska aren\u2019t just pushovers.\u201d\u201cEnvironmentally, I\u2019m not worried about this thing at all.\u201d \u2014 Robert JohnstonROYAL, Neb. \u2014 Robert Johnston, a fifth-generation farmer and self-described \u201cultraconservative\u201d Republican, is among the hundreds of Nebraskans\u00a0who have signed easements for Keystone XL.Just like the pipeline\u2019s opponents, Mr. Johnston speaks passionately about his land and his family\u2019s history of farming here \u2014 135 years in his case. But Mr. Johnston says he believes that the potential damage from a pipeline leak has been exaggerated, and that Keystone XL\u2019s benefits far outweigh any risks.\u201cI\u2019m just not going to let something happen to that ground,\u201d said Mr. Johnston, who grows corn, soybeans and alfalfa. \u201cThat ground is pretty special to me.\u201dMr. Johnston sees Keystone XL as an economic boon for the state, especially a local school district that stands to benefit from additional tax revenue. He also considers the project an opportunity for Nebraska to do its part in expanding the nation\u2019s energy sector.\u201cWe farm. We burn thousands of gallons of fuel every year,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cThat was one of my initial reactions to it: \u2018How can they be opposed if they\u2019re driving a fossil fuel-powered vehicle?\u2019\u201dAs Nebraska emerges once again as a national pivot point for Keystone XL, the matter is already settled for most landowners along the route. Years ago, and with varying degrees of enthusiasm, those farmers and ranchers accepted payments and signed papers allowing the pipeline to be built if regulators ever approved.Ronald Weber, who owns land in the same county as Mr. Johnston, said he wished the route had avoided his property. But Mr. Weber still signed an easement, saying that he recognized the benefits of pipelines and that \u201cit\u2019s got to go somewhere.\u201d Neither Mr. Weber nor Mr. Johnston said how much they were paid by TransCanada, which proposed Keystone XL, but both said the company had treated them fairly. Mr. Johnston said he used his easement money, which was below six figures, to invest in irrigation in a field the pipeline would cross.\u201cMost people would just as soon not have it and prefer it went somewhere else,\u201d Mr. Weber said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just like you can\u2019t have electricity if you don\u2019t have power lines.\u201d\u201cEvery post, every water well, every piece of concrete, I put in here.\u201d \u2014 Terry Van HousenSTROMSBURG, Neb. \u2014 Visitors to Terry Van Housen\u2019s feedlot are greeted with an American flag and a large sign: \u201cNO PIPELINE, NO PROBLEM.\u201dMr. Van Housen, who grows corn and raises cattle, is adamantly opposed to Keystone XL, which would run beneath his fields. He says he might testify against the project at hearings this summer and, if it is approved, participate in protests.\u201cIf it goes over our water system, it could just ruin it,\u201d Mr. Van Housen said. \u201cI don\u2019t want it \u2014 any way, shape or form. I don\u2019t even want to be close to it.\u201dBut Mr. Van Housen is a registered Republican living in a Republican county in a Republican state. He voted for Mr. Trump for president, knowing full well that his candidate supported the pipeline and that Hillary Clinton did not.So intense was Mr. Van Housen\u2019s distrust of Mrs. Clinton that he says he never really believed she would stand in the way of the pipeline. And Mr. Van Housen says he believes that the president can be persuaded to oppose Keystone XL.\u201cI was happy he won,\u201d said Mr. Van Housen, 64, who has never voted for a Democrat and who said he was buoyed by Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to shake up government and bring back factory jobs. \u201cI thought we needed some changes in the system.\u201dMr. Van Housen says he cannot reasonably expect to agree with the president on every issue. But if Mr. Trump ever passes through Stromsburg, Mr. Van Housen says he will offer him a drink from his well. Then he will tell Mr. Trump that Keystone XL is a threat to that pristine water.\u201cIt\u2019s a 36-inch bomb,\u201d Mr. Van Housen said, alluding to the diameter of the pipe. \u201cIt could destroy me, my business, the whole family operation, plus the neighbors.\u201d\u201cThe land is worth more than what they offered me.\u201d \u2014 Jim CarlsonSILVER CREEK, Neb. \u2014 Jim Carlson has lived all of his 62 years along the gravel roads and soybean stubble near the Platte River.\u201cIt\u2019s the only place I know as home,\u201d said Mr. Carlson, who said he had turned down a roughly $300,000 easement offer from TransCanada.Most landowners along the Nebraska route have accepted payments and given TransCanada permission to build on their land. But about 90 of them, roughly 9 percent, have not. Mr. Carlson said he feared that a leak in the pipeline would imperil the groundwater he uses to drink and irrigate his crops.Terry Cunha, a spokesman for TransCanada, said the proposed path through Nebraska \u201cis the safest route possible for the pipeline,\u201d adding that construction would not begin elsewhere until the Nebraska permit was in place. \u201cThis project has gone through numerous reviews, and we continue to believe in the value behind it,\u201d Mr. Cunha said.Doug Zimmerman lives along the route of a different oil pipeline built by the company, in use since 2010, and says he has had no problems. If TransCanada wanted to put in another pipeline on his land, he says he would be fine with that. \u201cThey\u2019re more than welcome to dig another trench and put it in here.\u201d\u00a0But the route still traverses the aquifer, unnerving other landowners. \u201cIt\u2019s the people who are tied to the land,\u201d Mr. Carlson said, \u201cwho understand what\u2019s at risk.\u201dThe family ties run deep. Mr. Carlson\u2019s son is the fifth generation to tend these fields.\u201cIf it never happens, it\u2019s fine. If it does, I can accept it.\u201d \u2014 Bill TielkeBut Mr. Tielke, a third-generation farmer, also signed an easement allowing TransCanada to put pipe along more than a mile of his land \u2014 through an alfalfa field, across a cow pasture and beneath a creek. He says he is neutral on the merits of the project.\u201cIt\u2019s not a deal where I\u2019m going to go out there and start digging for them,\u201d Mr. Tielke said on a recent morning as turkeys and a whitetail deer wandered through his backyard. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a deal where I\u2019m going to be standing in front of it saying, \u2018No, you can\u2019t.\u2019\u201dMr. Tielke concedes that a leak is possible and could damage the creeks running through his land. But he also says that he believes pipelines are necessary, and that TransCanada intends to operate Keystone XL safely.\u201cA lot of landowners have given up their property for easements for the betterment of the whole country,\u201d said Mr. Tielke, who declined to say how much TransCanada paid him.While activists for and against the pipeline gird for a highly public fight, there are many others here who find some merit in each side\u2019s arguments, and who mostly avoid bringing up Keystone XL in polite conversation.\u201cWe don\u2019t go to the bar and talk about why you like it and I don\u2019t, or vice versa,\u201d Mr. Tielke said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a subject that you don\u2019t talk about.\u201dTensions have simmered for years here in Holt County, a place that is about twice the size of Rhode Island but home to only 10,250 residents.\u00a0Along Mr. Tielke\u2019s fence line, just feet from where the pipeline would cross, a faded, tattered sign has blown over from a neighbor\u2019s property. \u201cSay NO To Keystone XL,\u201d it reads.\u201cWe kind of consider it beyond price.\u201d \u2014 Susan Dunavan, with her husband, Bill.YORK, Neb. \u2014 Susan Dunavan received her first letter from TransCanada more than eight years ago, informing her that a future pipeline might be routed through the cattle pasture just up the hill from her apple orchard. It has loomed ever since. Except for a period of 12 months \u2014 after Mr. Obama had blocked it in late 2015 and before Mr. Trump was elected \u2014 Keystone XL has been all-consuming.\u201cWe have been eating, sleeping, breathing this pipeline because it affects everything in our life,\u201d Ms. Dunavan said. \u201cTransCanada not only wants to steal our property, they have stolen eight years of our lives.\u201d\u201cOur vacations for the last eight years have been going to State Department meetings, hearings at the Nebraska Legislature,\u201d Ms. Dunavan said.The fight could not be more personal.\u201cWe are not rich people,\u201d said Ms. Dunavan, who questions the need for the pipeline and worries it would harm native grasses on her property. \u201cWe spent our lives purchasing this land.\u201dA final resolution could still be years away. TransCanada wants to begin construction in 2018, but Ms. Kleeb, the opponents\u2019 leader, said she expects an appeal and lawsuit from whichever side loses before the Nebraska Public Service Commission. And even if a permit is granted, individual landowners could challenge the eminent domain process in local courts. Ms. Kleeb predicted that the pipeline could still be an issue during the 2020 presidential campaign.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go to the end,\u201d Ms. Dunavan said.Jack Begg and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disrespect Intended: Mechanic-Candidate Bursts French Political Elite\u2019s Bubble", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 He left the corruption scandal-plagued Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front speechless. He made the nepotism-tarred center-right candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, grin frigidly, murmuring about a lawsuit. And from the immaculately groomed television anchors he drew only condescending fixed smiles.It took barely over a minute for Philippe Poutou, a balding and unkempt Ford factory mechanic from Bordeaux running as a fringe candidate in France\u2019s presidential election, to puncture the mutually protective world of the race\u2019s mainstream. Afterward television commentators tut-tutted about his \u201clack of respect.\u201d That was exactly Mr. Poutou\u2019s point.So effective was his brutal anti-corruption language that two days after a marathon four-hour debate among all 11 French presidential candidates, the rumpled no-hope candidate of the New Anticapitalist Party was being hailed in some news media here as its unquestioned winner. Mr. Poutou, 50, had instantly become a kind of folk hero, one expressing in unvarnished form what many Frenchmen and women are thinking: The political class, encased in its privileges, is demonstrably corrupt.The corruption scandals, widely aired in the print press, have been mostly taboo beneath a well-maintained facade of respectability in these debates.But Mr. Poutou did not plan to ignore them. Instead of a suit, he wore a white henley T-shirt and had barely shaved. He refused to pose for the group photo at the beginning.\u201cIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m not wearing a tie that you can cut me off,\u201d he said sharply to one of the debate hosts, who was trying to curb him. Running from a far-left party that got 1 percent of the vote in the last election, Mr. Poutou had little to lose.There was going to be trouble.It came like a Scud missile, as Le Monde put it.Mr. Poutou turned to Ms. Le Pen, whose surging National Front appears on the verge of a historic breakthrough, all but guaranteed a place in May\u2019s presidential runoff against the other probable finalist, the former economy minister Emmanuel Macron.At the same time, her party is mired in twin corruption scandals, one involving fake jobs at the European Parliament, the other fake campaign-expense billing reimbursed by the state. Close associates have been charged.Ms. Le Pen, a supposed \u201coutsider\u201d candidate from a populist party, has refused to answer a police summons, invoking \u201cparliamentary immunity.\u201dThat angered Mr. Poutou. He didn\u2019t bother with honorifics or first names \u2014 another sore point for the offended television commentators.\u201cAnd then we\u2019ve got Le Pen, next to me, Le Pen, dipping into the public purse,\u201d Mr. Poutou said. \u201cIt\u2019s not here, it\u2019s Europe, and now for somebody who is anti-European, the worst is that the National Front, which calls itself anti-system, it doesn\u2019t give a damn. It protects itself thanks to the laws of the system, thanks to parliamentary immunity, and so refuses to answer a police summons.\u201dThen he scored what was acknowledged as the evening\u2019s bull\u2019s-eye, aimed squarely at Ms. Le Pen: \u201cWhen we workers are summoned by the police, we don\u2019t have worker\u2019s immunity. Sorry about that. There it is. Here we go,\u201d Mr. Poutou said.He didn\u2019t look as if he was joking. The studio audience burst into applause. Ms. Le Pen, visibly flustered, was left uncharacteristically silent. She had been attacked by a factory worker for being a privileged child of the system \u2014 a nuclear hit against a rabble-rousing candidate whose rallies are always framed by banners with the words \u201cIn the name of the people.\u201d\u201cThe blow,\u201d Le Monde commented, \u201cwas sharp.\u201dEditorial writers across France hailed Mr. Poutou, and his sally lit up social media.\u201cOne came out of it the big winner: Philippe Poutou,\u201d L\u2019Est R\u00e9publicain, based in Nancy, wrote. \u201cIn shattering the system\u2019s formalities, Philippe Poutou gave form, using simple words, to a widespread sentiment.\u201dMr. Poutou had \u201cshattered the screen,\u201d Le Courrier Picard wrote. \u201cIt was like the eruption of a certain reality into the weighty and rigid universe of the political-media sphere.\u201d\u201cThe devil Poutou leaped from his cage to attack Fillon,\u201d La R\u00e9publique des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es said, \u201cand then Marine Le Pen. He scored the winning hit. This is what will be remembered.\u201dMr. Fillon, the candidate of the R\u00e9publicains, and at one time the race\u2019s front-runner, was hardly spared by Mr. Poutou. He has dropped steadily in the polls since being put under investigation, and now criminally charged, over accusations that he used public money to pay his wife for a phony job as a parliamentary assistant.Revelations that a political fixer recently bought him two fine suits for over $13,000 at one of Paris\u2019s fanciest tailors have not helped. Mr. Fillon\u2019s image of probity has been shattered, and his platform of austerity for France is the object of ridicule.\u201cFillon. Right. He\u2019s sitting across the room from me,\u201d Mr. Poutou began. His target shifted uneasily in his seat, a tight smile on his face. \u201cNothing but revelations,\u201d Mr. Poutou continued. \u201cThe more one digs, the more one smells corruption and cheating, and then, it\u2019s these fine folk who explain to us that we need rigor, austerity, and all the while dipping into the public purse.\u201dLe Monde heard Mr. Fillon mutter furiously, \u201cI\u2019m going to sock you with a damn lawsuit, you.\u201dAfterward, the television commentators in Paris sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t think Philippe Poutou deserves any honors,\u201d said Anna Cabana, an analyst on BFMTV. \u201cHe acted very disrespectfully.\u201dBut that was not the verdict on social media. And Mr. Fillon is now in danger of losing even his third-place perch in the first round of voting April 23 to another insurgent far-left candidate, the veteran Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, whose relatively unbridled style and populist fervor have caught on.Mr. Poutou was enjoying his new celebrity Thursday.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit surprising. We\u2019re not used to it,\u201d Mr. Poutou, a mechanic in the maintenance and repair department of a Ford factory, said in a brief phone interview, dashing between appointments. \u201cIn the streets, it\u2019s very striking. People are saying bravo, thanks so much. We realize it\u2019s touched a lot of people. It\u2019s what people are thinking, but these things are almost never said to politicians\u2019 faces.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea Election Turns Into 2-Way Race as Dark Horse Surges", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Just last month, Ahn Cheol-soo, a software mogul turned politician, looked like another also-ran for the South Korean presidential election in May. His centrist People\u2019s Party held only 40 seats in the 300-member Parliament. He was barely polling at 10 percent in surveys.The election could not be taking place at a more fraught moment. The victor will be replacing an impeached president and entering office at a time when tensions between the Koreas are as high as they have been in a long time.The outcome is likely to have far-reaching implications for international efforts to deal with North Korea, analysts say.President Trump has been pressing China to exert its influence on the North to forestall more nuclear tests and missile launches. He has threatened to act unilaterally if the Chinese do not prevail. The North, in turn, threatened on Friday to attack American military bases in South Korea as well as the Blue House, where South Korea\u2019s president resides.The Chinese leadership has been calling on both the North and the United States to exercise restraint.Mr. Ahn, a boyish former medical doctor and relative neophyte in politics, calls himself a champion of \u201cnew politics\u201d who would heal a country disillusioned with what he describes as a corrupt and out-of-touch elite.Polling experts say that Mr. Ahn owed his recent popularity to people who shunned conservative candidates after Ms. Park\u2019s corruption scandal but did not trust Mr. Moon either, especially in dealing with North Korea\u2019s advancing military abilities.Mr. Ahn has wooed those people by attacking Ms. Park\u2019s government while promising to honor its decision to allow the United States to deploy an advanced missile defense system in the country against the North, a decision that has infuriated China.\u201cWe should never recognize North Korea as a nuclear power,\u201d Mr. Ahn said recently, emphasizing that he would prioritize national security if elected. \u201cIf the North is about to launch a nuclear attack, we should first strike the source of attack.\u201dWith the two main conservative candidates polling in the single digits, people who would normally vote conservative have been seeking alternatives.Then, they rallied behind Ahn Hee-jung, a left-centrist provincial governor. But Mr. Ahn was eliminated this month when he lost the Democratic Party primary to Mr. Moon.Ahn Cheol-soo\u2019s support has since skyrocketed.\u201cFor many centrist and conservative voters, there is no one else to turn to except Ahn Cheol-soo,\u201d said Kim Jiyoon, a polling expert at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. \u201cWhether he can win the election will depend largely on how many of the anti-Moon voters he can persuade to come out and vote for him.\u201dMr. Moon and Mr. Ahn share remarkably similar views on many issues.And they both emphasize the importance of the alliance with the United States. But they argue that sanctions and pressure alone have failed to stop North Korea\u2019s weapons program and that it is time to try dialogue. During a televised debate on Thursday, both opposed action by the United States that might prompt war on the peninsula, like a pre-emptive military strike against the North.The candidates even grew up in the same town: Busan, a port city in the southeast.But they have vastly different backgrounds and public images. Mr. Ahn is a paragon of elite success. A son of a medical doctor, Mr. Ahn quit practicing medicine in 1995 and built a fortune developing the country\u2019s most successful antivirus software. He later became a graduate school dean at Seoul National University, his alma mater.During the debate, he said he would use his school connections and business background to build a rapport with Mr. Trump. Both Mr. Ahn and Mr. Trump attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\u201cLike Spider-Man, once you have the power, even if you don\u2019t like it, you have to accept the responsibility that comes with it and act accordingly,\u201d Mr. Ahn, a science fiction fan, once said in a magazine interview.The policy brought an unprecedented d\u00e9tente on the divided peninsula. But conservatives argue that it helped finance the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program. They also view Mr. Moon as a replica of Mr. Roh, who once said he would never \u201ckowtow to the Americans.\u201dIn a book published in January, Mr. Moon said South Korea should learn to \u201csay no to the Americans.\u201d\u201cGiven the tough-sounding foreign policy team of the Trump administration, some South Koreans fear that friction with Washington would be more likely under Moon than under Ahn,\u201d said Ko Sung-kook, a political commentator.But Mr. Ahn later changed his stance, saying that it was \u201cirresponsible\u201d for a future president to reverse a deal struck between the two governments. That shift helped him attract conservative voters, analysts said.Because of his business background, Mr. Ahn comes across as more palatable for conservative voters than Mr. Moon, said Bae Jong-chan, research director at Research and Research, an opinion survey company.But many consider Mr. Ahn a na\u00efve populist. He also faces doubts about whether his small opposition party can push policies through a contentious Parliament, Mr. Bae said.\u201cWhat can you do with only 40 parliamentary seats?\u201d Mr. Moon recently said of Mr. Ahn.With Mr. Ahn catching up fast, Mr. Moon has redoubled his efforts to bolster his national security credentials. He said that if the North conducted another nuclear test, dialogue with North Korea would be difficult and the Thaad deployment \u201cinevitable.\u201d\u201cI will create a government most feared by North Korea, most trusted by the United States and most reliable for China,\u201d Mr. Moon said in a nationally televised campaign speech on Thursday.\u201cIf you can\u2019t change yourself, how can you change the nation?\u201d he told the daily JoongAng Ilbo this week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Politicize the Federal Reserve", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorI was in the room when President Bill Clinton decided to reappoint Alan Greenspan, a lifelong Republican originally appointed by Ronald Reagan, as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. A political adviser urged Mr. Clinton to choose an administration ally, but that was never seriously considered. The president\u2019s choice was not determined by party, or politics or ideology.That\u2019s how it has been for decades: Federal Reserve chairmen and governors have been selected based on their ability to serve the country. President Barack Obama reappointed George W. Bush\u2019s nominee, Ben Bernanke, as chairman. President Reagan reappointed Jimmy Carter\u2019s nominee, Paul Volcker.The Federal Reserve System was created by statute in 1913, but the independence of its monetary policy from congressional or presidential influence is not codified by law \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t always inviolable. In recent years, so-called reforms have been proposed to subject Fed monetary policy to congressional review, but its independence has so far been preserved.For good reason: An independent Federal Reserve led by governors who are committed to pursuing its dual mandate of price stability and full employment, as well as effective regulation \u2014 and who make decisions based on facts and analysis \u2014 is critically important to our economy, the well-being of the people and the market credibility of Fed policy making.But that independence is about to be severely tested. Daniel K. Tarullo stepped down from the Federal Reserve Board last week, adding to the board\u2019s two existing vacancies. Instead of remaining as governors, Chairwoman Janet Yellen and Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman, could step down when their terms expire next year. President Trump has already said that he will not reappoint Ms. Yellen as chairwoman because she\u2019s not a Republican.Mr. Trump could therefore fill as many as five of the board\u2019s seven seats within the next year. I fear that he may appoint governors who lack a commitment to the Fed\u2019s dual mandate and will instead seek to please the White House.There could also be an effort to scapegoat the Fed if (or rather, when) the administration\u2019s unrealistic economic growth estimates fail to materialize. The recent rejection of Congressional Budget Office health care estimates is a troubling sign. The administration could use rigged economic projections to attack the Fed over its decisions, rather than respecting its integrity and independence.The Fed is not always right \u2014 no one can be on these matters. But it is staffed by, and the board consists of, immensely capable professionals who work with absolute intellectual integrity. That\u2019s why the Fed\u2019s work is highly and widely respected in the United States and around the world. This credibility keeps market interest rates lower and liquidity greater. That, too, could change.Efforts to denigrate the integrity of the Fed\u2019s work, and to inject groundless opinion, politics and ideology, must be rejected by the board \u2014 and that means governors and other members of the Federal Open Market Committee must be willing to withstand aggressive attacks.In the short run, these attacks could occur if the Fed raises rates when the administration would prefer to avoid impediments to its wishful thinking on growth or to the continued run-up of the stock market. The Fed is expected to raise rates two or three times during the coming year, based on its widely shared view that unemployment is as low as it can be without triggering inflation. There is undoubtedly still some room to bring those who have dropped out of the labor market back in, but mainstream labor economists say not much, especially given the skills gap.The path to greater growth over time is productivity-enhancing policy. While a small fiscal stimulus might increase real growth and wages, a highly expansive fiscal policy is very unlikely to meaningfully increase real growth, and the rest of the effect is likely to be inflationary, absent countervailing Federal Reserve action. Waiting until inflation gains momentum could force the Fed to take more dramatic action that could induce recession. With the administration\u2019s unwillingness to appreciate these realities, Fed rate hikes could provoke political backlash.During my years as secretary of the Treasury, I had a weekly breakfast with Mr. Greenspan and Larry Summers, the deputy secretary. We discussed everything under the sun, from the outlook for the United States economy to the latest political gossip. But never once did Mr. Summers or I, even in the privacy of those meetings, raise monetary policy, nor did anyone in the Clinton administration comment on monetary policy.As a result, the Fed chairman knew that the White House would not try to advance an agenda on that policy. And this trust enabled the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to engage fully with each other on other matters, such as the Mexican and Asian financial crises. Sooner or later, there will be other financial crises \u2014 in the United States and abroad \u2014 and maintaining a framework of trust for the Treasury and the Fed to work together is critical.The administration\u2019s relationship to the Fed, and its appointment of governors, must be based not on politics but on the same question every president ought to ask: Who and what will best serve our country?Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury secretary from 1995 to 1999, is a co-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Favorite S.U.V.s, From Most Affordable to Luxurious", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byDrivenWhile Americans have not taken up camping or off-roading at a prodigious rate, S.U.V.s have become the vehicles of choice in the United States. The appeal is in the rugged look, a high seating position and a knack for swallowing cargo.Of course, driving over 100 vehicles annually, it\u2019s my duty, as the video auto reviewer for The Times, to inform you that nothing beats a minivan for practicality and utility. There. My responsibility is fulfilled.I\u2019m often asked which S.U.V. is my favorite, but picking just one is impossible. So let\u2019s do five in various sizes and prices, along with a runner-up in each category.I\u2019ve provided the base price for each vehicle. The Environmental Protection Agency fuel economy averages are listed for the range of powertrain choices.I\u2019m also not including the excellent truck-based S.U.V.s from General Motors (the Chevy Suburban, Tahoe and GMC Yukon) because most families don\u2019t need their extreme capabilities, but if you are someone who does, put them on your own list.The boxy Soul owns the small affordable crossover segment. A cavernous interior with impressive headroom is perfect for tall people looking for a compact ride. Even hamsters can appreciate the quality cabin materials and elegant touch-screen interface.I advise skipping the base version for the more potent 4-cylinder engines found in upper models. The top-shelf Exclaim model has a turbocharged engine and the best fuel economy. The well-rounded Soul has comfortable driving dynamics and seats five average-size adults fairly comfortably. It is also available as an electric vehicle.Kia\u2019s big miss here? The Soul doesn\u2019t have all-wheel drive. If that\u2019s a must, the Subaru Forester is nimble and nearly as cubic. Average E.P.A. mileage: 27 to 28 miles per gallon.When it comes to five-passenger family crossovers, the CR-V is the one to beat. The new fifth-generation model looks familiar, while gaining a newfound sense of style with rich-looking taillights. The vibe in the cockpit appears a full grade more expensive now.Once again, skip the base model. An additional $2,600 buys a more efficient and powerful turbocharged 4-cylinder. It also adds the Honda Sensing safety technology suite with adaptive cruise control and automatic braking with pedestrian detection. The CR-V drives nicely, is fairly quiet and has the back seat room and cargo space small families crave. It lacks a panoramic glass roof and heated rear seats found on others in its class. Unless you live in Canada. Seriously.I\u2019ve seen the next-generation Chevrolet Equinox, but have not driven it. Its sleek styling, upmarket interior and a blizzard of amenities earn it my nod for runner-up. Average mileage: 27 to 30 m.p.g.In the premium segment, the Macan is a force to be reckoned with. To think people once thought Porsche S.U.V.s were a bad thing. It\u2019s handsome inside and out, but more important, the Macan is a passionate dance partner on a twisty road. Ditching a Cayman for practicality reasons? Don\u2019t fret. The Macan\u2019s sporty rear-drive characteristics can make drivers forget it\u2019s a crossover.The base turbocharged 4-cylinder does the 0-60 sprint in 6.3 seconds. I drove the faster turbo V6 version, and there are always the GTS or Turbo models for even more velocity. Porsche proves practical transportation can be a thrill to drive.It can also be pricey. Optioning a Macan to the $70,000 level is breathtakingly easy. And the Mercedes-Benz GLC300 has a roomier back seat and a lovely interior. Average mileage: 19 to 22 m.p.g.Buyers gravitate to three-row crossovers to avoid the stigma of minivans. For style mavens, it\u2019s tough to beat the CX-9. The lithe sheet metal puts some premium brands to shame. Go with the top-shelf Signature model at about $45,000, and chunks of rosewood and real aluminum grace the cabin.The future of powertrains \u2014 a turbocharged 4-cylinder \u2014 motivates the Mazda. No worries; power off the line is fine. A bonus? The family friendly CX-9 is the driver\u2019s choice for slicing through corners. Careful not to make the children carsick.The CX-9 lacks a panoramic roof, and its tidier size keeps the third row on the tighter side. For a little more elbow room, check out Toyota\u2019s Highlander, which also comes as a hybrid. Average mileage: 23 to 24 m.p.g.For luxury in the three-row segment, Audi\u2019s Q7 gets my nod (though it nearly came down to the excellent Volvo XC90). True, the Q7 is understated to the point of anonymity, but few interiors offer better craftsmanship.Power is provided by either a turbocharged 4-cylinder or a supercharged V6. The big Audi feels light on its feet. There are bank vaults that are not this solid. It\u2019s stuffed with safety technology, including Traffic Jam Assist, a semiautonomous driving feature that keeps the Q7 within its lane and in pace with the cars ahead while the driver reaches back to retrieve dropped Sippy cups and iPads.Shoppers will find it effortless to run the price up near $70,000. But hey, there are Porsche Macans that cost more. That sort of makes the Audi a bargain. Average mileage: 21 to 22 m.p.g.So those are my top five. My best advice for selecting a vehicle? Test-drive at least three models and brands before buying to make sure it is the best vehicle for your needs. Notice how one manufacturer does not dominate my choices? They should not dominate yours either.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For First Time Since 1800s, Britain Goes a Day Without Burning Coal for Electricity", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Friday was the first full day since the height of the Industrial Revolution that Britain did not burn coal to generate electricity, a development that officials and climate change activists celebrated as a watershed moment.The accomplishment became official just before 11 p.m., when the 24-hour period ended.Coal powered Britain into the industrial age and into the 21st century, contributing greatly to the \u201cpea souper\u201d fogs that were thought for decades to be a natural phenomenon of the British climate.Now on a path to phase out coal-fired power generation altogether by 2025, Britain, also the home of the first steam engine, is currently closing coal plants and stepping up generation from cleaner natural gas and renewables, like wind and solar.\u201cSymbolically, this is a milestone,\u201d said Sean Kemp, a spokesman for National Grid, Britain\u2019s power grid operator. \u201cA kind of end of an era.\u201dThe first public coal-fired generator opened at Holborn Viaduct in London in 1882. Since then, the British economy, one of Europe\u2019s largest, was thought to never have gone without power from coal for a whole working day.There have been shorter coal-free periods before. Last May, for instance, coal generation dropped to zero for the first time, but only for a few hours at a time. On a weekend later that month, National Grid achieved a coal-free stretch of 19 hours, the longest at the time, Mr. Kemp said.Demand for electricity tends to be lower in the spring, when homes and offices turn off their heating and normally do not yet have a need for air-conditioning. It tends to be particularly low on a Friday and during the Easter holiday period.But the trend away from coal as a source of electricity is structural, officials say, with coal-free days likely to become more common. Since 2012, two-thirds of Britain\u2019s coal-fired power generating capacity has been shuttered. Some plants have been converted partially to burn biomass, such as wood pellets. Last year, the share of coal in total power generation dropped to 9 percent, down from 23 percent in 2015 and 40 percent in 2012.Some countries have already left coal behind in power generation. In Switzerland, Belgium and Norway, \u201cevery day is a coal-free day,\u201d Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Alvarez, a coal analyst at the International Energy Agency in Paris, pointed out.In the United States, where coal still accounts for about 30 percent of power generation, Vermont and Idaho are the only coal-free states, and California is close behind, he said.Coal is still used in heavy industry like steel and cement production. But given how important coal was in Britain\u2019s history, Mr. Alvarez described the news on Friday as more evidence of a trend toward \u201clow-carbon electricity.\u201dMeanwhile, in the London Museum of Water & Steam, which has a heritage collection of coal-fired steam engines and railway engines, the operations manager, Edward Fagan, was planning for a future exhibition.\u201cCoal-fired power generation is very fast becoming a heritage item,\u201d Mr. Fagan said. \u201cOne day we\u2019ll have to add a power station to our collection.\u201dJohn Schwartz contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Guys Really Like Trump", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisPITTSBURGH \u2014 Al Paslow and Joe Peterson, friends since high school, together surfed the real estate and energy bubbles that buoyed the American economy \u2014 and together endured losing their lucrative jobs when each bubble burst.Mr. Paslow, 61, is a soft-spoken college graduate, Mr. Peterson, 62, a visceral debater who chose work straight out of high school. They both root for the Steelers and squabble about climate change. And 100 days into his presidency, they still share an unshakable faith in Donald Trump: This is the man who can restore the America they miss and cherish, the outsider too rich to bribe and too strong to intimidate.\u201cWhen Joe first told me about Trump, I said no, that guy\u2019s a bragger,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cThen I started listening to him, and I noticed, he\u2019s a billionaire. If somebody comes along and says, \u2018President Trump, I want to keep my plant in China and I want to close my plant here, here\u2019s $50 million,\u2019 he says, \u2018I don\u2019t need your money, mister.\u2019 \u201dI first met them at a Trump rally in October in the Western Pennsylvania town of Ambridge, once the vibrant headquarters of the American Bridge Company, where Mr. Paslow\u2019s mother wound cables during World War II. Mr. Peterson proudly wore his Trump-Pence T-shirt; Mr. Paslow a more modest Trump sticker. They had both been out of work for more than a year, laid off from their jobs in oil and gas exploration with two weeks\u2019 notice, no severance, no pension and no unemployment insurance \u2014 like many American workers, they were independent contractors, without the protections of full employment. And like many American men, they were now depending on their wives\u2019 jobs to get by.Mr. Trump came striding into this bleak landscape and offered them hope. He pledged to the crowd that he would bring back the oil and gas industry the very first day he was in office. \u201cUnbelievably, that is exactly what we wanted to hear!\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cOur hearts were uplifted.\u201dWhat struck me that day and in conversations over the next several months was how much it meant to them to be heard and seen, and how durable their trust was, once conferred. Here was a celebrity self-proclaimed billionaire who was paying attention to their fate, their town, their battered industry. They are quick to suspect conspiracy and corruption, in their state and in Washington. They thought even Mr. Trump might have his price \u2014 but luckily, it would be too high for most to afford.This amalgam of faith and cynicism still binds them to their president. They may not like his tweets \u2014 \u201cbad,\u201d Mr. Peterson said in his only criticism \u2014 but they consistently give him the benefit of the doubt.They dismiss protesters as sore losers, and pundits who attack policy swings as establishment voices bent on sabotage. Where critics point to promises unfulfilled, they see obstacles that are not their president\u2019s fault.\u201cI think he\u2019s doing a great job \u2014 he needs more help from everybody,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. And if Congress, judges and other naysayers get out of the way, Mr. Paslow said, \u201cthen he might go down as one of the best presidents we\u2019ve ever had.\u201dWhen fact checkers pounce, the two men see an insistence on petty detail when they know what their president really meant.Mr. Peterson, whose parents voted the straight Democratic ticket, denounced Hillary Clinton as a liar and President Barack Obama as a weakling. Mr. Paslow voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, spellbound by speeches that he said could make you happy and make you cry. In 2016, Mr. Peterson had persuaded his reluctant friend to hear out Mr. Trump, and Mr. Paslow was sold.At a dinner with their extended families in December, the two friends were elated at a victory that took them and their country by surprise. Mr. Paslow\u2019s wife, Adele, was outraged by Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women, and sparred with Mr. Peterson and her own mother, a fervent Trump supporter. By April, though, she was liking most of what she saw, and believes the nation\u2019s president deserved the allegiance of even those who did not vote for him.After the election, Mr. Paslow got a new job researching land titles for oil and gas exploration. He gives Mr. Trump credit for buoying the industry by promising to roll back environmental regulations that stifled growth. Even though Mr. Paslow welcomed the cleanup of a Pittsburgh once so polluted that streetlights went on by noon, he and his friend criticized Obama-era rules they saw as helping scuttle the shale gas boom and putting them out of work.\u201cThere were thousands of rules; you had to wait six, eight months just for paperwork,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cIt cost millions of dollars.\u201d\u201cYou couldn\u2019t drill because the owls were mating,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. Or the bats, Mr. Peterson added.The only work Mr. Peterson has found in 18 months is in West Virginia, and he does not want to move. He was a \u201clandman,\u201d going door to door asking whether landowners were willing to lease plots for drilling and then dispensing checks. But even in Pennsylvania, he says, he received a death threat from a farmer angry that his wife had been approached. He fears West Virginia would be even more hostile.The two friends reminisced about their childhood home on drives through Pittsburgh over the past few months. Though the city has reinvented itself as a center of health care, education and technology, they pointed out the houses that are still boarded up, the old economy and the new bumping up against each other in uneasy coexistence.\u201cThe things that made this country great are disappearing \u2014 factories, jobs, education,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cSomeone could get a job at the mill and live happily ever after. Now it\u2019s Walmart and Best Buy. Come on \u2014 a job at Walmart when you could have had a nice life working at a factory?\u201dYet they both set their sights at non-factory jobs when they first started out. \u201cMy dad didn\u2019t want me working there because it was bad,\u201d Mr. Peterson said of the mills. Instead, he started out trimming grass at a cemetery and then worked for 20 years in an electric motor repair shop until it folded. Meanwhile, Mr. Paslow set up a company based on researching land titles for the state for eminent domain and highway projects.As the real estate market heated up in the \u201990s, the two friends teamed up to build databases of available loans to refinance at lower rates, which they sold to mortgage brokers. Mr. Peterson remembered making $14,000 for little more than 15 hours\u2019 work.Then real estate foundered, and they had to start over. Mr. Peterson worked at Domino\u2019s and Papa John\u2019s, and set up a small business selling baseball cards.A newly booming oil and gas industry came to the rescue. At one point, Mr. Paslow said, he had 60 people working for him researching titles to make sure owners had no competing claims on land that could trip up companies who wanted to drill. \u201cPeople were hiring their brothers, sisters, ex-wives,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Maoists for Trump? In China, Fans Admire His Nationalist Views", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 They protest, picket and sing to defend Mao\u2019s memory, yearning for the East to be red again. But lately some of China\u2019s Maoists are finding inspiration in an unlikely insurgent in the West: Donald J. Trump.President Xi Jinping of China will be sizing up Mr. Trump during a visit to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida this week, in the leaders\u2019 first summit meeting. Meanwhile, many ordinary Chinese people have also been taking the measure of the new American president and have been bewildered, incensed and yet, sometimes, inspired.The global wave of nationalist, anti-establishment sentiment that Mr. Trump rode to power has washed ashore in China, encouraging a hard-left fringe that is hostile to capitalism and Western influence, and that the Communist Party has long sought to cultivate \u2014 and contain.China\u2019s Maoists are a small minority; most Chinese have no desire to revive the ruthless, convulsive politics of the Mao era. But the Maoists\u2019 growing assertiveness, echoed in their embrace of aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, could help push the country in a more authoritarian direction.It is a paradox that these admirers of Mao Zedong, a Marxist revolutionary who railed against Western imperialism, have found things to like about this American president, a property tycoon with a cabinet crowded with millionaires. But they want Mr. Xi to take a page from Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d script and protect Chinese workers from layoffs, privatization and foreign competition.China\u2019s neo-Maoists, as they are sometimes called, are loosely united by demands for stringent economic equality, zealous nationalism and a loathing of the capitalist West and liberal democracy.\u201cMany of the same ideas now animating the global populist movement have been the hallmarks of the neo-Maoist movement for over a decade,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, a researcher in Beijing who is writing a book about the movement.\u201cThe neo-Maoists have also clearly benefited from the rise of Xi Jinping, as he has blasted a pretty large dog whistle in their direction,\u201d Mr. Blanchette added.But some Maoists say Mr. Trump also offers a model. They think he led a populist revolt that humbled a corrupt political establishment not unlike what they see in China. They cheer his incendiary tactics, sometimes likening them to Mao\u2019s methods. And they hear in his remarks an echo of their own disgust with Western democracy, American interventionism and liberal political values.Maoist meetings and websites dwell on a clutch of enemies, including the C.I.A. and America in general, genetically modified crops and advocates of privatizing state companies. But they reserve a particular venom for liberal Chinese intellectuals and celebrities who have condemned Mao.In the West, Mr. Zhang argued, the nationalists are on the right while the left generally supports internationalism. \u201cBut China is the opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cChinese rightists are the traitors, while Chinese leftists are the patriots.\u201dThe Communist Party never repudiated Mao\u2019s legacy after his death in 1976, but it condemned his excesses, including the violent Cultural Revolution, and for years he was ignored or discredited while Deng Xiaoping pursued economic liberalization.Mr. Bo was purged in a scandal, but the Maoists regrouped as Mr. Xi associated himself more closely with Mao\u2019s legacy than his predecessors and called for a return to Marxist purity.Nobody expects Maoists to seize power in Beijing. They are disdained by the middle class and kept on a tether by the party authorities. Across China, there are maybe a few thousand active supporters of Maoist groups and causes, and their petitions against liberal intellectuals have gathered tens of thousands of signatures online, according to Mr. Blanchette, the researcher.But the Chinese left\u2019s broader message of muscular nationalism and its criticism of widening inequality have reverberated, especially among retirees, hard-up workers and former party officials dismayed by extravagant wealth and corruption. Mr. Trump and the global surge of nationalism and populism have added to the political tinder.Dai Jianzhong, a sociologist in Beijing, said Maoists could gain a bigger following if an economic slowdown caused mass layoffs, or if tensions with the United States escalated into confrontation.\u201cIt was a big shock for China to see American middle-class society overwhelmed by this tide of populism,\u201d Mr. Dai said. \u201cChina is a different society, but if the economy stagnates and workers feel badly let down, populism will gain influence. The influence of Maoists and ultraleftists would spread.\u201dIn January, about a hundred protesters gathered in Jinan, a provincial capital in eastern China, to condemn a professor of communications and advertising, Deng Xiangchao, who had dared criticize Mao online. They chanted and held banners near Mr. Deng\u2019s home, reviling him as a \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d and roughed up a few people who came to show their support for him.\u201cWe love Chairman Mao because we\u2019re poor, and the poor all love Chairman Mao,\u201d Yang Jianguo, a retired worker who was among the protesters, said by telephone after the protest.The university swiftly dismissed Mr. Deng rather than engage in a prolonged battle with the Maoists. Later, left-wing activists also successfully demanded the dismissal of a television station worker who had voiced support for Mr. Deng.It would be unthinkable for the party to be so obliging of protesters for free speech or other causes the party considers anathema. But while Mr. Xi has silenced the party\u2019s liberal critics, the party has tolerated, even abetted, its hard-left opponents, giving the Maoist populists room to grow stronger.\u201cTheir influence has clearly grown with the leftist turn in ideology, especially since 2015,\u201d said Deng Yuwen, a current affairs writer in Beijing who has criticized the Maoists.\u201cIt\u2019s not that the top level of the party directly controls them, but the Maoists are politically astute, and they have a good sense of what they can get away with,\u201d he added. \u201cThey know the officials use them, but they also use the officials.\u201dWhile party leaders may find them useful for intimidating critics, the Maoists want to take China in a different direction and reverse market policies that have fueled decades of growth, by seizing the assets of the rich and strengthening state ownership of industry, for example.Most phrase their criticism of the party carefully, but some openly accuse it of betraying Mao. \u201cChina is a capitalist state under socialist guise,\u201d said Mr. Yang, the retired worker. \u201cCapitalists dominate the country.\u201dAsked about the American president, Mr. Yang was more generous: \u201cTrump has socialist tendencies, because the way he won power in a way reflected the workers\u2019 demands.\u201dHe Weifang, a law professor at Peking University who is often reviled by China\u2019s far left, said Mr. Xi was playing a dangerous game by allowing Maoist populists to silence liberal voices and risked igniting political fires that he cannot easily control.\u201cIf political currents in China increasingly converge with populism,\u201d Mr. He added, \u201cthat would have a powerful effect on China\u2019s future.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Book Pins Corporate Greed on a Lust Bred at Harvard", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byDealBookIf you were to look for one ingredient that binds together the nation\u2019s chief executives, top managers and boards of directors, you\u2019d find a remarkably consistent commonality, now and in generations past: A disproportionate number of them are graduates of Harvard Business School.An M.B.A. from H.B.S., as those in the know refer to it, has long been the ultimate Good Housekeeping stamp of approval on any r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook \u2014 and the list goes on and on. The number of Fortune 500 chief executives who earned their business degrees at Harvard is three times the total from the next most popular business school, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.It is hard to overstate the school\u2019s influence on corporate America.That\u2019s why a new, exhaustive history of the school is causing a stir before it is even out. The book, \u201cThe Golden Passport,\u201d by the veteran business journalist Duff McDonald, is a richly reported indictment of the school as a leading reason that corporate America is disdained by much of the country.\u201cThe Harvard Business School became (and remains) so intoxicated with its own importance that it blithely assumed away one of the most important questions it could ask, which was whether the capitalist system it was uniquely positioned to help improve was designed properly for the long term,\u201d Mr. McDonald writes in the book, to be released in two weeks.His answer? \u201cWith economic inequality at a hundred-year high and meaningful progress on climate change and other social and environmental issues embarrassingly paltry, the answer to that question is obvious. It is not.\u201dCiting a report from the Aspen Institute, Mr. McDonald explains that \u201cwhen students enter business school, they believe that the purpose of a corporation is to produce goods and services for the benefit of society.\u201d\u201cWhen they graduate,\u201d he continues, \u201cthey believe that it is to maximize shareholder value.\u201dMr. McDonald brilliantly tells the story of the school\u2019s creation in 1908, when its mission was to educate the next generation of business managers. Edwin Gay, its first dean, defined business as the \u201cactivity of making things to sell at a profit \u2014 decently.\u201dBut, the author says, somewhere during the mid-1980s, something went very wrong: \u201cThe money got too good.\u201dThe money he refers to is the tsunami of job offers that Harvard students received from Wall Street, and the funding the school raked in from its well-heeled alumni.In fairness, Harvard Business School makes an easy punching bag, given its stature as the top feeder for big business. This is hardly the first time the institution has been criticized.And it is too much to paint all 76,000-plus alumni as being ethically challenged, as Mr. McDonald appears to imply. Indeed, many of the school\u2019s vaunted alumni are among the most talented executives in the country, and many are trying to think about stakeholders holistically.Yet in example after example, Mr. McDonald sets out his thesis that money and influence have distorted both the school\u2019s curriculum and the worldview espoused by its professors, who themselves are on the payroll of corporate America as part-time advisers and consultants.Mr. McDonald describes Mr. Jensen\u2019s arrival as \u201cthe moment of peak paradox for H.B.S.,\u201d contending that Mr. Jensen\u2019s \u201cideologically driven hijacking of the study of finance served as a cynical repudiation of everything that had come before him at the school.\u201dWith the elevation of Mr. Jensen, Mr. McDonald writes, \u201cH.B.S. had nurtured the professional manager from his birth and then helped to kill him.\u201dThe book is filled with anecdotal evidence of Mr. McDonald\u2019s argument. In once instance, he draws from a paper Mr. Jensen co-wrote in which the professor recounted a well-known story about the playwright George Bernard Shaw. As the story goes, Shaw had asked \u201can actress if she would sleep with him for a million dollars,\u201d Mr. McDonald writes. \u201cWhen she agreed, he changed his offer to $10, to which she responded with outrage, asking him what kind of woman he thought she was. His reply: \u2018We\u2019ve already established that. Now we\u2019re just haggling about the price.\u2019\u201dTo Mr. McDonald, Harvard teaches its students that \u201cwe\u2019re all whores.\u201dContinuing his train of logic, he writes: \u201cIf everybody assumes you\u2019re a whore, you might as well grab as much money as possible while you\u2019re still in demand.\u201dMr. McDonald\u2019s book also makes a provocative argument that Harvard Business School, and, by extension, the American business school complex, is responsible for out-of-whack compensation schemes for top management.\u201cWe benefit financially from it as well,\u201d the quotation continues. \u201cClearly, the fees we can charge M.B.A. students are correlated with the salaries they can get when they go get jobs.\u201dIn the end, Mr. McDonald acknowledges that \u201cone shouldn\u2019t expect Harvard Business School to be teaching courses on how to overthrow the capitalist economy.\u201dBut Mr. McDonald does raise enough salient questions that maybe the school should be asking: Should we create a case study about ourselves?A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the city in Massachusetts where Baker Library at the Harvard Business School is located.

{"Headline": "Why Britain\u2019s Trains Don\u2019t Run on Time: Capitalism", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 If how the railways run is a guide to the state of a nation, then it tells you something that Britain is in the middle of its biggest railway strike since 1994. Not coincidentally, that was the year the national rail network was privatized by the Conservative government of Prime Minister John Major.A labor dispute has been simmering for nearly a year on the routes managed by Southern, a train operator that, as the name suggests, runs crucial commuter services between London and the South Coast. In December, the crisis escalated when around 1,000 train drivers joined in a strike action against Southern\u2019s parent company, Govia Thameslink Railway, whose network also includes the Gatwick Express airport line.The details, of course, are local, and may even seem parochial. The dispute centers on Govia\u2019s plan to remove guards from trains. The unions believe this would threaten not just jobs but also the safety of passengers. The industrial upheaval on a rail artery critical to one of the world\u2019s largest economies tells a story that transcends borders, however: of the perils of introducing market ideology into key public services, a project driven not by the needs of passengers but by uncompromising dogma.How did we get here? Not on a Southern train, obviously: The company has become a byword for overcrowding, delays and understaffing.But more Britons than ever are using the rail network, crow the champions of privatization. That isn\u2019t because of the success of the sell-off, though, but is because of changes in the economy: More and more people are finding that they have to commute greater distances for work, for example. Where the networks themselves have improved, it\u2019s the state \u2014 not any private company \u2014 that has underwritten or financed modernization. Where the train operators have been left to their own devices, choosing whether or not to invest in new rolling stock, the result is clear: On some rush-hour train services into London, a third of passengers are forced to stand.The privatizers claimed that competition would lift standards of service, put the needs of the consumer first, reduce the burden on the taxpayer, rid the system of inefficiencies and drive down prices. On all scores, the privatization of Britain\u2019s railways is an embarrassment. Look no further than the current dispute on Southern to see how dysfunctional the privatized system is.Govia is contracted to run the Southern franchise \u2014 and is paid about \u00a31 billion (or $1.24 billion), a year by the government to do so. In return, revenue from ticket sales goes directly back to the government. Yet if train services are delayed or canceled, it is the government \u2014 or rather, the taxpayer \u2014 that refunds the bitter commuters. The company itself therefore has no incentive to settle with the unions; arguably, it is being paid by the Tory government to keep up the fight. Yet the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, pretends to have no hand in the matter, saying he cannot \u201cwave a wand\u201d to resolve the dispute.Not that public ownership has been banished from Britain\u2019s railways \u2014 but only other European governments are free to buy up Britain\u2019s rail networks. Foreign governments running British railway networks include France, Germany and the Netherlands. The important difference, of course, is that foreign state-owned companies are not accountable to British passengers (as a nationalized company is to British voters).Beyond the \u201ctravel chaos\u201d headlines and lost millions of economic activity, the failure of Britain\u2019s rail privatization opens broader questions that resonate beyond this country. Does it really make sense for the essential services we all depend upon to be for profit? The evidence from this two-decade experiment is a direct challenge to those who believe in the innate superiority of the private sector.What a way to run a railroad.Owen Jones is a columnist for The Guardian and the author of \u201cThe Establishment: And How They Get Away With It.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They\u2019re graphic designers and domestic workers, accountants and writers, adjunct professors and day laborers.We should be looking at common issues and exploring ways to help turn all these independent-worker gigs into sustainable middle-class careers \u2014 like creating a new social safety net to provide the same level of benefits and protections many full-time employees enjoy. In that way we can make good on the promises of the gig economy.SARA HOROWITZ, NEW YORKThe writer is the founder and executive director of the Freelancers Union.To the Editor:Workers join the on-demand economy because of the benefits it offers, not because of desperation or manipulation.In an economy with only 4.5 percent unemployment and 5.7 million job openings, the fact that millions of Americans continue signing up for work in the sharing economy is a testament to the value provided by these platforms beyond what is available in the traditional economy.The writer is chief economist of the Internet Association.To the Editor:Your editorial describes the perils workers face in the gig economy. These include low wages, long hours and a lack of benefits. What the editorial is missing, however, is a focus on sustainable policy solutions to the perils. Lawsuits and legislation deal with the symptoms \u2014 not the causes \u2014 of worker maltreatment.Moving forward, we will need to redefine what it means to be a worker. The new definition should include a set of shared principles, a social compact. This social compact should address worker priorities: health benefits, retirement schemes, education and training. It should also address company priorities: scheduling flexibility and controlling health care costs. Representatives of business, workers and government should work together to write the compact, which should act as the foundation for a legal framework for employment.We applaud The Times for putting a spotlight on the gig economy\u2019s impact on workers. But we need long-term solutions to this challenge. The future of our economy depends on getting this right.Advertisement"}

Raises 2017 Outlook for Global Economic Growth", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byThe rosy forecast is something of a change of mind for the fund, which has been fairly downbeat in recent years in terms of the global economy\u2019s capacity to deliver sustained growth.As the most ardent defender of traditional free-trade policies, the I.M.F. has, for the better part of a year now, been making the case that trade, free of protective barriers like tariffs and duties, is crucial to a healthy world economy.Ms. Lagarde did not mention President Trump or his promise to put America\u2019s interests first when it comes to signing trade deals with partners such as China and Mexico.\u201cOne salient threat is trade protectionism, leading to trade warfare,\u201d Maurice Obstfeld, the fund\u2019s chief economist, said on Tuesday at a news conference.Despite these worries, numerous indicators, including export growth in Asia and soaring demand for container ships, show that global trade is bouncing back.After growing 2.2 percent last year, global trade volume will expand 3.8 percent this year and 3.9 percent in 2018, the I.M.F. predicted.The growth rate of the United States economy was projected to increase to 2.3 percent in 2017 and 2.5 percent next year from 1.6 percent in 2016.Developing nations were predicted to expand at 4.5 percent clip this year and 4.8 percent in 2018, a marked improvement from 4.1 percent growth in 2016.\u201cThere has been a stream of continuing positive data that we have seen since the middle of 2016,\u201d Mr. Obstfeld said. \u201cThis pickup in manufacturing, industrial production and trade is fueling our confidence that this year and next year will be substantially better than 2016.\u201dIn its analysis, the fund cited a pickup in commodity prices as well as signs of increased investment spending as reasons behind the improved outlook in the emerging world.Economists say that the main impetus behind this surge in activity is an increase in private and public sector investment. Recent data showing Chinese imports increasing 20 percent highlight this boom in outlays.In its report, the I.M.F. predicts that the Chinese economy will grow a bit more slowly in 2017 \u2014 6.6 percent compared with 6.7 percent in 2016.Despite the recent growth spurt, many economists say they believe that a pace of close to 7 percent is not sustainable, and they say that recent signs of a credit slowdown are proof that the Chinese economy will lose steam in the coming quarters.The fund also took note of the risks of China relying too much on credit, especially on hard to pin down shadow financing, to fuel growth.\u201cGrowth has remained reliant on domestic credit growth so rapid that it may cause financial stability problems down the road,\u201d Mr. Obstfeld said. \u201cThese problems could, in turn, spill over to other countries.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Penney stores may still be open, but some of the jobs they once supported are starting to vanish.After hitting a low point during the recession in December 2009, the retail sector has reliably been churning out more jobs. Though the Labor Department\u2019s monthly employment summary provides only a snapshot of the labor market, this is the second month in a row that retail payrolls have registered substantial losses \u2014 a possible sign that larger structural changes are in the works.\u201cE-commerce and technology have absolutely changed the rules of the game and given massive amounts of power to the consumer,\u201d said Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at Nomura. \u201cThere is a self-help mentality now. People walk around with their phones in their hand to tell them the best model and the best price. You don\u2019t need as many people walking around trying to convince you to buy a sweater.\u201dThe vitality of the retail sector has been muscled out of the spotlight lately by a focus on better-paying manufacturing jobs, which President Trump sees as crucial to the revival of the middle class, particularly in the Midwest and the South. But retail outlets still employ millions of Americans and serve as an entry point into the labor force, especially for those with less education and fewer skills.Remember that while General Motors was once the single largest employer, today Walmart is.Yet even Walmart is having to contend with a sea change in the way people shop. The company, for instance, has been closing smaller stores in rural areas, according to Barbara Denham, a senior economist at Reis, a real estate data and analytics firm.Jack Kleinhenz, the chief economist at the National Retail Federation, does not discount the magnitude of the transformation that is occurring in retail, but cautioned that the monthly job figures are also highly subject to temporary vagaries. \u201cOne of the challenges we have at this time of the year is the quirkiness of seasonal forces,\u201d he said.An unexpectedly warm February and snowy March and the late arrival of Easter could have elbowed the numbers in an uncharacteristic way.The retail employment number, he said, does not necessarily \u201ctranslate into backsliding of retail sales.\u201dDiane Swonk, the chief executive of DS Economics in Chicago, agreed. The falloff in hiring \u201cis not a reflection of a consumer than can\u2019t spend, but rather of how they spend,\u201d she said. \u201cRetail is one of the largest employers in the country, and it\u2019s going to go through a pretty massive secular restructuring. We shop differently now, and no one has the right model.\u201dMost shopping is still done in person rather than online, but shopping patterns are shifting. Ms. Swonk mentioned research that shows consumers like to buy online but return things to bricks-and-mortar stores.\u201cClearly, it\u2019s just not one or the other, not just bricks or clicks,\u201d she said. But the marketplace is rapidly changing and retailers \u201care not sure what the endgame is.\u201dE-commerce may cause a drop in retail jobs, but a rise in warehouse, distribution and transportation jobs.At the same time, consumers have not only been changing how they shop, but what they buy. Ms. Denham noted that while the entire retail sector ended up down nearly 30,000 jobs, the restaurant industry showed a gain of 20,000 in March on top of steady previous growth.\u201cThere\u2019s been a shift in consumer spending from things to experiences,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s why restaurants are doing so well.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

Socially liberal but in favor of more control in the marketplace, he wants to loosen labor rules and make France more business-friendly, but he says he would preserve the social safety net.While he has the potential to draw votes from across the political spectrum, he is regarded warily by both left and right: on the left for his free-market ideas and his support for the European Union, and on the right for his embrace of immigration and of social outreach to all groups in society.Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, a Socialist, called on French voters on Sunday to back Mr. Macron in the runoff, \u201cto beat the National Front and to thwart its dire project of regression for France and division of the French.\u201dMr. Cazeneuve called Ms. Le Pen\u2019s agenda \u201cdangerous and sectarian\u201d and said it would \u201cimpoverish, isolate and divide\u201d the country.The Socialist candidate, Mr. Hamon, also threw his support behind Mr. Macron, a former Socialist.Mr. Hamon, trying to explain his disappointing fifth-place finish to fellow Socialists, said: \u201cI know you are waiting for a rebirth.

{"Headline": "The Senate Battle Over Gorsuch", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:As a 22-year-old progressive Democrat, I am furious at the Democrats\u2019 shortsighted decision to filibuster the Gorsuch nomination.The Democrats have two options: allow Neil Gorsuch to be confirmed and retain some leverage over the next Supreme Court pick, or allow Neil Gorsuch to be confirmed and retain no leverage over the next Supreme Court pick. Defying all logic, they have apparently chosen the second.If the Senate eliminates the filibuster this week, then for the next vacancy President Trump will have no incentive to nominate a mainstream judge like Neil Gorsuch, and every incentive to nominate a fringe conservative who appeals to Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.The Democrats did away with the filibuster for cabinet nominees, and their reward was Betsy DeVos. If the Senate invokes the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d Democrats will soon find themselves facing the Betsy DeVos of Supreme Court nominees with no ammunition left.JEREMY COHEN, NEW YORKTo the Editor:Judge Neil Gorsuch is Steve Bannon\u2019s dream pick for the Supreme Court because the judge\u2019s judicial philosophy meshes perfectly with Mr. Bannon\u2019s goal of destroying the administrative state. Judge Gorsuch would reject the \u201cChevron deference\u201d principle, which permits executive branch administrative agencies to interpret ambiguous legislation.Your article points out that even the conservative icon Justice Antonin Scalia understood the wisdom of Chevron deference, which allows administrative agencies to take prompt regulatory action.If Judge Gorsuch and Mr. Bannon accomplish their goal, they will turn the clock back 100 years, to a time when corporations could treat workers like pawns and the environment like a sewer. And an underregulated economy could spawn a depression that dwarfs the recession of 2008.We are in deep trouble when Justice Scalia starts sounding like the voice of reason.JERRY WALLINGFORD, SAN DIEGOTo the Editor:Let\u2019s be clear about two things. First, the Republicans certainly can\u2019t complain about the Democrats planning to filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuch, because they effectively filibustered Judge Merrick Garland in 2016 by refusing any consideration of his nomination. Second, over the last 25 years or so the Supreme Court itself and the nomination process have become highly partisan and politicized.The Senate may now counter the looming filibuster by reducing the vote threshold to a simple majority of 51. I believe that this is going in the wrong direction. A far better solution would be to require a two-thirds supermajority (67 votes) to confirm any Supreme Court nominee, as is required for Constitutional amendments.If we want to reduce the politics and partisanship in the court and the nomination process, we should not be making it easier to install extreme candidates; we should be making it harder. A supermajority would be an inducement for presidents to nominate middle-of-the-road candidates. This would serve the court and the country better as well.BILL BARRETT, TORREY, UTAHAdvertisement"}

Report Shows U.S. Economy Off to Slow Start in 2017", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byAmericans say they feel more optimistic about the economy since President Trump was elected. But they certainly are not acting that way, and that is shaping up to be a challenge for his administration.The caution among consumers was particularly notable on big purchases like automobiles. Other indicators were stronger \u2014 businesses invested at a healthy pace \u2014 but that was not enough to offset the headwinds from feeble retail sales and falling inventories.The softness last quarter also provides crucial ammunition for the Trump administration\u2019s arguments that big tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks are necessary for the economy to grow the way it did in the 1980s and 1990s.Tax cuts, regulatory relief, trade renegotiations and an unfettered energy sector are needed \u201cto overcome the dismal economy inherited by the Trump administration,\u201d said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. \u201cBusiness and consumer sentiment is strong, but both must be released from the regulatory and tax shackles constraining economic growth.\u201dThe first-quarter fade is also sure to be noticed by the Federal Reserve as it contemplates whether to proceed with two more interest-rate increases planned for this year.Federal Reserve policy makers are set to meet next week, and while there is little expectation that an interest-rate increase will be announced when the meeting ends on Wednesday, the latest economic reading could sway the Fed\u2019s outlook. The monthly report on job creation is due next Friday, and a strong showing could ease some of the concern over the lack of vigor in the first quarter.The job market has proved remarkably resilient even as quarterly growth has wobbled, and the unemployment rate sank to 4.5 percent in March, the lowest in nearly a decade.Reaffirming its recent findings, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index finished April with a decidedly bullish reading of 97, up from 87.2 just before the election.The White House provided a statement saying the report on gross domestic product might have been influenced by seasonal factors, but \u201cshows that we still have work to do to get the economic growth President Trump wants and expects.\u201dAnd in an interview with Fox News on Friday, Mr. Trump said that, with better trade deals, the United States should be able to lift the rate of economic growth to 5 percent or more in a few years.With personal consumption accounting for nearly 70 percent of all economic activity, however, the administration will be hard pressed to lift growth substantially if consumers remain cautious about opening their wallets.Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Obama, said he found the disconnect between findings of optimism and actual behavior puzzling, though he added, \u201cIt\u2019s possible it was a blip.\u201dOn the other hand, something more significant may be happening. The rising cost of necessities like health care, housing and education is crowding out discretionary spending for middle-class Americans, said Stephanie Pomboy, founder of MacroMavens, an independent economics consulting firm in New York.And the tax cuts the administration is proposing are unlikely to reverse that trend, she added.\u201cConsumers aren\u2019t spending out of desire but out of obligation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I believe that since the recession and the bursting of the housing bubble, the middle class wants to save. They don\u2019t want to get back into the position they were in after 2008.\u201dShe noted that although the Obama administration got temporary tax breaks through Congress as part of its stimulus package in 2009, tax credits and other incentives did not substantially increase consumer spending.Ms. Pomboy was among the earliest voices warning that a burst of first-quarter momentum was unlikely, and she is similarly cautious about the rest of 2017. \u201cThere are a lot of moving parts to this report for the first quarter, but none suggest we should look for an acceleration in growth going forward,\u201d she said.The initial weakness this year does follow a pattern of sluggish annual starts since the recovery began, when momentum has picked up in subsequent quarters.When growth is measured year over year, rather than quarter over quarter, the latest data reveal a 1.9 percent annual growth rate, which is almost identical to the broader trend of the postrecession period.Most economists on Wall Street are looking for a rebound over the rest of 2017, with growth rising to about 3 percent in the current quarter.\u201cWe see ebbs and flows in consumer spending, and it\u2019s still on an upward trend,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. Noting that consumption rose sharply in mid- to late 2016, Mr. Anderson suggested some payback was probably inevitable.While he is more sanguine about the economy\u2019s prospects than Ms. Pomboy is, Mr. Anderson shares her skepticism about the impact White House policy will have.\u201cThe reality, as we have seen in the first 100 days, is that it\u2019s a lot harder for the administration to achieve their policy goals and deal with Congress than they probably thought during the campaign,\u201d he said.\u201cEven if you are president of the United States, you have to deal with 535 individuals with different constituencies and agendas on Capitol Hill,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like running a commercial real estate company where everyone has to march to the same drummer.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been a believer in the \u2018Trump bump\u2019 for this year,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re in the same economy we\u2019ve been in all along.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erdogan Claims Vast Powers in Turkey After Narrow Victory in Referendum", "Date": "2017-04-16", "News": "Supported byISTANBUL \u2014 A slim majority of Turkish voters agreed on Sunday to grant sweeping powers to their president, in a watershed moment that the country\u2019s opposition fears may cement a system of authoritarian rule within one of the critical power brokers of the Middle East.With nearly 99 percent of votes in a referendum counted on Sunday night, supporters of the proposal had 51.3 percent of votes cast, and opponents had 48.7 percent, the country\u2019s electoral commission announced.The result will take days to confirm, and the main opposition party said it would demand a recount of about 37 percent of ballot boxes, containing around 2.5 million votes.But on Sunday night the result was already a political reality, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed his victory in front of a crowd of supporters in Istanbul. \u201cWe are enacting the most important governmental reform of our history,\u201d he said.The constitutional change will allow the winner of the 2019 presidential election to assume full control of the government, ending the current parliamentary political system.The ramifications, however, are immediate. The \u201cyes\u201d vote in the referendum is a validation of the current leadership style of Mr. Erdogan, who has been acting as a de facto head of government since his election in 2014 despite having no constitutional right to wield such power. The office of Turkey\u2019s president was meant to be an impartial role without full executive authority.The result tightens Mr. Erdogan\u2019s grip on the country, which is one of the leading external actors in the Syrian civil war, a major way station along the migration routes to Europe and a crucial Middle Eastern partner of the United States and Russia.\u201cWe are receiving thousands of complaints on election fraud,\u201d said Erdal Aksunger, the deputy head of the main opposition party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, known as the C.H.P. \u201cWe are evaluating them one by one.\u201d\u25a0 Abolish the post of prime minister and transfer executive power to the president.\u25a0 Allow the newly empowered president to issue decrees and appoint many judges and officials responsible for scrutinizing his decisions.\u25a0 Limit the president to two five-year terms, but give the option of running for a third term if Parliament truncates the second one by calling for early elections.\u25a0 Allow the president to order disciplinary inquiries into any of Turkey\u2019s 3.5 million civil servants, according to an analysis by the head of the Turkish Bar Association.Academics and members of the opposition are concerned that the new system will threaten the separation of powers on which liberal democracies have traditionally depended.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters deny that the new system will limit political and judicial oversight. If opposition parties win control of Parliament, they could override the president\u2019s decrees with their own legislation, while also asserting greater control over judicial appointments, supporters of the new Constitution contend.The victorious \u201cyes\u201d camp also argues that a strong, centralized government will make Turkey better able to tackle its many challenges, including a troubled economy, the world\u2019s largest population of Syrian refugees, two terrorism campaigns, a civil war against Kurdish insurgents and the Syrian war across Turkey\u2019s southern border.\u201cA new page opens in our history of democracy with this vote,\u201d Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, an Erdogan loyalist, said in a victory speech on Sunday night. \u201cBe sure, everyone, we will use this result as best as we can \u2014 for the wealth and peace of our people.\u201dAnalyses of television coverage showed that the \u201cyes\u201d campaign received disproportionately more airtime than its opponents.\u201cIt\u2019s been a completely unfair campaign,\u201d said Andrej Hunko, a German lawmaker assigned by the Council of Europe to observe the election.Despite this, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s victory fell far short of the 20-point majority that he and his supporters had expected. \u201cThis is a little bit bittersweet,\u201d said Cuneyt Deniz, an Erdogan supporter celebrating in Ankara. \u201cWe were expecting above 60 percent.\u201dThe result revealed a deeply divided country, nearly half of which now feels highly embittered. \u201cI am incredibly sad right now,\u201d said Yesim Kara, 37, a \u201cno\u201d voter in Istanbul. \u201cDark days are ahead.\u201dMr. Erdogan\u2019s victory \u201cwill enhance the stability of the government, but it will weaken social stability,\u201d said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the director of the Ankara office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research group.\u201cThe new social contract that is being built in Turkey is being based on a very weak foundation,\u201d he added.Few could agree about how Mr. Erdogan would respond, and he offered no conclusive clues in his victory speech.In one breath, he appeared to reach out to his opponents, calling the results the \u201cvictory of everyone who said yes and no.\u201d But in the next, he promised to reinstate the death penalty \u2014 which would end any hopes that Turkey will join the European Union \u2014 and mocked his opponents\u2019 intent to appeal the result.\u201cDon\u2019t beat the air,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is too late now.\u201dAfter Germany and the Netherlands blocked Turkish officials from campaigning in those countries, Mr. Erdogan said both nations had shown Nazi-like behavior, drawing a rebuke from leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Mr. Unluhisarcikli said he expected a victorious Mr. Erdogan to lead \u201ca charm offensive toward Europe and the U.S. to gain validation of the new system \u2014 and such a charm offensive might include correcting some of the democratic backsliding that we\u2019ve seen in Turkey.\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, if his charm offensive is not reciprocated,\u201d Mr. Unluhisarcikli added, \u201cthen he might start initiating a Plan B, which involves tightening his grip on Turkish society.\u201dBut Professor Eissenstat said it was unlikely Mr. Erdogan would spend any time repairing relationships with the opposition.\u201cSome people have imagined that Erdogan might reboot after a \u2018yes\u2019 victory and reach out to the opposition,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is likely. The purges will continue; Erdogan\u2019s instinct is to crush opposition, not co-opt it.\u201cThe question is whether further centralization of power and increased repression can bring stability and allow Erdogan to reboot a troubled economy,\u201d added Professor Eissenstat, a lecturer at St. Lawrence University. \u201cThe record of the past 10 years is that the opposite is true.\u201dMr. Yildirim, the prime minister, suggested in his speech that the government was unlikely to step back from its various vendettas at home and abroad. \u201cOur struggle with internal and external enemies will be intensified,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Markets Saw a Trump Bump, Then Hit a Speed Bump", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byThe Trump bump in the stock market ran into trouble when the Republican effort to \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare\u201d foundered in Congress and the Federal Reserve increased interest rates, raising doubts that developments in Washington would treat the markets as kindly for the rest of the year as they appear to have done right after Election Day.Stocks had recorded a succession of highs in the hope that President Trump\u2019s proposals for significant infrastructure spending, reduced regulation and an overhaul of the tax code would be enacted and be good for business.But then, the market became choppier.\u201cThe realization is setting in that even with a Republican White House and congressional majority, it doesn\u2019t ensure a smooth enactment of legislation,\u201d said Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families. Referring to the decline in March that accelerated after the health care bill showed signs of stalling, she added: \u201cHow much hope was priced in? Well, that much was priced in.\u201dMaybe more than that, according to Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies.\u201cWe need all of the Trump stimulus to take place, and we need a tax cut,\u201d he said, to justify stocks\u2019 trading as high as they are. \u201cI don\u2019t think either is going to take place in a hurry.\u201dIf at all. Robert Arnott, co-manager of the Pimco All Asset Fund, said that while the prospect exists for Mr. Trump to be \u201ca transformational president\u201d who can succeed at \u201cdisentangling the regulatory state, cutting a lot of red tape, making it easier for free enterprise to be free, a lot of that is likely to turn out to be wishful thinking.\u201dIt was wishful enough to take the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index up more than 12 percent between Election Day and the beginning of March. For the first quarter, the benchmark index rose 5.5 percent, closing at 2,362.72.When it comes to the outlook for monetary policy, the thinking is mixed. Ms. Patterson said the Fed\u2019s move last month \u201cwas perceived as an incredibly dovish hike, if that\u2019s not too much of an oxymoron.\u201d That\u2019s because Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, declined to discuss plans for selling trillions of dollars of Treasury instruments and other securities added to the Fed\u2019s balance sheet after the global financial crisis through its quantitative easing program.Mr. Sri-Kumar envisions a more accommodative Fed than is widely expected. The economy will remain too anemic for more than one rate increase a year for the time being, he predicted.Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, counters that central bankers would have to be more assertive because, with the unemployment rate below 5 percent and inflation above 2 percent, \u201cthey have met their policy objectives.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve moved into a base case where it\u2019s not so much that if the data improves, the Fed will consider raising rates,\u201d Mr. Gundlach said. \u201cNow if the data stays where it is, the Fed will raise rates once a quarter. If you look under the hood\u201d at Ms. Yellen\u2019s commentary last month, \u201cit wasn\u2019t that dovish.\u201dTighter monetary policy is ultimately good for long-term government bonds, all else being equal, he said, because it depresses economic growth and inflation. As he put it, \u201cthe long-bond market wants the Fed to destroy the economy.\u201dBut the economy is still doing well enough to keep the 10-year Treasury yield from falling much further, Mr. Gundlach predicted. He foresees it falling to 2.25 percent from 2.4 percent on March 31, before heading close to 3 percent later in the year. He would avoid buying longer-term government debt, therefore, and high-grade corporate bonds, which he said had \u201chuge interest-rate risk.\u201dAs for stocks, they would face pressure from a further rise in bond yields, he warned.\u201cThe argument for stocks has for quite some time been that they\u2019re better than bonds,\u201d Mr. Gundlach said. \u201cAs interest rates move higher, you start to get real competition\u201d for investors\u2019 money. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough environment in the middle of this year with bond yields rising.\u201dIt was a sufficiently favorable environment in the first quarter to send the average domestic stock mutual fund up 4.9 percent, according to Morningstar. Portfolios that focus on technology and health care did especially well, while specialists in industrials and financial services lagged.The average taxable bond fund gained a modest 1.6 percent.Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, contends that the economy is humming along better than many on Wall Street believe and that it makes more sense to attribute the rally in stocks to stronger growth than to a Trump bump.\u201cThe economy and earnings data were getting better before the elections,\u201d Mr. Levkovich said, with measures like new business orders and capital spending already on the rise. \u201cThe Fed was watching all this data, as well,\u201d he added, and that\u2019s why it raised rates in March.His benign economic view leads him to be wary of bonds; he expects a 10-year Treasury yield of 2.6 percent at year\u2019s end, and little opportunity for gains. He encourages investing in stock sectors that are especially sensitive to growth, like energy \u2014 which he said had been underperforming technology almost to the extent that it did during the 2000 tech bubble \u2014 and industrials. He also likes narrower segments like biotechnology and producers of entertainment and media content.Ms. Patterson is less hopeful about the economy and stocks. While she finds that economic and earnings growth \u201ccontinue to look pretty good,\u201d she thinks a downward turn in the cycle is approaching.\u201cWe\u2019ve been neutral on stocks since late spring, and we\u2019ll probably stay neutral until it\u2019s time to go underweight,\u201d she said, adding a caveat: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be too nervous too early.\u201dAlthough she is less hopeful on the economy than Mr. Levkovich, Ms. Patterson likewise favors energy stocks. She also recommends health care and would avoid materials stocks, another economically sensitive sector.\u201cWe went into the year thinking equities were already highly valued and we\u2019re in the latter stages of the economic cycle,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re telling our clients that over the next few years we\u2019ll have positive equity returns, but that they have to manage their expectations.\u201dWith his low expectations for the economy, Mr. Sri-Kumar advises a liberal allocation to Treasury and high-grade corporate bonds, and he would limit exposure to the stock market to defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples.Investors have seldom felt the need to go into a defensive crouch during the eight-year bull run in stocks. The market appears pricey, Mr. Arnott said, based on the CAPE Shiller ratio, which compares share prices to the last 10 years of inflation-adjusted earnings to get a valuation reading that adjusts for the shifts of the economic cycle.\u201cNow, we sit with a Shiller P.E. that briefly touched 29,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty expensive,\u201d more so than at any time in the last century, he said, other than just before the 1929 crash and in the run-up to the popping of the tech bubble in 2000.\u201cThat\u2019s heady company to be keeping,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a slam-dunk formula for a market crash, but it suggests very high odds for long-term anemic returns.\u201dMr. Arnott finds the return prospects much better abroad, with stocks trading at 13 times earnings in Europe and 12 times in emerging markets. As for bonds, local-currency debt in emerging markets yields about 6.5 percent on average, compared with 1.5 percent for a basket of long-term government issues from the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain and France.Emerging markets \u201care priced for deep disappointment,\u201d he said. \u201cAny upside surprise is not priced in.\u201dFunds that invest in emerging stock markets did not disappoint in the first quarter. The average one rose 11.9 percent, helping the average international stock fund to return 7.9 percent.Mr. Gundlach prefers foreign markets for similar reasons. He favors France, where returns have lagged those in other European countries, like Germany and Britain, over the last year. A populist presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, has continued to poll well ahead of French elections that will begin next Sunday, although she is not expected to win.Among emerging markets, he considers India an excellent investment over the very long term. He foresees its economy developing much as China\u2019s has over the last few decades.\u201cWhen foreign markets outperform the U.S., you see tremendous enthusiasm for U.S. investors to diversify, but they\u2019re buying what has already gone up,\u201d Mr. Gundlach said. \u201cIf diversification is prudent, why not do it when you\u2019ve already made big profits on U.S. investments?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is It Too Late for Turkey\u2019s Democracy?", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTurkish democracy is on life support. On April 16, Turks will vote on 18 amendments to their country\u2019s Constitution, including whether to abolish the office of the prime minister and transfer its powers to the president.Pushing for a \u201cyes\u201d vote is President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A presidential system would not only give Mr. Erdogan more authority to appoint judges and ministers, and control budgets, but also allow him to rule for two more terms \u2014 until 2029 \u2014 and it would solidify Turkey\u2019s shift to authoritarianism. But even if a \u201cno\u201d vote is preferable, it may not be enough to save the Turkish republic from Mr. Erdogan\u2019s damage.Several of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s predecessors called for a stronger presidency to tame the military. Upon becoming prime minister in 2003, Mr. Erdogan managed to place civilian oversight over military expenditures and gutted the generals\u2019 hold on the National Security Council. In part because of these moves, the European Union opened negotiations for Turkish accession in 2005.But for all of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s centralization of power, Turkey has become less stable under his watch. Recent years have seen a rise in terrorism and social unrest. Over the past two years alone, there has been a series of bombings throughout the country. The Islamic State is believed to be behind several of these incidents; the Kurdistan Worker\u2019s Party, known as the P.K.K., and groups associated with it have claimed responsibility for others.Based on the president\u2019s reaction to the coup attempt in July, that might include anyone who opposes or criticizes him. Since July, Mr. Erdogan has jailed journalists and political opponents, including Selahttin Demirtas, the leader of the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party. Over the past several months, the president has purged more than 100,000 public officials, including judges, prosecutors, police officers, civil servants, teachers and university rectors, accusing them of being aligned with Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim preacher who was once his ally but whom he now accuses of masterminding the July coup attempt. More than 45,000 people have been arrested.Mr. Erdogan has also abandoned the ambitious foreign policy that boosted Turkey\u2019s economy and helped increase the country\u2019s role in international affairs, replacing it with a crude nationalism. Turkey today is increasingly isolated, particularly from the West. In recent years, Mr. Erdogan has accused Washington and Brussels of \u201cdirty plots\u201d against Turkey. Last month, he lashed out at Germany for using \u201cNazi tactics\u201d and called the Dutch \u201cfascists\u201d and \u201cNazi remnants\u201d for blocking efforts to campaign for the referendum in the Netherlands.This belligerence has resonated with the conservative Muslims who feel alienated from the West and resentful of the growing Islamophobia that they see there. It would not be surprising if this population, which has consistently handed Mr. Erdogan electoral victories in parliamentary and presidential elections, delivers him a \u201cyes\u201d in Sunday\u2019s constitutional referendum. Current polls suggest that the results are too close to call.But if voters choose \u201cno,\u201d Mr. Erdogan won\u2019t be deterred. Turkey\u2019s president is a fighter and he will go to any lengths to get what he wants. In the face of a defeat at the ballot box, he is likely to amp up his war against the Kurds, making him seem like an embattled defender of the nation. This move would also help him win support from nationalist voters who don\u2019t normally back him. It also looks possible that if he is denied further power by way of constitutional amendment, he will seek it by extending the state of emergency \u2014 maybe even indefinitely.Mr. Erdogan could also call for early elections, allowing him to take another \u201cmandate\u201d at the ballot box. In the face of an inept and weak opposition, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party continues to command significant support. What the Turkish people don\u2019t deliver on April 16, Mr. Erdogan will seek from a majority in Parliament.Nonetheless, Turkey needs a \u201cno\u201d on Sunday. A rejection of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s proposed constitutional amendments would keep alive the prospect that once this president is no longer in office, Turkey can finally have a shot at curbing the power of its rulers and, perhaps someday, making way for representative, inclusive democracy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Orders Review of Safety Rules Created After Gulf Oil Spill", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Just days after the seventh anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, one of the worst environmental disasters in the nation\u2019s history, President Trump on Friday directed the Interior Department to \u201creconsider\u201d several safety regulations on offshore drilling put in place after the spill.Friday\u2019s executive order was aimed at rolling back the Obama administration\u2019s attempts to ban oil drilling off the southeastern Atlantic and Alaskan coasts.It would erase or narrow the boundaries of some federally protected marine sanctuaries, opening them up to commercial fishing and oil drilling.But Mr. Trump also took aim at regulations on oil-rig safety.In the final years of the Obama administration, the Interior Department instituted several new rules aimed at improving the safety of specific pieces of offshore drilling equipment that had failed during the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and that were found to have been responsible for the BP oil rig explosion.Mr. Trump\u2019s order directs Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to review and revise those rules.The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon killed 11, set off a weekslong crisis for the Obama administration and spilled 4.9 million barrels of oil into the sea.The regulations were intended to prevent such disasters in the future, but oil companies complained that many were costly, burdensome and duplicative, and that they were already developing industrywide safety protocols to prevent future blowouts.Mr. Trump espoused the companies\u2019 view in a Friday morning signing ceremony in the White House\u2019s Roosevelt Room, named in part for Theodore Roosevelt, a president famed for his legacy of conserving the nation\u2019s natural resources.\u201cOur country is blessed with incredible natural resources, including abundant offshore oil and gas reserves,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut the federal government has kept 94 percent of these offshore areas closed for exploration and production. And when I say closed, I mean closed.\u201dHe added, \u201cThis deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth. I pledged to take action, and today I am keeping that promise.\u201dIn particular, Mr. Trump\u2019s order targets a new rule put in place last year by the Obama administration, known as the Well Control Rule, which was intended to tighten controls on blowout preventers, the industry-standard devices that are the last line of protection to stop explosions in undersea oil and gas wells.The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig was caused partly by the buckling of a section of drill pipe. That buckling prompted the deployment of a supposedly fail-safe blowout preventer on the BP well, but the equipment malfunctioned.The Obama-era rule also added tougher requirements to the design of undersea wells and the lining that coats the wells.It also requires an outside organization to conduct annual assessments of the mechanical integrity of blowout preventers, including a requirement that the equipment be maintained according to the manufacturers\u2019 original performance standards, and that it be subject as well to real-time underwater video monitoring.Environmentalists said they were shocked at Mr. Trump\u2019s move to reopen the safety regulation.\u201cThe well control rule is one of the single most important things we did as a nation to respond to the worst offshore oil disaster in our nation\u2019s history and to reduce the risk of it ever happening again,\u201d said Bob Deans, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group, and co-author of the book \u201cIn Deep Water,\u201d an investigation into the causes of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.\u201cThe purpose of the rule is to reduce the risk in what is an inherently dangerous industrial operation at sea. Any attempt to walk back that rule will expose our workers, our waters and our wildlife to increased risk. Why we would want to turn the clock back to April 2010 and roll the dice on another BP-style disaster, walk away from the lessons we learned, from the deaths of those workers, is incomprehensible. It\u2019s madness.\u201dThe oil industry cheered the move and emphasized that companies were already implementing their own safety measures.\u201cI.P.A.A. applauds the signing of this executive order as a step in the right direction for America\u2019s energy economy and national energy security,\u201d said Dan Naatz, a vice president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. \u201cWith a proven record of offshore production that can be done safely and responsibly, I.P.A.A. has long advocated for increased access to our offshore resources to support economic development, American jobs, and expanded energy production here at home.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Restores Public Sector Perks Amid Grumbling", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 King Salman of Saudi Arabia rescinded salary cuts for ministers and restored financial perks for public sector workers in a series of royal decrees late Saturday.He also promoted two of his own sons to important positions, naming Prince Khaled bin Salman ambassador to Washington and Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman state minister for energy affairs.The decrees, released through state news media, are a new step in the Saudi leadership\u2019s efforts to adjust the kingdom\u2019s finances, which have been undermined by low oil prices.In seeking to stabilize the country\u2019s budget, the rulers have had to balance the need to reduce spending with the desire to maintain the support of a population used to generous subsidies and benefits.The bonus cuts had caused widespread grumbling in Saudi Arabia, where about two-thirds of employed citizens work for the state. For many, the bonuses had accounted for a substantial amount of their total take-home pay, with payouts equal to 20 percent or more of monthly salaries not uncommon.Saudi officials said that the decision to cancel the pay cuts and restore the bonuses reflected the government\u2019s improved fiscal position. Some analysts said the moves also sought to assuage public discontent over recent austerity measures, which have included increases in energy, water and fuel costs.The decrees also elevated two of King Salman\u2019s sons, empowering his branch of the vast royal family that has ruled the country since the 1930s.Prince Mohammed is spearheading an effort to modernize the kingdom by reducing its dependence on oil, diversifying the economy and improving life for Saudi citizens. He is also in charge of the Saudi intervention in the war in Yemen, where the kingdom and a coalition of Arab countries have been struggling to push rebels aligned with Iran from the capital, Sana.Prince Khaled\u2019s primary task will be to improve Saudi Arabia\u2019s relationship with the United States, which grew strained during the administration of President Barack Obama because of disagreements over Syria and Egypt, and Mr. Obama\u2019s pursuit of an agreement to limit the nuclear program of Iran, the Saudis\u2019 regional rival.Saudi officials have spoken positively of their interactions with President Trump and hope that he will increase support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen while also taking a harder line on Iran.Prince Abdulaziz, the new state minister for energy affairs, was previously deputy oil minister.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May Calls for New Election in Britain, Seeking Stronger \u2018Brexit\u2019 Mandate", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on Tuesday called for an early election in less than two months, clearly anxious that her thin majority in Parliament would weaken her hand in complicated negotiations on the British exit from the European Union.Mrs. May\u2019s proposal for a snap election on June 8 broke her oft-repeated vow not to call an early vote and was aimed at exploiting her popularity to gain more parliamentary seats. This would strengthen her political backing in the negotiations for Britain\u2019s departure, known as Brexit.Nobody expects the new election to undo that decision. Yet depending on how well Mrs. May\u2019s side does, it could affect her demands in the negotiations.The financial markets bid up the pound on the news, apparently anticipating a Conservative sweep that would give Mrs. May the mandate to override hard-liners in her own party who might resist concessions to the European Union in return for market access \u2014 the so-called soft Brexit.Certainly, the Conservatives\u2019 election prospects look promising. They are riding high in the opinion polls, with the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn in disarray, the centrist Liberal Democrats weak and the fractious far-right U.K. Independence Party, if anything, more a threat to Labour than to the Tories.But the decision does carry political risks for Mrs. May. For a politician who has cultivated a reputation as a straight shooter who puts country before party, the about-face on early elections could smack of opportunism. And in a year of election surprises, embittered but highly motivated voters from the Remain camp could coalesce behind one of the parties to register their anger over leaving the bloc.\u201cShe presents herself as someone putting the national interest first, before her party, and someone who does not play political games,\u201d said Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. \u201cIt might bite her, but she\u2019ll play the stability-versus-instability card.\u201dMrs. May apparently calculated that the risks of an early vote were small compared with the possible payoff from a strengthened Conservative hold over Parliament.Without an early vote, Mrs. May said, \u201cthe negotiations with the European Union will reach their most difficult stage in the run-up to the next scheduled election,\u201d in 2020. She added, \u201cDivision in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit, and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country.\u201dAnalysts generally praised her decision to call early elections. \u201cThis is the act of a rational politician, but one who had repeatedly promised not to call an early election,\u201d Mr. Fielding said. \u201cBut her lead in the polls can only go down as soon as Brexit negotiations start, so why not go now?\u201dSome were more effusive, all but guaranteeing a Conservative sweep. \u201cIt\u2019s a surefire certainty it will be a thumping majority, no doubt about it,\u201d said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. \u201cSomething terrible about Theresa May would have to emerge between now and polling day for that not to be the case.\u201dThe last election was in 2015, when Mr. Cameron won a surprising but thin majority as the Labour Party lost heavily in Scotland and the Liberal Democrats were reduced to just eight seats in Parliament.Labour\u2019s choice of Mr. Corbyn, a man of the hard left, has proved hugely unpopular, but on Tuesday he issued a statement welcoming an early election, as politically he had to do. That makes it likely that Parliament on Wednesday will give Mrs. May the two-thirds majority she needs to call an early election under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which otherwise mandates an election in May 2020.Mr. Corbyn, 67, was elected after Labour\u2019s bad defeat in 2015 and took the party strongly to the left. He was a weak supporter of the Remain campaign, and efforts by Labour legislators to unseat him have failed. He will lead a badly divided party and, if Labour loses this election, too, as expected, will be under considerable pressure to resign.The Liberal Democrats, under a new leader, Tim Farron, have explicitly opposed leaving the bloc and have called for another referendum on any final deal with Brussels. Though the Liberal Democrats are expected to win back some seats in June from the Conservatives, the Conservatives are expected to win more seats from Mr. Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party because many Labour constituencies in Britain\u2019s hard-pressed northern cities voted strongly for leaving.While a third or so of Conservative voters voted against leaving, they are considered likely to back Mrs. May, given the alternatives, especially as she has hinted lately that a transitional deal with Brussels would probably involve some compromises in the national interest.Mrs. May portrayed the election as one of leadership. \u201cIt will be a choice between strong and stable leadership in the national interest, with me as your prime minister, or weak and unstable coalition government, led by Jeremy Corbyn, propped up by the Liberal Democrats who want to reopen the divisions of the referendum,\u201d she said Tuesday.The Liberal Democrats have promised to bludgeon the Conservatives with the specter of a \u201chard Brexit,\u201d in which Britain would leave the European Union\u2019s single market and customs union without a mitigating trade agreement.On Tuesday, Mr. Farron said that \u201cif you want to avoid a disastrous hard Brexit, if you want to keep Britain in the single market, if you want a Britain that is open, tolerant and united, this is your chance.\u201d\u201cOnly the Liberal Democrats can prevent a Conservative majority,\u201d he added.Mr. Cameron endorsed Mrs. May\u2019s announcement, calling it a \u201cbrave \u2014 and right \u2014 decision.\u201dThe leader of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party, was harsh, saying, \u201cThis announcement is one of the most extraordinary U-turns in recent political history, and it shows that Theresa May is once again putting the interests of her party ahead of those of the country.\u201dMs. Sturgeon, who favors an independent Scotland but also wants to remain within the European Union\u2019s single market, said the snap election was about \u201cstanding up for Scotland in the face of a right-wing, austerity-obsessed Tory government with no mandate in Scotland but which now thinks it can do whatever it wants and get away with it.\u201dParadoxically, however, a more confident Mrs. May, with a larger majority, is likely to be able to negotiate more flexibly with Ms. Sturgeon over final terms to leave the bloc and undercut momentum for another Scottish independence referendum.In recent weeks, Mrs. May\u2019s office repeatedly insisted that an early election was not going to happen, despite considerable pressure to call one from party notables like the former leader William Hague. But British politicians remember well how speculation that a Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, was going to call an early election in 2007 rebounded on him when he failed to follow through, destroying his credibility.Mr. Brown took office after his predecessor, Tony Blair, stepped aside. Despite polls showing that Labour would win a commanding majority and provide him with his own mandate, Mr. Brown waited and suffered from the 2008-9 financial crisis, despite his skillful management of it, and Labour lost the 2010 election.Stephen Castle and Sewell Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.R.S. Enlists Debt Collectors to Recover Overdue Taxes", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byThe Internal Revenue Service is about to start using four private debt-collection companies to chase down overdue payments from hundreds of thousands of people who owe money to the federal government, a job it has handled in house for years.Even so, Congress passed a law in 2015 ordering the I.R.S. to once again outsource some of its delinquent debt. The provision was buried in a $305 billion highway funding bill. The agency hired four companies \u2014 CBE Group, ConServe, Performant and Pioneer Credit Recovery \u2014 and started giving them cases this month.The companies will work on commission, earning up to 25 percent of the delinquent debt they collect.High-profile lawmakers on both sides of the aisle backed the latest debt-collection plan. In addition to Mr. Grassley, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, has been a proponent of using private collectors for years. Three of the four companies that won the latest I.R.S. contracts are based in the two senators\u2019 states.Proponents of this kind of outsourcing say that the benefits go beyond jobs. During his confirmation hearing, Steven T. Mnuchin, President Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary, said that employing for-profit collectors to pursue money owed to the government \u201cseems like a very obvious thing to do.\u201dIn years past, Ms. Olson said, the outside collectors employed by the government used psychological tricks that may have coerced some debtors into payments they could not afford.After the remaining debt was returned to the I.R.S. for renewed collection attempts, agents brought in another $139 million \u2014 62 percent more than their private counterparts.With the administrative cost of running the program factored in, the I.R.S. lost $4.4 million, an agency analysis found.John A. Koskinen, the commissioner of the I.R.S., said the new program takes a \u201cstreamlined\u201d approach, with significantly lower overhead than the last attempt. The plan is to turn 140,000 accounts over to the four companies this year, all with a balance of $50,000 or less.\u201cWe will do everything we can to make sure this program is effective,\u201d Mr. Koskinen said at a congressional hearing this month. \u201cBecause if it works, that would be fine. If it doesn\u2019t work, I don\u2019t want anyone saying, well, we actually sandbagged it some way or the other.\u201dMs. Olson warned that the program appeared \u201cto place a bull\u2019s-eye on the backs of low-income taxpayers.\u201dBut there are no legal protections to keep those taxpayers out of the private collection program. Ms. Olson\u2019s office analyzed 360,000 delinquent accounts that could be turned over for private collection; among those who filed recent tax returns, more than a third had income of less than $20,000.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be going after folks like that,\u201d said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. \u201cIf you turn the screws on them to the point where they can\u2019t afford their rent, that\u2019s not good for anyone.\u201dAt the time, the commissioner, Mr. Koskinen, was quoted in a news release saying: \u201cIf you\u2019re surprised to get a call from the I.R.S., it almost certainly isn\u2019t the real I.R.S. We generally initially contact taxpayers by mail.\u201d Now that private companies are authorized to call taxpayers on behalf of the agency, that advice may no longer hold.\u201cThis is like putting out barrels of honey for scammers,\u201d said David C. Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School and the former director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s consumer protection bureau.\u201cWhat is the I.R.S. thinking?\u201d Mr. Vladeck said. \u201cThere\u2019s a very dark cloud hanging over Pioneer. The idea that the I.R.S. would engage it nonetheless to be its agent in debt collection is just stunning.\u201dThe I.R.S. says that delinquent taxpayers whose accounts are turned over to the private collection agencies will have already received many letters by mail from the agency, urging them to pay and warning them that the debt would be turned over to a third party for collection.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Central Bank Sounds a More Upbeat Tone", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byBut for analysts and investors \u2014 who parse every word spoken by Mario Draghi, the president of the bank, alert to even subtle changes in language or tone \u2014 there was plenty to focus on.The euro rose as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar shortly after Mr. Draghi started speaking, but it has since given up most of those gains.Here is a guide to phrases they were listening for as Mr. Draghi spoke on Thursday:The European Central Bank repeated its promise to keep buying government and corporate bonds \u2014 a form of economic stimulus \u2014 until the end of the year, \u201cor beyond, if necessary.\u201dObservers of the central bank are obsessing about when in 2018 the bank might begin to wind down, or taper, those bond purchases. A few subtle changes in the language used by Mr. Draghi signaled that the central bank is laying the groundwork for tapering, but that it is still on the distant horizon.After every meeting, the central bank\u2019s Governing Council issues a statement giving its view on the state of the economy in the eurozone.But the change in tone was not so significant that it caused most analysts to recalibrate their forecasts of when tapering might begin.A rise in the rate of inflation would put pressure on the central bank to ease its stimulus efforts.At its previous meeting, the bank said that an increase in the official eurozone inflation rate, to 2 percent, was the result of higher oil prices rather than being an indicator that the economy was heating up.On Thursday, Mr. Draghi repeated the central bank\u2019s view that higher inflation was most likely temporary. \u201cUnderlying inflation pressures continue to remain subdued and have yet to show a convincing upward trend,\u201d he said.If the central bank were to hint at concern about accelerating inflation, it would be another reason to expect tapering to begin sooner rather than later.The bank has been saying for some time that it would not touch official interest rates until after it had stopped buying government and corporate bonds.Still, there has been speculation it could raise the so-called deposit rate \u2014 the interest that banks receive on money they keep at the bank \u2014 sooner.Questioned repeatedly about the issue Thursday, Mr. Draghi said the bank\u2019s stance had not changed. Interest rates will not rise until the bond buying is over.Without fail, the central bank\u2019s monthly statements beseech leaders in the eurozone to take politically unpopular steps to overhaul their economies by reducing red tape and making it easier for companies to dismiss unwanted workers.Just as reliably, politicians in the eurozone pay no attention whatsoever.Mr. Draghi declined to comment on the French elections. But a question about the vote prompted him to embark on a long discourse on how reforms would increase productivity and cut unemployment. Some countries have made changes, he said, without specifying which ones. \u201cThe picture is not uniformly bleak,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.While also declining to comment on American politics, Mr. Draghi said he was less worried that the Trump administration would take measures that would interfere with world trade. \u201cThe risk of protectionism may have somewhat receded,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Boom or Bust: Stark Partisan Divide on How Consumers View Economy", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported byEconomics has a foundation in hard numbers \u2014 employment, inflation, spending \u2014 that has largely allowed it to sidestep the competing partisan narratives that have afflicted American politics and culture.But not anymore. Since Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in November, consumer sentiment has diverged in an unprecedented way, with Republicans convinced that a boom is at hand, and Democrats foreseeing an imminent recession.\u201cWe\u2019ve never recorded this before,\u201d said Richard Curtin, who directs the University of Michigan\u2019s monthly survey of consumer sentiment. Although the outlook has occasionally varied by political party since the survey began in 1946, \u201cthe partisan divide has never had as large an impact on consumers\u2019 economic expectations,\u201d he said.At the same time, familiar economic data points have become Rorschach tests. That was evident after the government\u2019s monthly jobs report on Friday; Republicans\u2019 talking points centered on a 10-year low in the unemployment rate, while Democrats focused on a sharp decline in job creation.\u201cI find it stunning, to be honest. It\u2019s unreal,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington. \u201cThings that were less politicized in the past, like how you feel about the economy, have become more politicized now.\u201dIndeed, the night-and-day views underscore yet another front on which Americans remain polarized five months after the election, and with President Trump nearing his 100th day in office.There are some tangible reasons for the split. Many Republican states, including the Midwestern swing states that provided Mr. Trump\u2019s margin of victory, have experienced a more sluggish recovery over the last eight years \u2014 and are thus more invested in the change promised by Mr. Trump.Many Democratic states have bounced back more vigorously. Hence their political and economic viewpoints were jolted by November\u2019s election result.For example, Vermont, Colorado and Massachusetts \u2014 all carried by the Democrats \u2014 are thriving, with an unemployment rate below 4 percent. In Republican strongholds like Alaska, Georgia and Alabama, the rate is well above the national average of 4.5 percent.Rank-and-file Republicans aren\u2019t the only ones who are feeling more upbeat, whether or not it\u2019s justified by the data. Sentiment among business leaders who backed Mr. Trump has also surged since the election.David Congdon, chief executive of Old Dominion Freight Line, the trucking giant, never expected Mr. Trump to win when he voted for him in November.\u201cI fell out of bed when I got up in the morning on Nov. 9,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite know what I was voting for.\u201dBut despite misfires in Washington like the failed attempt to roll back President Barack Obama\u2019s health care policies, Mr. Congdon is definitely feeling more positive.\u201cTrump\u2019s got a hard road ahead of him, but I think he\u2019s off to a decent start,\u201d said Mr. Congdon, who recently joined other transportation executives for a meeting with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\u201cI\u2019m personally optimistic about the economy for the rest of the year, and I think we will see an uptick in terms of freight deliveries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have picked up our hiring.\u201dEconomists, too, find their outlook shifting with the political landscape. Before the election, Heather Boushey, a top adviser to Hillary Clinton during the campaign, thought \u201cthe economy was on the right track, with slow and steady growth like we\u2019ve had over the past few years.\u201dNow she is much more pessimistic, especially about the economy\u2019s long-term prospects. Although she is pleased that the Affordable Care Act survived Republican efforts to repeal it, the gridlock has led her to believe that Mr. Trump will never get a big infrastructure spending package through Congress.\u201cI am losing hope that we will make those much-needed investments over the next few years,\u201d said Ms. Boushey, executive director of the liberal Center for Equitable Growth.The University of Michigan researchers have their own way of measuring the gulf between the two viewpoints and how quickly it has flipped.Among Republicans, the Michigan consumer expectations index was at 61.1 in October, the kind of reading typically reported in the depths of a recession. Confident that Mrs. Clinton would win, Democrats registered a 95.4 reading, close to the highs reached when her husband was in office in the late 1990s and the economy was soaring.By March, the positions were reversed, with an even more extreme split. Republicans\u2019 expectations had soared to 122.5, equivalent to levels registered in boom times. As for Democrats, they were even more pessimistic than Republicans had been in October.As at the voting booth, the split in perceptions could have real-world consequences. If behavior tracks the recession-era sentiment among Democrats, who account for 32 percent of respondents in the survey, prophecies could quickly become self-fulfilling by affecting spending and investing decisions.\u201cIf one-third of the population cut their consumer spending by 5 percent, you get a recession,\u201d said Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist who served in the Clinton administration and advised Al Gore and Hillary Clinton on economic policy during their Democratic presidential campaigns. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will happen, but it\u2019s not beyond the realm of the possible.\u201dTo be sure, even if Democratic consumers pulled back, that wouldn\u2019t necessarily bring on a recession. A burst of spending by bullish Republicans, who equal 27 percent of those polled by the Michigan researchers, could counteract much of that drag. And independents, who are the largest cohort in the survey, at 41 percent, remain fairly optimistic about future growth.It is rare for \u201crising optimism to coexist with increasing uncertainty,\u201d said Mr. Curtin, the Michigan expert. \u201cThe current level of optimism clearly indicates that no economywide spending retrenchment is underway, but the prevailing level of uncertainty will limit growth in discretionary spending.\u201dLawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and was Mr. Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser during his first term, said he, too, was struck by the big swing in economic sentiment.\u201cIt is a remarkably big switch from October,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are a Democrat, you are primed for negativity. It carries through in your view of everything else.\u201dA prominent Democrat himself and a strong Hillary Clinton backer, Mr. Summers is nonetheless slightly more optimistic than he was late last year, because the data on housing starts and business investment intentions has been positive, not because of the new administration\u2019s policies.Whether the optimists or pessimists prove more prescient about the economy\u2019s trajectory, Mr. Summers said, the split in perceptions will persist.\u201cI\u2019d bet there will be some minor convergence,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there will still be a large divergence on what should be a matter of objective reality.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, 84, Dies; N.F.L. Force and Link to Football\u2019s Past", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byDan Rooney, the longtime Pittsburgh Steelers chairman who helped shape the modern National Football League and was one of the last surviving links to its founders, died on Thursday in Pittsburgh. He was 84.The Steelers announced his death on their website.\u201cMy father meant so much to all of us, and so much to so many past and present members of the Steelers organization,\u201d said Mr. Rooney\u2019s son, the team president Arthur Rooney II. \u201cHe gave his heart and soul to the Steelers, the National Football League and the City of Pittsburgh.\u201dMr. Rooney\u2019s health had deteriorated in recent weeks, and he had uncharacteristically missed the league\u2019s annual meeting in Phoenix in late March. In a speech there to the other team owners, Commissioner Roger Goodell praised Mr. Rooney for his decades of service, and flew to Pittsburgh to see him soon after the meeting concluded.Except for a stint as ambassador to Ireland in the Obama administration, Mr. Rooney was part of the Steelers almost from birth, having been born the year before his father, Art, bought the team in 1933.Mr. Rooney started out as a water boy and held nearly every job in the team\u2019s front office, eventually becoming chairman. During his nearly eight decades with the team, the Steelers became one of the league\u2019s most successful franchises, winning six Super Bowl titles \u2014 more than any other team.Mr. Rooney was also a powerful force in the N.F.L. and a confidant of commissioners going back to Bert Bell, who was himself once an owner of the Steelers. Mr. Rooney worked to settle the often-tumultuous labor disputes of the 1970s and \u201980s. Without the bombast that characterized some other owners, he was a consensus builder who could work with players to hammer out differences.Among his many roles, Mr. Rooney was on the expansion committee that helped put teams in Seattle and Tampa, and he helped engineer the merger between the N.F.L. and the American Football League, in part by persuading his father to let the Steelers join the new conference that would be home to many A.F.L. teams.Mr. Rooney, however, rarely sought the spotlight. In 1989, when he helped lead the search for a successor to Commissioner Pete Rozelle, several owners pushed Mr. Rooney\u2019s name forward as an alternative to Jim Finks and Paul Tagliabue, two other candidates. Asked about the odds of his seeking the job, Mr. Rooney was blunt.\u201cSlim and none,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cNo, make that none.\u201dMr. Tagliabue got the job.In a league filled with billionaires and outsize personalities, Mr. Rooney was more interested in deflecting attention than receiving it, particularly when he turned into an elder statesman surrounded by owners who had made their money outside of football.Like other second- and third-generation owners, including John Mara of the Giants and Michael Bidwill of the Arizona Cardinals, Mr. Rooney\u2019s primary concern was the health of his team and the league, not an outside business.Few owners wore as many hats or were as universally admired as Mr. Rooney. Nor have many of them spanned as many generations as Mr. Rooney, who worked with some of the original architects of the league, including George Halas in Chicago and Curly Lambeau in Green Bay, Wis.\u201cIn some ways I think of myself as the Last Steeler, the last of the founding generation of the N.F.L.,\u201d Rooney wrote in \u201cDan Rooney: My 75 years With the Pittsburgh Steelers and the NFL\u201d (2007).Daniel Milton Rooney was born in Pittsburgh on July 20, 1932, a year before the Steelers entered the still-fledgling N.F.L. His home on the North Side of Pittsburgh, he would note, was just three blocks from where the first professional football game is thought to have been played, 40 years before he was born.\u201cI guess you could say the game is in my blood,\u201d he wrote.The oldest of five sons of Art Rooney and the former Kathleen McNulty, Mr. Rooney lived almost his entire life in Pittsburgh. In his memoir, he recalled playing football with friends and his brothers \u2014 Art Jr., Tim, Pat and John \u2014 in the shadows of the steel mills that powered Pittsburgh\u2019s economy.\u201cFamily, faith, football \u2014 those are my priorities,\u201d Mr. Rooney wrote.A year after he was born, his father, a boxing promoter who hoped to own a baseball team, paid $2,500 for the Steelers, who were then named the Pirates. The N.F.L. was struggling to survive during the Depression, but Art Rooney saw potential for the team in western Pennsylvania, a football hotbed.Most years, the Steelers were little match for the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers. But Dan Rooney was hooked. When he was 9 years old he became the Steelers\u2019 water boy. He ran errands, cleaned the locker room and painted the team\u2019s helmets.\u201cI loved being out there, loafing with the players and working with the team,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI did whatever needed to be done and didn\u2019t get paid much to do it, but I felt part of the team \u2014 I was a Steeler.\u201dMr. Rooney played quarterback and halfback at North Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, and thought seriously about becoming a Roman Catholic priest.Instead, he earned a degree in accounting from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. In short order, he was handling the team\u2019s logistics and negotiating contracts.In 1955, he pushed the team to draft Johnny Unitas, another western Pennsylvania native. To Mr. Rooney\u2019s lasting regret, the Steelers\u2019 coaches released him before the season. Unitas went on to have a Hall of Fame career with the Baltimore Colts.During the Steelers\u2019 playoff drought, from 1948 to 1971, Mr. Rooney and his wife, Patricia, built a family, with nine children.His survivors include his wife; his brothers; his daughters, Joan Clancy, Patricia Gerrero and Mary Duffy; his sons, Arthur II, John, Jim and Dan Jr.; 20 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. His daughter Kathleen died in 1987, and his daughter Rita died in 2012.The Rooney family has been inextricably linked to the Mara family, which owns half of the Giants. Dan Rooney and Wellington Mara continued the friendship of their fathers, Art Sr. and Tim, and members of the families have also married.Not long after, the team hired Chuck Noll as its coach after interviewing the Penn State coach Joe Paterno. Mr. Rooney and the Steelers then drafted players who became the nucleus of their championship teams of the 1970s: Joe Greene, Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Jack Lambert and many others.Mr. Rooney received his pilot\u2019s license in 1975 and earned the nickname Crash after an accident in 2000, the same year he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. (He and his father, who was inducted in 1964, were the second father-son pair to be enshrined; Tim and Wellington Mara were the first.) Three years later, Mr. Rooney handed the job of club president to his son Arthur II.President Barack Obama appointed Mr. Rooney ambassador to the Republic of Ireland, in part because he had raised millions of dollars for the American Ireland Fund, an educational and philanthropic organization, and helped establish the Rooney Prize, which is given to young Irish poets and writers. He served from July 2009 to December 2012, but he frequently returned to the Steelers and the N.F.L.\u201cFootball and the Steelers have taught me lessons about perseverance,\u201d he said, \u201cthe belief in possibilities, the expansion of boundaries, the kindness of people and the unpredictability of life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Faces the Limits of American Power", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, inspired by TV images of faraway suffering to launch missile strikes against Syria, may be about to discover a lesson that has confounded presidents for 25 years: American power can only do so much.That truth is also embedded in another set of disturbing images that Mr. Trump has not cited publicly: those from Nigeria\u2019s conflict-torn northeast, where a very different crisis is drawing different American action toward different ends.Those two conflicts, in both their contrasts and commonalities, reveal something of the role that Mr. Trump has taken on and its limitation.Both are humanitarian disasters whose ground-level stories horrify and enrage. And they are both crises of a sort that the United States, since emerging from the Cold War as the world\u2019s policeman, has repeatedly tried but often failed to resolve.The two wars could hardly be more different, as are the American responses. Yet they may still share the fundamental dynamics that make conflict-driven crises so resistant to outside resolution.In Syria, the United States has sought to either mediate between the warring parties or tip the military balance through force, whether by the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to arm certain rebels or Mr. Trump\u2019s missile strikes. The scope of the United States\u2019 involvement has been extensive and highly visible.In Nigeria, American action appears more modest.There, the United States is emphasizing political tools, pressuring the government to improve practices in the affected parts of the country and supporting any reforms. It has helped to coordinate a multinational force from surrounding countries. It is also providing military advisers, intelligence and other forms of military support, which Mr. Trump this week extended in the form of warplane sales, but nothing comparable to action in Syria.The difference between the two approaches is partly explained by the scale of the suffering, which is more severe in Syria, and perhaps by an even wider gap in attention received.It is also explained by Syria\u2019s wider geopolitical stakes \u2014 its conflict touches on the European refugee crisis, Russia\u2019s resurgence, global terrorism and Middle Eastern power struggles \u2014 whereas Nigeria\u2019s is contained to a region that is less central to American interests.But the difference is also caused by the contrasting nature of the crises. Syria\u2019s problem is seen, in part, as a deadlocked military imbalance that American force is meant to overturn. Nigeria\u2019s problems are driven more by crises in governing.Boko Haram has exploited, and been fueled by, long-held political tensions and grievances within Nigerian society, including neglect by the central government and abuse by its soldiers. American policy is aimed at helping Nigeria address the underlying issues that helped give rise to the insurgency, pushing for reforms to roll back corruption and military abuses.Because the goal is restoring government control and local faith in it, military power plays a smaller role in American strategy.Still, Americans sometimes see the degree of military intervention as a function of political will \u2014 if the president cared, he would intervene. This reveals a deeper assumption: that American power can solve any crisis, but only if it is sufficiently and correctly applied.But while the United States has exerted far more effort in Syria than in Nigeria, and has used different tools, the outcomes have been similar to what it often finds in such efforts: disappointment.The conflicts in Syria and Nigeria, in their breadth of difference, reveal the common factors that make conflict-driven humanitarian crises so hard to solve: simultaneous breakdowns in governing and in the social contract by which a population agrees to exist in harmony.Once these have collapsed, segments of society, whether divided by demographic tribe or political affiliation, come to see one another as locked in a zero-sum contest for survival and control. The result is chaos, a self-perpetuating cycle of violence with entire communities caught in the middle.Syria and Nigeria also illustrate a common American response: intervention, military or otherwise, to resolve the underlying political breakdown that compels the fighting.Since the early 1990s, when the United States took on the mantle of global leadership, it has acted in Somalia, in Afghanistan, in two different parts of Sudan, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Liberia and Sierra Leone\u2019s overlapping conflicts, in East Timor and twice in the former Yugoslavia.It has tried diplomacy and foreign aid, imposed political reforms and peacekeepers, launched cruise missiles and outright occupations. Sometimes the variance in policy was because of differing temperaments or worldviews of key American officials, or the amount of attention those crises received on TV, but the outcomes were consistently modest.The relatively few breakthroughs offer hints as to why other efforts have faltered.Successful interventions have often come in one of two forms: resolving a conflict between two states, or nudging local dynamics that were already aligning around peace.The United States helped, for instance, halt the wars between the nations once united as Yugoslavia. Because the problem was one of border-crossing forces, outside intervention could push them back.This rarely applies, though, in an era when interstate conflict is rare and most wars come from political breakdowns that do not fall along neat borders.Where outside intervention has succeeded in such crises, it has typically been not by changing those dynamics from the outside, but by capitalizing on major shifts toward peace that arose from within.In East Timor, which Indonesia claimed as its territory, years of diplomacy and political pressure faltered until Indonesia\u2019s economy collapsed and its hard-line president was replaced by a reformer.The breakthrough, as is almost always the case, had come from the conflict\u2019s participants, whose calculus was driven largely by local factors and not the threat or promise of outside action.That can be a difficult message for Americans accustomed to seeing themselves as deciders of major global issues.The United States assumes this leadership in part because it is the guarantor of the international order and the power of last resort, leading the world to look to American involvement.Jeremy Shapiro, the research director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, has argued that the United States is also driven by what he calls \u201cthe American omnipotence problem.\u201dA string of military victories in the early 1990s, Mr. Shapiro told The New York Times in October, established an assumption \u201cthat any problem in the world is basically solvable by American power if there is sufficient political will.\u201dAs a result, when a crisis emerges, and Americans are confronted with images like those Mr. Trump saw from Syria, the question raised is often not whether the United States is capable of imposing a solution, but why it hasn\u2019t.The United States has long tried to impose such shifts from the outside. If success were primarily a matter of American will or commitment, it would have come in mid-2000s Baghdad.The United States, responsible for a crisis largely of its making and driven by a president whose legacy hung in the balance, committed the full force of its might and diplomacy to resolving the city\u2019s sectarian bloodletting.It imposed block-by-block order through blast walls, patrols and checkpoints. It held high-level peace talks and local neighborhood meetings. It won relative calm, but even proponents said this served only to create space for Iraqis to resolve the deeper issues that divided them, which many tried to do.Once American troops drew down, it became clear that outside force could restore order to a neighborhood. But it could not resolve the social and political breakdowns that had made it dangerous in the first place, and would do so again once the vacuum reopened.Syria and Nigeria, in their own ways, carry this same dilemma. American policy options are aimed at alleviating the suffering and violence that are symptoms of deeper problems. But resolution can come only when the war\u2019s participants once again see peaceful coexistence as worth the compromises and risks \u2014 a task harder than any American mission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Trump Appointees, a Raft of Potential Conflicts and \u2018No Transparency\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is populating the White House and federal agencies with former lobbyists, lawyers and consultants who in many cases are helping to craft new policies for the same industries in which they recently earned a paycheck.In at least two cases, the appointments may have already led to violations of the administration\u2019s own ethics rules. But evaluating if and when such violations have occurred has become almost impossible because the Trump administration is secretly issuing waivers to the rules.There are other examples. At the Labor Department, two officials joined the agency from the K Street lobbying corridor, leaving behind jobs where they fought some of the Obama administration\u2019s signature labor rules, including a policy requiring financial advisers to act in a client\u2019s best interest when providing retirement advice.This revolving door of lobbyists and government officials is not new in Washington. Both parties make a habit of it.\u201cThe White House takes its ethics pledge and federal conflict of interest rules very seriously,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe White House requires all of its employees to work closely with ethics counsel to ensure compliance and has aggressively required employees to recuse or divest where the law requires.\u201dThe Trump administration\u2019s overhaul of personnel lays the groundwork for sweeping policy changes. The president has vowed to unwind some of the Obama administration\u2019s signature regulatory initiatives, from Wall Street rules to environmental regulations, and he has installed a class of former corporate influencers to lead the push. Administration supporters argue that appointees with corporate ties can inject a new level of sophistication into the federal bureaucracy and help the economy grow. And efforts to trim regulations in some areas have attracted bipartisan support.But in several cases, officials in the Trump administration now hold the exact jobs they targeted as lobbyists or lawyers in the past two years.Trump White House officials had over 300 recent corporate clients and employers, including Apple, the giant hedge fund Citadel and the insurance titan Anthem, according to a Times analysis of financial disclosures. (The White House has released disclosures for only about half of its roughly 180 current senior political employees.) And there are more than 40 former lobbyists in the White House and the broader federal government.He said that Mr. Trump\u2019s own ethics executive order in late January eliminated a requirement, first adopted by President Barack Obama, that executive branch appointees not accept jobs in agencies they recently lobbied. That weakened standards applying to approximately 4,000 executive branch hires.Mr. Trump also made it easier for former lobbyists in the government to get waivers that would let them take up matters that could benefit former clients.\u201cThere\u2019s no transparency, and I have no idea how many waivers have been issued,\u201d Mr. Shaub said in an interview, adding that he could not comment on any individual matter until a complaint had been filed and investigated.The granting of such waivers, he said, has become \u201ca political decision, which means career government ethics officials should not get involved in waivers under the new executive order.\u201dMr. Catanzaro did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment. And White House officials would not say whether he had been granted a waiver allowing him to be involved in the same matter he handled as a lobbyist.Mr. Catanzaro is not the only senior adviser facing potential conflicts on the National Economic Council, the White House office, run by the former Goldman Sachs executive Gary D. Cohn, that helps steer the president\u2019s financial and economic policy. D. J. Gribbin, the council\u2019s infrastructure specialist, previously worked for Macquarie, a bank that specializes in infrastructure deals and that stands to gain from whatever infrastructure proposal the president gets Congress to fund.At Fidelity, lobbying records show, she was registered to work on retirement issues, including the so-called fiduciary rule, which has broad support from consumer groups. It requires financial firms to act in a client\u2019s best interest when dispensing retirement advice. Fidelity has said it supports the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard but, like other firms, has raised concerns that the rule will prevent investors from accessing products they currently rely on for retirement savings.Ms. Knight directed some of her appeals to the National Economic Council, her current employer. White House visitor logs show she met with the person whose job she essentially holds now.The White House did not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Gribbin or Ms. Knight, so it is unclear whether they received waivers letting them work on these issues or recused themselves from issues affecting their former employers. But under Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, Ms. Knight should probably be barred for two years from participating in decisions that would affect the fiduciary rule.Such potential conflicts are showing up across the federal government.A T.S.A. spokesman agreed to arrange an interview with Mr. Wolf \u2014 who worked at the agency during the Bush administration before becoming a lobbyist \u2014 but canceled it when told about the topic in detail.\u201cI\u2019m afraid Mr. Wolf isn\u2019t going to have any available time in his schedule today,\u201d said Mike England, the spokesman, who then declined several follow-up requests over a one-week period. He later added, in a statement, that Mr. Wolf\u2019s \u201cduties have not required a waiver\u201d of the ethics standards Mr. Trump adopted in January, although Mr. England would not discuss the matter further.The Department of Health and Human Services has become another source of potential conflicts.The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for a comment.Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, said the sheer number of potential conflicts \u2014 which will require recusals, necessitate waivers or result in violations of the ethics rule \u2014 is disturbing, particularly given the secretive approach the administration is taking on the issue.\u201cThis is not a matter of just checking a box \u2014 this is about protecting the integrity of the operation of federal government,\u201d Ms. Brian said. \u201cBut our worst fears are coming true: We know people coming in who have conflicts, and we cannot see what restrictions they are under, if any.\u201dThe result, she predicted, might serve no one particularly well. Even if the rules are enforced, so many senior officials will be required to recuse themselves that \u201cthey will have a hard time getting their job done.\u201dSarah Cohen from The New York Times and Justin Elliott and Derek Kravitz from ProPublica contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexican Deportees, Once Ignored Back Home, Now Find \u2018Open Arms\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s president dashed to the airport to greet a planeload of deportees. The education minister rushed to the Texas border to meet Mexicans being kicked out of the United States. Mexico City\u2019s labor secretary is urging companies to hire migrants who abruptly find themselves sent back home.\u201cUnlike what\u2019s happening in the United States, this is your home,\u201d the labor secretary, Amalia Garc\u00eda, told deportees in the audience at a recent event for the city\u2019s jobs programs.For years, as the Obama administration sent back thousands of Mexicans each week \u2014 more than two million altogether \u2014 Mexico\u2019s establishment barely reacted. All but invisible, the deportees were left to cope on their own with divided families, uncertain job prospects and the poverty that had pushed so many north in the first place.\u201cWe have something to thank President Trump for, which is this sudden awakening to this reality that we were kind of ignoring,\u201d said Cecilia Soto, a legislator who met recently with migrants in Chicago and Los Angeles.\u201cWe gave lip service to the migrants\u201d in the past, she added, and now \u201cyou have a sector of society that is really moved by this reality and trying to do things.\u201dBut to some, the sudden rise in concern for migrants feels like political opportunism, taking advantage of the public fury over Mr. Trump before Mexico\u2019s elections next year.\u201cIt\u2019s promotional. It\u2019s really self-serving,\u201d said Nancy Landa, 36, who was pulled over by immigration agents in Los Angeles one morning in 2009 and, after 20 years in the United States, dumped across the border in Tijuana before nightfall \u2014 with only a cellphone and $20.\u201cElections are coming in 2018, and if migration continues to be an issue, they\u2019re going to use migrants as a political flag,\u201d she added.According to statistics from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, the number of Mexican citizens deported from the United States in the first three months of 2017 dropped by nearly 20 percent from a year earlier.The Mexican government\u2019s statistics also show a slowdown in Mexican citizens being kicked out of the United States during January and February, with fewer deportations in those months than during any month last year. (March figures were not yet available.)The number of deportations often fluctuates considerably from month to month, for a variety of reasons, and an official with the American immigration enforcement agency cautioned against drawing any firm conclusions from the recent decline.The cause of deportees \u201chas very few costs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a noble cause\u201d in the eyes of most Mexicans.Even businesses, which have long shied away from hiring deportees out of fear they were criminals or would be more assertive about their labor rights, are changing their attitudes. Ms. Garc\u00eda, the Mexico City labor secretary, said Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive language about Mexicans \u201chas paradoxically been generating a lot of solidarity to incorporate migrants.\u201dAlong with the surge in attention has come some tangible assistance, like additional money to help undocumented immigrants in the United States with legal issues.Mexico City and several states are welcoming deportees by easing their way into social programs like public health insurance or small loans to start businesses. The western state of Jalisco is adding services to cut through bureaucracy, certify skills and encourage companies to hire migrants.And lawmakers in Congress pushed through a measure to simplify school enrollment for American-born children.When signing the legislation last month, Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, said of the migrants, \u201cAs a society and as a country, we have the ethical and moral duty to receive them with open arms, to treat them with affection, respect and dignity.\u201dMany deported migrants fall into a vacuum when they return, with no connections, no work history, no home, no papers. They often face a social stigma. A federal government program, Somos Mexicanos or We Are Mexicans, offers to link deportees with public services and job banks, but advocates say its scope is limited.\u201cMexican society has to open itself up to the fact that they are from the same country,\u201d said Claudia Masferrer, a migration expert at the Colegio de M\u00e9xico. \u201cMexico has no integration policy.\u201dRen\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez, who returned to Mexico last year after two decades in the United States, has started over with a truck, a workshop and new tools he bought with a loan of about $2,600 from the Mexico City government.\u201cIf we could do it there, we can do it here,\u201d Mr. \u00c1lvarez said at the jobs event in Mexico City, surrounded by the mayor and other dignitaries.Mr. \u00c1lvarez, 46, had built a construction business, bought a house and raised four daughters in Georgia.

But he eventually became a target of the authorities, partly because his public displays of wealth came even as his company fell behind on salary payments to staff.Often likened to the British entrepreneur Richard Branson, Mr. Mallya, 61, turned what had been a family brewing business into a sprawling conglomerate. He now owns the United Breweries Group, which makes Kingfisher beer and distributes a wide variety of products, including alcohol, chemicals and fertilizer. He also has a stake in India\u2019s only Formula One car racing team, Force India.He was a frequent presence on the party scene, drawing attention in particular for a birthday party a decade ago that featured Lionel Richie as the headline act. Attendees at Mr. Mallya\u2019s 60th birthday party, held at his villa in the coastal Indian state of Goa, included the singer Enrique Iglesias, Bollywood stars and top Indian businessmen.But his outsize ambitions proved to be his downfall.In 2003, Mr. Mallya established an airline, with plans to expand internationally and shift from an all-economy-class model to add a luxurious business class. He made a splash at the Paris Air Show in 2007 with a $7 billion order for 50 Airbus planes.The airline promised meals even on short-haul flights, and curbside valets. Its flight attendants wore the bright red uniforms used by staff members on Mr. Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic.But Kingfisher Airlines struggled in a competitive domestic market. Over time, it was left with a ragtag collection of aging and inefficient planes. By 2012, after persuading lenders to restructure its debt, it ceased operations in the face of high fuel prices and a global slowdown.The airline owed more than $1 billion in loans, as well as other bills, including back pay to former employees. Because Mr. Mallya himself, and the United Breweries Group, had backed some of the loans, creditors chased them for repayment.As the dispute went through the courts, banks tried to seize Mr. Mallya\u2019s assets. Indian authorities raided his homes and offices in Mumbai, Bangalore and Goa in 2015.He left for Britain in March 2016, but India canceled his passport the next month, after a court in Mumbai issued a warrant for his arrest. India sent Britain an official request for Mr. Mallya\u2019s extradition on Feb. 8.Mr. Mallya appeared at a London court and was then released on bail, according to Dinesh K. Patnaik, India\u2019s deputy high commissioner in London. Mr. Mallya is scheduled to appear for another hearing next month.\u201cThe willingness of the U.K. government in bringing him to justice is something we are appreciative of,\u201d Mr. Patnaik said.According to the British Home Office, arrest warrants are issued in response to extradition requests only if such requests are certified by officials and then sent to a court for the warrant to be issued.If the judge in Mr. Mallya\u2019s extradition hearing approves the request for him to be sent back to India, then it is sent to Britain\u2019s home secretary for final approval.Mr. Mallya dismissed the news as \u201cmedia hype,\u201d but he confirmed on Twitter that an extradition hearing began on Tuesday.\u201cI did not flee from India and neither am I an absconder,\u201d he added. \u201cRubbish.\u201dSantosh Kumar Gangwar, an Indian finance minister, told reporters that the country\u2019s authorities were \u201cascertaining the facts\u201d about Mr. Mallya and \u201ctrying to find out how to bring him back to our country and start legal proceedings against him.\u201d\u201cWe will not spare him legally,\u201d Mr. Gangwar said.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Kingfisher Airlines was founded. It was established in 2003, not after the 2008 global financial crisis. (An earlier version of this correction misstated the year that Kingfisher was founded. It was 2003, not 2005.)Amie Tsang reported from London, and Hari Kumar from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

Lured by the assurances of safety and promises of profit, investors have plowed their savings into the products.But many of the investments have focused on coal, steel and real estate \u2014 areas that are facing overcapacity problems in China. As those areas show signs of trouble, the worry is that many of the investments could fail, creating a major shock to the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second-largest, after the United States\u2019.The products, which are often kept off banks\u2019 balance sheets, are part of a vast, shadowy system of lending that has girded the Chinese economy and kept businesses growing. The Chinese government has stepped in to protect investors, avert ripple effects and ensure social stability.But those bailouts create their own challenges. Investors, assured that the government will come to the rescue, do not worry about the potential risks and continue to pour money into the products. According to the state news media, Chinese investors have put $4.4 trillion into wealth management products, equivalent to about 40 percent of the country\u2019s annual economic output.\u201cIt invites moral hazard,\u201d said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, who specializes in the politics of Chinese banking policies. \u201cWhen you tell people that they will get bailed out, then they will engage in very, very risky behavior and also opportunistic behavior on the part of the banks.\u201dChina Minsheng, the bank at the heart of the latest scandal, had a good pitch.The product, it told investors, would provide a return of 8 percent to 27 percent. To sweeten the deal, the bank offered free golf events and trips to South Africa and other overseas locales.Encouraged by the bank\u2019s strong reputation, investors, including many older people, forked over a minimum of $145,000. \u201cMy fund manager stressed again and again that there is no risk,\u201d said Ms. Wang, the investor.Investors gathered at the bank on Wednesday, pushing for the bank to make good. \u201cWe\u2019re not going home if you don\u2019t return us our money,\u201d one of them shouted.Such protests are a big concern for the government. Chinese investors, who often display a herd mentality, could dump the products once bad news spreads. If investors suddenly demand their money back, it could create a liquidity crunch, putting significant pressure on the economy. To avoid that situation, the government has generally acted quickly to repay investors when problems have surfaced.Along with wealth management products from banks, online lenders are jumping into the game, adding to the risks. Last year, Chinese authorities said an online finance company had bilked investors out of more than $7.6 billion in what they said was a huge Ponzi scheme.The scandal at China Minsheng reflects \u201cthe lack of internal controls\u201d at the bank, said Wei Jiyao, an analyst at PY Standard, a research company based in Chengdu, China, that tracks wealth management products. Mr. Wei predicted that regulators would probably respond by trying to tighten their control over the products.While regulators have pledged to increase oversight of the industry, experts say that many banks have found ways to circumvent the rules.Christopher Balding, an associate professor of finance at Peking University HSBC Business School in Shenzhen, China, said he had not seen any indication that the authorities would seriously rein in wealth management products, even though \u201cintellectually, they want to.\u201dMr. Balding pointed in particular to a Communist Party congress scheduled for the fall, when a big leadership shake-up is expected and when the government prizes social stability above all else.\u201cThey are kind of like a dieter on Jan. 15 who says, \u2018It\u2019s going to be so hard for me to get out of bed and go and exercise,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut are they willing to get out of bed every morning and give up that cookie at lunch?\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Think New York Transit Is Bad? Just Wait", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsIn the past few weeks, commuters in New York and New Jersey have been dealing with the chaos caused by the derailments of an Amtrak train and a New Jersey Transit train in New York\u2019s Penn Station. While the accidents themselves were minor, by closing down tracks, they provided a stark preview for what life could soon be like if we don\u2019t follow through with critical investments to improve our infrastructure.Alarmingly, if we don\u2019t act soon to repair the two tunnels under the Hudson River, that same reduction in service our region experienced last week will become a permanent reality.The current tunnels under the Hudson River were built in 1908 and are rapidly deteriorating. This problem was exacerbated by Hurricane Sandy, which filled the tunnels with corrosive salt water, and engineers now estimate that without major overhauls the tunnels are likely to fail within the next 10 years. The closing of either tunnel would be devastating because it would essentially shut down the Northeast Corridor, the transit route from Boston to Washington that produces over $3 trillion in economic output \u2014 a full 20 percent of the national gross domestic product.Decades ago, New York lost one of its grand entryways. What if a new one were hiding in plain sight?Over the last year and a half Amtrak, along with New York and New Jersey, has been advancing a project called Gateway that would address this impending crisis. Gateway would update and increase the number of tracks at Penn Station and build a new tunnel under the Hudson River. That new tunnel would allow the existing tunnels to be closed and repaired, and after the completion of both projects, train service into New York would be doubled.Last year the federal government, along with New York and New Jersey, agreed to split the cost of Gateway evenly, and engineering and permitting are now underway; construction on the next phase was set to begin later this year. But in his budget proposal, President Trump proposed slashing the two funding sources \u2014 federal transit dollars and Amtrak \u2014 that are the key to building Gateway and the new tunnel.Time is running out to replace the existing crumbling tunnels, and our region cannot afford setbacks to this project like the one President Trump\u2019s budget would impose. Over the past few weeks Penn Station commuters have gotten a taste of what it will be like if just one of those tunnels fails before the new tunnel is constructed.The Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit and Amtrak were all forced to cancel trains. As a result of the first derailment alone, over 300,000 New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road passengers were delayed, and the second caused eight of the 21 tracks under Penn Station to be shut down for days. Our regional economy paid a price: The Partnership for New York City estimates that every hour train commuters from New Jersey and Long Island are delayed costs Manhattan employers alone over $14.5 million.If an entire tunnel crumbled and needed to be closed for repair, a reality that engineers agree is closing in on our region, the suffering and delays would last well over a year.By building the new tunnel, we will have the flexibility to make the years\u2019 worth of repairs that are needed to the existing tunnels without reducing service. Additionally, once the new tunnel is done and the existing tunnels are repaired, the increased capacity will mean that even when there is a shutdown, problem or derailment, service can continue with only minor delays because trains will be able to pass the derailed or broken locomotive.Gateway is important in itself, but it is also an illustration of the country\u2019s immense need for infrastructure investments. Senate Democrats understand the challenge and have put forward a real plan to make game-changing investments across the country, including Gateway.However, despite the president\u2019s campaign rhetoric and his continued promise to deliver major infrastructure investments, to date the administration has gone the opposite direction and proposed major cuts in infrastructure spending.We\u2019ll fight to restore these funds for Gateway and other projects, increase overall investments in infrastructure and continue to work with our state and local partners to make progress on this important project. But the past two weeks should serve as a cautionary tale for what will happen if proposals like those put forth in the president\u2019s budget ever become reality. Like Scrooge meeting the Ghost of Christmas Future, transit riders were given a glimpse of the hair-pulling transit apocalypse to come if we do not make major investments in our infrastructure now.Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand are Democratic senators from New York. Robert Menendez and Cory A. Booker are Democratic senators from New Jersey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supply-Side Economics, but for Liberals", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewThe social safety net is forever at risk of becoming a hammock, to use House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s memorable metaphor.That, anyway, is an operating assumption behind much of the discussion of social welfare programs. Economists have often taken it as a given that there is an inherent trade-off in which the larger the social safety net, the fewer people will work.But what if that framing is backward? Certain social welfare policies, according to an emerging body of research, may actually encourage more people to work and enable them to do so more productively.That is the conclusion of work that aims to understand in granular detail how different government interventions affect people\u2019s behavior. It amounts to a liberal version of \u201csupply-side economics,\u201d an approach to economics often associated with the conservatives of the Reagan era.Those conservative supply-siders argued that cutting taxes would lead businesses to invest more, unleashing faster economic growth as the productive capacity of the nation increases. In the emerging liberal version, government programs enable more people to work, and to work in higher-productivity, higher-income jobs. The end result, if the research is correct, is the same: a nation that is capable of growing faster and producing more.In other areas, the relationship between public programs and higher incomes and employment rates is more indirect and takes longer to play out, but researchers are analyzing vast troves of data to detect trends.What is behind the surge of research in this vein? \u201cIt is a combination of data and time,\u201d Ms. Hoynes said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what is possible.\u201dThe advent of more advanced computer processing power has enabled social scientists to mine administrative data \u2014 actual records on individuals \u2014 instead of relying on often spotty, inconsistent surveys.But also important is that a variety of social welfare programs introduced and expanded since the 1960s have now been around long enough, often with periodic changes to their structure, to allow for an analysis of their long-term effects.None of this means that all social welfare programs result in more people working. Receiving unemployment insurance, for example, appears to make people slower to find new work, and the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Affordable Care Act will lead to fewer adults working because they can more easily obtain health care without having an employer.It also isn\u2019t an assertion that these programs pay for themselves by generating more economic growth. Something like food stamps or the E.I.T.C. can have pro-growth effects while still being costly to the government.And finally, many elements of the social safety net are justifiable purely on moral grounds, regardless of whether they increase or decrease the labor supply. The entire range of programs that benefit older adults are in place because society has judged taking care of this group to be the right thing to do, not because it might increase the nonagenarian labor force.But the emerging body of evidence on the supply-side benefits of certain programs does mean that the specific structure of a given program matter, and policy makers shouldn\u2019t take for granted that the trade-offs around the social safety net always point in the same direction.\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet in terms of having models we can feed into to say that you\u2019ll get X amount of extra G.D.P. in 20 years if you invest in people now,\u201d said Chye-Ching Huang, who studies these issues at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cBut maybe we will, as that body of evidence develops.\u201dThe United States and other advanced nations are struggling to emerge from a pattern of persistently low growth, an era when many prime-age people aren\u2019t in the labor force at all and productivity gains have been weak for years. Supplementing low-end wages through the tax code and ensuring that children have the food and education to become productive adults just may help, and that means \u201csupply-side economics\u201d isn\u2019t just for low-tax conservatives any more.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Emerging Markets Are Bouncing Back From a Six-Year Slowdown", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byAs Turkey hurtled toward one of the most politically divisive polls in its history, the country\u2019s business leaders reacted in a curious manner.They ramped up production.Ignoring terrorism threats, the yo-yoing of the Turkish currency and a president quick to pick fights with Europe, Turkish manufacturers last month reported their most buoyant month of economic activity in three years.Turkey\u2019s robust performance \u2014 exports last month were up 19 percent on an annual basis \u2014 highlights what has been a string of unusually expansive data showings by emerging markets since the beginning of the year.As the stock market in the United States takes a breather after a torrid run this year, emerging-market stocks and bonds have attracted large inflows from investors. Worries about President Trump\u2019s anti-trade statements are fading, and a weaker dollar has also helped, giving once-downtrodden currencies like the Mexican peso, the Turkish lira and the Brazilian real a lift.Stock and bond market gains in emerging markets can be fleeting, vulnerable to political turmoil and investors with short-term investment horizons. But for now, the mood is bullish.On Monday, investors bid up Turkish stocks, betting that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s referendum victory in Turkey on Sunday, giving the office of the presidency greater executive powers, would further bolster the economy. The Turkish lira, which has borne the brunt of investor fears, had one of its stronger days, gaining 2 percent against the dollar.And China said its economy, buoyed by heavy investment spending, had grown 6.9 percent, a better figure than economists had projected.Other economies considered to be emerging markets \u2014 Mexico, South Korea and Brazil \u2014 are also overcoming deterrents, like volatile currencies, political upheaval and worries of a trade crackdown by the Trump administration, to generate stronger-than-expected economic growth.This nascent boomlet follows a six-year slowdown in these once fast-growing economies.Fears that the Chinese economy would slam on the brakes, a slump in commodity prices and political scandals that hobbled countries like Brazil have taken a toll, spurring a broad exodus of global investment funds from such markets.\u201cDespite what is happening politically in mature economies, we are seeing a real broadening of growth in emerging markets,\u201d said Ulrik Bie, an economist at the Institute of International Finance, a trade group for global banks, which bumped up its growth forecasts in light of recent data. \u201cThese economies are such a large part of the global economy, so this provides a really solid foundation for overall growth.\u201dThe sources for these demand spurts have been varied.In China, import growth in volume terms, a major measure of domestic demand in the economy, was up 20 percent during the first two months of the year.Business confidence in Mexico improved sharply in March. The peso, which plunged sharply after the election of Mr. Trump, has regained all its value. For the year, the peso is up 10 percent against the dollar.And in Brazil, which is struggling to emerge from a devastating recession, the central bank slashed interest rates last week by the largest amount since 2009 in a bid to spur an economy that is revealing small, but persistent, signs of recovery.According to an index of hard and soft economic data points compiled by the Institute of International Finance, growth in emerging economies was up 6.8 percent through the first quarter this year \u2014 the model\u2019s highest reading since 2011.As an early indicator, the growth tracker\u2019s tally is by no means definitive, and it is entirely possible that the final figure for the quarter will be lower. But economists at the institute say the model is a good spotter of economic trends, and it is clearly showing a sharp pickup in global emerging markets in recent months.\u201cWe are seeing a broad uptick in business confidence and P.M.I.s in these countries,\u201d said Mr. Bie, the I.I.F. economist, referring to the purchase managers index, a gauge of private-sector manufacturing activity.The impressive trade numbers coming from China (exports grew 16 percent in March) as well as similarly robust export figures in South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia also point to a sharp recent pickup in global trade.The last few years have been poor for international commerce; fears of a China slowdown have been a major factor.But shipping executives say there has been a remarkable increase in demand for container vessels, which carry most manufactured trade goods around the globe. According to the Harpex Shipping index, which follows container pricing trends, rates have soared 40 percent this year.Economists note that container shipping is the oxygen of global growth, and for the last few years the business has been in the doldrums. Shipping prices plummeted, pushing some firms into bankruptcy and forcing many ships to be scrapped.The turnaround, coming so quickly after a bad 2016, has caught the industry by surprise.\u201cThere is definitely something going on here,\u201d said Nick Bailey, the chief commercial officer at Lomar Shipping, a container-focused shipper owned by the Libra Group. \u201cThe market from mid-last year to today has doubled.\u201dChina has been the single largest purchaser of container ships, Mr. Bailey, who is based in Singapore, said. He noted that many were being used to transport goods from hubs like Shanghai to smaller, regional ports.\u201cThis is being driven by domestic demand in China,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a big part of this growth story.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.At the same time, analysts said, China is unlikely to abandon North Korea as an ally and a strategic asset because it does not want to see a unified Korean Peninsula dominated by American troops.The Chinese reports approvingly noted that the granddaughter did a three-part performance, singing a Chinese song, \u201cJasmine,\u201d and reciting the \u201cThree Character Classic\u201d and some Tang poetry.Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Xi\u2019s invitation to visit China at an \u201cearly date,\u201d the state-run news agency Xinhua reported, a gesture that showed the two men had established the rapport that the Chinese leader was seeking to show his people at home.Then after dinner, with Mr. Xi safely back at his nearby hotel, Mr. Trump stepped to a podium to announce the strikes, making comments punctuated with emotional descriptions of the children killed by the Syrian government\u2019s chemical weapons attack.Mr. Trump informed Mr. Xi of the attack during dinner, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said in remarks to the news media on Friday afternoon.At the Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Friday, the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, noted China\u2019s opposition to the use of chemical weapons and added that it was necessary to seek a political solution in Syria. \u201cIt is imperative to prevent the further deterioration of the situation,\u201d she said.China has maintained a longstanding policy opposing unilateral military action. But Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to order the strikes at the very moment Mr. Xi was visiting inevitably put the focus on North Korea.In an interview last weekend before the talks with Mr. Xi, Mr. Trump told The Financial Times that he was prepared to take unilateral action against North Korea if China did not cooperate with the American goal of curbing the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program. Mr. Trump did not specify what kind of action he was considering.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s action against Syria in the middle of Mr. Xi\u2019s visit, there was not an exact parallel between Syria and North Korea, said Jin Qiangyi, director of the Center for North and South Korea Studies at Yanbian University in Jilin Province, which borders North Korea.Syria does not possess the capacity to hit back after the missile strikes, but North Korea, with its arsenal of weaponry and its nuclear program, does, Mr. Jin said.\u201cThe North\u2019s nuclear capacity has reached such a level that any unilateral action from the U.S. would be extremely difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Americans have been saying a lot recently about attacking North Korea, but it is us who will be suffering from the consequences.\u201dThe northeast area of China where Mr. Jin teaches has become increasingly fearful of radiation leaks from North Korea\u2019s nuclear operations. An attack by the United States would be \u201ccatastrophic for the region,\u201d he said.Another consequence for China of the Syrian attack could be an increase in the disaffection for North Korea among the population, and among those in the government and think tanks that consider the North a strategic liability.Beijing believes that the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, is insurance against a unified Korean Peninsula dominated by the American military.But a quiet debate has grown inside the Chinese government over the wisdom of hanging onto North Korea, an increasingly troublesome ally that functions because of China\u2019s largess.China supplies North Korea with almost all of the oil needed to keep its bare-bones economy afloat, and 90 percent of North Korean trade passes through China. Some Chinese companies trade with North Korea in contravention of United Nations sanctions.The White House is trying to persuade China that its support for the North is counterproductive, an argument that Mr. Trump was prepared to make to Mr. Xi during their talks, a senior administration official told reporters before the meeting.The Syrian strike could serve to make that point, but it would not be definitive in changing China\u2019s strategic thinking, said Andrei Lankov, a historian of North Korea who visits China.\u201cYes, North Korea is a liability for China,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the real world, the status quo is the least unpleasant option.\u201dIf the talks with Mr. Trump on Friday go badly, Mr. Xi will be able to use the Syrian airstrikes against the American president by telling the Chinese people that they were the action of a weak leader, some Chinese analysts said.\u201cTrump is frustrated with his own critics,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University. \u201cThis airstrike was a defensive measure to deal with criticism against him.

In the short run, such a plan would add many billions of dollars to the national deficit. Mr. Trump contends that it will be worth it in the long run.\u201cThe tax plan will pay for itself with economic growth,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary and main architect of the plan, told reporters this week.The scope of the president\u2019s plan, as it has leaked out in recent days, has excited the markets even as it has worried fiscal hawks. If this feels like a familiar debate, it is because it has played out repeatedly in the past four decades as the dominant Republican orthodoxy shifted from deficit reduction to tax cuts.Mr. Mnuchin argues that an ambitious tax cut would unleash businesses that now feel constrained by one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. Corporations would be freed to build plants and create jobs in the United States instead of in foreign countries, and would bring home money that currently is sheltered overseas.While a corporate tax rate cut of the dimension Mr. Trump envisions would reduce tax revenues by more than $2 trillion over the next 10 years, Mr. Mnuchin noted that an increase in economic growth of a little more than one percentage point would generate close to the same amount. The goal, he said, was to produce a sustained national growth rate of 3 percent, instead of the 1.8 percent now projected over the next decade. That would not include the cost of personal income tax cuts.The question comes down to how the effect of a tax cut is measured. Under what is called static scoring, changes are judged without assuming any difference in growth. Under what is called dynamic scoring, assumptions are made about how much growth will change. \u201cUnder dynamic scoring, this will pay for itself,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said at a public forum last weekend. \u201cUnder static scoring, there will be short-term issues.\u201dCritics scoffed at the math. \u201cThere is not a shred of evidence to support the secretary\u2019s pay-for-itself claim,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a top White House economics adviser under Mr. Obama. \u201cSure, significantly faster growth would spin off more revenues. But there\u2019s simply no empirical linkage between tax cuts and growth that\u2019s both a lot faster and sustained.\u201dN. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard University economist who was chairman of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under the younger Mr. Bush, said tax cut supporters exaggerate the possible growth benefits while opponents overemphasize the budgetary cost. \u201cA reasonable rule of thumb, in my judgment, is that about one-third of the cost of tax cuts is recouped via faster economic growth,\u201d he said.One-third, of course, is not the same as fully paid for, which is one reason some Republicans on Capitol Hill are concerned. \u201cI certainly want to see corporate taxes decreased,\u201d Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, said on CNN. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we can go down to 15 percent.\u201dThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing deficits, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan was more likely to increase growth by 0.2 percentage points than by the higher estimates Mr. Mnuchin forecast. \u201cThese tax cuts, of course, would not pay for themselves,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cAs we\u2019ve explained before, there is little evidence to suggest any major tax cut could pay for itself with economic growth alone.\u201dBut one fan of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach is Mr. Laffer, now 76 and still every bit the believer in the virtues of lower taxes as he was the night he went to a restaurant in 1974 with three fellow conservatives named Dick Cheney, Donald H. Rumsfeld and Jude Wanniski and outlined his thinking on that famous napkin.He said that he would urge Mr. Trump to close loopholes and eliminate tax shelters as he slashed rates, but that even without doing so, a corporate tax rate cut would generate cascades of tax revenue. The businesses themselves would no longer look for ways to avoid paying, and so report more of their income.\u201cWe would bring people back and we would create jobs without tariffs and without protectionism,\u201d Mr. Laffer said by telephone. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in using honey rather than vinegar, and incentives are much better. I think it would be a flood of businesses coming back in short order, and it would stop inversions\u201d \u2014 when companies move overseas for tax reasons.He also said greater economic activity would increase revenues from other taxes, including those on personal income and sales. Moreover, he said, with more jobs would come lower expenses for welfare.\u201cIt\u2019s a slam dunk,\u201d Mr. Laffer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201dPolitically, at least. He noted that both Mr. Reagan and the second Mr. Bush won re-election.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misattributed the passage beginning with the quotation, \u201cWe would bring people back and we would create jobs without tariffs and without protectionism,\u201d and concluding with the quotation, \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201d The remarks were made by Arthur Laffer, not Jude Wanniski.Follow Peter Baker at @peterbakernytAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Arkansas Community Looks for an Execution to End Its Ache", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported bySTAR CITY, Ark. \u2014 James Hawkins, the affable local coroner, has long performed a grim duty on execution nights: He pronounces the deaths of the condemned prisoners. He has done it more than two dozen times.Mr. Hawkins declared another man dead on Thursday night, when Arkansas executed its fourth prisoner in seven days. Seventeen years after pronouncing the death of a murder victim and family friend, Cecil Boren, Mr. Hawkins did the same for Mr. Boren\u2019s killer, Kenneth D. Williams.\u201cIt\u2019s a satisfying moment,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said in an interview at a funeral home in this largely rural patch of southeast Arkansas, where prisons and produce are about all that power the local economy. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard nonstop in this community \u2014 this entire community \u2014 is: \u2018This is the one we\u2019re waiting on.\u2019\u201dMr. Williams was executed at 11:05 p.m. after the United States Supreme Court rejected an appeal from his lawyers, who sought to block the execution on the grounds that their client was intellectually disabled and ineligible for the death penalty. Prison officials said that he requested holy communion as his last meal.The death chamber in nearby Varner is Arkansas\u2019s ultimate clearinghouse for capital cases, the site of all of the state\u2019s executions in the modern era of the American death penalty. The area is one of the country\u2019s sparsely populated death chamber locales, places of peculiar notoriety whose very names can be statewide shorthand for capital punishment and hard prison time: Angola, La.; Parchman, Miss.; Raiford, Fla.\u201cI personally know part of the Boren family, and, of course, naturally we empathize with them,\u201d said Charles R. Knight, the mayor of nearby Grady, where the city limits end just a few miles from prison watchtowers. \u201cBut we empathize for all of the families involved, and being Christian, we also empathize with the inmates as well. From my standpoint, I look at it as, this is the law, this is what the law has allotted and this is what we do.\u201dThe state built its death chamber in 1978, and Mr. Williams was born the next year. In 1998, he emptied a revolver after a robbery in neighboring Jefferson County, killing a 19-year-old woman, Dominique Nicole Hurd. When Mr. Williams was spared the death penalty and sentenced to life in prison, he mocked Ms. Hurd\u2019s relatives, turning to them and saying, \u201cYou thought I was going to die, didn\u2019t you?\u201dHe was sent to Cummins and, weeks after his arrival, escaped by hiding inside a 500-gallon tank that was brimming with hog slop. Mr. Boren was in his yard, working while his wife was at church, when Mr. Williams arrived. The fugitive entered the house, stole one of Mr. Boren\u2019s guns, shot him seven times, seized his victim\u2019s wallet and drove off in his truck.Eight Arkansas inmates have filed multiple lawsuits to halt their executions, which had been scheduled to occur in a span of 10 days this month.In Missouri the next day, Mr. Williams led the police on a high-speed pursuit that ended when he struck a water truck, killing its driver. Sentenced to death for Mr. Boren\u2019s murder, Mr. Williams later wrote a letter to The Pine Bluff Commercial, an Arkansas newspaper, and confessed to another killing that had been unsolved.\u201cI don\u2019t want to make any excuses or shift the blame,\u201d Mr. Williams said in the 2005 letter. \u201cI just want to be honest and accept responsibility for my actions.\u201dThe confession, as well as Mr. Williams\u2019s professed religious transformation, had no discernible effect on the Arkansas Parole Board, which ruled this month that his application for clemency was \u201cwithout merit.\u201dThe daughter of Michael Greenwood, the man killed during the pursuit in Missouri, urged Gov. Asa Hutchinson to stop the execution. \u201cWe are in no way asking you to ignore the pain felt by the victims of Mr. Williams\u2019s other crimes,\u201d Kayla Greenwood wrote in a letter this week. \u201cWe know what they are going through, but ours is a pain that we have decided not to try and cure by seeking an execution.\u201dAt Carla\u2019s Cafe, a lunch spot in Star City, the county seat, that was just fine. On Wednesday afternoon, when grilled pork chop was a lunch special, residents expressed little concern for Mr. Williams, whose lawyers argue he is intellectually disabled.\u201cWhen they apprehended him in Missouri, they should have shot him down and killed that sucker,\u201d Wayne Harmon, 66, said.But the police did not, so people like Mr. Harmon were left to worry that some court somewhere would step in to save Mr. Williams\u2019s life days before the expiration of one of Arkansas\u2019s lethal injection drugs.\u201cWe\u2019ve got some of the sorriest judges, leaders and men,\u201d Ed Hardin, 73, said. \u201cI got tickled the other night when the governor said this was the hardest thing he had to do. Hell, if you can\u2019t be no better governor than that, you don\u2019t need to be governor.\u201dIn hotels and in restaurants, in the governor\u2019s mansion and on Main Streets, the executions in Arkansas have occupied a large segment of conversation. Residents have debated execution methods \u2014 electrocution is still enshrined in Arkansas law as a future possibility \u2014 and analyzed last meals. Some here have committed details of the crimes to memory and recalled executions even before Mr. Hawkins\u2019s tenure as coroner, which began in 1991. Facebook feeds have been filled with posts about \u2014 and pleas for \u2014 the state\u2019s original plan to put eight men to death this month. (Four of the executions have been postponed indefinitely.)Polling suggests that more than 70 percent of the state\u2019s residents support the death penalty, but, because of drug supply issues, it is not clear when Arkansas will be able to put anyone to death again.In this area, people welcomed the fact that Mr. Williams died just before the expected onset of an informal moratorium.Emotions here are rarely so vivid for executions at Cummins, but, Mr. Hawkins noted, \u201cWhen it hits your home, it\u2019s a little different.\u201dMr. Boren\u2019s widow declined to be interviewed. Her family opposed clemency for Mr. Williams.Vickie Williams, Ms. Hurd\u2019s mother and no relation to Mr. Williams, said her daughter had ambitions of being a neonatologist as a biology and premedical student at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, where she was known as Nicky. Ms. Williams said she did not plan to attend the execution, but she supported it.\u201cHe did not receive the death penalty for killing Nicky,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cIf proper justice was served, others may not have lost their lives. The justice system is very confusing. Everyone has rights except for the families of victims.\u201dRodney Kennedy, a local resident, said Mr. Williams cut across his parents\u2019 1,500-acre property after he fled from Cummins.\u201cI think they\u2019re doing the right thing executing him,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cHe could always escape again and kill again.\u201dAfter the execution, Mr. Boren\u2019s daughter, Jodie Efird, said her mother\u2019s \u201cpeace will come later.\u201d\u201cHer peace will come every time we\u2019re driving down this road,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not here anymore.\u201dAlan Blinder reported from Star City, and Manny Fernandez from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Can\u2019t-Do Record", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byWell, heck, who said Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to accomplish anything in his first 100 days? All of a sudden there\u2019s a one-page tax plan and a raft of deal-making, while the Senate was bused over to the White House grounds for a briefing on North Korea.Maybe the president believes that when you can make an entire chamber of Congress ride around like so many tour groups, the world will understand that you\u2019re a can-do kind of guy.Trump wasn\u2019t actually in public for any of this. Outside of congratulating the National Teachers of the Year, the man himself was in sight only for events in which he announced that a cabinet member had been directed to look into something.On Day 97, Trump first appeared before the cameras to tell us the secretary of the interior is going to review previous presidents\u2019 habit of saving federal lands from development. Federal land, Trump reminded the audience, \u201cbelongs to all of us.\u201d He then called for turning it over to the states.His recent predecessors have tried to defend places like a gorgeous section of Utah called Grand Staircase-Escalante by declaring them national monuments. You can do that because of a law called the Antiquities Act that goes back to Theodore Roosevelt. Republicans love to brag about Theodore Roosevelt, except when he was protecting the wilderness.People, I want a show of hands: How many of you would like to see coal mining at the Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument? I thought so.Trump, who took only one question, seemed extremely proud of himself when he announced this new study-the-issue initiative. Other politicians, he confided, were always telling him: \u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing. I don\u2019t know if I would have had the courage to do some of these things.\u201dSecond show of hands: How many of you think politicians are actually telling the president that if they were in his shoes they\u2019d be too chicken to favor the energy industry over environmental protection programs? I know they can be craven, but really.Everybody knows that Trump wants a can-do record when he hits Day 100 on Saturday. To get there, he appeared to be adopting the garb of Somewhat Normal Republican (SNORE). The House leaders were working out an agreement with conservatives on health care, tossing people with pre-existing ailments over the rail. The administration seemed ready to make a deal with Democrats to keep the government running. And his new tax plan is almost identical to the approach his recent Republican predecessors have taken, which is basically to cut the heck out of revenue and to hell with the deficit.\u201cThe tax plan will pay for itself with economic growth,\u201d said Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin.The idea that huge tax cuts will gin up the economy so much that everything will balance out is a beloved fairy tale. It can be found in the same book as \u201cThe Beauty Starves the Beast,\u201d which tells the saga of a handsome prince who cut down a thicket of taxes, and was saved from a witch\u2019s curse when Congress arrived with matching cuts in spending.The president was not around for the news conference in which his plan was revealed, in the form of a super-short press release. (The description of how the administration wants to help families with child care costs was, in total, \u201cproviding tax relief.\u201d)For a man who loves drama, Trump\u2019s domestic role lately has been super undramatic. While the senators were getting off their buses, Trump went before the cameras to announce that he\u2019s directed the secretary of education to investigate whether there are too many federal regulations of public schools.We can already guess where this one is going, so there wasn\u2019t a lot of suspense \u2014 the high point of the event was his introduction of the new governor of Alabama, who had arrived at her office through the time-honored method of waiting for her superior to get driven out of office in a sex scandal.It\u2019s a bit ironic that Trump makes such a show of directing his cabinet members to do things when the administration hasn\u2019t gotten around to nominating their top staff. Do you think Mnuchin would have had a longer tax description to hand out if he had an assistant secretary for tax policy?This is going on all over the government. But then who needs an ambassador in Afghanistan or South Korea?The Democrats, meanwhile, are gearing up for battle on the tax cuts \u2014 once they figure out exactly what they are. The super-easy response is just to say that before Trump asks Congress to do anything, he should show us his taxes. This came up at the press conference, and Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin\u2019s response was approximately the same as if someone suggested his boss might want to disembowel puppies.\u201cThe president has released plenty of information and I think has given more financial disclosure than anybody else,\u201d he said quickly and with deep inaccuracy.SNORE.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snarled Commutes, Squabbling Agencies and Amtrak\u2019s Penn Station Responsibilities", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byCommuters from the East End of Long Island to the western edge of New Jersey suffered a transportation meltdown and four days of upheaval last week \u2014 all because of the faulty maintenance of a federal railroad they may never ride.Amtrak accepted blame for the minor train derailment that forced cancellations and disrupted tens of thousands of commuters last week. That admission only exacerbated the frustration of the slogging hordes, reminding them just how deeply the New York City area depends on a network of transit agencies that do not always work as a team.The disruption highlighted an entrenched problem in the New York metropolitan area: The task of moving people around the most congested corner of the United States is divided among several autonomous agencies, each with its own priorities \u2014 and interests that often clash.As a result, in a region where the highways, bridges, tunnels, trains and subways are packed, even a minor accident like the one at Penn Station can reverberate far and wide \u2014 in this case, all the way to Washington.Once a jewel of the nation\u2019s transportation network, Penn Station, North America\u2019s busiest rail terminal, is now the overburdened nexus of two of the country\u2019s biggest commuter railroads and its only viable intercity train service. Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road combine to push and pull half a million people through the station\u2019s aging infrastructure every weekday.But when something breaks, it falls to Amtrak, which owns and operates the station, to perform triage, deciding how to spread the pain among the customers of the three railroads. The agencies must then seek any help they can arrange. Last week, New Jersey Transit enlisted PATH trains, operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and New York Waterway ferries, run by a private company, to carry displaced riders across the Hudson River.The diffuse nature of the transportation system occasionally causes sniping among agencies, which was precisely what happened last week. Both the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit publicly vented about Amtrak. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey went further, threatening to withhold payments to Amtrak and calling for a congressional hearing.\u201cThey\u2019re the landlord,\u201d Mr. Christie said of Amtrak. \u201cThey\u2019re the owner of the rails, and they need to make sure they\u2019re safe for our people to travel on them.\u201dPenn Station\u2019s 21 tracks are chock-full during rush hours, so when several are unavailable, dozens of scheduled trains must be canceled. That was why the derailment of a New Jersey Transit train near the Hudson River on Monday morning, which knocked out eight tracks, was still disrupting the routines of riders from Long Island on Friday.As the traffic controller, Amtrak has to coordinate with the commuter railroads, explaining the effects of an episode like Monday\u2019s derailment, said Charles W. Moorman, the chief executive of Amtrak.\u201cWe then have to go through and say, \u2018O.K., here is the new capacity of the station,\u2019 and then try to allocate it so people understand this is what we can get into the station today,\u201d Mr. Moorman said in an interview.He said Amtrak notified other local and state agencies, too. But the derailment also exposed another complication in the region\u2019s transportation system: While New York City relies on the rail system to carry a sizable portion of its work force, it has little say over how that system operates.\u201cThe city has an enormous vested interest,\u201d said Thomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group that has been calling for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River for over 20 years. \u201cEvery property owner, every employee, every resident in New York has an enormous stake in this system working because the city\u2019s economy depends on it.\u201dThe Partnership for New York City, which represents the interests of the city\u2019s biggest private companies, estimates that it costs Manhattan employers $14.5 million for every hour that train commuters from New Jersey and Long Island are delayed, said its president and chief executive, Kathryn S. Wylde. For some companies, such as Guardian Life, whose headquarters are in Lower Manhattan, more than half their employees travel from New Jersey and Long Island.\u201cPenn Station is a symbol of the failure of America to keep up with the escalating demands on urban public transportation, as cities have become much bigger and more important as global economic hubs,\u201d Ms. Wylde said.She said large employers in New York were frustrated by the exclusion of private investment to help improve the city\u2019s transportation infrastructure.\u201cOur competitor cities in Europe, Asia and Australia generally have modern systems and equipment, largely designed, built and managed through public-private partnerships,\u201d Ms. Wylde said. \u201cThe frustration of the business community is not over which governmental units are running the railroad, but the missed opportunity to tap the private sector to create systems that can measure up to 21st-century expectations.\u201dMr. Wright said the patchwork response to the recent disruptions offered a glimpse of what life in the region might be like if one of the 110-year-old rail tunnels under the Hudson had to shut down. And the question is no longer \u201cif,\u201d but \u201cwhen.\u201dAmtrak officials have warned that the damage to those two single-track tubes from Hurricane Sandy will eventually force Amtrak to close off one for repairs. When that happens, the number of commuter trains crossing the river at peak travel times will decline by 75 percent, a potentially crippling blow to the regional economy, they said.The loss of that many trains would drive commuters to try crossing in buses or cars, on ferries or on PATH. Last week, New York Waterway added boats to its routes out of Hoboken and PATH honored New Jersey Transit passes, the costs to be recouped later from the railroad.The Port Authority said the PATH system, which connects to Manhattan from Hoboken, Jersey City and Newark, carried an additional 55,000 riders per day from Monday through Thursday. That surge of more than 20 percent overwhelmed some PATH station entrances and platforms. At Hoboken Terminal, the police blocked off a main entrance to the PATH station.\u201cIt\u2019s just a nightmare,\u201d Mr. Wright said, after a fourth day of protracted commutes from his New Jersey home. \u201cThis is simply a harbinger of what\u2019s going to be coming more and more. It\u2019s still not what fully would happen if cracks start appearing in the Hudson tunnels.\u201dAnd given the fragmented nature of the region\u2019s transportation network, perhaps the only viable solution is Amtrak\u2019s Gateway project, which would include new rail tunnels between New Jersey and Penn Station. Mr. Wright said the corporation created to manage Gateway should have the power to take private property, override zoning rules and maybe even impose taxes on businesses that would benefit from the project.As a model, he cited the Crossrail project in London, a network of rail tunnels being built by a corporation financed by the British government, the City of London, and taxes and fees assessed on businesses and property owners. After more than 25 years of planning, Crossrail is scheduled to start providing new service this year.But until Gateway is completed \u2014 if it ever is completed \u2014 more than 200,000 daily commuters will continue to rely on Penn Station, its 21 tracks and Amtrak\u2019s stewardship.Mr. Moorman said he believed that Amtrak was the right agency to manage the daily crush at the station.\u201cWe\u2019re the appropriate party to make the right judgments to balance out the needs of everyone else,\u201d Mr. Moorman said.He said he planned to convene officials from all of the agencies that use Penn Station and \u201chammer out\u201d their priorities. \u201cI think we all can and will and should work together,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s in all of our best interests to work together.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind the Comparison of Zuma\u2019s South Africa and Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorJOHANNESBURG \u2014 \u201cHeh, you people, you used to laugh at us. Look at you now. You can\u2019t even buy a bottle of Coke!\u201dIt was the early 2000s, during the economic free-fall that had followed Zimbabwe\u2019s Fast Track Land Reform program, which began 20 years after the country had won its political independence from Ian Smith\u2019s settler colonial regime. My parents were visiting Zambia from South Africa and in the town of Livingstone met a woman who, upon discovering that they were Zimbabwean, could not hide her schadenfreude.She recalled the period in the late 1980s when Zambians had flocked to Zimbabwe to buy basic goods with Zambian bank notes that had lost much of their former value, thanks to hyperinflation and economic instability caused by a series of so-called structural adjustment programs. Zimbabweans, she wanted my parents to know, were not so special, after all \u2014 and now Zimbabwe was doomed to the same downward economic trajectory as Zambia and other post-independence states in Southern Africa.It\u2019s an encounter I have often thought about over the years \u2014 even more so now, in the wake of the widespread protests against President Jacob Zuma in South Africa in response to the recent depreciation of the rand and the downgrading of our economy to junk status. These events were incited by the president\u2019s cabinet reshuffle, in which several key ministers lost their positions, including the finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, who was viewed as an obstacle to accessing state coffers.The official rationale for the reshuffle was that the African National Congress-led government now seeks to carry out a \u201cradical economic transformation.\u201d Though there is not much clarity about what exactly this might entail, the president has hinted at large-scale redistribution of land, an issue over which the A.N.C. has prevaricated for years.The type of political system that emerged out of Southern Africa\u2019s settler colonies was a liberal constitutionalism built on transitional power sharing brokered between \u201cmoderates\u201d from the liberation movements and the settler colonial authorities. A key feature of the historic compromise was that settler representatives handed over political control to the black majority in return for their economic interests being secured by a constitution that enshrined property rights.The foreign policy orientation of these liberal democracies reflected their reliance on Western investment and free-enterprise capitalism. The dominant settler states \u2014 Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa \u2014 all followed this model.Their newly inaugurated governments soon faced the question of whether to reform, or conform to, the historic compromises that had brought them into power. Their answer, by default, was to shelve the issue \u2014 and land restitution was sidelined. In the new economic and social order, the black political elites shifted their focus from the ousting of colonialism to development policies that often overlapped with private wealth accumulation and patronage.In this context, Zimbabwe\u2019s land redistribution program was a Rubicon moment. It struck a belated blow against the enduring economic injustices of colonialism. It also signaled a loss of faith in the ability of liberal constitutionalism to address the structural problems of inequality inherited by the post-independence state.In Zimbabwe, the redistribution of land had been delayed by the 1980 peace settlement, which gave the white landowners 10 years of protection from any restitution measures. By the 1990s, the rule of President Robert Mugabe\u2019s ZANU-PF party was threatened on two fronts. On one hand, organized labor and civil groups were challenging the government\u2019s structural adjustment policies that had precipitated an economic downturn. On the other hand, veterans of the independence war were demanding compensation, including pensions and parcels of land.President Mugabe chose to split the opposition by accusing the independent labor movement of plotting with the British government to bring down the government, while at the same time increasing the compensation awarded to war veterans. The labor activists were labeled \u201csellouts\u201d and \u201cimperialist puppets\u201d; the veterans were celebrated as revolutionary heroes.Zimbabwe offers important lessons on how a post-independence black-majority government can manage, or mismanage, the gap between the strictures of liberal constitutions that entrench the property rights of the white minority and the demands of the black majority to right historical injustices and structural inequalities that disproportionately affect them. One of those lessons would be for opposition movements to resist the temptation to exaggerate the individual role of President Mugabe to the detriment of a focus on social and economic justice.More than anything, Zimbabwe teaches us that if the South African people\u2019s legitimate demands for land and wealth redistribution remain unaddressed for too long in the post-apartheid era, it will take only the right political entrepreneurs to cynically capitalize on a hollow rhetoric of \u201cradical\u201d and \u201crevolutionary\u201d demands to consolidate power in the face of widespread dissent. Like the A.N.C., Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ZANU-PF long prevaricated on these historic issues central to the liberation struggles. It was only when Mr. Mugabe was losing political ground and international credibility that his party appeared to rediscover its revolutionary roots.What we are witnessing now in South Africa is not so much a matter of an exceptional, corrupt president as the surfacing of contradictions that were inherent in the negotiated settlement. The longer these stay unresolved, and subject to cynical manipulation, the worse the consequences could be. What will determine whether South Africa can escape the \u201cZimbabwe complex\u201d is its ability to confront the inequity that was the legacy of the political settlement that ended apartheid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Monk Erects a \u2018Cathedral of Faith\u2019 Brick by Brick, and Mostly Alone", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byMEJORADA DEL CAMPO JournalMEJORADA DEL CAMPO, Spain \u2014 In February, Justo Gallego dug his own grave, literally, in the crypt of the church he has been building here, brick by brick, since the early 1960s.Mr. Gallego, 91, also recently switched dwellings, moving from the nearby home of some relatives to the more spartan surroundings of his self-made temple. He wants to make certain he will die in the place that has become his life\u2019s mission.\u201cThis is where my vocation has taken me and this is where I\u2019m prepared to suffer, just as Jesus Christ taught us to suffer for others,\u201d said Mr. Gallego, as he threw wood onto a stove by his rudimentary bedroom, next to the altar, where he sleeps on a plank without a mattress.Mr. Gallego might be ready to confront death, but some residents here worry about what will happen to his extraordinary project without him. Mr. Gallego has never received a building permit or any public financing, but he has managed to erect a striking landmark in this otherwise nondescript town of 23,000 inhabitants on the outskirts of Madrid.His ambitious undertaking is labeled the \u201cCathedral of Faith\u201d on internet maps, even though it has received no official backing from officials of the Catholic Church. Flanked by two cloisters and crowned by an unfinished 125-foot-tall cupola, it attracts tourists on the weekend, helping lift the local economy.\u201cThis man has built something incredible against all odds and turned it into a symbol of our town,\u201d said Victor Morillo, a resident who can see the cupola from the balcony of his apartment. \u201cThe Town Hall should have done a lot more to help and should certainly not allow anything bad to happen to this cathedral after he dies.\u201dMr. Gallego, however, is unmoved by this kind of support, just as he has been unshaken by past criticism of his project and his own personality, sometimes derided as that of an exalted former monk. He is also unfazed that he has never received any public financing, even in a country that is mostly Catholic and whose infrastructure has been heavily subsidized.\u201cI\u2019ve not been building this to get money or fame, just as I\u2019m not here to listen to people decide whether I\u2019m mad or unique,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fully responsible for my work and I\u2019m not looking for the authorities to have any say.\u201dDespite the lack of permits, no one is talking of tearing the church down, but neither is anyone certain of the project\u2019s long-term future.Encarnaci\u00f3n Mart\u00edn \u00c1lvarez, an official in charge of urban planning here, said the city could not finance Mr. Gallego because of budgetary constraints and had made no plan to guarantee the continuation of the project, whatever its growing importance to the town and its identity.Mr. Gallego was born here in 1925, on the day of the town\u2019s patron saint, the Virgin of Sorrows. At 27, he joined a monastery in the northern province of Soria, but was ordered to leave eight years later, after he caught tuberculosis and risked contaminating the other monks.After recovering in a Madrid hospital, Mr. Gallego returned to his hometown, where he decided to turn a family plot of land into a place of worship, without the blessing of the Catholic Church.He said that his project was an act of faith, motivated in part by his desire to make amends for the desecration he witnessed during the Spanish Civil War. During the war, \u201cI saw the Communists destroy all the churches here, with people laughing and dancing in the ruins,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you believe, you can then also rebuild with your own hands a beautiful new place.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Gallego has put up most of the church himself, without any training as an architect or civil engineer, using recycled material ranging from food tins to misshapen bricks and other leftovers from local factories and construction sites.The capitals of some of the church\u2019s concrete pillars are made from secondhand car tires, painted gray to resemble the color of the concrete used for the pillar. Part of the roofing is still missing, but there are already frescoes on the walls.Mr. Gallego has financed his work by selling family farmland, as well as through donations.He has held religious ceremonies on the premises, but the ground has not been consecrated.\u201cMany members of the institutional church view him as a fanatic who shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously, but I consider him an example for humanity,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Teresa Alonso, a retiree from a nearby town, who visits occasionally and has donated money to help Mr. Gallego. \u201cThey say faith can move mountains, but here we see that faith can also build an incredible cathedral.\u201dMr. Gallego has received some informal support from members of the local clergy. \u201cThere have been complaints about him, but we support him in as far as we can,\u201d said Pedro Luis Jim\u00e9nez Langa, a parish priest in town. \u201cIt\u2019s an exceptional work, and he\u2019s a good man.\u201dWith his health growing more fragile, Mr. Gallego has increasingly relied on friends and volunteers to help with construction. A local entrepreneur offered a crane to lift the cupola, while some admirers have donated religious sculptures and decorations, rather than money.But nothing gets added without Mr. Gallego\u2019s approval, particularly if it jars with the arches and other circular designs that he loves, which are loosely based on the Romanesque style.\u201cThat\u2019s really not going to look good anywhere around here,\u201d Mr. Gallego said, as he studied a blue dove made of raffia given as a donation, but which Mr. Gallego left lying on the floor.While some have wondered about Mr. Gallego\u2019s mental health, his supporters dispute there\u2019s anything unhealthy about his obsession.\u201cDo you really think somebody mad could have built something like this?\u201d said Pablo Cantuel Gallego, a nephew, 64, who has been helping his uncle since he was a child. \u201cThe only problem with my uncle is that he belongs to a different century. He thinks and works like nobody could now imagine doing.\u201dIt is notable that Mr. Gallego\u2019s building is on a street named after Antoni Gaud\u00ed, the architect of Barcelona\u2019s world-famous and unfinished basilica, the Sagrada Famil\u00eda.Gaud\u00ed died in 1926, but other architects have taken over and hope to finish his basilica in 2026, for the centenary of his death. Mr. Gallego, on the other hand, has no timetable and not even a single sketch of his cathedral project. But he does have one trusted assistant, \u00c1ngel L\u00f3pez, who said that he would take over the works when Mr. Gallego died.\u201cThe only plan is made in my head, drawn day by day,\u201d Mr. Gallego said, with a grin that revealed several missing teeth. \u201cBut Jesus Christ is the one who makes the real plans and decides what eventually should happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once a Lace Capital, Now Riven by French Politics", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Globalization silenced the historic looms of Calais; blue-collar voters there represent the forces powering the far right.Supported byCALAIS, France \u2014 The clang of giant weaving looms ricocheted across a cavernous factory one recent afternoon at Desseilles Laces, one of the oldest lace makers in France. A handful of workers flitted among the machines, guiding gossamer threads into a floral confection destined for luxury lingerie and couture dresses.The halls here, and at hundreds of lace factories around Calais, were once thick with employees. But as competition from countries with cheaper labor costs buffeted France, waves of layoffs swept through this working-class town on the edge of the English Channel.It has been a painful retreat for an industry whose delicate creations symbolized \u201cMade in France\u201d know-how, an economic pattern repeated across the country and one of the most divisive issues in the presidential election.In ravaged industrial areas like Calais, anger about the impact of globalization is fierce, as unemployment tops 20 percent and the remaining factory floors rely more heavily on machinery than manpower.\u201cMarine Le Pen says this election is about the patriots versus the globalists,\u201d said Famke Krumbm\u00fcller, the head of research at OpenCitiz, a political risk consultancy in Paris. \u201cShe\u2019s right: The new cleavage opposes those who feel they have lost from globalization and want economic and national protectionism, versus those who think the answers to France\u2019s problems also lie in European and international openness and cooperation.\u201dFrench lace has long been a symbol of refinement. After the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, the French aristocracy drove demand for the luxurious adornments that were just starting to be produced in Calais. Today, superfine lace continues to embellish outfits of the elegant, whether as a cascade of sheer flowers on the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s wedding dress, or layered in couture gowns on catwalks around the world.Lace-making began to flourish here in the early 19th century, after three British weavers smuggled giant looms, called Leavers machines, across the English Channel to evade English restrictions on selling lace to the French.They set up in the textile-making town of Calais. The new industry blossomed, and the metallic click of the Leavers looms vibrated in Calais\u2019s narrow streets day and night. Some streets are named after leaders of an industry that ushered in jobs, prosperity and a cosmopolitan makeover that would sustain the town\u2019s families for generations.The dream began to unravel around the 1960s. Factories still relied heavily on the antique Leavers looms, which were slow and required many employees. When more efficient lace-knitting machines were added, workers lost jobs.Shifting fashion trends also affected demand, as women started wearing pants, plainer shirts and fewer dresses and undergarments trimmed with lace. More casual lifestyles took their toll on lace tablecloths and handkerchiefs.In the ensuing decades, more jobs were lost as factories opened in Asia, cranking out lower-quality but passably pretty lace. Many of Desseilles\u2019s clients shifted their buying away from Europe.Labor costs were up to 15 times cheaper in Asia than in France, where employers also pay high taxes on salaries to fund the generous social welfare system. \u201cA French person working 35 hours a week cost the same as 15 Chinese,\u201d said Michel Machart, the head of MM Textile, a consultancy.Soon, only a few thousand of the 30,000 lace-related jobs that had existed 30 years earlier were left. The sound of Leavers machines gave way to silence as layoffs accelerated and factories were abandoned.Unemployed lace workers in Calais went to nearby steel and paint factories, only to see them shutter, too.Manufacturing in France in general has fallen from about 25 percent of the economy in the 1960s to around 10 percent today, putting millions of people out of work.Ms. Le Pen has capitalized on the disenchantment. \u201cThe main thing at stake in this election is the rampant globalization that is endangering our civilization,\u201d she told supporters last Sunday. She wants to pull France out of \u201charmful\u201d European pacts and hold a referendum on membership in the European Union. Around Calais, which used to vote for the far left, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s posters promise to \u201cBring Order Back to France.\u201dMr. Macron, a former Rothschild banker, says that business-friendly policies and sticking with the European Union are the way to shield France from globalization\u2019s threat.It didn\u2019t stop the bleeding. With around 800 workers in Calais, representing 60 percent of Noyon\u2019s costs, revenue kept eroding.Noyon laid off hundreds of employees, many of whom had spent their lives in the factories. \u201cIt hit all types of workers,\u201d said Henri-Philippe Durlet, the general director of Noyon. \u201cIt was people who designed patterns, threaded bobbins, cut lace, maintained the machines, as well as drivers and customs officers who had less to inspect.\u201dAs losses mounted, Noyon filed for bankruptcy last September and was on the verge of closing until a group of French lingerie makers swooped in to invest, wanting to protect their high-quality supply. Today, with just 170 employees, it is the largest lace factory in town.The only way it can keep a competitive edge, Mr. Durlet said, is by maintaining the exquisite design and quality of French lace that artisans have perfected for decades.Desseilles faced a similar fate, exacerbated by French labor laws. In 2011, facing what Michel Berrier, an owner, called \u201ccatastrophic losses,\u201d Desseilles went into receivership to shed nine of its remaining 74 workers in a bid to survive.But five employees, among them protected union leaders, sued to be reinstated. In 2015, a court ordered Desseilles to rehire them with back pay and damages, a cost of nearly one million euros. With debts of \u20ac600,000, it was money Desseilles did not have.The company was forced into bankruptcy. \u201cGlobalization isn\u2019t the only reason we ran into trouble,\u201d said Mr. Berrier, surveying his near-empty factory floor. \u201cThe French labor laws put the last nail in the coffin.\u201dMs. Le Pen\u2019s National Front party issued a news release blaming cheap Chinese competition and the French labor code for endangering Desseilles.Since then, Yongsheng, which runs textile and investing companies in Asia, has increased productivity, installing a bright new LED system that allows employees to easily identify flaws, and grouping Leavers machines closer together so that one employee can work several looms at once. Yongsheng also added new looms, and linked employee pay to production.\u201c\u2018Made in France\u2019 matters \u2014 the expertise is here,\u201d said Cloris Li, Yongsheng\u2019s manager in France, who wants to start an Asian luxury label using French-made lace. \u201cI hope I can bring a brighter future to Desseilles.\u201dWith the factory humming again, Mr. Berrier hired five new employees, and hopes to obtain seven more.Even there, the French system can provide disincentives. When he tried to hire a lace maker whom Noyon had laid off, he said, the man told him he was collecting so much of his old salary through unemployment, he saw no point in working.The last of the lace makers are relieved to have jobs, but many are nostalgic for the days when French lace was king. Most have family ties to the factories that go back for generations.\u201cI learned how to string a bobbin when I was 11,\u201d said Sonia Rengot, 47, a lace maker at Noyon for over 30 years. \u201cEveryone in Calais had someone in the business.\u201dToday, when she walks around town, she can tell just by looking in a shop window whether the lace on a dress was made in Asia or in Calais.Jean-Philippe Lenclos, 50, has worked the lace machines at Desseilles for 30 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen our colleagues leave one after another,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the last one: My three children are teenagers, but none of them wants to do what their father is doing.\u201d He added that the younger generation has grown up hearing only about layoffs.Even as they hope the factories will stay afloat, the lace makers seem aware that the damage to France\u2019s lace industry \u2014 and to other manufacturers around the country \u2014 is permanent. On the streets of Calais, no one really expects the factories to return.Mr. Durlet, the Noyon executive, does not think either of the presidential contenders is capable of reversing France\u2019s industrial decline. Not Mr. Macron, with his pledges of keeping France open to globalization. Not Ms. Le Pen, with her vision of hard protectionism.\u201cShe talks about closing borders, but what will that serve?\u201d Mr. Durlet asked. \u201cNothing. \u201dBut for some on the factory floor, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s promises have struck a chord.\u201cPeople are so disappointed that they will go vote for Marine Le Pen out of frustration,\u201d said Renato Fragoli, a 23-year Desseilles veteran who led an employee group called the Forgotten, which backed Yongsheng\u2019s bid to keep the factory from closing.\u201cIt\u2019s truly sad,\u201d said Mr. Fragoli, recalling the scores of longtime workers who left the factory amid waves of layoffs. \u201cBut I can understand them. The jobs have disappeared.\u201dWords by Liz Alderman; Photographs by Dmitry KostyukovElian Peltier contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Vows to Unveil Tax-Cut Plan Next Week, Surprising Staff", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump promised on Friday that he would unveil a \u201cmassive\u201d tax cut for Americans next week, vowing a \u201cbig announcement on Wednesday,\u201d but he revealed no details about what is certain to be an enormously complicated effort to overhaul the nation\u2019s tax code.Mr. Trump offered his tax tease in an interview and again during remarks at the Treasury Department on Friday afternoon as he raced to stack up legislative accomplishments before his 100th day in office at the end of next week.His announcement surprised Capitol Hill and left Mr. Trump\u2019s own Treasury officials speechless as he arrived at the Treasury offices to sign directives to roll back Obama-era tax rules and financial regulations. Earlier in the day, when reporters asked Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, how far away a tax overhaul proposal was, he said he could not give an answer. \u201cTax reform is way too complicated,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump told The Associated Press in the interview that his tax reductions would be \u201cbigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever.\u201d But he faces an enormous fight among clashing vested interests as Congress tries to rewrite the tax code.Starting that fight next week is further complicated by Mr. Trump\u2019s hopes to revive the Republican health care plan that collapsed last month. And it would mean trying a tax overhaul as his White House faces the prospect of a government shutdown if lawmakers cannot agree on a funding bill by April 28.The details of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plans remain the subject of intense speculation, with stock markets regularly gyrating when White House officials discuss the subject. Since taking office, the president has suggested that he wants to enact the deepest cuts to individual and corporate tax rates in history.But despite Mr. Trump\u2019s statement on Friday that his tax overhaul \u201creally formally begins on Wednesday,\u201d White House officials quickly cautioned against high expectations that Mr. Trump would provide the legislative text of a detailed tax plan next week.Instead, a senior administration official said the president would release only the \u201cparameters\u201d that Mr. Trump expected a tax plan to follow in the long congressional debate that would surely follow. Another official said the information released next week would be more like a \u201cbroad\u201d outline. Wall Street, which tends to celebrate tax cuts, barely reacted; the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down 0.3 percent Friday.The administration has maintained that middle-income tax cuts, a simplification of personal income taxes, and making business taxes more competitive with other countries are the top priorities. Mr. Trump insisted that his plans were on track and that his strategy to remake the economy would change history.\u201cThis is really the beginning of a whole new way of life that this country hasn\u2019t seen in many, many years,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he sat at the desk of Mr. Mnuchin, near a portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary.He said, \u201cWe\u2019ve lifted one terrible regulation after another at a record clip from the energy sector to the auto sector.\u201dDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s enthusiasm, the directives he signed at the Treasury Department on Friday to review measures put in place by the Obama administration were largely preliminary. As business groups cheered the moves, some skeptics were left questioning whether Mr. Trump was keeping his campaign promises to give working-class Americans a higher priority than Wall Street bankers.\u201cFrom our perspective, it is a direction that is dramatically backwards on financial stability,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform.The presidential order asks Mr. Mnuchin to review the tax regulations imposed by President Barack Obama in 2016. Those include efforts to clamp down on \u201ccorporate inversions\u201d \u2014 in which American companies merge with foreign companies to take advantage of lower tax rates abroad.Viewed alone, undoing the rules would appear to be at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to reduce incentives for companies to move overseas to minimize taxes.Last year Mr. Obama\u2019s Treasury Department, concerned about Pfizer\u2019s $152 billion bid to acquire Allergan, which makes Botox, issued rules to thwart the practice. Among those efforts were regulations to prevent moves like \u201cearnings-stripping,\u201d in which an American subsidiary borrows from a parent company and uses the interest payments on the loans to offset its earnings. It was intended to make the financial relocations less attractive.The uproar over inversions dogged a number of transactions over the last five years including Burger King\u2019s takeover of the Canadian chain Tim Hortons and the drug maker AbbVie\u2019s planned acquisition of an Irish rival, Shire.But the major target of the outrage was the Pfizer-Allergan deal, by far the biggest effort by a company to give up its American citizenship to cut its taxes. Pfizer executives braced themselves for opposition from the Obama administration \u2014 but were surprised by how aggressively the White House fought the deal. Within a few months, Pfizer and Allergan surrendered and ended their agreement.Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant, said reversing these rules would be a gift to Wall Street bankers and lawyers who have complained that they have hampered international deal making.\u201cThey\u2019ll be dancing in the streets and jumping for joy,\u201d Mr. Willens said.Memorandums with the executive order ask Mr. Mnuchin to review the Orderly Liquidation Authority, a tool created by the Dodd-Frank law of 2010 for unwinding financial institutions that are on the verge of collapse. Many banks have hoped that Congress will repeal the system. The administration is examining whether it encourages excessive risk-taking or exposes taxpayers to potential liabilities.The Treasury is also reviewing the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which designates financial institutions as \u201csystemically important,\u201d better known as \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d It requires them to hold more capital in reserve in the event of financial emergencies.Both provisions, which were part of the Dodd-Frank law, are delayed by a 180-day review by the Treasury.Democrats warned that Mr. Trump was putting vulnerable middle-class Americans in danger. \u201cSimply eliminating these regulations and putting nothing in their place leaves a hole in the tax system that sophisticated corporations will continue to take advantage of, to the detriment of the country,\u201d said David Kamin, a New York University law professor who worked on the Obama administration\u2019s National Economic Council.Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, assailed Mr. Trump for trying to undermine rules that were put in place to protect the economy. \u201cAny actions to undermine these protections encourage Wall Street\u2019s risky behavior and leave taxpayers and our economy exposed to another catastrophe,\u201d he said.Mr. Brown said that Mr. Trump appeared to be breaking a campaign promise by making it easier for companies to use inversions. \u201cWe should be working to lower taxes for hardworking families and workers across Ohio, not helping multimillion-dollar corporations cheat the system to avoid paying their fair share,\u201d he said.Mr. Mnuchin insisted that would not be the case and argued the tax overhaul legislation plan that they would propose will address the problem of companies moving overseas.Mr. Trump has shown an affinity for tariffs. He proposed a \u201creciprocal\u201d tax this month that matches the import taxes other countries impose on American goods.It remains unclear if Mr. Trump is on board with the \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax that is central to the plan being promoted by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and House Republicans. The concept would allow Republicans to raise more than $1 trillion of revenue, making it possible for them pass legislation without adding to the deficit.Mr. Trump has been cool to that plan in interviews, and recently his advisers have been making the case that a surging economy, rather than Mr. Ryan\u2019s border adjustment tax, will pay for deep rate cuts.\u201cThe plan will pay for itself with growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said an Institute for International Finance conference on Thursday.Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team had initially set an August deadline to get tax legislation passed, but that target was delayed to the end of the year after Republicans expended time on their failed health plan.After The Associated Press reported on Mr. Trump\u2019s accelerated timeline to put out their tax plan, Treasury officials who were awaiting Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to their office smiled broadly and chuckled nervously as they digested news on their smartphones.But during his visit, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that Mr. Mnuchin and his team were ready to move on a tax overhaul, a mammoth legislative undertaking that has not occurred since 1986. After a brief tour of the building, Mr. Trump praised his Treasury secretary\u2019s financial acumen and said he was sure that Mr. Mnuchin would be among the best to do the job.\u201cI think Hamilton is tough to beat, but maybe you can do that too,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Glenn Thrush contributed reporting from Washington, and Michael J. de la Merced from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Weighs Infrastructure Bill but Keeps New York Up in the Air", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said he was considering \u201caccelerating\u201d the introduction of his $1 trillion infrastructure bill \u2014 but he pointedly refused to say whether he planned to include two major New York City transportation projects that his budget for next year would defund.Mr. Trump, speaking in a wide-ranging interview in the Oval Office on Wednesday, described the infrastructure package as a high-value legislative sweetener that he could attach to a revived Affordable Care Act repeal bill or tax code overhaul to attract bipartisan support that thus far he had neither sought nor received.The president, who inherited and expanded a family fortune built on middle- and upper-income real estate development, has proposed eliminating an Obama-era infrastructure program that would have funded long-delayed proposals to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, and extend the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan north to East Harlem.State and city leaders say both projects are essential: The subway line is needed to alleviate congestion on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, and the tunnel is needed to improve deteriorating rail service in the heavily trafficked Eastern corridor and provide a new conduit for freight in the event of a natural disaster like Hurricane Sandy in 2012.Mr. Trump said he planned to examine both New York projects and submit them to an as-yet unformed \u201ccommission\u201d headed by Richard LeFrak, a fellow scion of a prominent Queens real estate family, and Steven Roth, the chairman of the New York-based Vornado Realty Trust.\u201cWell, I may support them,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m going to look at them.\u201d\u201cI did great in real estate in New York,\u201d he added. \u201cI know all the developers. I know all of the folks. I know the good ones and the bad ones. And I\u2019m setting up a commission of very smart people that know how to spend money properly. That know how to build on time, on budget. And ideally, under time and under budget.\u201dNew York leaders were not impressed. \u201cWelcome to the party,\u201d said Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. \u201cThe governor has been saying that we need to rebuild our airports for years, but unlike Washington, we aren\u2019t just talking about needed improvements; we are already in the process of rebuilding them. This is exactly why the federal government needs to follow through on its promise to fund infrastructure projects.\u201dMitchell Moss, the director of New York University\u2019s Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management, predicted that Mr. Trump, spurred on by his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, would eventually come through for the city.\u201cMar-a-Lago is a nice place to golf, but New York is where Donald Trump grew up, and it\u2019s where he will return,\u201d Mr. Moss said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida resort. \u201cAt the end of the day, Donald, Ivanka and Jared are going to come back here, and they know the city needs a world-class infrastructure.\u201dIt is not that the president thinks the city is not in need. \u201cI think it\u2019s in poor shape,\u201d he said of New York\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cThe highways are in poor shape.\u201d\u201cI think the airports are a horror show,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled the world, I know the world.\u201dMr. Trump, whose knowledge of complex policy issues can sometimes be lacking, then offered a scathing critique of the bent and battered metal median guards on the Van Wyck Expressway not far from his childhood home in Queens.\u201cWhoever the person is that owns that company is a genius salesman,\u201d he said, as his aides \u2014 who wanted to talk about their bigger plans \u2014 grew restless in their carved armchairs. \u201cThat is the worst garbage. I think it bends by the heat, because not that many cars could possibly hit it. It\u2019s the worst garbage. And I also think it\u2019s dangerous because it\u2019s a spear. And if you hit those things, they come flying apart. And if you\u2019re driving, you\u2019ve got yourself a problem.\u201dMr. Trump confessed that he had not personally driven in a while, and that it had been years since he had ridden the subway.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. It\u2019s been a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the subway system very well. I used to take it to Kew-Forest School, in Forest Hills, when I lived in Queens. And I\u2019d take the subway to school. Seems a long time ago. I\u2019d take it from Jamaica, 179th Street. Jamaica, right? To Forest Hills. I understand the subway very well. I used to ride between the cars.\u201dReferring to his parents, he added, \u201cThey weren\u2019t thrilled when they heard that.\u201dMr. Trump, at the advice of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Vice President Mike Pence, had intended to tackle health care first \u2014 gaining hundreds of billions of dollars in cost savings \u2014 that would then be rolled into an ambitious tax cut package. Infrastructure, according to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and other top administration officials, was something the administration would handle when the other two bills were passed.But the health care debacle has scuttled the president\u2019s plans, and he is considering merging one or all of the proposals in the hopes of cobbling together a coalition. The idea of merging a big infrastructure plan with a tax proposal is not new: Shortly after taking office in 2009, President Barack Obama proposed a similar idea \u2014 and his stimulus package included more than $300 billion in tax breaks intended to spur infrastructure and capital investments to stimulate growth.Mr. Trump is confident he will attract Democratic support \u2014 even though he has not spoken with the minority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, for weeks. He said Democrats were \u201cdesperate for infrastructure \u2014 that\u2019s the thing that they want.\u201dMr. Schumer said he was eager to start negotiations but not especially hopeful. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t put out anything specific yet,\u201d the senator said.The president, surrounded by staff members including Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Reed Cordish, an assistant to Mr. Trump \u2014 refused to say how much direct public funding would be included in his proposal. A senior administration official directly involved in drafting the plan said that number would be in the $200 billion to $300 billion range over the next decade, with the balance of the package paid for by tax credits.Mr. Schumer and many congressional Democrats say they will never agree to such large tax breaks for developers and builders, despite the president\u2019s claim that they will fold.And even as Mr. Trump trumpeted the curative political tonic of the infrastructure bill, his aides were on hand to remind him that they had their own priorities, too.\u201cHe\u2019s spending an enormous amount of time on trade and taxes,\u201d Mr. Cohn said, interrupting the talk of trains, planes and automobiles. \u201cThose are two big areas.\u201dA few minutes later, Mr. Cohn \u2014 who is ascendant in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle \u2014 let out a colossal sneeze. Perhaps that is why the president paid such close attention to Mr. Cohn\u2019s physical well-being.\u201cGod bless you. You O.K., Gary?\u201d the president said. \u201cThat was a pretty tough one. I\u2019ve got to make sure my man is all right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is Wimping Out on Trade", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported bySo on Friday the White House scheduled a ceremony in which Mr. Trump would sign two new executive orders on trade. The goal, presumably, was to counteract the growing impression that his bombast on trade was sound and fury signifying nothing.The fiasco perfectly encapsulated what\u2019s looking more and more like a failed agenda.First, back when Mr. Trump was railing against trade deals, he had no idea what he was talking about. (I know, you\u2019re shocked to hear that.)Talking nonsense about trade didn\u2019t hurt Mr. Trump during the campaign. But now he\u2019s finding out that those grossly unfair trade deals he promised to renegotiate aren\u2019t all that unfair, after all, leaving him with no idea what to do next.Which brings me to Trumptrade\u2019s second big obstacle: Whatever you think of past trade agreements, trade is now deeply embedded in the economy.Does it have to be this way? No. Slap on 30 percent tariffs, and after a few years those national industries would separate again. But the transition would be chaotic and painful.The point is that at a deep level Trumptrade is running into the same wall that caused Trumpcare to crash and burn. Mr. Trump came into office talking big, sure that his predecessors had messed everything up and he \u2014 he alone \u2014 could do far better. And millions of voters believed him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Facebook Fix Its Own Worst Bug?", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "FeatureMark Zuckerberg now acknowledges the dangerous side of the social revolution he helped start. But is the most powerful tool for connection in human history capable of adapting to the world it created?Supported byZuckerberg used to be a nervous speaker, but he has become much less so. He speaks quickly but often unloads full paragraphs of thought, and sometimes his arguments are so polished that they sound rehearsed, which happened often that morning. \u201c2016 was an interesting year for us,\u201d he said as the three of us, plus a P.R. executive, sat around a couple of couches in the glass-walled conference room where he conducts many of his meetings. (There are many perks to working at Facebook, but no one, not even Zuckerberg, has a private office.) It was an understatement and a nod to the obvious: Facebook, once a mere app on your phone, had become a global political and cultural force, and the full implications of that transformation had begun to come into view last year. \u201cIf you look at the history of Facebook, when we started off, there really wasn\u2019t news as part of it,\u201d Zuckerberg went on. But as Facebook grew and became a bigger part of how people learn about the world, the company had been slow to adjust to its new place in people\u2019s lives. The events of 2016, he said, \u201cset off a number of conversations that we\u2019re still in the middle of.\u201dAfter the election, Zuckerberg offered a few pat defenses of Facebook\u2019s role. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite proud of the impact that we were able to have on civic discourse over all,\u201d he said when we spoke in January. Misinformation on Facebook was not as big a problem as some believed it was, but Facebook nevertheless would do more to battle it, he pledged. Echo chambers were a concern, but if the source was people\u2019s own confirmation bias, was it really Facebook\u2019s problem to solve?It was hard to tell how seriously Zuckerberg took the criticisms of his service and its increasingly paradoxical role in the world. He had spent much of his life building a magnificent machine to bring people together. By the most literal measures, he\u2019d succeeded spectacularly, but what had that connection wrought? Across the globe, Facebook now seems to benefit actors who want to undermine the global vision at its foundation. Supporters of Trump and the European right-wing nationalists who aim to turn their nations inward and dissolve alliances, trolls sowing cross-border paranoia, even ISIS with its skillful social-media recruiting and propagandizing \u2014 all of them have sought in their own ways to split the Zuckerbergian world apart. And they are using his own machine to do it.Underneath it all was a nagging feeling of complicity. Trump had benefited from a media environment that is now shaped by Facebook \u2014 and, more to the point, shaped by a single Facebook feature, the same one to which the company owes its remarkable ascent to social-media hegemony: the computationally determined list of updates you see every time you open the app. The list has a formal name, News Feed. But most users are apt to think of it as Facebook itself.If it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that News Feed has become the most influential source of information in the history of civilization, it is only slightly so. Facebook created News Feed in 2006 to solve a problem: In the social-media age, people suddenly had too many friends to keep up with. At the time, Facebook was just a collection of profiles, lacking any kind of central organization. To figure out what any of your connections were up to, you had to visit each of their profiles to see if anything had changed. News Feed fixed that. Every time you open Facebook, it hunts through the network, collecting every post from every connection \u2014 information that, for most Facebook users, would be too overwhelming to process themselves. Then it weighs the merits of each post before presenting you with a feed sorted in order of importance: a hyperpersonalized front page designed just for you.Scholars and critics have been warning of the solipsistic irresistibility of algorithmic news at least since 2001, when the constitutional-law professor Cass R. Sunstein warned, in his book \u201cRepublic.com,\u201d of the urgent risks posed to democracy \u201cby any situation in which thousands or perhaps millions or even tens of millions of people are mainly listening to louder echoes of their own voices.\u201d (In 2008, I piled on with my own book, \u201cTrue Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society.\u201d) In 2011, the digital activist and entrepreneur Eli Pariser, looking at similar issues, gave this phenomenon a memorable name in the title of his own book: \u201cThe Filter Bubble.\u201dEmployees got the same message. \u201cWhen Facebook cares about something, they spin up teams to address it, and Zuck will come out and talk about it all the time,\u201d one former executive told me. \u201cI have never heard of anything close to that on the filter bubble. I never sensed that this was a problem he wanted us to tackle. It was always positioned as an interesting intellectual question but not something that we\u2019re going to go focus on.\u201dFacebook, under criticism, reinstated the picture, but the photo incident stuck with Zuckerberg. He would bring it up unbidden to staff members and to reporters. It highlighted, for him, the difficulty of building a policy framework for what Facebook was trying to do. Zuckerberg wanted to become a global news distributor that is run by machines, rather than by humans who would try to look at every last bit of content and exercise considered judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s something I think we\u2019re still figuring out,\u201d he told me in January. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to do here than what we\u2019ve done. And I think we\u2019re starting to realize this now as well.\u201dIt struck me as an unsatisfying answer, and it later became apparent that Zuckerberg seemed to feel the same way. On a Sunday morning about a month after the first meeting, I got a call from a Facebook spokesman. Zuckerberg wanted to chat again. Could Mike and I come back on Monday afternoon?What\u2019s striking about that 2012 letter, read through the prism of 2017, is its certainty that a more \u201copen and connected\u201d world is by definition a better one. \u201cWhen I started Facebook, the idea of connecting the world was not controversial,\u201d Zuckerberg said now. \u201cThe default assumption was that the world was incrementally just moving in that direction. So I thought we can connect some people and do our part in helping move in that direction.\u201d But now, he said, whether it was wise to connect the world was \u201cactually a real question.\u201dZuckerberg\u2019s new manifesto never quite accepts blame for any of the global ills that have been laid at Facebook\u2019s feet. Yet by the standards of a company release, it is remarkable for the way it concedes that the company\u2019s chief goal \u2014 wiring the globe \u2014 is controversial. \u201cThere are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone,\u201d Zuckerberg writes, \u201cand whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course.\u201d He also confesses misgivings about Facebook\u2019s role in the news. \u201cGiving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality.\u201dAt the time of our second interview, the manifesto was still only a draft, and I was surprised by how unsure Zuckerberg seemed about it in person. He had almost as many questions for us \u2014 about whether we understood what he was trying to say, how we thought it would land in the media \u2014 as we had for him. When I suggested that it might be perceived as an attack on Trump, he looked dismayed. He noted several times that he had been noodling over these ideas since long before November. A few weeks earlier, there was media speculation, fueled by a postelection tour of America by Zuckerberg and his wife, that he was laying the groundwork to run against Trump in 2020, and in this meeting he took pains to shoot down the rumors. When I asked if he had chatted with Obama about the former president\u2019s critique of Facebook, Zuckerberg paused for several seconds, nearly to the point of awkwardness, before answering that he had.Facebook\u2019s spokespeople later called to stress that Obama was only one of many people to whom he had spoken. In other words: Don\u2019t read this as a partisan anti-Trump manifesto. But if the company pursues the admittedly airy aims outlined in \u201cBuilding Global Community,\u201d the changes will echo across media and politics, and some are bound to be considered partisan. The risks are especially clear for changes aimed at adding layers of journalistic ethics across News Feed, which could transform the public\u2019s perception of Facebook, not to mention shake the foundations of its business.For the typical user, Cox explained when I met him on a morning in October at MPK20, News Feed is computing the relative merits of about 2,000 potential posts in your network every time you open the app. In sorting these posts, Facebook does not optimize for any single metric: not clicks or reading time or likes. Instead, he said, \u201cwhat you really want to get to is whether somebody, at the end of the day, would say, \u2018Hey, my experience today was meaningful.\u2019\u2009\u201d Personalizing News Feed, in other words, is a very big \u201cmath problem,\u201d incorporating countless metrics in extraordinarily complicated ways. Zuckerberg calls it \u201ca modern A.I. problem.\u201dLast summer, I sat in on two meetings in another glass-walled MPK20 conference room, in which News Feed\u2019s engineers, designers, user-research experts and managers debated several small alterations to how News Feed displays certain kinds of posts. The conversations were far from exciting \u2014 people in jeans on couches looking at PowerPoints, talking quietly about numbers \u2014 and yet I found them mesmerizing, a demonstration of the profound cultural differences between how news companies like The Times work and how Facebook does. The first surprise was how slowly things move, contrary to the freewheeling culture of \u201cthe hacker way.\u201d In one meeting, the team spent several minutes discussing the merits of bold text in a certain News Feed design. One blessing of making social software is that you can gauge any potential change to your product by seeing how your users react to it. That is also the curse: At Facebook, virtually every change to the app, no matter how small or obviously beneficial, is thoroughly tested on different segments of the audience before it\u2019s rolled out to everyone.The people who work on News Feed aren\u2019t making decisions that turn on fuzzy human ideas like ethics, judgment, intuition or seniority. They are concerned only with quantifiable outcomes about people\u2019s actions on the site. That data, at Facebook, is the only real truth. And it is a particular kind of truth: The News Feed team\u2019s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want \u2014 what they find \u201cmeaningful,\u201d to use Cox and Zuckerberg\u2019s preferred term \u2014 and to give them more of that.This ideal runs so deep that the people who make News Feed often have to put aside their own notions of what\u2019s best. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve all learned over the years is that our intuition can be wrong a fair amount of the time,\u201d John Hegeman, the vice president of product management and a News Feed team member, told me. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t expect will happen. And we learn a lot from that process: Why didn\u2019t that happen, and what might that mean?\u201d But it is precisely this ideal that conflicts with attempts to wrangle the feed in the way press critics have called for. The whole purpose of editorial guidelines and ethics is often to suppress individual instincts in favor of some larger social goal. Facebook finds it very hard to suppress anything that its users\u2019 actions say they want. In some cases, it has been easier for the company to seek out evidence that, in fact, users don\u2019t want these things at all.If a human editor ran News Feed, she would look at the clickbait scourge and make simple, intuitive fixes: Turn down the Upworthy knob. But Facebook approaches the feed as an engineering project rather than an editorial one. When it makes alterations in the code that powers News Feed, it\u2019s often only because it has found some clear signal in its data that users are demanding the change. In this sense, clickbait was a riddle. In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them? Was there something Facebook\u2019s algorithm was missing, some signal that would show that despite the clicks, clickbait was really sickening users?To answer these questions, Cox and his team hired survey panels of more than a thousand paid \u201cprofessional raters\u201d around the world who answer questions about how well News Feed is working. Starting in 2013, Facebook began adding first dozens and then hundreds and then thousands of data points that were meant to teach the artificial-intelligence system that runs News Feed how people were reacting to their feeds. Facebook noticed that people would sometimes click open a clickbaity story but spend very little time on it. In other cases, lots of people would click on a story but few would share or Like it. Headlines on stories that people seemed to reject often contained a set of signature phrases (\u201cyou\u2019ll never believe,\u201d \u201cthis one trick,\u201d etc.) or they came from a set of repeat-offender publishers.This approach \u2014 looking for signs of user dissatisfaction \u2014 could curb stories that constitute the most egregious examples of misinformation. Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s vice president in charge of News Feed, says that Facebook has begun testing an algorithm change that would look at whether people share an article after reading it. If few of the people who click on a story decide to share it, that might suggest people feel misled by it and it would get lower billing in the feed.But the solution to the broader misinformation dilemma \u2014 the pervasive climate of rumor, propaganda and conspiracy theories that Facebook has inadvertently incubated \u2014 may require something that Facebook has never done: ignoring the likes and dislikes of its users. Facebook believes the pope-endorses-Trump type of made-up news stories are only a tiny minority of pieces that appear in News Feed; they account for a fraction of 1 percent of the posts, according to Mosseri. The question the company faces now is whether the misinformation problem resembles clickbait at all, and whether its solutions will align as neatly with Facebook\u2019s worldview. Facebook\u2019s entire project, when it comes to news, rests on the assumption that people\u2019s individual preferences ultimately coincide with the public good, and that if it doesn\u2019t appear that way at first, you\u2019re not delving deeply enough into the data. By contrast, decades of social-science research shows that most of us simply prefer stuff that feels true to our worldview even if it isn\u2019t true at all and that the mining of all those preference signals is likely to lead us deeper into bubbles rather than out of them.\u201cAt some point, if they really want to address this, they have to say, \u2018This is good information\u2019 and \u2018This is bad information,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Emily Bell, the director for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School. \u201cThey have to say, \u2018These are the kinds of information sources that we want to privilege, and these others are not going to be banned from the platform, but they are not going to thrive.\u2019 In other words, they have to create a hierarchy, and they\u2019re going to have to decide how they\u2019re going to transfer wealth into the publishing market.\u201dDuring our first meeting in January, I posed this question to Zuckerberg: \u201cWhen you see various problems in the media, do you say to yourself, \u2018I run Facebook, I can solve that?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cUm,\u201d he started, and then paused, weighing his words as carefully as American presidents once did. \u201cNot usually.\u201d He argued that some of Facebook\u2019s critics\u2019 proposed fixes for news on the service, such as hiring editors, were impractical due to Facebook\u2019s scale and global diversity. Personalization, he said, remained a central tenet. \u201cIt really gets back to, like, what do people want at a deep level,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this oversimplified narrative that a company can get very successful by just scratching a very superficial itch, and I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s right over the long term.\u201dYet by our second meeting, Zuckerberg\u2019s position seemed to have evolved. Facebook had by then announced plans for the Facebook Journalism Project, in which the company would collaborate with news companies on new products. Facebook also created a project to promote \u201cnews literacy\u201d among its users, and it hired the former CNN news anchor Campbell Brown to manage the partnership between it and news companies. Zuckerberg\u2019s tone toward critics of Facebook\u2019s approach to news had also grown far more conciliatory. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to get to the core of the actual problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI also really think that the core social thing that needs to happen is that a common understanding needs to exist. And misinformation I view as one of the things that can possibly erode common understanding. But sensationalism and polarization and other things, I actually think, are probably even stronger and more prolific effects. And we have to work on all these things. I think we need to listen to all the feedback on this.\u201dStill, in both our conversation and his new manifesto, Zuckerberg remained preoccupied with the kind of problems that could be solved by the kind of hyperconnectivity he believed in, not the ones caused by it. \u201cThere\u2019s a social infrastructure that needs to get built for modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving more people oriented not just toward short-term things but toward building the long-term social infrastructure that needs to get built across all these things in order to enable people to come together is going to be a really important thing over the next decades.\u201d By way of example, he pointed to Safety Check, Facebook\u2019s system for letting people tell their friends that they\u2019ve survived some kind of dangerous event, like a natural disaster or terrorist attack.\u201cWe\u2019re getting to a point where the biggest opportunities I think in the world ... problems like preventing pandemics from spreading or ending terrorism, all these things, they require a level of coordination and connection that I don\u2019t think can only be solved by the current systems that we have,\u201d Zuckerberg told me. What\u2019s needed, he argues, is some global superstructure to advance humanity.This is not an especially controversial idea; Zuckerberg is arguing for a kind of digital-era version of the global institution-building that the Western world engaged in after World War II. But because he is a chief executive and not an elected president, there is something frightening about his project. He is positioning Facebook \u2014 and, considering that he commands absolute voting control of the company, he is positioning himself \u2014 as a critical enabler of the next generation of human society. A minor problem with his mission is that it drips with megalomania, albeit of a particularly sincere sort. With his wife, Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg has pledged to give away nearly all of his wealth to a variety of charitable causes, including a long-term medical-research project to cure all disease. His desire to take on global social problems through digital connectivity, and specifically through Facebook, feels like part of the same impulse.Yet Zuckerberg is often blas\u00e9 about the messiness of the transition between the world we\u2019re in and the one he wants to create through software. Building new \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d usually involves tearing older infrastructure down. If you manage the demolition poorly, you might undermine what comes next. In the case of the shattering media landscape, Zuckerberg seems finally to have at least noticed this problem and may yet come up with fixes for it. But in the meantime, Facebook rushes headlong into murky new areas, uncovering new dystopian possibilities at every turn.Just as quickly, though, Zuckerberg then pivoted to Facebook\u2019s next marvel, a system for digitally augmenting your pictures and videos. The technical term for this is \u201caugmented reality.\u201d The name bursts with dystopian possibilities \u2014 fake news on video rather than just text \u2014 but Zuckerberg never mentioned them. The statesman had left the stage; before us stood an engineer.Farhad Manjoo is a technology columnist for The New York Times. He is working on a book about what he calls the Frightful Five: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 the five technology giants that are swallowing up the rest of the economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Do You Say \u2018Hail Mary\u2019 in French?", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 I\u2019ve lately been telling French people about the Hail Mary pass. I explain that it\u2019s a desperate move in American football: You\u2019re running out of time to score, so you lob the ball toward the end zone and hope for the best.The \u2019ail Marie \u2014 as I\u2019ve been pronouncing it \u2014 is the best metaphor I\u2019ve found for the French elections this Sunday. The country that gave us the Enlightenment, Cartesian logic, the Napoleonic Code and possibly reason itself may be about to just throw a ball into the distance and see what happens.Proof of this is the sudden rise of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, until recently an angry ex-Trotskyist on the left wing\u2019s colorful fringe. He probably never thought his policy ideas \u2014 like cutting the workweek to 32 hours (from a punishing 35), letting everyone retire at 60, and possibly leaving the European Union and joining an alliance with Venezuela and Cuba \u2014 would need to pass a reality test.Now he\u2019s one of the four candidates who are neck-and-neck, in a race where a third of voters say they might still change their minds. Thursday night\u2019s shooting on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es \u2014 apparently another act of terrorism here \u2014 makes the results even more uncertain.In response to the attack, each candidate appealed to a different side of the French psyche. The xenophobic nationalist Marine Le Pen warned of \u201cuninterrupted terrorism\u201d and claimed she has a \u201cbattle plan to protect France.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, of the mainstream right-wing party, pledged to make more room in prisons. The centrist Emmanuel Macron vowed to create an anti-ISIS task force, then quoted a line about bravery from \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables.\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon called for sang-froid and decided that the campaign cocktail parties he\u2019d convened around the country should go on.Until now, security had been just one of many campaign themes. A worker at my local supermarket told me he became a M\u00e9lenchoniste because the candidate promised a sixth week of annual vacation. He added that he knew Mr. M\u00e9lenchon would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the French economy, then gave me a guilty look.I\u2019d been worried about the French election for a while. For months, Ms. Le Pen had been leading the polls for the first round of voting. But after an American campaign in which the winner\u2019s policies were conveyed in three-word chants like \u201cBuild a wall\u201d and \u201cLock her up,\u201d I was reassured that French elections are usually rational affairs. In the lead-up to the vote, each candidate unveils a detailed \u201cprogramme\u201d explaining positions on everything from nuclear energy to school lunches.It can feel like you\u2019re comparison shopping for a flat-screen TV: Newspapers run charts showing each candidate\u2019s stand on different issues. It\u2019s not unusual to hear a French voter say she won\u2019t commit until she has read the programs.Despite the usual parade of programs, this year\u2019s election seems less like a reasoned debate and more like an avant-garde circus. Posters for Fran\u00e7ois Asselineau, a minor candidate who wants France to leave the European Union at once, simply say, ominously, \u201cVote your intuition.\u201dMany French voters are already doing that, which means the future of Europe might hinge on pets. An undecided 20-something told me last week that she was waiting to hear the candidates\u2019 views on animals. I assumed she was just an exceptionally committed cat owner, until I saw a poll in which 39 percent of respondents said that animal policy could influence their votes, up from 29 percent in 2012.How did it come to this, in the birthplace of Voltaire? A special issue of Philosophie Magazine, now on newsstands, explains that anti-Enlightenment thinkers have always popped up here. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe in progress,\u201d a headline warns. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust democracy. They\u2019re back.\u201dIt helps to have an electorate that\u2019s more schooled in philosophy than economics. The pro-business newspaper L\u2019Opinion warned on Thursday that there\u2019s so much magical thinking on economic matters right now, \u201cwe\u2019re not very far from a psychosis.\u201dFrance is also recovering from the five-year presidency of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who neither solved the country\u2019s problems nor satisfied its need for a regal figurehead. Now voters are searching for a president who embodies France.The center-right Mr. Fillon may have faced some pesky corruption charges. But Mr. Fillon, the son of a provincial notary, looks just like \u201cthe son of a provincial notary,\u201d Mr. Perrineau said, a reassuringly familiar image that helped him rebound into a competitive third place.

He doesn\u2019t fit into an established French political type, but by a slim margin, he has edged ahead of Ms. Le Pen to become the front-runner in Sunday\u2019s vote. (Current polls show that if he goes head-to-head against Ms. Le Pen in Round 2, he will crush her.) An eager volunteer handed me Mr. Macron\u2019s program on the street the other day, and I practically applauded on the M\u00e9tro while reading it.I\u2019m hoping that, alone in the voting booth, faced with the gravity of their choice, French voters will, too.Pamela Druckerman is the author of \u201cBringing Up B\u00e9b\u00e9: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mike Judge, the Bard of Suck", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "FeatureFrom \u201cIdiocracy\u201d to \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d the writer and director has established himself as America\u2019s foremost chronicler of its own self-destructive tendencies.Supported byI asked Judge about a rumor that surrounds the film: that Fox spiked it because it lampooned so many of Fox\u2019s advertisers, not to mention Fox News itself. (Its anchors, in the film, look as if they just walked in from a porn set.) Judge explained that, actually, the movie had tested abysmally with audiences. And because his first live-action film, \u201cOffice Space,\u201d had become a hit despite initially bombing, Fox figured it might as well not bother with much marketing \u2014 that the movie would take off on its own or recoup its budget in the home-video market. But he\u2019d heard the other version of the story too.As if on cue, Rothman approached our table, wearing glasses and a pinkish Oxford, carrying an antique lacrosse stick with a tennis ball in the basket, cradling it back and forth as he talked. He was with a friend named Lars Tiffany, who was wearing a Virginia Lacrosse shirt and, as a matter of fact, had recently been installed as the head coach of men\u2019s lacrosse at the University of Virginia, and had taken his team to the studio to meet Rothman. \u201cThis is Mike Judge himself,\u201d Rothman said to Tiffany. Then Judge introduced me to Rothman, explaining that I was from The Times: \u201cBe careful what you say.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re doing a profile of Mike?\u201d Rothman asked, beaming with excitement, which seemed to be his default mode. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly do a profile of Mike without talking to me! About his [expletive] movie career! Goddamn right! \u2018Office Space\u2019! \u2018Office Space\u2019 and \u2018Idiocracy\u2019!\u201d Judge, who speaks so softly I often found myself nudging my recorder closer to him, was beginning to tell Rothman that we had just been talking about \u201cIdiocracy\u201d when Rothman started up again. \u201cO.K., so lemme just say, I\u2019ll give you the simple answer: \u2018Office Space\u2019 is to his credit, and \u2018Idiocracy\u2019 is entirely my fault.\u201d He turned to Judge. \u201cRight?\u201d\u201cI agree,\u201d Judge said.\u201cHe was [expletive] ahead of his time. As always. As always.\u201d\u201cI should\u2019ve made it 10 years later and set in the present.\u201dAfter lunch, Judge and I made our way back to his editing bay on the lot. HBO rents space from Sony for the production of \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d and Judge was there putting together the first episode of the new season, working from a room with blackout curtains over windows that would otherwise look out onto a small warren where the R.V. from \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d is parked \u2014 alongside, somewhat less impressively, Walter White\u2019s Pontiac Aztek. Judge sat down with his co-showrunner, Alec Berg, their assistants and his editor to watch the episode for what might as well have been the thousandth time.\u201cSilicon Valley\u201d concerns a small start-up called Pied Piper that is constantly bullied by a tech giant called Hooli, when it is not being brought low by its own employees. The fourth season opens with Richard Hendricks, the lead character and company founder, trying once again to turn his visionary compression algorithm into a viable business. We all watched as he paid a visit to Monica, a partner at the venture-capital firm that backs him, but found that someone else had taken over her office. It\u2019s immediately clear that this new occupant is less a dreamer than a destroyer of dreams, which is no simple feat considering he\u2019s onscreen for all of 10 seconds. But the job of comedy writers, sometimes, is to draw in bold lines, as you would with stage makeup. The perfect details were all there: The guy leans back in his chair with a smug smirk, seated beneath a framed Tom Brady jersey, and \u2014 amazingly, considering the scene was shot weeks earlier \u2014 in his hands, he holds a lacrosse stick.The other pole of Judge\u2019s work can be found in the 1992 short \u201cFrog Baseball,\u201d his first starring the adolescent goons Beavis and Butt-Head. The two venture out into the Texas chaparral, strip malls fading into the distance, the landscape seeming to ask: What do you expect to happen? They catch a grasshopper and stick a firecracker \u201cin its butt,\u201d celebrating its demise by shouting the chord progression from \u201cIron Man.\u201d They find a frog and hit it with a bat, its corpse coming to rest amid crushed beer cans and spent shotgun shells; the boys do \u201cSmoke on the Water.\u201d Then they find a poodle.He had an out: For a few years, he made a living playing stand-up bass with the blues guitarist Anson Funderburgh\u2019s band. He moved to Dallas, where he bought a home for about $85,000 with his wife at the time. Back then, banks were still offering high-interest CDs that paid about 10 percent a year. Judge sat down one day to calculate how much he\u2019d have to plow into one of these to avoid working for the rest of his life, living on interest alone. It was $360,000. This early-retirement scheme would be made irrelevant by the colossal success of \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head,\u201d which thrived in part by savagely roasting both MTV (the channel that aired it) and the generation its programming had spawned.But Judge\u2019s frustration with his early experience in the white-collar work force had only temporarily receded, and it would soon come rushing back in the form of \u201cOffice Space.\u201d The 1999 film reprised the characters from the \u201cMilton\u201d short and expanded on the theme it explored: the way work not only robs you of your free will but also refashions that will in its own image. It\u2019s such a brutal portrayal of workplace misery that its most useful points of comparison date back to when office culture was first unleashed on humanity. Many liken it to Herman Melville\u2019s \u201cBartleby, the Scrivener\u201d (a story Judge has not yet read), and I still recall a high-school English teacher invoking the movie in an effort to impress on the class what Franz Kafka\u2019s life was like, toiling away by day at an insurance company in the twilight of the Hapsburg empire.If you set aside his long-running TV show \u201cKing of the Hill,\u201d which is much too loving to be considered satire, Judge\u2019s corpus of work cleaves neatly into two pieces. In one, people are driven nearly to ruin in their efforts to escape the crush of immense managerial apparatuses (\u201cOffice Space,\u201d \u201cExtract\u201d). In the other, we see the opposite \u2014 imbeciles left completely and terrifyingly to their own devices (\u201cBeavis and Butt-Head,\u201d \u201cIdiocracy\u201d). \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d remarkably, fuses both of these impulses. The tech world it skewers is the most dynamic sector of our economy, possibly representing the greatest concentration of brainpower and capital ever seen in human history, creating products that insinuate their control into every last corner of our lives. And yet it\u2019s nevertheless lousy with man-children who seem to want nothing more than the ability to prolong adolescence, theirs and ours alike, and have the means and the license and the asinine product ideas to do so. If \u201cIdiocracy\u201d imagined that America would one day amuse itself into ruin, then \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d offers a compelling case for how we\u2019ll go about doing it \u2014 not in spite of our best and brightest, but because of them.In the middle of all this was Judge, whose appearance sits somewhere in the overlap between \u201caging surfer\u201d (which he is) and \u201coff-duty cop\u201d (which he is certainly not). At 55, he\u2019s trim with a powerful-looking upper body and somehow presents a sense of calm despite quivering with nervous energy. He sat at his monitors, eyes darting back and forth between the two feeds, legs pumping like pistons, chewing gum so furiously that I could, at times, see the muscles in his temples pulsating like an exposed heart. He has the habit, when making decisions, of clutching his skull as if it might otherwise split open. Anxious as he seemed, he never raised his voice and still laughed at the bits he liked, even on repeat viewings. (I asked him later, half-kidding, if directing stresses him out to the point that he still harbors fantasies about leaving the work force completely. \u201cOh, no, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cTotally.\u201d)The portrayal of the tech world on \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d might scan as absurd to anyone outside the industry, but within the valley the show is known and appreciated for its verisimilitude. Not only does it have a technical adviser in the writers\u2019 room and on set; it also has a small research staff. Judge and Berg frequently meet with a network of contacts in the valley for material, in subjournalistic fashion, offering anonymity or compositing as cover to protect their sources. Thomas Middleditch, who plays Richard, told me he gets two responses from people in tech: They either love the show for its accuracy or find it so accurate that it\u2019s too stressful to watch.It could be said that a satire so beloved by its target must be a failure, but the valley\u2019s embrace of the show underscores, in a way, the accuracy of the critique \u2014 a dynamic apparent at the convention. \u201cYou have to be careful,\u201d warned Clay Tarver, a writer on the show, \u201cbecause if you start talking to them, then they\u2019ll start pitching you their thing. So I just don\u2019t talk to anyone. It\u2019s a pretty good rule of thumb here.\u201d The actors, he said, are pitched all the time, wherever they go \u2014 which would be the equivalent of Christopher Guest being handed demo tapes by aspiring musicians who enjoyed his performance in \u201cSpinal Tap.\u201d Between takes, I watched a bearded employee of an electric-skateboard company enter full mall-kiosk-tout mode, aggressively selling Hollywood actors and extras on the merits of his product. Martin Starr, who plays Gilfoyle, took one for a spin and was then shown how the board\u2019s battery popped out, making it convenient for air travel.I tried to heed Tarver\u2019s advice as I wandered around the faux-convention in the late afternoon, but I wound up failing. The initial pressure of the morning had given way to boredom among the extras and start-up employees. At the edge of the set, a man sat in a three-wheeled conveyance called a Vanderhall Laguna, looking vaguely disappointed. I walked by the Roku booth, where the \u201cemployees\u201d were lounging on the carpet, looking at their phones. They were extras, it turned out, and when I asked why Roku hadn\u2019t bothered sending real employees, their answer was interrupted by a voice from the next booth: \u201cBecause Roku doesn\u2019t have an exciting product to talk about!\u201dIt was the skateboard guy again. Though his prop lanyard identified him as Chris Riddle, he introduced himself as Dave. I couldn\u2019t help liking him, and we fell into conversation as Judge and the cast prepared a shot at Pied Piper\u2019s booth. Dave was impressed with how true to life the booth was, especially its use of AstroTurf. He had just been at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, he said, and AstroTurf was definitely the hallmark of a shabby booth. (Unknown to him, the \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d team had been there, too.) It would\u2019ve been even more accurate, he said, if it had Ikea furniture \u2014 and from there, all of a sudden, I was being pitched. Dave had run to Ikea that very morning, he said, because a Best Buy in Mountain View had decided to sell his product, and he\u2019d had to give them all his promotional fixtures; in fact, Dave said, he had big plans to place the board in dozens more stores. Then he added something strange: He said he\u2019d spoken with a procurer for a Police Department about using the skateboards for patrols.The entire conversation seemed to bolster Judge\u2019s case for verisimilitude-as-satire. The implicit suggestion of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d is that if you want to see how the tech world\u2019s ostensibly freewheeling nature conceals a willingness to be party to systems of bureaucratic and governmental control \u2014 not to mention how it runs on a crass sort of hucksterism, and how it might represent a terrible misallocation of wealth and intellect \u2014 all you really need to do is look straight at it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Tax Plan Would Shift Trillions From U.S. Coffers to the Richest", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s proposal to slash individual and business taxes and erase a surtax that funds the Affordable Care Act would amount to a multitrillion-dollar shift from federal coffers to America\u2019s richest families and their heirs, setting up a politically fraught battle over how best to use the government\u2019s already strained resources.But the vast majority of benefits would accrue to the highest earners and largest holders of wealth, according to economists and analysts, accounting for a lopsided portion of the proposal\u2019s costs.Reducing the rate on capital gains, noncorporate business taxes and those in the highest bracket, as well as repealing the alternative minimum tax, would also ease the burden on wealthier Americans. So would the repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 3.8 percent surtax on the investment income of high earners, put in place to subsidize health coverage for low-income Americans.\u201cThese are all afflictions of the affluent,\u201d Mr. Kleinbard said.There is no way to know how the mathematics of the proposal would work, since the White House offered no cost estimates, no detail about which incomes would be taxed at what levels and no information about tax deductions or other breaks that might be eliminated to make up for the lost revenue.On Thursday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, suggested that tax benefits for retirement savings would be rolled back to mitigate the cost of the tax cuts, the kind of tough decision that makes a rewrite of the tax code so politically difficult. But within minutes, White House officials said Mr. Spicer had misspoken.Officials instead said specifics would come later, as negotiations unfolded with members of Congress to draft legislation.The administration\u2019s silence on many crucial details of the proposal was by design, to leave room for what promise to be intense negotiations with lawmakers in Congress, said Rohit Kumar, the leader of PwC\u2019s Washington National Tax Services and a former senior Republican Senate aide.Yet without specifics, he added, \u201cyou can\u2019t make anything but a wild guess on what the distributional effects of the proposal would be.\u201d\u201cWhat the administration put out yesterday is all of the good news,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. \u201cThey\u2019ve withheld on the bad news.\u201dBut estimates of the impacts for some of the cuts that were outlined Wednesday, such as the estate tax and alternative minimum tax repeals, can be made, and they run directly counter to the populist themes that animated Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. He has often stated his concern for ordinary working men and women who he contends were forgotten under previous administrations but have risen to the top of the priority list under his leadership.Many economists who analyzed a similar plan Mr. Trump proposed during his presidential campaign found that it would have disproportionately helped the richest. William G. Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, estimated that just over 50 percent of the benefits of that proposal would have gone to the top 1 percent of taxpayers.The new proposal \u201closes probably something in the neighborhood of $5 trillion in revenue over 10 years with regressive tax cuts that exacerbate the inequalities that already exist in our economy,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was a top economist in the Obama administration.Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team argues that there is no disconnect; the tax reductions they are seeking, they argue, will ultimately help all Americans, including the poorest, by spurring growth that will translate into more jobs and better wages.Still, it seems almost inevitable that the blueprint, should it eventually yield legislation, would violate the vow Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, made that the administration would provide \u201cno absolute tax cut for the upper class.\u201dThat axiom, uttered by Mr. Mnuchin in November and quickly named the \u201cMnuchin rule\u201d by skeptical Democrats, was based on his insistence that any tax reductions at the top would be matched by the elimination of deductions and loopholes.\u201cIt is hard to know what the overall effects would be, but a plan that is intended to reduce taxes on business income and investment income is going to provide substantial benefits to wealthier individuals, and the bulk of the benefits in this plan would go to them,\u201d said Ed Lorenzen, a senior adviser for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal policy education group. \u201cIt would probably work out to be a significant shift in the distribution of the tax code.\u201dWant to know how the proposed tax plan will affect you? Answer these questions to find out.One major reason is Mr. Trump\u2019s idea to allow the income of owner-operated companies, including his real estate concern, hedge funds and large partnerships, to be taxed at a 15 percent rate \u2014 the same rate corporations would pay under his plan \u2014 rather than at the individual income tax rate, which now tops out at 39.6 percent and would be set at 35 percent by Mr. Trump.That would potentially allow doctors, lawyers and others who are part of such firms to structure their compensation as business rather than personal income and effectively enjoy a substantial tax cut. The Tax Policy Center estimated last year that the proposal would cost $1.5 trillion over a decade.Higher earners also appear likely to reap the greatest benefit from repealing the alternative minimum tax, which is set at a marginal rate of 28 percent and falls most heavily on those who earn between $250,000 and $1 million. In 2013, President Barack Obama and Congress reached agreement on a \u201cfix\u201d that shielded middle-class families from the tax. So any repeal now would benefit wealthier taxpayers.Only a fifth of taxpayers who earn above $1 million were affected by the provision, a parallel tax system that limits the deductions and other tax breaks available to them, in part because interest and investment income are exempt.At the same time, lower- and middle-income families could be in a worse position. The White House proposes to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three: 10, 25 and 35 percent. But no one yet knows where the income cutoff lines are being drawn. People who end up being pushed into a lower bracket would be better off, but those kicked into a higher bracket would not be.Families with after-tax income between roughly $19,000 and $76,000, for example, are now in the 15 percent marginal tax bracket, which is slated for elimination.\u201cThat\u2019s where the middle of America is,\u201d Mr. Kleinbard said. While some may drop into the new 10 percent bracket, others could be nudged up into the 25 percent range.Increasing the standard deduction to about $24,000 for couples might also appear to help most families, but that is not necessarily the case, Mr. Kleinbard pointed out. Larger families, which now benefit from being able to add a deduction for every additional member of their household, could lose out.\u201cAt the bottom end, the typical family will be worse off if personal exemptions go away,\u201d he said.Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Washington, and Patricia Cohen from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Trump\u2019s Trade Deficit Obsession: Deficient Analysis", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisThis is the central assumption behind Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated vow to take a meat cleaver to the North American Free Trade Agreement, redrawing the terms of commerce with Mexico. This is the spirit in which he has promised to confront China over its systematic job-killing machine, beginning later this week as he greets the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.But Mr. Trump\u2019s portrayal of trade deficits entails crucial departures from economic reality.In his accounting, international trade is a zero-sum affair, as if every country were jockeying for a share of forever limited amounts of business. An auto part made in Mexico and later included in a finished vehicle destined for a suburban driveway in California represents jobs hijacked from the Midwestern factory that should have employed American hands to build everything.Trade is not zero-sum. Expanded trade has historically tended to support economic growth, which generates more spoils to be divvied up for all.Economists generally dismiss bilateral trade deficits as essentially meaningless, for reasons easily recognizable in the rest of everyday life. Most people surely run lopsided trade deficits with their dentists, handing these professionals their dollars without expecting them to purchase anything in return.One may assume that successful dentists will distribute their profits throughout the economy \u2014 on marketing, accounting, laundry and streaming music services. One way or another, these dollars generate jobs and income for other people. So it is with countries.China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States, which reached $347 billion last year, does in part reflect dubious Chinese practices, including lavishing state credit on favored exporters and flooding world markets with low-cost goods to keep its laborers employed.Yet even if China were a paragon of fair trading practices, it would almost certainly run a surplus with the United States. Despite tremendous economic advances, China remains a relatively low-income country, home to hundreds of millions of people who cannot afford the more sophisticated fruits of the American economy. Though wages have risen in recent years, China\u2019s fundamental advantage still involves making goods cheaply.The Trump administration faces the problem that China\u2019s high trade barriers are allowed by the World Trade Organization, because China entered the group as a developing country and insists it still is one.Trade imbalances with the world are a more complex matter, one that is subject to genuine debate among economists. But the story is different for every country, depending on its size, the maturity of its economy, the sorts of goods and services it tends to export, and the reason for the imbalance in trade at any moment in time.In the case of the United States, trade deficits with the world have been a feature of economic life for more than three decades, a sweep of time that has seen economic booms, the worst downturn since the Great Depression and plenty of events in between.\u201cTrade deficits aren\u2019t a good barometer,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.The only thing one can say with certainty is that the deficit reflects how Americans have consumed more than they have been willing to save, purchasing from foreigners who have in turn invested in the United States. To the degree that this is a problem \u2014 and opinions vary \u2014 most economists suggest that it is best addressed with tax policies and incentives to save, rather than by impeding trade.The American trade deficit with the world contracted sharply in 2008 and 2009, but this was not the result of a sudden resumption of old-school saving. It reflected a cratering of consumer spending in the midst of the Great Recession. Calling that progress would be like applauding a nation gripped by famine for limiting its intake of saturated fats.But if trade deficits do not lend themselves to certain conclusions in the realm of economic policy, they have served as highly useful political fodder. Politicians use trade deficits \u2014 money departing the nation! \u2014 as a handy, if flawed, explanation for why paychecks are inadequate.Back in the 1980s, it was Japan that played the boogeyman in the American political conversation, the goliath believed to be gobbling up American prosperity with every Sony Walkman it sent toward American shores. More recently, China has assumed that role.Now, with Mr. Trump in the White House, much of human civilization has seemingly been cast as the predator class \u2014 Germany, Mexico, China, willfully fleecing Americans through a series of trade deals extended by a Washington elite too clueless to fight them.Liberalized trade has proved punishing for lower-skilled factory laborers clustered in the American South and Midwest. Entire industrial communities have been upended by joblessness, mass foreclosure and attendant ills like substance abuse, domestic violence and depression.But trade has proved a boon to bankers, executives and multinational corporations that harness low-wage labor in distant lands to make their products. Much of Walmart\u2019s business model was built on a reliance on Chinese factories. American consumers have grown accustomed to low prices for clothing, shoes and other goods.None of this action gets captured in narrow obsessions over trade deficits.\u201cTrump hugely mis-frames it,\u201d said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, who is a persistent critic of trade deals. \u201cWe have U.S. companies that are hugely profiting by having access to low-cost labor in China. Portraying that China won and we lost is 180 degrees wrong. Factory laborers are the losers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans\u2019 Fiscal Discipline Wilts in Face of Trump\u2019s Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 From an office high above Manhattan, the billionaire Peter G. Peterson has warned for years that the federal government is borrowing too much money. So have other Republican grandees, like former Senator Alan K. Simpson, who made dire predictions about the federal debt in a 2010 report. Republicans in Congress have been eager to sing from the same hymnal so long as a Democrat was in the White House.But when Republicans take charge, their fiscal rectitude sometimes starts to waver. The broad Republican support this week for President Trump\u2019s plan to sharply reduce taxes suggests that those who hang on to austere concerns about debt will now be facing former allies who want to chase economic growth.Some Republicans are rallying around the idea that less taxation is more important than less debt, just as they did during the Republican presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. That shift is a break with the die-hard hawks of the anti-deficit industrial complex, who have long warned of calamitous consequences to the American economy.\u201cThis is about math, not mystery and magic,\u201d said Mr. Simpson, who was a chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s bipartisan commission on the federal debt in 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s madness to think that you can have a tax cut without some reduction in spending or some increase in revenue.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s proposal, while short on details, calls for cutting taxes on corporations and individuals, including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and doubling the size of the standard deduction for individuals. Analysts estimated that it could add as much as $7 trillion over a decade to the federal debt, depending on what Congress eventually packs into a tax bill.That is particularly notable because the debt has already increased sharply over the last decade, growing from 34.8 percent of the nation\u2019s annual economic output at the end of 2006 to 76.5 percent at the end of 2016. Prominent figures like Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and a Democrat, have urged lawmakers to curb that growth.The prospect that the debt might balloon again instead is stirring anxieties within a range of well-financed groups that have long regarded Republicans as their natural allies.\u201cRight now, we are all about trying to figure out how to offset the cost of this framework and coming up with pro-growth tax reform ideas that won\u2019t worsen our really dire fiscal situation,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cIf the president pursues this proposal of seeing through the largest-ever tax cut rather than reform, he will also be the president who oversees the largest expansion of our country\u2019s debt \u2014 and that\u2019s probably not the legacy he\u2019s looking for.\u201dMs. MacGuineas said that her group had already started pulling together specific proposals to make the tax legislation less costly. The White House plan, for example, has thus far only made passing reference to proposals for closing loopholes and broadening the tax base, she said.\u201cIt will be all hands on deck to try to come up with ideas,\u201d Ms. MacGuineas said.Mr. Peterson created the Peterson Foundation in 2008, with an endowment of $1 billion, to raise public awareness of what he saw as an alarming increase in federal borrowing. The federal debt increased sharply during the early years of the Obama administration, largely because of programs that automatically disburse more money during economic downturns. When unemployment increases, so does federal spending on unemployment benefits.Michael A. Peterson, the chief executive of the foundation and the son of its founder, warned lawmakers against forgetting that the nation is already deeply in debt.\u201cReforming taxes in a way that worsens our fiscal condition is counterproductive because adding to our national debt hurts economic growth,\u201d he said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cTax changes that increase the deficit would harm the economy by raising interest costs, reducing wages and crowding out public and private investments in our future.\u201dConservative lawmakers, advised by conservative economists, once regarded government debt as a public health problem. The government is borrowing money that might otherwise be available to private businesses, which is bad for economic growth. The money must be repaid eventually, which requires higher taxes, which is also bad for economic growth. And higher debt leaves less room for government borrowing during a genuine emergency.But Reagan, advised by economists like Milton Friedman, argued that taxation was a more important economic problem, and Republicans began to prioritize tax cuts.This was, at the least, very good politics. President George H. W. Bush was not re-elected in 1992 in part because he did not join the revolution. He continued to advocate fiscal rectitude, famously agreeing to raise taxes because he wanted to reduce the federal debt. His son did not repeat that mistake during his presidency, and passed a tax cut.The nation\u2019s financial situation was markedly different in 2001. The government was running a hefty annual surplus; it was actually on course to pay off its debts completely.Democrats have been quick to accuse Republicans of ideological inconsistency. \u201cThe Republican plan is just steeped in hypocrisy,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said Thursday.\u201cFor the last eight years, all we heard from our Republican colleagues was that Obama was raising the deficit, and we need to cut programs that benefit the poor and middle class,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cAll of a sudden, now, with a Republican president and a proposed tax cut for the wealthy, we\u2019re hearing from the other side of the aisle, \u2018Deficits don\u2019t matter.\u2019\u201dWant to know how the proposed tax plan will affect you? Answer these questions to find out.Others still hold the view that deficits matter. Josh Gordon, the policy director of the Concord Coalition, another group that advocates fiscal discipline, said it was heartening that Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, have expressed a commitment to changes that are \u201crevenue neutral.\u201dRepresentative Peter Roskam, the Illinois Republican who is chairman of the Tax Policy Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee, warned that his party should resist taking the easy route and passing temporary tax cuts in favor of making deeper changes to the tax code.\u201cThe best thing to do is to create a tax policy that\u2019s permanent, and permanent means paid for,\u201d Mr. Roskam told MSNBC on Wednesday. \u201cSo that\u2019s the new fault line that is developing.\u201dBut some Republicans see an important difference between deficits caused by more spending and deficits caused by tax cuts. They insist that tax cuts will encourage economic growth sufficient to compensate for lower rates. The government will get a smaller piece of a larger pie.Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said that he was committed to balancing the federal budget and that tax cuts could help achieve that goal. \u201cI\u2019m a supply-sider. I recognize the dynamic value of the nature of some tax cuts,\u201d Mr. Flake said. \u201cNot all tax cuts are created equally. Corporate tax cuts should be very stimulative.\u201dRepresentative Dave Brat, Republican of Virginia, who spent most of his career as an economics professor, said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come clean with people that this is not optimal, but tax cuts are a way to drive productivity.\u201d The pain of a short-term increase to deficits, he said, was pain worth enduring for the sake of growth.\u201cThe one thing you make an exception for is tax cuts.\u201dMatt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Beginning with references to his hero Robert Frost, a cheap shot at a Swedish poet Nobel Prize winner and vague generalities about \u201cvarious English-language novelists\u201d who might be annoyed about Dylan\u2019s award, Orr goes on to an originalist interpretation of literary awards that would be admired by Antonin Scalia. He further bemoans the widespread use of the word \u201cpoetry\u201d in our everyday descriptions of beauty, be it about blancmange or a shovel pass, particularly by those having \u201climited experience with poems.\u201dIs this essay really about Dylan\u2019s poetry or about the critic\u2019s own superior language and lofty perspective? The only sample we get of Dylan\u2019s writing is a throwaway line under an old photo. Mr. Orr, the times began changing a long time back, and Dylan was there to help us on the way. John Ashbery probably likes his work too.JOHN AUNENYACK, N.Y.\u2b25To the Editor:David Orr makes some excellent points in his wonderful column about Bob Dylan\u2019s winning the Nobel Prize in Literature. But the award to Dylan comes down to a technicality: It is not the Nobel Prize in Poetry or the Nobel Prize in Novels; it is for literature. And as Alfred Nobel specifically stated in his will, the prize is intended for the person who, in the literary field, had produced \u201cthe most outstanding work in an ideal direction.\u201d In addition, the laureate would be determined by \u201cthe Academy in Stockholm,\u201d which was specified by the statutes of the Nobel Foundation to mean the Swedish Academy. Those statutes defined literature as \u201cnot only belles-lettres, but also other writings which, by virtue of their form and style, possess literary value.\u201dSo, worthy as Orr\u2019s analysis of the relationship between song-lyric writing and poetry may be, the bottom line in terms of whether Dylan qualified for the prize is not whether his lyrics are poetry. What is required is that the lyrics possess literary value, and that the author singularly distinguishes himself, in the field of all literature, in their creation. It would be hard to argue with the academy\u2019s determination that Dylan succeeded in meeting those criteria.RICHARD MARGOLINCHERRY HILL, N.J.\u2b25To the Editor:David Orr perpetuates the mistaken notion that Dylan is the first songwriter/musician to win the Nobel literature prize. In 1913, the prize was awarded to the Bengali songwriter/poet/playwright/novelist/artist Rabindranath Tagore, the first non-Western Nobelist.The book that made his reputation in the West, and for which he was awarded the Nobel, was \u201cGitanjali,\u201d a collection of more than 100 songs composed by Tagore. Since the lyrics were not published with music (though Tagore composed music for over 2,000 songs), they were called poems by Western critics, despite the translated title \u201cSong Offerings\u201d printed on the title page of the English edition of the book.Tagore wrote so many songs (and yes, he also was a musician) that they became a musical genre in themselves, rabindrasangeet. Two of his songs were chosen as the national anthems of India and Bangladesh. A century after his Nobel, Tagore\u2019s songs are sung throughout the Indian subcontinent by rich and poor alike.

France has been mistreated, in people\u2019s minds, for years.\u201dMs. Le Pen\u2019s words created a small eruption in an already heated campaign, drawing strong criticism by politicians right, left and center and by Jewish groups, who all saw it as an echo of her party\u2019s anti-Semitic roots.In addition, the remark contradicted over 20 years of state policy, which has been to recognize French responsibility for the roundup, in which thousands of men, women and children were rousted from their homes by French police officers, parked in a stinking overcrowded sports arena in Paris \u2014 the V\u00e9lodrome d\u2019Hiver, which has since been destroyed \u2014 and eventually deported to their deaths in concentration camps.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s words also flew in the face of over four decades of historical research into the eager collaboration of the wartime French government, which had been installed in the spa town of Vichy. It was the French government\u2019s police chief, Ren\u00e9 Bousquet \u2014 a favorite of the head of the government at the time \u2014 who organized the roundup, impressing his German counterparts with his energy.\u201cVichy did not have a knife to its throat,\u201d the historian Philippe Burrin wrote of the Vel d\u2019Hiv roundup in his landmark book, \u201cLa France \u00e0 l\u2019Heure Allemande,\u201d (\u201cFrance Under the Germans\u201d).\u201cWithout the help of the police\u201d \u2014 the French police \u2014 \u201cthe SS was paralyzed,\u201d Mr. Burrin wrote. \u201cThe French authorities were entirely disposed to get rid of foreign Jews,\u201d he wrote, referring to the officials\u2019 offer to the Nazis, on that occasion at least, to hand over Jews who were not French citizens.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s campaign has been oriented around an extreme form of nationalism, and she often criticizes historians and others who bring up the uglier aspects of France\u2019s past, as she did on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve taught our children that they have all the reasons in the world to criticize it, to only see its darkest historical aspects,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to be proud of being French.\u201dMainstream candidates on the right have uttered similar sentiments about respecting France\u2019s \u201cnational narrative.\u201dBut the Vel d\u2019Hiv and France\u2019s wartime treatment of its Jews have generally been off-limits to this sort of historical revisionism. As the American historian Robert Paxton has pointed out, France was unique in Western Europe in that it was the only country to use its own police force for roundups in territory not occupied by the Germans.Ever since President Jacques Chirac declared in a speech in 1995 commemorating the Vel d\u2019Hiv roundup that \u201cFrance, on that day, committed the irreparable,\u201d the question of French complicity and guilt has appeared largely settled, officially at least. \u201cGoing back on its word, it delivered those whom it was protecting to their executioners,\u201d Mr. Chirac said at the time.On Sunday night, to quiet the growing polemic, Ms. Le Pen tried to place her words in the context of others who have disassociated the Vichy government from France itself. \u201cI consider that France and its Republic were in London during the occupation, and that the Vichy regime wasn\u2019t France,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said in a news release.There again, the historians\u2019 verdict is different. The Vichy government initially enjoyed wide support, its functionaries and officials came largely from the prewar bureaucracy, and many went on to have excellent careers in government and business after the war. Foreign countries, including the United States, maintained embassies at Vichy and had cordial relations with it.\u201cTo isolate Vichy from the French population, that doesn\u2019t hold up for one second,\u201d one of France\u2019s leading historians of the period, Henry Rousso, said on Monday. \u201cYou only have to look at the newsreels of the crowds applauding P\u00e9tain,\u201d Mr. Rousso said, referring to the wartime Vichy leader, Marshal P\u00e9tain. \u201cNot all of France was at Vichy. But a part of it was.\u201dEx-wartime Nazi collaborators were prominent in the early leadership of the National Front in the 1970s \u2014 including members of the French SS and collaborationist Milice, and even a leading official of the French wartime anti-Jewish agency, a minor cog in the Holocaust.By the end of the 1980s, Holocaust denial \u201chad become a wholesale part of the Front\u2019s ideology,\u201d the historian Val\u00e9rie Igounet has written.

{"Headline": "Marine Le Pen May Get a Lift From an Unlikely Source: The Far Left", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The far-right leader Marine Le Pen faces an uphill battle in France\u2019s presidential runoff, less than two weeks away. But she saw daylight through a small window on Tuesday, and from an unlikely source: her defeated counterpart on the far left.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s critics say his obstinacy is petulant, wounded pride that can only help Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front. But it also speaks to the passions that Mr. Macron, a seemingly mild-mannered centrist, provokes in large parts of the French electorate, far left and far right, who share a view of the 39-year-old former investment banker as a fire-breathing incarnation of evil market culture.As populism and anger over the impacts of globalization energize much of the electorate, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s stand has added a new element of uncertainty into the final round of voting on May 7.It has also set off a dynamic in the French race much like when Hillary Clinton defeated Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primaries last year \u2014 leaving his supporters, still in the thrall of populism, up for grabs as party allegiances broke down.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s 19.6 percent of the vote Sunday is now a rich booty \u2014 triple the score of the mainstream Socialist Party, whose collapse has elevated Mr. M\u00e9lenchon to be de facto leader of the French left. He even won in big cities like Marseille and Lille.But it is not clear where that vote will now go, not least because far-left populism and far-right populism may have more in common than the seemingly vast gulf between them on the political spectrum would suggest.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, 65, a former Trotskyite, ran a campaign denouncing banks, globalization and the European Union \u2014 just like Ms. Le Pen.Both were competing for working-class voters suspicious of the global financial elite. Mr. Macron had already \u201cruined the lives of thousands of people\u201d with his pro-market policies, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said during the campaign.And like Ms. Le Pen, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon regularly attacked the news media during the campaign. On election night, after his defeat, he tore into what he called \u201cmediacrats\u201d and \u201coligarchs.\u201d They were \u201crejoicing\u201d over \u201ctwo candidates who approve and want to maintain the current institutions\u201d of government, the longtime fan of Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez said.The shared lines of attack gave the candidates at the political extremes their best showings ever, if from opposite ends of the spectrum. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon almost doubled his 2012 result, refused to concede for hours and then attacked both finalists, refusing to distinguish between them.In that, he is alone. Across the board, politicians and other former candidates have urgently counseled their supporters to vote for Mr. Macron to block Ms. Le Pen\u2019s path to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon is having none of it.Instead, his party has announced an internet \u201cconsultation\u201d of his followers, with three choices offered for the May 7 vote: a blank ballot, a vote for Mr. Macron or an abstention. A vote for Ms. Le Pen is not one of the choices, and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s aides insist that is the last thing they want.On Tuesday, a site linked to Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s party bristled with debate, with one poster saying Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen represented \u201cthe failure of the system\u201d and others agonizing over whether to abstain or vote blank.Critics of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon \u2014 who have become numerous in the Socialist Party and Mr. Macron\u2019s camp \u2014 say a blank ballot or abstention can only help Ms. Le Pen.\u201cIt\u2019s his pride.

{"Headline": "With a Hollywood Writers\u2019 Strike Looming, Here\u2019s What to Know", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The threat of a Hollywood strike is getting real.A strike would have serious implications. When writers walked out a decade ago, the impasse cost the Los Angeles economy an estimated $2.5 billion. As production halted, income dried up not only for writers but also for set decorators, caterers, limo drivers and florists. Fans were not thrilled, either, as television schedules became a sea of reruns.Here is what you need to know this time around. How likely is a strike?Longtime Hollywood power players \u2014 agents, studio executives, labor lawyers \u2014 put the chance at roughly 51 percent. But it changes by the day. How would it affect television?Late-night comedy shows would instantly revert to reruns. Summer reality shows, such as \u201cBig Brother,\u201d would arrive \u2014 the writer-producers who work on them have a different contract \u2014 but some scripted series scheduled for the fall would most likely be delayed. A strike could be a death knell for daytime soap operas, which rely on a new episode almost every weekday, unless producers bring in nonunion writers, which happened during the last strike.What about movies?At first, it would be business as usual. Because big-budget event films take years to make, summer movies would continue to arrive on schedule. Films with finished scripts \u2014 and perhaps some with not-so-finished ones \u2014 would continue to go into production. Movie executives really started to sweat the last writers\u2019 strike, which took place in the winter, only when it threatened to derail the Academy Awards, a crucial marketing platform.How long could a strike go on?Anybody\u2019s guess. The Writers Guild walked out for 100 days in 2007-8 and 155 days in 1988. In both cases, the most in-demand writers eventually got tired of losing income and applied pressure to wrap it up. (Thousands of guild members are unemployed in any given year.)Why are writers upset? With the boom in scripted television shows, isn\u2019t there more work than ever?There are definitely more union-made series \u2014 at least 300 last season, or about 40 percent more than two years before that. But networks are ordering fewer episodes per season (10 to 13) than in the past (22 to 24). So a series writing job pays less.At the same time, in a contract provision known as exclusivity, most TV writers can write for only one series at a time, taking them off the market for up to a year. And to top it off, reruns don\u2019t attract very many viewers anymore, limiting residual payments.What does the union want?Negotiators started with a laundry list of requests, including easing that exclusivity rule, but it boils down to raises and bigger payments from studios for the guild\u2019s health plan.Why won\u2019t studios give it to them?Studios are also adamant that writers agree to fundamental changes in how the union health plan functions to avoid future bailout demands.Why is it always the writers who go on strike?As a rule, the directors are well paid and feel valued by entertainment companies, and the actors\u2019 union can be a bag of infighting cats. That leaves the writers.According to historians, the friction between \u201cscribes\u201d and studios dates to the end of the silent film era. Studios suddenly needed writers to provide witty dialogue, so they imported wordsmiths from New York. But they treated writers \u2014 or at least many writers have felt this way ever since \u2014 as expendable stenographers.Put another way, writers see their craft as artistic expression. For the most part, studios see it as commerce.An article on Tuesday about a potential walkout by the Writers Guild of America misstated the year of a previous strike. It was 1988, not 1998.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Birth of \u2018Vietnamization\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byVietnam '67On Oct. 14, 1966, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who had been principally responsible for waging war against the Communists in South Vietnam, threw in the towel. A little over a year before he officially resigned as secretary, he sent a long memorandum to President Lyndon Johnson, artfully admitting that he and his Pentagon had no strategy to end the war on favorable terms for the South Vietnamese.Johnson quickly turned to others for a new approach. A month after McNamara\u2019s memo, the president asked two aides \u2014 Walt Rostow, his national security adviser, and Robert Komer, a National Security Council staff member \u2014 to come up with something more effective than McNamara\u2019s tactics of attrition and bombing. Their recommendation, delivered on Dec. 13, 1966, was to \u201ccomplement our anti-main force campaign and bombing offensive with greatly increased efforts to pacify the countryside and increase the attractive power\u201d of the government of Vietnam. Long before the term became a household word, \u201cVietnamization\u201d was born.To put the plan into effect, Johnson chose three men: Ellsworth Bunker to be ambassador in Saigon; Komer to lead a new counterinsurgency organization; and Gen. Creighton Abrams to build up South Vietnam\u2019s military capacity to defeat invading North Vietnamese regulars.Bunker was to work with the Vietnamese leadership and ensure coordination of all efforts \u2014 civil and military, American and Vietnamese nationalist. Komer and Abrams were to be deputies to Gen. William Westmoreland at his headquarters on the outskirts of Saigon.But it was Bunker whose role Johnson considered most pivotal. It was about more than being America\u2019s top diplomat in South Vietnam. It was about getting America out of the war. \u201cI had gotten him out of the Dominican Republic and accomplished his political objective there,\u201d he told me in an interview. \u201cHe wanted me to do the same in South Vietnam.\u201dIn a private meeting where no notes were taken, Johnson told Bunker that he wanted to begin withdrawing American troops from Vietnam. But before those forces could leave, a better, stronger South Vietnamese army had to take over more responsibility for search and destroy missions to keep Hanoi\u2019s battalions up in the mountains and close to the borders, far away from the civilian population.Simultaneously, Johnson wanted the South Vietnamese to accelerate democratic development, taking into their hands full responsibility for the political destiny of South Vietnam. In short, Johnson wanted the American role in Vietnam diminished at a speed corresponding to the emergence of South Vietnamese self-reliance.Johnson and his new Saigon leadership team organized a meeting in Guam on March 20, 1967, with South Vietnam\u2019s chief administrators, Generals Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky. They presented him with a new constitution for South Vietnam, one calling for checks and balances and decentralization of power to elected local councils in provinces and villages.President Johnson played down the meeting\u2019s importance; he stressed in public that the conference was not devoted to military aspects of the war effort, saying only that \u201cI think we have a difficult, serious, long, drawn-out, agonizing problem that we do not yet have the answer for.\u201d But there was no mistaking the significance of the Guam conference. Johnson used it to establish a new set of metrics by which to measure success in the war effort: Nation building was in, warfighting was out.Two days before the Guam meeting, General Westmoreland had asked for an increase of 85,000 combat troops in order to intensify field operations to \u201cavoid an unreasonable protracted war.\u201d At Guam, Westmoreland defended his request for more troops. Bunker watched Johnson react to Westmoreland\u2019s briefing. The president\u2019s mood and countenance revealed no pleasure in listening to Westmoreland\u2019s grim analysis, which largely confirmed McNamara\u2019s earlier judgment that the Pentagon strategy of high-intensity warfare could not force Hanoi to cease its aggression.Indeed, Johnson had already turned against adding troops. When Westmoreland traveled to Washington a month later to pitch the troop increase again, the president replied: \u201cWhen we add divisions, can\u2019t the enemy add divisions? If so, where does it all end?\u201d Several months later Johnson threw Westmoreland a bone, adding 45,000 combat troops, about half of what he requested.Bunker arrived in Saigon in late April 1967, where he made clear that Washington\u2019s approach had changed. It would no longer to be a \u201chard power\u201d war fought primarily by American combat units in South Vietnam supplemented by American bombing of North Vietnam, with everything else waiting on the outcome of that armed struggle. Instead, he told Thieu on April 28, the \u201dessence of success\u201d would be found in bringing security to all the hamlets and villages across the countryside.Bunker set himself four main tasks: convincing South Vietnam\u2019s leadership of the need to build a legitimate government reflecting the country\u2019s various political forces; executing a pacification program to bring peace and order to rural villages; preparing South Vietnam\u2019s army to take over the burden of direct ground combat with Communist forces; and promoting economic development to improve living conditions and raise funds to finance the struggle against North Vietnam.In other words, Ellsworth\u2019s goal was to shift from the United States to the South Vietnamese the burden of sustaining South Vietnam as a viable independent republic.Sent to be Westmoreland\u2019s deputy for pacification, Komer immediately started building a new organization \u2014 Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development, or Cords \u2014 which brought together American military and civilian advisers to work with South Vietnamese in mobilizing civilians against the National Liberation Front, known to its enemies as the Vietcong.For the moment, things looked headed in the right direction. South Vietnam adopted its new constitution, and elections brought in a bicameral National Assembly and thousands of popularly chosen village and hamlet chiefs. And a relatively clean presidential campaign ended with Thieu as president and Ky as vice president. South Vietnam now had in place a political infrastructure to support villages, grow the economy and provide more manpower for the armed forces.Westmoreland likewise adjusted his military efforts to the new strategy. In a public address at the National Press Club in Washington on Nov. 21, 1967, he announced his plan for ending American combat in South Vietnam. He called this \u201cPhase IV\u201d or \u201cthe final phase,\u201d in which American forces became \u201cprogressively superfluous\u201d to the defense of South Vietnam. \u201cU.S. units can begin to phase down as the Vietnamese Army is modernized and develops its capacity to the fullest.\u201d In an appearance on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d after the speech, Westmoreland predicted that American forces would start to withdraw from South Vietnam in \u201ctwo years or less.\u201dAnd he was right: American forces began their drawdown from combat in August 1969 \u2014 but not before another 21,000 American soldiers died in combat.Stephen B. Young is the global executive director of the Caux Round Table. He worked for the United States Agency for International Development in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toshiba Casts Doubt on Its Ability to Stay in Business", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Toshiba, a pillar of the modern Japanese economy whose roots stretch back to the country\u2019s industrial stirrings in the 19th century, warned on Tuesday that a disastrous foray into nuclear power may have crippled its business beyond repair.Toshiba\u2019s uncertain fate represents another blow for a country that has seen its dominance in a range of technologies eclipsed by rivals in South Korea and China.Toshiba said it hoped the planned sale of shares in its chip division, its crown jewel, would alleviate the uncertainty over its future. While Toshiba has not said exactly how much of the business it will sell, even a minority stake is expected to be worth several billion dollars.Any stability, though, would come at a price. Toshiba would be parting with parts of its most profitable asset and giving a competitor \u2014 very likely a foreign one \u2014 a foothold in the market for flash memory drives, where Japan has managed to retain some of its long-held edge.\u201cWe will do what we can to avoid being delisted from the stock exchange,\u201d Satoshi Tsunakawa, Toshiba\u2019s chief executive, said at a news conference after apologizing to shareholders for Toshiba\u2019s latest worrying turn. The company reported financial details for the quarter that ended in December after multiple delays and disputes with its auditors.The financial problems are mounting.The auditors have refused to certify Toshiba\u2019s accounts \u2014 a highly unusual signal of doubt about the company\u2019s ability to recover its financial health. Toshiba still has the support of its banks, which would be saddled with huge losses if they were to push the company into bankruptcy by calling in loans. But the auditors are, in effect, saying that Toshiba may need to undertake a more radical overhaul to ensure its survival.Toshiba has already admitted defeat in nuclear power.The chip sale will, in some ways, be more painful.Pioneered by Toshiba nearly 40 years ago, so-called NAND flash memory has become one of the crucial building blocks of modern electronics, essential to storing data in smartphones and other gadgets. And Toshiba has kept the business profitable while competitors outside Japan have elbowed into the market and competed for its customers.The identities of the bidders for shares of the chip business have not been made public. But people with knowledge of the process say as many as a dozen companies from the United States, South Korea and Taiwan have approached Toshiba with proposals.Foxconn of Taiwan, the assembler of Apple iPhones and other electronics, which has big manufacturing operations in mainland China, is among the bidders, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss it.None of the early suitors are from Japan \u2014 a remarkable turnabout for a country that controlled the majority of the market for many kinds of microchips a generation ago. It is also noteworthy because Japanese companies have frequently banded together to rescue flailing domestic rivals rather than let them fold or be acquired by foreigners.The Japanese government may cobble together a Team Japan offer, consisting of small financial contributions from multiple companies and a larger investment by a state-controlled bank or investment fund, according to a person familiar with deliberations. But the response from potential participants, who would have to explain the spending to shareholders, has been tepid.\u201cIt is fundamentally unthinkable that the Industry Ministry would intervene and take some kind of action,\u201d Hiroshige Seko, the industry minister, said at a news conference on Tuesday, further damping expectations.Other potential investors include the American microchip makers Western Digital and Broadcom and SK Hynix of South Korea.Toshiba\u2019s microchip business is viewed as a more valuable asset than a business in TV screens. Japan \u2014 despite having pioneered LCD, or liquid crystal displays \u2014 has lost most of its market share in TV screens to South Korea and China.Samsung of South Korea has overtaken Toshiba in NAND, but Toshiba remains the world\u2019s second-biggest producer, with a global share of just under 20 percent, according to market research groups. Analysts say Toshiba\u2019s technology, commonly used in smartphones and USB drives, remains at the cutting edge.One analyst, Mark Newman of Sanford C. Bernstein, argued in a report that Toshiba\u2019s memory business remained valuable enough that selling it amounted to \u201cselling the crown jewels to pay next month\u2019s rent.\u201dToshiba sees little choice.Its Westinghouse-related write-off left its balance sheet perilously thin. And though the business is profitable, staying competitive in microchips is notoriously expensive. Toshiba spends $3 billion to $4 billion a year on research and development and capital investments in its chip division, costs it can no longer afford on its own.The choice of partners, though, may be a difficult process.Japanese politicians and industry leaders have fretted over Chinese investors\u2019 buying advanced chip production technology; semiconductors and memory are a major priority of China\u2019s industrial policy.It is not clear whether Foxconn\u2019s close relationship with China will undermine its bid. Although Foxconn is based in Taiwan, it has experience in attracting subsidies from the Chinese government to build large-scale production operations in China.It would be easy for Foxconn to take technology from Toshiba and manufacture it more cheaply in China. Such a move could drive down pricing for memory, a boon for Apple and low-cost Chinese smartphone makers. But it would also propel China forward in its long push to become internationally competitive in semiconductors.The worry is that Foxconn \u201cwould build huge fabs in China,\u201d said Mr. Newman, referring to semiconductor fabrication plants. \u201cThe jobs would move to China from Japan, and furthermore China would go after market share at the expense of crushing industry economics, so the U.S., Taiwan, Korea, Japan all get hurt substantially by this arrangement.\u201dJonathan Soble reported from Tokyo and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As U.S. Targets Berlin on Trade, German Manufacturers Lobby Trump", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 When Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, met with President Trump in Washington, she brought three executives with her, all heads of German manufacturing or engineering giants. Their message? Germany is not a threat to the United States.For decades, the United States has been a kind of second home to German carmakers, a place not only to sell vehicles but also to build them. German manufacturers employ thousands at plants across the United States, and produce finished products like cars, as well as parts and machinery, within the country for sale domestically or export abroad.But that the point \u2014 made during a session that included the chief executives of BMW, the carmaker; Siemens, the electronics and engineering company; and Schaeffler, a major supplier of parts for automotive engines, transmissions and chassis \u2014 needed to be made at all underlines growing concern in Berlin over hostility directed at German industry by the Trump administration.Peter Navarro, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump, has accused Germany of being a currency manipulator, even though German politicians and economists are among the staunchest critics of European Central Bank policies that have encouraged a weak euro. And the American president himself wondered aloud to a German newspaper in January why Americans buy lots of Mercedes cars while Germans hardly buy any Chevrolets.The anger from the Trump administration has been a rude shock, threatening the bedrock of Germany\u2019s economy and leaving executives perplexed. Their quandary is one faced by business across Europe: Mr. Trump has questioned the assumptions that have underpinned trans-Atlantic commerce since the end of World War II, without making clear what could come instead.\u201cI think there is a little bit lack of understanding,\u201d Harald Kr\u00fcger, the chief executive of BMW, said in an interview at the Geneva International Motor Show in March, not long after Mr. Trump had attacked the company for building a plant in Mexico. \u201cMaybe there hasn\u2019t been enough data supplied before.\u201dBut delivering a counterargument to the administration\u2019s protectionist rhetoric \u2014 pointing out, for example, that BMW\u2019s largest factory in the world is in a South Carolina county that voted heavily for Mr. Trump \u2014 has proved exceptionally difficult. Mr. Trump\u2019s election disrupted old lines of communication and left BMW and other companies with no idea whom to talk to in Washington.For now, businesses hope that Mr. Trump is not really serious about erecting trade barriers with Europe, which would arguably damage the United States economy as well. They hope that, over time, they can find ways to sway him.If the Trump administration does follow through, however, the consequences will be particularly ominous for Germany.The March 17 visit to Washington, led by Ms. Merkel, provided a measure of how seriously Berlin views the threat.\u201cIt was a good discussion,\u201d Mr. Kr\u00fcger said a few days later at a news conference in Munich. \u201cWe were able to talk about how much German carmakers have invested and how many jobs we have created.\u201dThe session with the president included a round-table meeting where Mr. Kr\u00fcger and the other business leaders, Joe Kaeser of Siemens and Klaus Rosenfeld of Schaeffler, gave a presentation on the country\u2019s vocational education system for young people.The issue of free trade came up, the BMW chief said, but he did not elaborate except to say that it was essential that the carmaker be able to export products from the United States. German companies fear that Trump policies could ignite a trade war and interfere with exports.The subtle message of the presentation was that Germany\u2019s export success was not just the result of a cheap euro.Whether that message got through, however, is unclear.Germany and the United States, traditionally close allies, are still groping to find common ground following President Trump\u2019s election. Those differences were on display at a meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents from the Group of 20 in Baden-Baden, Germany, that began on the same day that Ms. Merkel visited Mr. Trump.But even before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, it was a gloomy period for advocates of trans-Atlantic trade. After more than three years of painstaking negotiations, an ambitious effort to dismantle trade barriers between the European Union and United States stalled amid opposition from, of all places, Germany.The question European business is still wrestling with is how to do so.BMW has long been one of the most sophisticated political operators in the United States. The company, based in Munich, has government relations offices in South Carolina, site of its largest factory in the world; Washington; and Sacramento. California is important to the car company because the state sets emissions standards that are emulated by numerous other states.And BMW is not without political clout. It employs 9,000 people in Spartanburg, S.C., in a county that voted for Mr. Trump by a large margin. At least four times that many work for suppliers. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is a fierce defender of the company\u2019s interests, and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal Republican critics.While it\u2019s true that BMW is building a factory in Mexico, it will be only a third the size of the Spartanburg plant, which exported vehicles worth $10 billion from the United States last year, more than any other carmaker. Many of those BMWs went to China. The company has in fact created the kind of manufacturing jobs that Mr. Trump says he wants.It is not alone. Many German companies have large factories in the United States, including Mercedes in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Volkswagen in Chattanooga, Tenn., where the company recently began making a new S.U.V., the Atlas, which will go on sale in May. Siemens says it has about 60 plants in the United States turning out products like wind turbines and light rail vehicles. It employs 50,000 people in the country.And while the rhetoric in the United States has turned distinctively against foreign trade, American politicians have not shown any aversion to it when it brings jobs to their districts.That includes some people close to the president. For example, as governor of South Carolina, Nikki R. Haley was known as a friend to BMW and lobbied heavily for Volvo Cars to choose the state as a site for a new factory that will have an annual capacity of 100,000 cars. That was despite Volvo\u2019s being owned by Geely Automobile Holdings, which is based in China, a prime target of Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric.Volvo broke ground for the factory in Berkeley County, S.C., in September 2015. Ms. Haley now has a new job. She is Mr. Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Parliament Approves Theresa May\u2019s General Election Call", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byBy an overwhelming vote of 522 to 13, British lawmakers agreed to hold elections on June 8 at the request of Prime Minister Theresa May, who hopes to strengthen her parliamentary support and gain a freer hand to negotiate Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc.The outcome of Wednesday\u2019s vote in Parliament was never in doubt, even with the requirement of a two-thirds threshold to call a snap election that, until Tuesday morning, Mrs. May and her aides had insisted would not happen.\u201cA general election is the best way to strengthen Britain\u2019s hand in the negotiations ahead,\u201d Mrs. May told lawmakers at the outset of a 90-minute debate.While many critics of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union hope that an early general election will give them a chance to obstruct the process, current opinion polls suggest it will do the opposite, strengthening Mrs. May\u2019s power to force through any deal she negotiates.If her Conservative Party wins a majority, Mrs. May would not be required to call another general election until 2022. That would allow for much more time to build a new relationship with the European Union and would lessen the chances of a disorderly departure from the bloc \u2014 often likened to walking off a cliff edge.Analysts warned, however, that this did not necessarily mean that Mrs. May would seek a close relationship with the European Union after Britain has completed its departure.\u201cThat gives her added momentum, though I don\u2019t necessarily think that the momentum is towards the soft side of Brexit,\u201d he added, referring to a type of withdrawal that would maintain closer economic relations with the European Union.If Britain were to stick with the next scheduled general election date, in May 2020, \u201cthe negotiations would reach their most difficult and sensitive stage just as an election was looming on the horizon,\u201d Mrs. May said. She said her Conservative Party needed a new mandate: \u201cFive years of strong and stable leadership, to see us through the negotiations.\u201dEven though opinion polls show that the Conservative Party is likely to perform strongly, lawmakers from the opposition parties went along with Mrs. May\u2019s call, perhaps out of fear that resisting an early election would make them look weak.\u201cWe welcome the opportunity for an early election,\u201d the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said, before describing Mrs. May as \u201ca prime minister who cannot be trusted\u201d for her about-turn on the election.\u201cThis election is about her government\u2019s failure to rebuild the economy and living standards for the majority,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said, as he tried to shift the focus away from Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, an issue on which his party is badly divided.Mr. Corbyn condemned Mrs. May\u2019s reluctance to participate in a televised debate with other party leaders before the election, as has Tim Farron, the leader of another opposition party, the centrist, pro-Europe Liberal Democrats.But Mrs. May said Mr. Corbyn would \u201cbankrupt our economy, weaken out defenses and is simply not fit to lead.\u201dIn a separate development, Nick Clegg, a former deputy prime minister who led the Liberal Democrats to a crushing defeat in 2015, said he would seek to remain in Parliament, quashing speculation that he might withdraw from politics.A general election adds to a period of extraordinary turbulence in British politics. Mrs. May\u2019s predecessor, David Cameron, won his unexpected, if small, majority in Parliamentary in 2015, and soon afterward Labour took a hard left turn, electing Mr. Corbyn as its leader. Then Mr. Cameron, who favored remaining in the European Union, lost his referendum bet last year, resulting in a reversal of four decades of European integration and creating extreme uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future economic ties to its closest partners.Voters are unlikely to relish the prospect of another election and, given the volatility of politics, it is possible \u2014 though unlikely \u2014 that Mrs. May\u2019s decision could backfire. Among other things, critics argue that she risks sacrificing her image as a straight player.In an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, Mrs. May said her opponents in Parliament had sought to \u201cfrustrate the Brexit process,\u201d but she conceded that she had suffered no defeats in the House of Commons on the issue.Many analysts say that the prime minister simply was unable to resist taking advantage of very strong support in opinion polls for the Conservative Party.After Mrs. May\u2019s announcement on Tuesday, the pound rose against other currencies, suggesting that the financial markets believe that Mrs. May will win a larger majority in Parliament and a smoother path to leaving the European Union.Professor Menon noted, however, that new Conservative lawmakers might be even more opposed to the bloc than current ones. And with a strengthened position in Parliament, Mrs. May would be able to blame European Union negotiators if she did not get the deal she wanted.Sewell Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Guess Who\u2019s for a Carbon Tax Now", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byFixesBut Michael Crothers doesn\u2019t work for an environmental organization. He\u2019s the president of Shell Canada. Steve Williams is head of Suncor, Canada\u2019s largest oil company. Ben van Beurden is chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell. Bob Dudley is chief executive of BP.All of these energy companies favor a tax on every ton of carbon emissions, which is one of two ways to price emissions. The other way is called \u201ccap and trade\u201d \u2014 creating a market in emissions by imposing a maximum. Companies who want to exceed the level can buy the right from others who pollute less.Let\u2019s assume for now that this support for a carbon tax is genuine. (More about this later.) In the age of Trump, this is a gift that shouldn\u2019t be wasted.Could it actually happen?The organization claims that if the plan is fully implemented, it would alone achieve twice the reductions of all Obama-era regulations combined, allowing America to meet the high end of its obligations under the Paris climate accord. So the plan would scrap the Clean Power Plan and other regulations it says would become superfluous.Oil companies that support a carbon tax do so because they are also gas companies, and carbon pricing would help gas replace coal in the power generation business.They also know that the likely alternative is a patchwork of regulations. \u201cIf you accept that society is going to deal with this problem, you want approaches you can understand, manage and work,\u201d said Nicolette Bartlett, director of carbon pricing at CDP, a global organization through which companies disclose their environmental impacts. \u201cMarket-based approaches give you this.\u201dAs for Exxon Mobil, now would be a great time to show that its endorsement means something. Tillerson\u2019s support for a tax in 2009 was aimed in part at killing a cap-and-trade bill in Congress, and Exxon Mobil pours money into the campaigns of legislators who vote against carbon pricing.Other American companies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips don\u2019t even bother with the public relations.One lesson from these countries, however, is that carbon taxes can be hard to sustain. Australia began one in 2012 \u2014 and ended it in 2014. The tax successfully cut emissions. But Australians hated paying more for electricity, and only some tax money returned to them as compensation for the increase. When the tax vanished, emissions took a sharp turn up again.But it\u2019s not working now. A new provincial government has kept it frozen since 2012, with no increases. Not coincidentally, 2012 was the year that emissions started creeping up again.The lesson: Carbon taxes don\u2019t work if they\u2019re too low to affect economic behavior. And they certainly don\u2019t work if they are repealed.That challenge has something basic in common with others that hinder climate change action. \u201cAdvocates are trying to convince their fellow citizens to make short-term sacrifices now for the benefit of other people, in other countries, in 40 years,\u201d said Halstead. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take into account human nature.\u201dAmericans love some taxes \u2014 the Social Security tax, for one. They think of it as a benefit, not a tax, and the connection between what they pay and what they later collect is clear.To avoid penalizing American business, the leadership council proposes border adjustments \u2014 extra fees on imports from countries with no carbon tax, and tax rebates to American companies that export to countries with no carbon tax. This would also encourage other countries to adopt a tax.There\u2019s much here for environmentalists to dislike. It would repeal the Clean Power Plan (which President Trump has already vowed to do) and phase out other federal regulations on emissions.The plan would also protect fossil fuel companies from lawsuits: \u201cRobust carbon taxes would also make possible an end to federal and state tort liability for emitters,\u201d said the Leadership Council.This likely will mean \u2026 whatever oil companies want it to mean. Halstead argues that it\u2019s necessary to win Republican support. And he\u2019s right that a climate change activist wants to punish oil companies that lied about climate change, he or she probably wants something else even more: to drastically cut our carbon emissions.Since the public\u2019s support would come from the dividends, the tax money would not be subsidizing clean technologies. Neither would it be helping those harmed by climate change or the fossil fuel industry. Nor retraining coal miners or helping workers adjust to a greener economy. And labor union insistence on what it calls a \u201cjust transition\u201d is so strong that it helped defeat a Washington State proposal for a carbon tax last year. (The Koch brothers were the other major opponent. Go figure.)A year ago, no one who cared about the environment would have considered trading all this away. But climate policy is in the hands of climate deniers now, and we are staring at catastrophe. The only path is for businesses, especially oil companies, to seize the lobbying machinery they have used to deny climate change and block regulation, and throw it behind the carbon tax that at least the largest of them claims to support. What an irony that the best hope for the climate right now seems to be for Exxon Mobil to lead the charge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind the Problem of Student Homelessness", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported by_________________College students live on ramen noodles. College students couch-surf. These popular images can obscure more ominous realities: hunger and the little acknowledged problem that some do not have a place to live at all.\u201c\u2018Homeless college student\u2019 seems like a contradiction in terms,\u201d said Paul Toro, a psychology professor at Wayne State University who studies poverty and homelessness. \u201cIf you\u2019re someone who has the wherewithal to get yourself into college, well, of course you should be immune to homelessness. But that just isn\u2019t the case.\u201dIt\u2019s difficult to know exactly how many students are homeless, or are dangling dangerously close to it, in part because of the enormous stigma surrounding the issue. But new research shows how pervasive a problem it is \u2014 and one that some educators believe is growing.There are several possible reasons the problem appears to be so widespread, said Sara Goldrick-Rab, founder of the HOPE Lab and a professor of higher education policy at Temple University. One is that there are fewer well-paying jobs these days for those without a college degree. Only 11 percent of the homeless students she surveyed in the HOPE study reported making more than $15 an hour.The college-going population, she said, has also changed. \u201cOne of the nuances here is that there are people going to college who didn\u2019t used to go,\u201d Dr. Goldrick-Rab said. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have a parent with a college degree in the past, you didn\u2019t go to college. If you were a foster youth, you didn\u2019t go to college. It\u2019s a big triumph that we have expanded access in this way, but we didn\u2019t change the schools and we didn\u2019t change the policies.\u201dIn essence, more low-income students are arriving on campus without a safety net; should they lose their job or their roommates kick them out, parents may not be able to just cut them a check. Most community college students are older \u2014 29, on average \u2014 and on their own. They may not be willing to tell their parents how dire their situation is.\u201cThis is not just happening in urban poor communities,\u201d said Eloy Ortiz Oakley, chancellor of the California Community Colleges. \u201cIt affects kids from working-class families across the state, in rural communities and in communities of color.\u201d The economy looks very different from what it used to, he said. \u201cHomelessness now affects working-class and formerly middle-class families.\u201dIndeed, even at prestigious four-year colleges, the problems of extreme poverty appear on campus. Amherst College keeps its dorms open over the summer, in part so students with no place to go can stay on campus.This past fall, a group of students at the University of California, Los Angeles, opened a small homeless shelter. Called Students 4 Students (formerly known as the Bruin Shelter), it operates out of a church that\u2019s an easy bus ride from campus. It offers meals, nine beds and a study room so residents have a place to do their work. The shelter mostly serves students from U.C.L.A. and Santa Monica College, a community college nearby, said Luke Shaw, one of its founders and a Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering.\u201cHousing insecurity doesn\u2019t care about the prestige of your institution, or whether it\u2019s a two-year or a four-year college,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t care about your gender or your religion or your background. Hard circumstances can fall on anyone. Some people have a safety net for that kind of thing. Some people don\u2019t.\u201dAnd when a student ends up homeless, it can be exceedingly difficult to stay in school and thus break the cycle of poverty. There are practical problems \u2014 where to do your homework, for example \u2014 and, of course, there is the emotional toll. If you are worried about finding a place to sleep, how are you ever going to focus on schoolwork?The average family income of students at LaGuardia Community College, part of the City University of New York, is $26,000, according to Gail O. Mellow, its president, who says that helping students navigate the issues surrounding such poverty is central to keeping them in school. At LaGuardia, students have access to a food pantry and help applying for public benefits like food stamps, among other services.\u201cWe\u2019re not a social service agency; we want to educate students,\u201d Dr. Mellow said. \u201cBut in order to do that, they can\u2019t be hungry and they can\u2019t be homeless.\u201d Elizabeth A. Harris is an education reporter for The Times covering the New York region.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "NRG, a Power Company Leaning Green, Faces Activist Challenge", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byOver the years, NRG, a leading independent power producer whose fleet once depended heavily on coal, has made big bets on low-carbon energy technologies and publicized its embrace of sustainability as essential to its future.It pursued developing renewable energy for customers large and small and set aggressive goals to reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide \u2014 50 percent by 2030, and 90 percent by 2050.But now, the company finds its strategy challenged from within.Activist hedge-fund investors, intent on extracting value from NRG assets, have installed two directors on the board who, in one potential approach, would push to sell off some of the company\u2019s renewable-power projects, raising questions about how it would meet its clean-energy goals.It is but the latest skirmish in NRG\u2019s long struggle to make several kinds of energy products \u2014 conventional and renewable, large-scale and decentralized \u2014 profitable under one corporate umbrella.\u201cIn light of Mr. Smitherman\u2019s stated views on climate change, which are incompatible with NRG\u2019s disclosed business strategy and risks, we question his ability to act in the best interests of NRG and its shareholders,\u201d Mr. Stringer wrote in the letter. \u201cAdditionally, we believe his role on the board sends a demoralizing message to the many NRG employees responsible for implementing the company\u2019s existing business strategy and managing its risks.\u201dMr. Smitherman did not return an email or phone call seeking comment about his views and how the board shake-up might affect NRG\u2019s long-term strategies and goals.The conflict has its roots in efforts led by Elliott Management, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund run by Paul E. Singer, and Bluescape Energy Partners, run by C. John Wilder, a former executive at the Texas utility TXU who has been credited with its turnaround.Under Mr. Singer, an early titan of the hedge-fund industry who has also made a name for himself as a top Republican donor, Elliott has been known for its no-holds-barred approach to taking on companies and governments over its investments around the world.As an activist investor, Elliott quietly builds up equity stakes in companies until it has a big enough position to start rattling the cages of a company\u2019s management. In South Korea, Elliott became the first investor to publicly spar with Samsung, a conglomerate run by one of the country\u2019s most powerful corporate dynasties. In Argentina, Elliott was pilloried in the local press as a \u201cvulture\u201d investor for waging a decade-long battle with the government over its defaulted debt.In its investment in NRG, Elliott has so far remained largely behind the scenes. But in an emailed statement on Thursday, Elliott said that if a buyer in the market were willing to pay a premium for some of NRG\u2019s renewables businesses, \u201cit may be a good decision for NRG and its shareholders to crystallize that value.\u201dMost of the company\u2019s power plants run on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, but it has extensive wind and solar farms, including several unfinished projects it bought last year from SunEdison, which had gone bankrupt. Earlier this year, the company reported a loss of $891 million for 2016, largely because of low natural gas prices, down from a $6.4 billion loss the year before.As for investor concerns about the appointment of Mr. Smitherman, Elliott pointed to the fact that Mr. Smitherman had extensive knowledge of the Texas regulatory landscape. NRG is one of the largest energy suppliers in Texas, and some of its assets in the state could be considered for sale, requiring extensive knowledge of the regulatory hurdles.\u201cHaving someone with Mr. Smitherman\u2019s strong Texas-centric utility regulatory background is crucial to helping NRG navigate this process,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Looney, an Elliott spokesman.\u201cAt NRG, the debate is not over clean versus conventional generation,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Looney said. \u201cThe debate is simply over who is the best long-term owner of individual assets and fleets of assets that currently reside inside the broader NRG portfolio.\u201dMr. Smitherman, an ally of Rick Perry, the energy secretary and former Texas governor, was chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission, where he helped usher in the high-voltage transmission lines that spurred the development of a robust wind industry. He then ran the state Railroad Commission, which largely regulates the oil and gas industries.NRG has reeled in recent years as it has sought to transform itself from a conventional-energy giant into a leader in the clean-energy economy.\u201cNRG is caught between what we consider the next generation of power supply and the status quo,\u201d said Travis Miller, an energy and utilities analyst at Morningstar. \u201cThe move toward renewable energy and gas generation is a trend that won\u2019t stop anytime soon so every power generator is trying to develop a strategy where they can benefit from the transition period.\u201dDavid Crane, a former chief executive, had tried to do that by transforming the company into the Google of green energy, investing in big renewable-energy projects and buying small start-ups to help capture emerging markets like rooftop solar, electric-vehicle charging and home automation. But the company pulled back from those ambitions as a combination of low oil and gas prices and the threat of rising interest rates led to turbulence in the energy markets and skittishness among renewable-energy investors and the company\u2019s stock tumbled. Despite an elaborate reorganization aimed at cutting costs, reducing debt and better aligning the businesses with investors, Mr. Crane was pushed out in 2015, and replaced by Mauricio Gutierrez, the executive vice president and chief operating officer.Mr. Gutierrez has continued to pursue the company\u2019s sustainability and carbon reduction efforts, but in a more restrained way, focusing more on large-scale renewable projects and less on the emerging markets.The company, for instance, recently re-signed the Business Backs Low Carbon pledge organized by Ceres, an advocacy group.But corporate aims may end up in the hands of directors with a different agenda.In January, Elliott and Bluescape announced that they had each bought a large stake in NRG and were teaming up to put pressure on the company to make changes to its business. NRG was \u201cdeeply undervalued\u201d and could be worth more if its management undertook \u201coperational and financial improvements\u201d as well as \u201cstrategic initiatives,\u201d Elliott said at the time in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Elliott said that Mr. Wilder and his team had \u201cdirectly relevant experience in effectuating such improvements,\u201d adding that they were in a dialogue with the board.By February, NRG announced that it had struck an agreement with Elliott, which owned 6.9 percent of the company\u2019s stock, and Bluescape, which had 2.5 percent, to replace two outgoing directors and appoint Mr. Wilder and Mr. Smitherman.NRG also agreed to undertake a business review of the different parts of the company, including examining \u201cpotential portfolio and/or asset de-consolidations.\u201dThe company\u2019s renewables business is likely to be among the assets spun off. Some analysts have argued that those businesses are undervalued because they are housed within NRG\u2019s legacy business, which involves burning natural gas, coal and oil.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Giant U.S. Bomb Carries an Even Bigger Message", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The bomb that the United States dropped on an Islamic State cave complex in Afghanistan on Thursday was big \u2014 at 22,000 pounds, the most powerful conventional weapon in the American arsenal. Arguably, even bigger were the messages it sent, whether by design or not.To potential adversaries like Syria and North Korea, the bombing could signal deterrence. For the American public, it underscored the Pentagon\u2019s more aggressive stance under President Trump than under his predecessor, whose administration never even debated using the weapon.Dozens of militants were killed, Afghan officials said. American commanders said that the bomb was chosen because it fit the target, a series of tunnels with dug-in positions nearby used by militants in a remote part of eastern Afghanistan, and that it posed little or no risk to civilians. The bombing spared troops from fierce fighting in caves.It also illustrated how Mr. Trump is releasing commanders from Obama-era restrictions on the use of force and how the top United States commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., was seeking to showcase Afghanistan\u2019s myriad threats. General Nicholson, who has requested reinforcements to the 8,500 American troops stationed there, drew his bosses\u2019 attention by dropping what the Pentagon has nicknamed the \u201cmother of all bombs.\u201dUsing the weapon, called the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, or MOAB, presents special challenges. It can obliterate everything within a 1,000-yard radius. The ordnance contains almost 19,000 pounds of Composition H6, an explosive compound that is roughly one-third stronger than an equivalent weight of TNT.In Afghanistan, with its rural and agrarian economy, civilians who are engaged in food-gathering, woodcutting, farming or tending herds are often near or beside concentrations of militants. The blast radius of an explosion of this size could pose risks to people far from the center of the target.For that reason, President Barack Obama\u2019s administration did not consider using the bomb, American officials said. Early in the Iraq war in April 2003, during the administration of President George W. Bush, American commanders weighed using the weapon to try to kill President Saddam Hussein, who was on the run from United States troops who had toppled his government.But commanders discarded the option when analysts estimated that the bomb\u2019s blast would also kill thousands of civilians. \u201cThe collateral damage would have been massive,\u201d said Marc Garlasco, who led a team in the military\u2019s Joint Staff that was seeking to target Mr. Hussein.The Afghan government said Friday that 36 militants were killed in Thursday\u2019s blast. That number has not been independently verified, and official Afghan government casualties estimates have been unreliable in the past. Another official put the number of dead militants at more than 80.Early reports from the area near the blast did not suggest that any civilians had been killed and said that most civilians had left the target area in recent weeks because of continuing fighting between the militants and Afghan forces and American troops.The attack seemed to have a limited purpose and to be less significant than implied by the news coverage that focused principally on the unusually large size of the bomb.General Nicholson said Thursday\u2019s attack was tactically necessary to defeat obstacles, hidden bombs and the dug-in positions used by the militants. \u201cTherefore, this was the appropriate weapon to use at this time,\u201d he said.But the Islamic State\u2019s regional affiliate in Afghanistan, largely made up of former members of the Pakistani Taliban, numbers only some 700 fighters, compared with a peak of 2,000 to 3,000 in the spring of 2016.The Trump administration has not publicly articulated a thorough long-term plan or endgame for the Afghan war and faces harsh circumstances in a conflict beset by starts and stops, troop commitments and withdrawals, and a series of disappointments and failures over more than a decade and a half of varied missions, priorities and even doctrines.Many of the areas where American troops and their allies have fought hard and died in large numbers have fallen or reverted to militant control in recent years. The Afghan security forces, created with American training, money and weapons, have not lived up to the Pentagon\u2019s promises.The pace of airstrikes has increased, and Thursday\u2019s bombing served as an example of a new weapon being applied to the war. But past airstrikes, while they have killed an uncountable quantity of militants, have not prevented their organizations from regrouping and refilling their ranks. And in this case, the use of the powerful bomb \u2014 whether it was seen internationally as a signal of a renewed American intention of using force \u2014 could also be read as an option that commanders viewed as necessary because they have limited resources on the ground.While some analysts said the bombing sent a stern symbolic message to Syria and North Korea, it has little real utility against those countries, or Iran or Russia, because it is pushed out of a lumbering cargo plane that can operate safely only over nations that have no effective air defenses or air forces.Some critics said the bombing could send an unintended message to North Korea that may unnecessarily rattle nerves in Pyongyang at a time of high tension for no clear strategic reason, while failing to advance a long-term strategy in Afghanistan.\u201cLet\u2019s not confuse this tactic for a strategy,\u201d said Representative Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat and former Marine Corps captain who served four tours in Iraq.At the Pentagon, military officials said that they did not need to request authorization for the strike from Mr. Trump, although three officials also acknowledged that if Mr. Obama had still been in charge, the Defense Department would probably have sent the proposal to the White House before proceeding.But instead of the deliberative processes in place during the Obama administration that made for lengthy National Security Council staff meetings, Mr. Trump has approved allowing his commanders more authority, giving the Pentagon a rare freedom to assert its control over national security policy from a commander in chief who eschews quibbling over the details.Eric Schmitt and Helene Cooper reported from Washington.

{"Headline": "Why Are Republicans Making Tax Reform So Hard?", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsIn the aftermath of the health care blowup, President Trump and the Republicans need a legislative victory. Tax reform probably should have gone first, but now is the time to move it forward with urgency.Unfortunately, the White House seems all over the map on the subject. One day there is a trial balloon for a value-added tax. The next, the idea of a carbon tax or a reciprocal tax. And now we are hearing the curve ball of a payroll tax cut. Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has thrown cold water on the idea of any tax bill meeting the August deadline.One sure lesson from the health care setback is the old admonition \u201cKeep it simple, stupid.\u201d The Republicans tried to fix the trillion-dollar health insurance market instead of keeping the focus on repealing Obamacare.They have a chance to make amends with a new tax bill and still hit the August deadline. We advised President Trump during his election campaign and we believe the Republican Party\u2019s lesson for tax reform is this: Don\u2019t try to rewrite the entire tax code in one bill.Instead, the primary goal of Mr. Trump\u2019s first tax bill should be to fix the federal corporate and small-business tax system, which has made America increasingly uncompetitive in global markets and has reduced jobs and wages here at home. The White House and the Treasury already have a tax plan that we were involved with last year. The three most important planks of that plan are:First, cut the federal corporate and small-business highest tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, which is now one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.Second, allow businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of their capital purchases. Full expensing of new factories, equipment and machinery will jump-start business investment, which since 2000 has grown at only one-third the rate recorded from 1950 to 2000.Third, impose a low tax on the repatriation of foreign profits brought back to the United States. This could attract more than $2 trillion to these shores, raising billions for the Treasury while creating new jobs and adding to the United States\u2019 gross domestic product.To help win over Democratic votes in the House and Senate, we would also suggest another component: What many workers across the country want most from President Trump is infrastructure funding. As part of this bill, we should create a fund dedicated to rebuilding America\u2019s roads, highways, airports and pipelines, and modernizing the electric grid and broadband access \u2014 financed through the tax money raised from repatriation of foreign profits.As much as possible, this bill should include private financing for projects like toll roads and energy drilling. We also favor \u201cuser pays\u201d financing, such as toll roads, and we would oppose any Fannie Mae-type financing structure for projects that would put taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of billions in potential losses.For this strategy to work, Republicans need to take several steps. First, President Trump and Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, should stop insisting on \u201crevenue neutrality.\u201d In the short term, the bill will add to the deficit. But President Trump\u2019s tax bill, like those of Presidents Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy, should be a tax cut, and it should be sold to the American people as such.We should emphasize that business tax relief is not a sellout to corporations but a boon for middle-class workers. A study by the Tax Foundation and Kevin A. Hassett, then at the American Enterprise Institute and now the chairman of President Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, found that middle-class wages rise when business taxes fall.The additional increase in real wages could be nearly 10 percent over the next decade, which would reverse 15 years of income stagnation for the working class in America. And, if we are right that tax cuts will spur the economy, then the faster economic growth as a result of the bill will bring down the deficit.Next, Republicans should abandon the so-called border-adjustable tax. A border tax is a poison pill for the tax plan: It divides the very business groups that the party needs to rally behind tax reform. Retailers like Walmart will never go along. A carbon tax would be even worse. The best way to bring jobs back to America is to simply lower tax rates now while rolling back anti-jobs regulations, such as rules that inhibit American energy production.As for fixing the maddeningly complex individual income tax system \u2014 lowering tax rates and ending needless deductions \u2014 we are all for it, but that should wait until 2018. Jobs and the economy are the top priority to voters.Republicans need to act with some degree of urgency. The financial markets and American businesses are starting to get jittery over the prospect that a tax cut won\u2019t get done this year. A failure here would be negative for the economy and the stock market and could stall out the \u201cTrump bounce\u201d we have seen since the president\u2019s election.Mr. Trump should demand that Congress send him a jobs bill this summer that he can sign into law on Aug. 13, 2017. That is the day President Reagan signed his historic tax cut in 1981 at his beloved Ranch del Cielo in Santa Barbara, Calif.That tax cut and President Kennedy\u2019s before it unleashed two of the longest periods of prosperity in American history, and that is a result Donald Trump should want to replicate.Steve Forbes, Larry Kudlow, Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore, co-founders of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, advised the Trump presidential campaign on economic policy.Advertisement"}

Private student loans \u2014 those made not by the government, but by banks or other lenders \u2014 typically require co-signers. In all, about 8.5 million people could potentially benefit from the expanded program, he said.Second, borrowers applying for a mortgage may now exclude debt being paid by others \u2014 say, credit cards or student loans being paid off by a parent or an employer \u2014 from their applications. That helps give them a better debt-to-income ratio \u2014 an important criterion in a loan application \u2014 and one that makes it more likely they will qualify for a mortgage.Finally, another change helps student borrowers who are on flexible payment programs, which tie monthly loan payments to a borrower\u2019s income. Previously, Fannie Mae required lenders to factor in higher monthly loan payments, rather than the borrower\u2019s lower, flexible payments, when calculating an applicant\u2019s debt-to-income ratio, which made it harder to qualify for a mortgage.Now, Mr. Lawless said, lenders may use the lower payment, which should help more borrowers qualify for home loans. (The rationale for the change, he said, is that if a borrower\u2019s flexible payments were to increase, it would be because his or her income had increased.) More than five million student loan borrowers are on flexible payment programs.Such \u201cnuances,\u201d he said, have been \u201cpushing people out of the box who should be in the box.\u201d Over all, Mr. Lawless said, people with student loans are a \u201cmuch safer cohort\u201d because they have made an investment in their education.Here are some questions and answers:Are there any risks with trading student loan debt for mortgage debt?Student loans are unsecured, while a mortgage is secured by a home. If all goes well with a refinancing, consumers wind up paying less, said Persis Yu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. But, she said in an email, if borrowers run into financial trouble, \u201cin the worst-case scenario, consumers may lose their homes.\u201dFederal student loans come with consumer protections, like flexible repayment options and the ability to request a deferment if the borrower encounters financial trouble. When the loans are refinanced into a new mortgage, those protections go away.Private student loans, however, typically lack those protections.What are current interest rates on student loans?The current rate for federal undergraduate loans is 3.76 percent; the rate for federal Plus loans, for parents of undergraduates or for graduate students, is 6.31 percent. (Rates are set each spring and take effect July 1, so those rates may change for the next academic year.)Borrowers with older loans, however, may have much higher rates, so those borrowers may see more benefit from refinancing. And private student loans typically carry higher rates \u2014 sometimes, in double digits.Mortgage rates have been fluctuating, but are still historically low. This week, the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was just above 4 percent, compared with 3.97 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac\u2019s weekly report. A year ago, the average was 3.66 percent.When do the new Fannie Mae rules take effect?The changes are effective immediately.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Non-Techies Can Get With the Programming", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byWhen the Georgetown University Law Center offered computer programming last year, it was an experiment, a single class for about 20 students. It was filled almost instantly, and the waitlist swelled to 130. This semester, the law school has five programming classes, and the waitlist still overflowed.\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to become programmers, but they realize these are skills that will make them better lawyers,\u201d said Paul Ohm, the Georgetown law professor who teaches the course. His students, for example, learn to write short, tailored programs that can identify clusters of words and concepts in Supreme Court rulings more accurately than a Google search or standard legal software.It\u2019s the same in every field, from marketing to manufacturing to medicine. Code, it seems, is the lingua franca of the modern economy.So you have no plans to become a computer engineer, no dreams of being code wizard at Google or Facebook. But you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time to pick up practical technology knowledge and skills, including writing some code. There are options aplenty, in college classes, online courses and boot camps. The offerings range widely in terms of time required, skills mastered and price tag, from free to more than $20,000 for some six-month programs.Enrollment in computer science courses has exploded in recent years, with both majors and nonmajors fueling the surge \u2014 so much so that many schools now restrict enrollment by nonmajors.One recent institutional adaptation is the creation of so-called CS+X initiatives at schools like Stanford, Northwestern and the University of Illinois. These programs are hybrid majors that combine computing with other disciplines, including anthropology, comparative literature and history \u2014 a nod to the reality that software skills can advance research in nearly every field.But the main on-ramp to computing for non-techies is an introductory computer science class. Today, at many universities, at least half of the student population takes the intro courses. At Stanford, it\u2019s 90 percent.These classes include coding as a window to \u201ccomputational thinking,\u201d which involves abstract reasoning, modeling and breaking down problems into the recipelike steps of an algorithm. That kind of thinking, said Ed Lazowska, professor of computer science at the University of Washington, has become \u201can essential component of a 21st-century liberal arts education.\u201d\u201cProgramming,\u201d he said, \u201cis the hands-on, inquiry-based way we teach computational thinking.\u201dNot a computer whiz? Not a problem. Try these practice exam questions from Computer Science Principles.The programming language for an introductory course, professors say, is not so important, though Python, JavaScript and Java are widely used.David J. Malan, a computer science professor at Harvard, has students work in several different languages in his popular introductory course for majors and nonmajors, CS50. The main goal, he says, is to demystify technology and provide a foundation for students who want to go further. \u201cYou come to realize it\u2019s just one idea after another, layered on top of each other,\u201d Dr. Malan said.No matter what your academic or career path, he has this advice: Take at least one course in computer science. \u201cIt\u2019s just so useful and empowering,\u201d he said.At the nation\u2019s coding boot camps, the pitch has nothing to do with a liberal arts education. This thriving niche of the for-profit education business tightly links courses to the job market.Today, there are 91 coding campuses across the country, producing 18,000 graduates last year, up from fewer than 2,200 in 2013, Course Report says. Programs vary, but the average length is 13 weeks and average cost $11,500.Most boot camp programs are full-time immersives, and the curriculum is tightly focused on the skills most in demand in the marketplace \u2014 these days, web development and data analysis.But this young industry is evolving and adding short introductory sessions and online courses. At General Assembly, which operates 20 boot camp campuses, one of the most popular offerings is \u201cProgramming for Non-Programmers,\u201d said Jake Schwartz, the chief executive. The two-day version of the course costs $525. General Assembly also has a free online course, \u201cDash,\u201d which covers the basics of writing software for the web.When considering a boot camp, first sample the free offerings. \u201cTry it out before you commit your money,\u201d said Liz Eggleston, co-founder of Course Report.Coding camps are not regulated or accredited. Within the industry, initiatives are underway to establish standards for required reporting of graduation and job placement rates. The leading boot camps are disclosing those numbers already.Some universities have started their own coding camps. Their efforts are mainly courses added to continuing education programs, and tap the expertise of outside partners.Trilogy Education Services, which manages skills-based training programs, is working with the continuing education arms of more than 20 universities, including Northwestern, Rutgers, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of California, Berkeley. The six-month courses, with classes held evenings and weekends, cost nearly $10,000. The initial course is on web development, but a new one on data analysis and data visualization is being added.Students graduate with new skills and a portfolio of work, said Dan Sommer, chief executive of Trilogy, and they can qualify for certificates that verify they took and completed the curriculum.Coursera, edX and Udacity, three major providers of MOOCs, or massive open online courses, have evolved into hubs for teaching computing skills. Their most popular courses are nearly all programming and technical. On edX, the lone nonprofit, the course taken by more people than any other is the online version of Harvard\u2019s introduction to computer science, CS50. The course is free, but for $90 students get a certificate of completion.Labor market demand largely explains the dominance of computing offerings. But Richard C. Levin, the former president of Yale and chief executive of Coursera, suggests another factor. Digital subjects, he said, are more naturally suited to being taught online. \u201cYou really can do it yourself with technology courses,\u201d Dr. Levin said. \u201cOr at least you don\u2019t lose as much by not having the classroom experience as you do with the liberal arts.\u201dCoursera\u2019s classes can be taken free, but the track for earning a certificate costs $39 to $79 a month, depending on the course. Udacity has developed more than a dozen certificate-bearing programs it calls nanodegrees, including digital marketing, Android programming, artificial intelligence and self-driving car engineering. The course work is created in partnership with leading companies in those fields, like Facebook, Google, IBM and Mercedes-Benz. A nanodegree course typically costs $200 a month, but if you complete it within 12 months you get half your money back.Sebastian Thrun, the co-founder and chairman of Udacity, who is a former Stanford professor and Google scientist, said his company has found a way to improve the notoriously low completion rates for online courses. Add people.And as he sees it, success in programming requires a certain kind of human empathy. \u201cIt\u2019s a people skill,\u201d said Dr. Thrun, who created and led the self-driving car project at Google, \u201cgetting your brain inside the computer, to think like it does and understand that it\u2019s just a little device that can only do what it\u2019s told.\u201dSteve Lohr is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump's Industry, Real Estate, Poses Hurdle to Tax Overhaul", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byMany tax experts say a key element to any fundamental overhaul is getting rid of certain deductions for businesses \u2014 the \u201cspecial-interest giveaways that are masked as tax breaks,\u201d as House Republicans describe many of them in their own proposal. That is the only way tax rates for much of the country can go down without starving the Treasury, the experts say.But there is a major roadblock to that fundamental change, and it comes from a sector well known to the president: the real estate industry.As the nation\u2019s first real estate developer-president \u2014 one who has refused to divest his holdings while occupying the Oval Office and has declined to release his past tax returns \u2014 Mr. Trump brings his career perspective to the tax question, as well as a substantial financial stake in the outcome.His interest will be shared by small builders, brokers and contractors in congressional districts across the country. And as they showed in rolling back previous changes that had taken away advantages, their lobbying prowess is formidable.\u201cThere\u2019s probably no special interest that\u2019s more favored by the existing tax code than real estate,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a real estate tax lawyer and senior fellow at the centrist Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to take that industry on.\u201dMuch of the attention will focus on the tax deduction for interest payments by businesses, a provision that Mr. Trump has used to great advantage in what little has been seen of his past tax returns. The House Republican plan calls for eliminating the deduction as part of an overall plan, helping offset lower tax rates. The nonpartisan, conservative-leaning Tax Foundation says the provision could be a $1.5 trillion proposition over the next decade.The National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade association of apartment owners, managers, developers and lenders, has come to the defense of the interest deduction and other provisions favorable to the real estate industry, describing them as \u201ccore principles\u201d and promising a fight. So has the influential Real Estate Roundtable, whose board includes several of Mr. Trump\u2019s fellow New York developers.The real estate lobby has prominent allies in both parties. After the last major overhaul of the tax code, in 1986 \u2014 under a Republican president, Ronald Reagan, a Republican Senate and a Democratic House \u2014 it was a Democrat, Bill Clinton, who signed legislation that restored lost real estate tax breaks seven years later.While the Trump administration has yet to put forward a plan, Mr. Trump has embraced several key proposals, including some at odds with the House Republican blueprint. His ideas, in many cases, would enhance benefits to developers like himself.\u201cTrump said he knows where the loopholes are, but so far he hasn\u2019t proposed closing any of them,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said. \u201cMaybe he will. But so far he hasn\u2019t made any of the hard decisions that would show he\u2019s willing to close the loopholes that benefit him in order to make the tax code more fair and efficient.\u201dCertain tax breaks, in fact, seem to exist solely or primarily to benefit the real estate industry, with dubious benefits or even harmful effects for the broader economy.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign staff indicated last summer that he wanted to keep the interest deduction. But then Mr. Trump came out in favor of another key element of the House Republican plan: immediate deductibility, or expensing, of capital expenditures, rather than the practice of depreciating assets over time.Tax experts broadly agree that the interest deduction is untenable if the code also allows immediate expensing. That\u2019s because many investors would borrow large sums to make capital expenditures (like buildings), immediately deduct all of the cost and continue to deduct the interest payments \u2014 \u201cdouble dipping,\u201d as Mr. Rosenthal put it.Mr. Rosenthal put it bluntly: \u201cCoupling an interest deduction with expensing is ridiculous.\u201dIn response to the criticism, Mr. Trump pivoted and said he would give taxpayers the \u201coption\u201d of either taking the interest deduction or expensing capital expenditures, not both. But that adds yet another layer of complexity and would be even more costly for the Treasury, since taxpayers would presumably choose the option that resulted in the lower tax bill.Moreover, it is hard to see a path toward reducing overall corporate tax rates \u2014 the crucial element in making any overhaul palatable to a wide swath of businesses \u2014 without the added revenues from eliminating the interest deduction.(Individuals generally cannot deduct interest payments \u2014 with the major exception of mortgage interest, another boon to the real estate industry, albeit one that also benefits millions of homeowners. Mr. Trump has said eliminating the mortgage deduction is off the table.)Then there is the ability of \u201cactive\u201d real estate investors such as Mr. Trump (but virtually no other group) to deduct their real estate losses against other income. That loophole was eliminated for most investors \u2014 including real estate investors \u2014 in the landmark tax legislation in 1986. But because of aggressive lobbying by the powerful real estate industry, including Mr. Trump himself, Congress passed legislation in 1993 restoring the tax break for so-called active real estate developers.Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation, said it was difficult to estimate how much that provision costs the Treasury, because the underlying data is not available.(Whether Mr. Trump would still qualify as an active real estate investor now that he is in the White House and has handed over management of his business interests to his sons is an open question. Ordinarily an investor has to spend 750 hours a year working in real estate to qualify, which would be hard to reconcile with Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential duties.)Another loophole for real estate developers is the so-called like-kind exchange provision, which allows real estate investors to defer or even eliminate capital gains tax by using the proceeds from a sale to reinvest in a similar property (which does not have to be all that similar \u2014 just about any real estate can be exchanged, even an apartment complex for vacant land).Since Mr. Trump has not released his tax returns, the public doesn\u2019t know whether and to what extent he benefits from the provision, but nearly all real estate developers use like-kind exchanges to avoid capital gains tax. The Real Estate Roundtable strongly backs the provision. Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t said whether he would retain it. But it is another special-interest loophole that nearly all tax experts would eliminate.The Tax Foundation estimates that taxing like-kind exchanges would generate $92 billion in additional revenue over 10 years.Advocates of a tax overhaul often point to the 1986 act as a model for a comprehensive approach that ushered in a long period of economic growth. Given the power of the real estate lobby, \u201cpresidential leadership was crucial,\u201d said Leonard E. Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University.Reagan made tax reform a central campaign theme and mustered bipartisan support in Congress. \u201cReagan didn\u2019t get into the details,\u201d Mr. Burman said. \u201cBut he made the calls, he gave the speeches, and he got people excited about the idea of fixing our broken tax system.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine President Trump doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause at the end of the day, the existing tax code is great for people like him.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Sunday about the influence of the real-estate industry on tax issues referred incorrectly to the makeup of Congress when it approved a 1986 tax overhaul. Republicans were in the majority in the Senate and Democrats controlled the House; there was not a \u201cDemocratic Congress\u201d then.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall Street and Washington: A New Love Affair", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byDealBookRepealing Obamacare. Reforming the tax system. Spending big on infrastructure.One by one, President Trump\u2019s campaign promises seem to be less likely \u2014 or at least won\u2019t happen on the timetable he anticipated. So, why are so many chief executives and investors still seemingly bullish about a Trumpian economy?The answer they consistently provide: regulations. Or the promise to get rid of them.But it is actually something else, something that seems vastly underappreciated, that is staring us right in the face: The people whom Mr. Trump has appointed to positions of power can wield significant influence over how business is conducted in America. And in many cases, they can do so unilaterally, without the approval of Congress.The presidency of Donald J. Trump \u2014 the wealthiest businessman to occupy the White House in recent memory \u2014 has ushered in a new paradigm, one in which business and government are married in a way never seen before. And the people whom Mr. Trump has appointed come from the most senior ranks of business, bringing with them a frame of reference that is almost strictly about profit and economic growth.It isn\u2019t often said aloud, but the aristocracy that Mr. Trump has put in place may be more important than any rule written on paper.And while there are significant questions about whether their experience in business will translate in Washington \u2014 and to the Regular Joe who supported Mr. Trump \u2014 their focus on issues that relate to the economy and their reverence for increasing G.D.P. have lifted the spirits in corner offices across America. Whether the topic is trade, infrastructure or taxes, to the C.E.O. set, Mr. Trump speaks their language.\u201cWe are absolutely destroying these horrible regulations that have been placed on your heads,\u201d Mr. Trump declared on Tuesday in Washington to a group of chief executives representing companies like Citigroup, MasterCard and JetBlue.Yes, there are C.E.O.s who are not on board with Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. His penchant for tweeting at all hours and shaming people who disagree with him have, at least for now, silenced them. (Many critics, given the options, have decided that the best course of action is to hope for the best.)That hope is tied to Mr. Trump and his team \u2014 and their power to remove certain regulations and to slow down or thwart the implementation of others. The results could be beneficial to executives in any number of industries: banking, energy, media, technology.In a remarkably blunt and telling memo to its clients, the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s appointment of people overseeing the banking sector could have a more meaningful effect than legislative changes.A look at the business backgrounds of Trump administration appointees and advisers.\u201cTaken together, the senior policy makers at the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have been far more impactful on the regulatory environment than Dodd-Frank,\u201d the memo said. \u201cDodd-Frank\u2019s impact is often overstated.\u201dThe law firm encouraged Mr. Trump to appoint people who have the goal of \u201ccountering the prevailing regulatory philosophy,\u201d meaning they oppose the approach taken under President Barack Obama.Even if Mr. Trump\u2019s team doesn\u2019t try to change regulations (and they already have, in industries like energy and telecommunications), they may show little interest in enforcing existing regulations, which, in and of itself, could have a significant impact on the way business is run.And if Mr. Trump, the businessman-president, is a novelty, so, too, is the makeup of his cabinet. Never before have the most senior roles in government been played by so many billionaires (and near-billionaires) with such extensive experience running companies. His cabinet, kitchen cabinet and just about every cabinet in and around the White House is filled with people from the private sector. A good number of them have long track records of fighting against the departments they now represent.This mind meld of Wall Street and Washington represents a shift that may be even greater than when President Reagan, Mr. Trump\u2019s often-cited role model, entered office.The list of industry captains now running the government is long and well documented. It includes a cadre of former Goldman Sachs bankers, like Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser; and Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist. Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, is the former chief executive of ExxonMobil. Even more junior roles are being filled by former colleagues from the very same companies.Critics have long contended that many of these appointees are conflicted, given their previous work. Some people argue that whatever legislative efforts they pursue will be aimed at enriching themselves or their friends.That may turn out to be true \u2014 or not. But here is an explanation that\u2019s hard to dispute: The people Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with have a particular worldview based on their experiences. If you grow up somewhere or work at a particular institution for any length of time, you assimilate and take on the values and opinions of the people around you.Of course, one of the big questions is how much a president, absent legislation, can sway an economy simply by rolling back regulations.If you look at the precedent set by Mr. Obama, the answer is \u201ca lot.\u201d His White House announced during his last year in office that it had helped save $28 billion by removing regulations, starting in 2011. And much of it was done with the stroke of a pen.Wall Street is bullish on the approach.\u201cRegulatory reform that does not require legislative approval faces a lower hurdle than tax reform and would also provide a boost to S.&P. 500 earnings,\u201d Goldman Sachs recently wrote in a note to its clients.Reforms, the note said, \u201cwill likely come through changes to existing rules as well as the interpretation and application of outstanding regulation.\u201dThe bank, which has seen its own stock rise since the election, suggests that \u201cabout $200 billion of excess capital could be deployed in 2018 as a result of changes in regulatory capital requirements.\u201dCapital requirements are largely governed by the Federal Reserve, meaning they could be adjusted without congressional approval. And the Fed is in transition: Wednesday was the last day in office of Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve Board member who crafted some of the strictest banking rules post-crisis and led the annual stress tests that bankers loathe. He was a thorn in the side of many bankers, who complained that he was too difficult.Mr. Tarullo\u2019s replacement is expected to be a Wall Street insider who will be significantly less strict and may look to lower capital requirements and conduct its stress tests differently.Still, while regulations (or their removal) can clearly have a big influence on the economics of a particular industry or company, the fundamental economic trend lines are much harder to shift.Peter Boockvar, an analyst at the Lindsay Group, an economic advisory firm in Washington, said that confidence among home builders, for example, is high \u2014 which should be a sign the economic outlook is bright.But there are other headwinds, too. In the home construction sector, for instance, \u201cbuilders continue to face a number of challenges, including rising material prices, higher mortgage rates, and shortages of lots and labor,\u201d Mr. Boockvar wrote in an email, citing a report from the National Association of Home Builders.His assessment mirrors the cautious optimism with which the business world is viewing the Trump presidency. On one hand, \u201cit\u2019s great to see this level of confidence,\u201d Mr. Boockvar said, referring to the home builders. But he added, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a Debbie Downer here, but just wanted you not to get too carried away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They included setting election dates, freeing political prisoners and allowing legislators to write laws.\u201cToday, we are beginning a new stage in the democratic struggle to arrive at elections,\u201d he said. \u201cOur first objective is to mobilize, to show that we are the majority.\u201dWhile past protest movements by the opposition have often sought to topple the leftist government \u2014 one in 2002 even briefly deposed Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the president at the time \u2014 the current wave has a more modest goal: a timetable for elections, which the opposition believes it will win.\u201cIn the past, the opposition focused on getting rid of Chavismo, which proved unrealistic,\u201d said Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy group. \u201cThis time is different.\u201dPro-government rallies also formed, and in a defiant address on Wednesday, Mr. Maduro said he welcomed elections, vowing that leftists would trounce the opposition. \u201cI want us to prepare ourselves so we have a total electoral victory,\u201d he said. However, he offered no date for a vote.Instead, the government met protesters with tear gas and water cannons. Some demonstrators took refuge in a nearby river.The leftist movement, weakened by a failing economy and food shortages, is almost certain to lose its grip on power in a popular vote, according to polls. The country\u2019s rulers already postponed elections for governors last year.There were also signs that the lower middle class and the poor, who benefited most from Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s programs and who steered clear of opposition protests in 2002 and 2014, might be willing to join the demand for elections.Demonstrations in recent weeks have erupted in poor districts of Caracas, the capital, which have suffered most from shortages of food and medicine. And there were signs that many from those areas had come to the streets again on Wednesday.\u201cI live in a barrio, and the people there go around begging for food,\u201d said Beatriz Bustamante, a 61-year-old from the Petare neighborhood, a poor district in which opposition support is strong. Ms. Bustamante blamed the government for rising crime, including the death of her only son, who was killed during a robbery.Even some of the loyalists sent out by Mr. Maduro said they doubted him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what is going on\u201d in this country, said DeManuel Hern\u00e1ndez, a 24-year-old militia member.\u201cSome say there\u2019s an economic war, but I\u2019ve also heard that the president doesn\u2019t understand how to control the economy,\u201d he said.Not far from Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, a crowd had gathered in support of Mr. Maduro. But it numbered only in the few thousands, far less than in previous marches or the huge crowds of the opposition, which shut down highways and the city center.Still, many there defended the president.\u201cWe came to support Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and the legacy of Ch\u00e1vez because we can\u2019t lose the great social advances of the revolution,\u201d said Vlacmy Solorzano, 40, a member of a government food distribution group.But even Ms. Solorzano said elections needed to be held soon.\u201cIf we don\u2019t win, we have to accept the result,\u201d she said.An article on Thursday about political unrest in Venezuela misstated, in some copies, the total number of people who had died in recent protests against the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.

Here are some of our in-depth articles about the race:The presidential candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon has found himself in deep trouble over payments from public funds to his wife and children. France has a long history of such cozy arrangements, but the revelations about Mr. Fillon tapped a wellspring of anger._____France is losing the core of its provincial towns \u2014 dense hubs of urbanity deep in the countryside where Balzac set his novels, prefects issued edicts and citizens shopped for 50 cheeses. Our reporter Adam Nossiter headed to Albi, one of those small towns whose fate is intertwined with voters\u2019 anxieties about the French way of life._____A traditional distaste for the far right appeared to be softening during this campaign. Uncertainties and a sense that mainstream parties have failed to offer solutions to the country\u2019s economic anemia have left the National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, better positioned than at any other time in its 45-year history._____Ms. Le Pen sought to sanitize the image of the National Front and distance the party from the uglier associations of Europe\u2019s far right. The efforts seemed to have paid off, but the news that two of her associates had longtime links to Nazi sympathizers and the party\u2019s campaign finance scandals raised new doubts._____The issue of French identity and heritage is at the heart of the presidential campaign. Our Paris bureau chief, Alissa J. Rubin, went to Joinville, a small town in rural France. Graceful old structures there have been stripped \u2014 a vivid illustration of the gradual depopulation of many of the country\u2019s villages, and what some fear is an ebbing away of French traditions and culture._____Just as it was in the United States last year, Moscow is accused of orchestrating fake and slanted reports in France to bolster politicians who share the Kremlin\u2019s views and to weaken those who do not._____An in-depth profile of Emmanuel Macron, a former economy minister and one of the front-runners.

Further, depending on where they live, some middle-class families might not benefit much or at all, because the plan does away with important deductions like those for state and local taxes.As to the rationale offered up by Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Cohn, even many conservative economists believe that the argument that tax cuts will pay for themselves, by increasing investment and creating jobs, is the same supply-side fantasy that has repeatedly been proved wrong. This durable nonsense would instead add mightily to a federal debt that Americans will be paying off for generations to come.Whatever the number, the outcome cannot be good. There are legitimate reasons to run deficits, including lifting the economy in tough times, strengthening the military against proven threats and building or rebuilding public infrastructure. Borrowing trillions of dollars to provide a huge windfall for people at the top is not one of those reasons.It is hard to know whether Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan or some version of it could pass. Republican leaders have said that they want to pass revenue-neutral changes to the tax code that would not explode the deficit. Still, many of these same lawmakers went along with the budget-busting tax cuts offered by President George W. Bush.Regardless of the plan\u2019s fate, Mr. Trump has already sent a strong message about where his sympathies really lie. They lie not with the working people who elected him, but with the plutocracy that envelops him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Economists Fear Trump\u2019s Tax Plan Only Heightens a \u2018Mountain of Debt\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseDuring his campaign, Donald J. Trump embraced the cause of fiscal responsibility and accused President Barack Obama of shackling the country with a \u201cmountain of debt.\u201dThen on Wednesday, Mr. Trump unveiled the outlines of his much-anticipated tax overhaul, calling for steep tax cuts with only modest offsetting revenue increases. Economists I spoke to this week estimate it would add trillions to the national debt over the next decade.\u201cWe\u2019ve only done the rough numbers, but this looks like a tax cut of a magnitude of about $5 trillion,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan advocacy organization for fiscal responsibility. \u201cThat is simply unimaginable given our fiscal situation and the size of the deficit, which is already the worst since World War II.\u201dThe sense of incredulity was widely shared.Or as Steven M. Rosenthal, a business tax expert and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, put it: \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s plan basically is tax cuts for everyone. Real reform, with revenue neutrality, is difficult. There are winners and losers, but Trump apparently just wants winners.\u201dTax cuts, as opposed to tax reform, are easy, Ms. MacGuineas agreed: \u201cWho doesn\u2019t love a tax cut, especially if no one has to pay for it? This is a free-lunch mentality.\u201dThat Mr. Trump would embrace such a cut-now, pay-later approach probably shouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise, considering the Trump Organization\u2019s reliance on borrowed money. \u201cI\u2019m the king of debt,\u201d Mr. Trump said last year on CNN. \u201cI love debt.\u201dJust how much Mr. Trump\u2019s plan would cost the government is hard to determine, given the sketchy details. But the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation estimates that two prospective elements \u2014 reducing individual rates to three brackets of 35, 25 and 10 percent, and cutting the tax rate for corporations and pass-through entities (businesses that pay taxes at individual rates) to 15 percent \u2014 would cost the Treasury $4 trillion to $6 trillion over 10 years, said Alan Cole, an economist at the foundation.Mr. Trump also wants to eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, each of which would cost the Treasury hundreds of millions in revenue.The administration\u2019s proposal was silent on some critical aspects of any tax plan, such as the treatment of capital expenditures for business. Mr. Trump has said he strongly supports immediate expensing of capital expenditures, which many economists agree would encourage growth. The Tax Foundation estimates that such a change from current depreciation schedules would cost the Treasury $2.2 trillion over 10 years.That would raise the 10-year revenue loss to well over $8 trillion.Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal did nod in the direction of raising revenue by calling for elimination of all deductions, save those for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and retirement savings. The major deduction not mentioned \u2014 and evidently jettisoned \u2014 is the one for state and local taxes. (And it\u2019s probably no coincidence that the states that would be hit hardest, like New York and California, overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton.)Mr. Cole said eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes would add about $2 trillion of revenue over 10 years.But the Trump plan didn\u2019t address other possible sources of revenue, such as eliminating the interest deduction for businesses or imposing a border tax. Both are key elements of the Republican House plan, but have drawn fierce opposition from the powerful real estate and retail lobbies.The Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, suggested that the plan would \u201cpay for itself\u201d by bolstering economic growth and tax receipts. But no economist I spoke to this week \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 said growth could compensate for an increase in the deficit of anywhere near the magnitude of $4 trillion to $6 trillion.While economists debate the impact of vast additional government borrowing on debt markets, most argue it would drive up interest rates, curbing the very growth the cuts were intended to foster. \u201cBorrowing trillions of dollars eventually shows up in financial markets,\u201d Mr. Burman said. \u201cIt will almost certainly push up interest rates.\u201dAnd the effect would come at a time when the Federal Reserve is already raising interest rates, even without the impact of new federal borrowing.\u201cWe\u2019re very vulnerable to higher rates,\u201d Ms. MacGuineas said. \u201cEvery 1 percent increase in interest rates adds $160 billion a year to our existing interest payments. Interest is already the fastest-growing portion of the federal budget.\u201dShe, too, argued that a big increase in federal borrowing would push up interest rates, undermining growth \u201cor even causing negative growth.\u201dThe Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated that when additional interest payments were included, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign tax proposals would add $7.2 trillion to the national debt by 2026 and $20.9 trillion by 2036.\u201cThe losers are future generations,\u201d said Mr. Rosenthal \u2014 as Republicans have long argued.Given the huge impact on the deficit, no one I spoke to expects Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to be enacted without significant modifications. \u201cI don\u2019t think a tax cut of anywhere near this size can make it through Congress,\u201d Ms. MacGuineas said. \u201cThere are varying degrees of commitment to getting our fiscal affairs under control among members of Congress, and there are some Republicans who only use the argument against Democrats. But there are others who are very serious about it.\u201dMr. Holtz-Eakin agreed. \u201cThere are many Republicans who genuinely care about deficits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey recognize that you can\u2019t create permanent tax reform if you\u2019re blowing up the deficit. \u201cHe added: \u201cI think this is an opening salvo. With this president, everything is a negotiation, and this is his opening bid.\u201dEven that prospect is worrisome, Ms. MacGuineas said. \u201cThese numbers are so huge, they almost lose meaning,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start negotiating about adding $5 trillion to the deficit and $1 trillion starts to sound reasonable. But that shouldn\u2019t even be on the table without a plan to get the deficit under control.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The latest concoction presented by President Trump is being touted as \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d of tax revenue.It received its iconic truth-in-advertising label from George H. W.

Most large corporations don\u2019t pay this rate anyhow. I favor a reduction in the marginal corporate tax rate to 20 percent \u2014 and further reductions for creating jobs \u2014 as long as it is accompanied by the elimination of all loopholes and dodges, an increase in the personal income tax rate for high earners and a progressive wealth tax.Cutting the corporate tax rate would help small business, stimulate the economy and add domestic jobs.STUART DUNN, NEW YORKTo the Editor:To the Editor:Congress should maintain one of the mainstays of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s monumental Tax Reform Act of 1986: Tax small-business income and capital gains at the same rates as ordinary income like wages.It is inherently unfair to average wage-earning Americans for individuals who receive small-business income or capital gains to pay taxes at lower rates. In fact, many so-called \u201csmall businesses\u201d are partnerships that serve merely as investment vehicles for their owners.Despite some rhetoric to the contrary, lower rates on capital gains and small-business income are not required for individuals to invest in new businesses. Under Mr. Reagan\u2019s 1986 tax act, similar investments did not come to a halt.Having different tax rates for various sources of income will result in income tax \u201cgamesmanship.\u201d For example, even under current law many individuals create corporate entities to receive their consulting income. Why should such consulting income be taxed at lower rates? Taxes should be fair.DAVID NELSON, HOUSTONThe writer is a former tax partner at Ernst & Young.To the Editor:If Donald Trump the candidate had any intention of keeping his campaign promise of providing more jobs, then Donald Trump the president would not propose lowering corporate taxes but would propose using part of revenues gained from corporations to create job-training programs.No doubt there is some pro-business, supply-side rationale saying lower taxes will help keep corporations and jobs in the United States. But as corporations gain more money and power in America, I have seen no evidence that they become more altruistic or concerned about their employees or their customers.ANNE MACKIN, BOSTONAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do Tax Cuts Really Spur Growth? It Depends on the Details.", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byIf your tax rate were lowered tomorrow, how would it affect your work habits?Maybe you would work harder \u2014 put in longer hours, take on special projects, do everything you can to get that next promotion. After all, lower taxes would mean you get to keep more of each dollar you earn.Or maybe you would work less. After all, if you are happy with your current standard of living, lower taxes would mean that you could maintain it while putting in fewer hours at the office. Who needs that promotion when you\u2019re able to keep more of the money you already make?Or possibly you would work exactly the same amount, because life is too short to sit around making every decision based on what is in the tax code.That little mental exercise \u2014 and the fact that reasonable people may choose any of the options \u2014 helps explain why the Trump administration\u2019s plans to induce stronger economic growth by cutting taxes won\u2019t necessarily work.At the core of decades of Republican economic policy is a simple idea: Cutting taxes will unleash investments and lead to higher incomes, more jobs and more rapid growth. And there are historical episodes that would seem to support that idea, most notably when Ronald Reagan cut taxes in the early 1980s, and the economy boomed in the years that followed.But there\u2019s considerably less evidence that this cause-and-effect applies at all times and at all places. George W. Bush\u2019s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were followed by years of disappointing growth. Bill Clinton\u2019s tax increases in 1993 were followed by a boom that surpassed the Reagan-era expansion.In a large body of academic research on this question, it seems that the exact time period and country examined and how tax changes are measured matters a lot \u2014 as does what the government does with the revenue.For example, the economists Robert J. Barro and Charles J. Redlick looked at the relationship, studying the United States from 1912 to 2006, and found that cutting the average marginal tax rate on Americans by 1 percentage point raised the next year\u2019s per-person economic output by about 0.5 percent.But research across time periods and countries shows more ambiguous results.\u201cThe basic finding in the literature is that it\u2019s very hard to detect a robust impact from changing taxes to growth,\u201d said Andrew Samwick, a Dartmouth economist who co-wrote a review of the evidence. \u201cIf you look across countries, unless they\u2019re actually out there confiscating assets through their tax system, you don\u2019t find a strong relationship.\u201dIn other words, there are countries with high or rising taxes that have strong growth, and countries with low or falling rates that don\u2019t.Part of that has to do with the many factors that go into economic growth that have nothing to do with taxes, including demographic change and technological advances (or lack thereof), which makes trying to isolate the impact of tax changes tricky. But it also ties to the importance of understanding how tax cuts may fuel growth \u2014 and the limits of those channels.If the government lowers income taxes on individuals, it changes the incentives for them to work and spend \u2014 going back to the conundrum of how a tax cut may affect your working behavior.If individual income tax rates are lowered and it leads people, in the aggregate, to work more hours or strive harder for a promotion, secure in the knowledge they will keep a bigger chunk of higher earnings, then it could increase the productive potential of the economy \u2014 and more people working more hours with higher productivity means higher economic growth.If the reverse effect prevails \u2014 people needing to work less to support themselves thanks to lower taxes \u2014 a tax cut could even cause lower growth, in theory.But the possible effects on peoples\u2019 work habits are just one of the ways tax policy ripples through the economy.Although many conservative arguments around the pro-growth effects of income tax tend to focus on the marginal rate \u2014 how much people must pay on each incremental dollar of income they receive \u2014 there are also situations where cutting other rates to leave more money in peoples\u2019 pockets matters.When the economy is in recession, both conservative and liberal economists have argued that tax rebates (like one supported by George W. Bush in 2001) or reductions in the payroll tax (which were a part of Barack Obama\u2019s stimulus efforts in 2009) can help support demand in the economy and promote short-term growth.But the more you game out the various ways taxes can affect the economy, the more obvious it becomes why the economic impact of tax cuts is so uncertain and subject to debate.For one thing, taxes exist for a purpose \u2014 funding the government \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t help much to look at one side of the government\u2019s ledger, taxes, without also looking at the other, spending.That is to say, in assessing the economic impact of taxes, it helps to know what the tax money is going toward. If taxes are raised to pay for programs that increase the productive capacity of the country \u2014 programs that make workers more efficient, or infrastructure projects that have long-lasting benefits \u2014 the net effect on growth is more likely to be positive than if the projects that tax increases pay for are wasteful.And even if tax cuts are funded by bigger budget deficits instead of spending cuts, taxpayers are still footing the bill in one way or another. Higher public debt amounts to a burden that taxpayers will face over time as they pay back interest and principal on that debt, and arguably higher debt levels could crowd out private sector investment by pushing interest rates higher.Indeed, you could argue that the liberals\u2019 and conservatives\u2019 differences on taxes is less a technocratic debate over optimal taxation but a proxy war for a bigger philosophical argument on the role of government.\u201cA lot of the debate about taxes is really a debate about spending,\u201d said Leonard E. Burman, who studies tax policy at the Urban Institute. \u201cWhat is the role of government, and what is the value of government spending? Those tend to be the real underlying question.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say that different taxes are likely to have different implications for growth. While economists are divided on whether the corporate income tax is ultimately borne more by shareholders or by workers, it\u2019s fairly straightforward math that a lower tax rate on businesses lowers the threshold at which companies can justify capital investments, which over time should lead to greater investment.Conversely, consumption taxes, like the sales taxes charged by many states or value-added taxes charged in many countries around the world, seem to cause less of a drag on growth than taxes on income and investment. After all, they don\u2019t tax work or investment, the roots of economic growth.And even most die-hard liberals would agree that taxes can be damaging to the economy if they are overly complex to comply with, erratically enforced, or set at levels so high that the incentive to evade them is high. The dispute, of course, is what would count as too complex or too high.\u201cTax increases associated with productive investments can help growth, and deficit-financed tax cuts can harm growth,\u201d said Chye-Ching Huang, who studies taxes at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cSome people claim there\u2019s a broad consensus that tax cuts are good or bad, but there isn\u2019t one, because the question is too big. The answer to a question that imprecise is always going to be, \u2018It depends.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tribes That Live Off Coal Hold Tight to Trump\u2019s Promises", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byCROW AGENCY, Mont. \u2014 The pale yellow halls of the Crow government building here are nearly empty these days, with 1,000 of this tribe\u2019s 1,300 employees recently laid off.Across the way, Rebecca Ten Bear Reed and her children have no running water. And past the nearby grassy hills, families live a dozen to a home, playgrounds have fallen to tatters and this tribe of roughly 13,000 people is now turning to President Trump\u2019s promise to revive coal for its future.\u201cThis is the worst I\u2019ve ever seen it. Ever,\u201d said the tribe\u2019s chief executive, Paul Little Light, explaining that revenue had dwindled as the Crow\u2019s main resource fell from favor. \u201cA lot of people are not Trump fans here. Very few. But we would be his best friends if he brought back coal.\u201dWhen thousands of Native Americans converged near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation last year, their stance against the Dakota Access oil pipeline became a global symbol of indigenous opposition to the pro-drilling, pro-mining agenda that Mr. Trump adopted.But some of the largest tribes in the United States derive their budgets from the very fossil fuels that Mr. Trump has pledged to promote, including the Navajo in the Southwest and the Osage in Oklahoma, as well as smaller tribes like the Southern Ute in Colorado. And the Crow are among several Indian nations looking to the president\u2019s promises to nix Obama-era coal rules, pull back on regulations, or approve new oil and gas wells to help them lift their economies and wrest control from a federal bureaucracy they have often seen as burdensome.In a recent interview, Mr. Zinke noted that he was once adopted into the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes and said he would help native nations get fossil fuels to market.\u201cWe have not been a good partner in this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe amount of bureaucracy and paperwork and stalling in many ways has created great hardship on some of the poorest tribes.\u201cA war on coal is a war on the Crow people,\u201d he continued. \u201cPresident Trump has promised to end the war.\u201dStripped of other resources, many tribes have had to rely on pit mines and oil pads to fund their budgets. This has bred conflict within not only Indian nations, but also individual hearts, with people torn between revenue that feeds their children and a deep commitment to protecting the environment.Complicating the matter is the coal market. Although Mr. Trump has promised to revive the industry, power plants across the country are switching to cheap natural gas, leaving no guarantee that his policies will bring money back into tribal bank accounts.\u201cUnless there is severe restriction of natural gas production, there is not much U.S. coal can do to expand its market in the U.S.,\u201d said Ian Lange, director of the mineral and energy economics program at the Colorado School of Mines.Under the Trump administration, some native nations are asking for help as they work toward other revenue streams, including renewable energy. Others are seeking greater control of their own land, so they can create their own rules on harmful activities related to development, like gas flaring and wastewater dumping.The Absaloka opened in 1974. It operates all day every day, employs about 170 people and has left a complex legacy. The work \u2014 shoveling coal dust, hauling through the night in trucks \u2014 is grueling.But on the reservation, coal royalties, taxes and mine salaries have funded college educations, weddings and much-cherished homes with ponies corralled in the back. A coal payment every four months of about $225 to every tribal citizen puts food on tables, warm jackets on backs and gifts under Christmas trees.Ms. Ten Bear Reed, the mother without running water, recently used her coal payout to buy a hot bath at a local motel. Normally, she sponge-cleans at home.\u201cI care about the environment, I really do,\u201d said Ms. Ten Bear Reed, 37, who is raising two children on a $9-an-hour casino job. \u201cBut when you see that money, then you don\u2019t care. Because you\u2019re getting the thing you need.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which called for coal-fired power plants to reduce emissions, threw the future of the Absaloka mine, and the Crow budget, into question, said Kenneth Brien, the tribe\u2019s energy director. Already, coal revenue here has dwindled, contributing to the tribe\u2019s current economic crisis.\u201cI want to make this clear: Obama was a great president,\u201d Mr. Brien said. But his energy policies, he said, \u201cwould have devastated the tribe.\u201dOne of the first tests of Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to coal could come in his administration\u2019s response to the Navajo and Hopi, who derive millions of dollars from a coal-fired power plant nestled amid red rocks in Arizona, as well as an associated mine.\u201cBack up what you\u2019re saying about coal,\u201d Mr. Begaye said, addressing Mr. Trump. \u201cGive us 10 years.\u201dIn the small, rectangular homes that dot the Crow reservation, hope for Mr. Trump\u2019s administration is also accompanied by fear.Tribal leaders are acutely aware of the need to diversify their economy. They have begun selling local bison meat, and hope to break ground soon on a hydroelectric project. There is talk of building a cement plant and solar and wind farms. But none of these endeavors are bringing in meaningful revenue at the moment.At the same time, Mr. Trump has proposed cutting the budget of the Interior Department by 12 percent and the Health and Human Services budget by 18 percent, which could shrink services from Meals on Wheels to reservation law enforcement, education and health care.\u201cIt was a cultural stand,\u201d said L.

{"Headline": "Could a Leftist Bring Growth Back to France?", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 If the first round of the French presidential election on Sunday is now too close to call, that\u2019s partly because of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s last-minute surge in the polls. The media describe him as a populist from the far left, and as he has risen, attacks on him have intensified.Is it, though?Mr. M\u00e9lenchon would certainly face significant political hurdles if elected, including the need to build political support for his program in Parliament. But the French economy, despite serious problems, could sustain, as well as benefit from, his proposals.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s critics say that France is already living beyond its means. The French enjoy a level of economic security and living standards that most Americans can only dream about: universal health care, free child care and public-university education, a 35-hour workweek, higher life expectancy, and lower per capita energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The new government, say people who oppose Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s views, will have to focus on reducing the public debt.But the numbers do not bear them out.France\u2019s main economic problem today is the same as that of the eurozone: virtually no growth in G.D.P. per capita since the world financial crisis of 2008. And the main culprits of that are the misguided policies of the economic orthodoxy in Europe.In the view of many economists at the International Monetary Fund and, say, Emmanuel Macron, a former economy minister of France and now a presidential candidate, the fundamental cause of unemployment in France is a rigid labor market \u2014 not, as Mr. M\u00e9lenchon and others argue, inadequate demand in the economy. So their proposed fix is to lower labor costs by reducing the bargaining power of unions, making it easier for employers to dismiss workers and raising eligibility requirements for social or unemployment benefits.Reforms of this kind have been passed over the last few years, including the so-called \u201cloi Macron,\u201d which relaxed rules for letting employees go. More have been recommended by the I.M.F. and European Union authorities.But \u2014 to take just one example \u2014 cuts to France\u2019s pension system in 2010 were as unnecessary as they were unpopular. The year before, projections by the European Commission showed that spending on public pensions in France would increase by just 1 percent of G.D.P. over the next 60 years. Given that France\u2019s G.D.P. was projected to more than double over that period, that increase would have been eminently affordable.So why not put some money into public investment that will provide positive real returns while creating new jobs?Yes, high unemployment has been a fixture of the French economy for several decades now. But a major fiscal stimulus could spur overall demand in the economy, and that would encourage employers to hire workers.But Europe cannot endure another decade of mass unemployment, which denies a future to so many young people and fuels the xenophobic far right. This is the reason Mr. M\u00e9lenchon has called for renegotiating European Union treaties. Some argue that position is too radical. Yet it is those who champion strict adherence to the European authorities\u2019 failed economic policies who stoke anti-European sentiment and endanger the future of European integration. France has enough clout within the eurozone to help steer it in a better direction.Mark Weisbrot is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C., and the author of \u201cFailed: What the \u2018Experts\u2019 Got Wrong About the Global Economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "During Rikers Upheaval, the \u2018Prettiest Village in Maine\u2019 Beckoned", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byWISCASSET, Me. \u2014 The trip, even in the best of conditions, is one that will eat up at least a quarter of a day. It starts with creeping through traffic heading out of New York City and soon gives way to a tour of New England. One route touches five states, skirting bigger cities and cutting through smaller ones, but mostly the journey is spent cruising along on six-lane highways, whipping past a blur of trees.An inquiry by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation into the personal use of Correction Department vehicles found that they had been driven off to outlet malls and the Hamptons and, in the case of Mr. Ponte, to Maine, where he lived before coming to New York in 2014.Tracking the vehicle\u2019s movements through GPS, E-ZPass data and records on gasoline purchases, along with other information, investigators found that Mr. Ponte had spent 90 days last year outside of New York, including 35 during the workweek.Among the destinations, officials said, was Wiscasset, a town of more than 3,000 people reached after long rides on winding country roads and marked with a welcome sign that declares it the \u201cPrettiest Village in Maine.\u201d Mr. Ponte and his wife had, until recently, owned a home here, and he has adult children living in the state. Officials said he had also visited nearby resorts.The working-class town, sitting along the Sheepscot River, has an economy driven in large part by tourism; antiques dealers, art galleries and boutiques dominate the few blocks that constitute downtown, and Red\u2019s Eats, a small food stand, overshadows them all with its ability to draw a crowd as noteworthy as its lobster rolls.Some around Wiscasset said they had recognized Mr. Ponte or had encountered him or his wife around town. But many said people here tended to place a premium on independence, treasuring a kind of live-and-let-live attitude in which neighbors are friendly but also allow for a bit of space.\u201cEveryone just leaves you alone,\u201d said Deb Schaffer, who owns a boutique downtown and remembers seeing Mr. Ponte and exchanging greetings on the street. \u201cBut if you need something, they\u2019re there to help.\u201dHis work in Maine led him to be recruited by Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2014 in an effort to overhaul the Correction Department in New York. During his time as commissioner, the agency has had some successes, including expanding education and therapeutic programs and ending solitary confinement for inmates younger than 22.Officials said he had put about 18,500 miles of out-of-state travel on the vehicle, costing less than $1,800 in gas and tolls. Officials and investigators declined to elaborate on where he had gone on those trips, and it is unclear how he spent his time in Maine.Mr. Ponte and his wife had owned a home in Wiscasset about a mile from downtown, a gray house perched on a hill at the end of a short road, with a wraparound porch offering a sweeping view of the river and a panorama of trees. It is about a half-hour drive to the State Department of Corrections headquarters in Augusta.These days, ahead of the busy season, there is no line at Red\u2019s, and in the parking lot by the yacht club, there were only a couple sitting in their truck, reading the paper and eating sandwiches on their \u201cdate night.\u201d The issue driving much of the town\u2019s conversations was hotly debated plans to alter Route 1, the main street through downtown, and add traffic lights.Even when things pick up, the draw of the area remains the same: It serves as a \u201csanctuary\u201d for many who come and appreciate the stunning vistas that surround them, said Matthew Robinson, an antiques dealer who has a shop in an old bank across from Red\u2019s.Visitors here try not to gain notice, and residents often list the names of the celebrities they have come across but have not gawked at. \u201cIt\u2019s not a place like the Hamptons,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way people sort of want it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t aspire to have a society.\u201dAcross the street, as she worked in her shop, Ms. Schaffer said the area had an undeniable appeal, one that she remembered from visits as a child and that led her move here two decades ago.\u201cMy soul\u2019s at peace here,\u201d she said.Lynn Murray, who works with Ms. Schaffer, agreed. She had come to Maine for work years ago, then left for Montana only to miss the trees and water, and she quickly sought a way back.\u201cOur way of life,\u201d she said, \u201cis the best way of life.\u201dWilliam K.

Trump may have found much of his agenda stymied, like a health care overhaul and a hotly contested immigration order.But he can at least point to the biggest stock market rise of any president since the 1980s.In Mr. Trump\u2019s first 100 days, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen about 5 percent, in what supporters have called a \u201cTrump bump.\u201dOnly George Bush enjoyed a bigger stock market rise, with the index gaining 7.7 percent in his first 100 days as president in 1989 amid a 15-year low in unemployment and efforts to shore up the battered savings-and-loan industry.By comparison, in Barack Obama\u2019s first 100 days in the White House, the S.&P. rose 2.8 percent. Under George W. Bush, it fell 7.3 percent. Under Bill Clinton, it rose 0.9 percent. Under Ronald Reagan, it fell 1 percent.Much of the markets\u2019 movements arises from circumstances beyond any president\u2019s control. When Mr. Obama took office in early 2009, the country was still grappling with the fallout of a global financial crisis that had mired the economy in deep recession.And the younger Mr. Bush assumed the presidency amid the bursting of the dot-com bubble, which wiped out scores of internet stocks.But from the moment Mr. Trump won the 2016 election, analysts and bankers predicted a bump in the S.&P., based in part on the promises of an overtly business-friendly presidency. Mr. Trump has pledged to lift regulations that he said were stymieing private enterprise, while ushering in both big tax cuts and greater infrastructure spending.Since taking office, Mr. Trump has made good on some of those promises, lifting regulations on the financial and energy industries while appointing government officials inclined to look more favorably upon business. The White House tax proposal this week called for a drastic cut to corporate taxes.And still, much of what has happened is because of factors beyond the administration\u2019s promises and control, according to Erik Knutzen, the multi-class asset chief investment officer at Neuberger Berman.While Mr. Trump has asserted that he \u201cinherited a mess\u201d from Mr. Obama, the economy that he took over has shown some fundamental resilience: a 10th year of economic expansion, stock markets at historical highs and low interest rates.Much of the improvement in market indexes of late, Mr. Knutzen said, came from strong corporate earnings in the first fiscal quarter of the year \u2014 which the new administration would have had little to do with. \u201cI think most of the movements in the markets in the last five and a half months are much more associated with improvements in global economies,\u201d he said.On Friday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 4.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,384.20. The Dow Jones industrial average gave up 40.82 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,940.51. The Nasdaq composite lost 1.33 points, less than 0.1 percent, to 6,047.61.And the path forward for Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cut proposal is murky. What was unveiled on Wednesday so far holds great promises for corporate America, from slashing the business tax rate to 15 percent to a one-time tax holiday for companies to bring back trillions of dollars in profits earned overseas. Whether the White House can win support from Congress remains an open question.\u201cWhile that\u2019s possible, from a prudence standpoint, I think it\u2019s better to assume volatility will increase,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which former President Barack Obama began his first term.

{"Headline": "Strengthening Britain\u2019s Hand on Brexit", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe election cannot change the outcome of last year\u2019s referendum in which British voters shocked the world by voting to leave the European Union. She is stuck with that. But what she will need is the backing of the British people for the extraordinarily difficult negotiations with the union to determine how, at what pace and at what cost to the British economy the separation is to be achieved. It\u2019s also best for the European Union to know who it\u2019s dealing with as it grapples with major challenges to its own future.Mrs. May claimed she changed her mind on an election \u201conly recently and reluctantly\u201d because opposition parties and the House of Lords were weakening her negotiating stance. The real reason is more prosaic: The Labour Party under the far-left Jeremy Corbyn is a mess, and unless something startling happens in the next seven weeks, Mrs. May\u2019s Conservatives will greatly expand their majority in Parliament. Elections will also give the prime minister, who took power last July without a national vote, a personal mandate.Most important, a strong showing should give Mrs. May the flexibility and authority she will need once the enormously complex and fraught negotiations get going \u2014 after France and Germany hold their own national elections, the former this weekend and the latter in September. The European Union will resist making major concessions to Britain for fear of encouraging other members to exit, so Mrs. May will be under considerable pressure to make compromises that hard-core advocates of Brexit will strongly resist.At that point, Mrs. May\u2019s polling numbers are likely to sink, especially if she opts for a phased withdrawal at the cost of continuing to allow the free movement of Europeans into Britain for some time. That is a feature of union membership that Brexiteers especially loathe. Similarly, Britons still harboring hopes that Brexit can be avoided are likely to see them dashed once Mrs. May secures a firm mandate from voters.All these passions are certain to peak as the March 2019 deadline for the Britain-European Union divorce approaches, so by pushing the next scheduled general election from 2020 to 2022 Mrs. May also gives herself a needed political buffer.That, at least, is the picture at this juncture. There have been too many electoral surprises and misleading polls \u2014 including the polls predicting Brexit would be rejected in last year\u2019s referendum \u2014 to take anything for granted. The election could re-energize Scottish nationalists, and after calling her own election, Mrs. May will have a hard time arguing that another Scottish referendum would be ill timed.Whether Britain is wise or not to leave the European Union, the die is cast, and what is important now is to ensure a divorce that is the least disruptive and destructive to both sides. For that, Mrs. May is right to ask the British once again for their judgment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "For almost 80 years, commercial real estate has been an asset class in which the average investor has been unable to participate, as it has been accessible only to wealthy individuals and institutional investors. But now, that's changing. Crowdfunding technology and recently enacted laws have created a new public market that allows more people to invest in opportunities that were once reserved exclusively for private offerings.This form of crowdfunding enables different types of investors to pool their resources in order to potentially earn high returns through investing in the development of large-scale commercial properties. These new laws coupled with recent advances in technology are essentially leveling the playing field by giving more people access to some of the world\u2019s prime investment assets. Looking for the next big investment?Interest in commercial real estate in New York began in the early 1900s. With population growth surging and a lack of residential and commercial properties to fulfil demand, early investors began to capitalize on the opportunity by investing in New York\u2019s rapidly growing real estate development market. Real estate proved to be a relatively consistent source of income compared with other asset classes as investors were able to collect rental income regardless of economic conditions, assuming their tenants remained in business. Real estate was especially attractive after the stock market crash of 1929, which erased an estimated $30 billion of wealth from the U.S. economy. Within months, more than 3.2 million people were unemployed, some 6,000 of them selling apples for a nickel apiece on New York City's street corners. While this was taking place, many building owners across the city were still collecting rent from their tenants. A turning point came in 1933, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was inaugurated. To curtail the economic chaos within the economy, Roosevelt enacted two major laws intended to restore investors' confidence in the stock market and stabilize the financial markets. First was the Securities Act of 1933, which required companies that offered investments to the public to disclose the nature of their business and risks of investing. This law was followed by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a U.S. government agency that reviews companies' stock registration statements. The 1933 and 1934 securities acts reduced certain investment risks because they helped cut down rampant fraud by unregulated stock promoters. They also worked to protect small investors by restricting the types of offerings that promoters were allowed to present to them (including much of commercial real estate). In what became the public stock market, companies raised capital by selling shares on exchanges or through investment brokers. All investors were allowed to buy these shares, which were registered with the SEC and presented to the public with SEC-required disclosures. Companies could also raise capital in the private market, but these investments weren't registered or advertised openly. Instead, they were sold through private offerings to a sector of individuals later known as accredited investors. \"The idea was to differentiate between people who were raising significant monies from a lot of people on a public basis, where there was the potential for fraud, from the mom and pops,\" explains Thomas Kearns, a commercial real estate attorney and partner at Olshan, Frome, Wolosky in New York City. As a result, those individuals allowed to participate in the private market in the 1930s were part of an elite group. These laws stabilized investment markets but had unforeseen consequences, some of which negatively impacted the very investors the laws were supposed to protect. The artificial divide between public and private securities locked most investors out of commercial real estate investment opportunities, among other private offerings, and eventually led to an imbalance in the financial markets by concentrating much of the country's wealth in the private sector. \"If you were just a member of the general public, you couldn't invest,\" Kearns says. \"There was some loss of opportunity.\" Investment opportunities abound in NYC, but commercial real estate has often been relegated to the super-rich. Prodigy Network is opening this door for everyone by creating a crowdfunding model of commercial real estate investing. Explore some of its recent opportunities by clicking on the buildings below. Sixty-seven years after the Great Depression ended, the United States experienced another severe economic crisis that became known as the Great Recession. While the causes were complex, there's no question that the uneven concentration of wealth, lack of transparency in the financial system, misalignment of return on capital, and complex financial instruments called derivatives, contributed to this period of tremendous turmoil in the U.S. economy. During the Great Recession, the U.S. gross domestic product dropped 4.3 percent and the unemployment rate nearly doubled from less than 5 percent to 9.5 percent. Though the recession technically ended in 2009, the unemployment rate continued to rise and later hit a high of 10 percent.In the years that followed, economic growth was sluggish and U.S. stock markets experienced continued volatility as the Federal Reserve tried to stabilize the economy. Ripples were felt in many individuals' investment portfolios. However, investors who owned large commercial real estate assets in major U.S. cities were fortunate as these investments proved more resilient. \"Wealthy investors have chosen commercial real estate in the 10 most populous U.S. cities in an effort to protect themselves against losing capital during financial crisis,\" says Rodrigo Ni\u00f1o, founder and CEO of Prodigy Network, a commercial real estate development company that operates one of the world's largest crowdfunding investment platforms. Following the Great Recession, individuals around the world searched for better ways to invest their capital to protect themselves from future economic downturns. In 2013, the public was given this opportunity with the JOBS Act. Among other provisions, it allowed unaccredited individuals to invest in some private offerings for the first time since the Securities Act of 1933 was passed 80 years prior. This change democratized investments by opening the private market to all investors. \"Crowdfunding offers the perfect synergy between positive impact for the community and return of capital for the individual,\" Ni\u00f1o says. With the JOBS Act and crowdfunding technology, investors no longer need to be wealthy to invest in commercial real estate development. The concept of crowdfunding in commercial real estate may be relatively new in the U.S., but it has already proved successful in South America. In 2009, Ni\u00f1o and Prodigy Network raised $190 million from 3,950 investors to develop Colombia's tallest skyscraper in Bogota. The 66-story tower, known as BD Bacat\u00e1, includes a hotel, apartments and office space. Karim R. Lakhani, associate professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, wrote a case study documenting the success of this investment property and the potential of this new public investment market. \"Colombia did not have a ban on solicitation, and therefore, small investors, accredited or not, could participate in large projects through a third-party fiduciary system,\" Lakhani wrote. \"However, this had never been done at the scale required for a massive skyscraper.\" BD Bacat\u00e1 had Ni\u00f1o on the search for more opportunities. After much research, Ni\u00f1o started the first crowdfunded building in the U.S., deciding on New York City. For the AKA United Nations project, Ni\u00f1o and Prodigy Network raised $12 million in just four months from investors in 11 countries. Their return on their investment exceeded 15 percent per year. Invest in commercial real estate in NYC.Technology is critical to the success of commercial real estate crowdfunding. \"Technology enables very granular aggregation of funds from investors from all over the world so they can access opportunities that only the wealthy could participate in previously,\" Ni\u00f1o says. \"Irrespective of the wealth they previously had, individuals can now get the same returns as larger investors by pooling together.\" Funds for each project are held in a separate account until a third party fund administrator has evidence that enough funds have been raised to move forward with the project. Only then are funds released and invested into the property. \"What we do is simple,\" Ni\u00f1o says. \"We help investors access what we believe is the best commercial real estate in the world.\" Crowdfunding works in part because everyone can participate in it. \"For years, you had private placements with a small group of known investors who did deals with each other. There was no mechanism for those real estate operators to bring the public in easily. That's one of the beauties of the crowdfunding rules,\" Kearns says. \"It's a big opportunity, particularly if people want to invest in their community and things they know about.\" Crowdfunding provides an opportunity for individuals who were once restricted from the private market, and the possibilities aren't limited to commercial real estate. \"Eventually we will open our platform to select third-party developers in the United States and around the world,\" says Ni\u00f1o. This new concept of investing is creating a new public market, allowing access for all.

It demanded personal sacrifice for the sake of future harmony and required harmony \u2014 in love, comradeship and book learning \u2014 as a condition for its fulfillment. Most of the revolutionary leaders were young men who identified the revolution with womanhood; many of them were men in love who identified particular women with the revolution. Becoming a Bolshevik meant joining a band of brothers, aided by a few sisters. Living as a Bolshevik meant favoring some brothers over others and loving some sisters as much as the revolution.\u201cThe final act of the human tragedy is at hand,\u201d wrote Yakov Sverdlov from exile in Siberia to a young woman named Kira Egon-Besser. \u201cToday only the blind and those who do not want to see fail to notice the growing force that is fated to play the main part in this final act.\u201d Sverdlov and Egon-Besser were part of that force, and that act.\u201cAllow me to kiss you on both cheeks when we meet,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfor I have no doubt that I will see you again.\u201dSverdlov\u2019s last letter to Egon-Besser arrived in Petrograd in late February 1917.

When I heard the sound of his familiar booming bass coming from the entryway, I came running and saw Yakov Mikhailovich. He kissed me on both cheeks.\u201dAt about the same time, the economist Valerian Osinsky wrote a letter to his lover, Anna Shaternikova. He was 30 and married to a fellow revolutionary; she was in her mid-20s and, in Osinsky\u2019s view, \u201cyoung, tall, intelligent and beautiful.\u201d They had met a few months earlier in a hospital in Yalta, where he read Knut Hamsun\u2019s \u201cVictoria\u201d to her.They, too, knew that their happiness depended on the coming of the final act of the human tragedy. They were certain that it was near, but did not know that it had already reached Petrograd. Communism, like Hamsun\u2019s novel, was the kingdom of eternal love.\u201cOver there,\u201d wrote Osinsky, love would \u201creveal without shame all of its profound tenderness.\u201dVladimir Mayakovsky met his love in Odessa, in 1914. Her name was Maria Denisova. He was 21 and an avant-garde poet; she was 20 and \u201cabsolutely extraordinary: tall, shapely, with magnificent, shining eyes.\u201d She promised to come to his hotel room, but did not. He appealed to God:You, the almighty,came up with a pair of hands,made sure everyone got a head,so why couldn\u2019t you come up with a wayfor us to kiss and kiss and kisswithout this torture?God had nothing to say. The poet promised to \u201cslice him up\u201d as part of a general apocalypse. He said it would come in 1916.It came in 1917.Sverdlov was made the chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, pioneered the fashion for leather jackets, unleashed the Red Terror, ordered the execution of the czar and his family and died of influenza in 1919, in the midst of the \u201cde-Cossackization\u201d campaign he had unleashed. Osinsky became the first chairman of the Supreme Council of the National Economy and a leading advocate of forced labor in the countryside. Mayakovsky\u2019s Maria married the Red Cavalry commissar, Efim Shchadenko, and fulfilled her graduation requirements at the Higher Art and Technology Studios in Moscow by submitting a marble sculpture of Lenin in his coffin. Mayakovsky wrote the canonical poem on Lenin\u2019s death and immortality.By the time Lenin died in 1924, the arrival of Communism had been postponed indefinitely. Most senior Bolsheviks had moved into the Kremlin or one of Moscow\u2019s \u201cHouses of Soviets\u201d and settled into a life of self-loathing communal domesticity. Osinsky left his wife and son for Anna, and then left Anna to return to his wife and son. Anna married someone else and had a son, Vsemir (or \u201cWorldwide,\u201d for the World Revolution).Several years later, Anna and Osinsky ran into each other at an official reception. She fainted, was taken to a hospital and somehow lost her party card. Osinsky, her original sponsor, was called upon to reconfirm his endorsement. They met again and resumed their relationship. One night, he decided to reread the first five pages of \u201cVictoria,\u201d but could not stop until he finished the book the next morning.\u201cWhat I find moving about \u2018Victoria,\u2019 \u201d he wrote to Anna, \u201cis not the sense of pity it evokes, but the enormous power of feeling. In its own way, it is comparable to revolutionary enthusiasm.\u201d He was and was not ashamed of his sentimentality. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to cry,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I get a catch in my throat during the emotional passages \u2014 even when I am reading silently to myself.\u201dNo one cried more than Osinsky\u2019s friend and former cellmate in a czarist prison, Nikolai Bukharin.\u201cThis trait \u2014 emotional fragility and acute sensitivity \u2014 would often send him into a state of hysteria,\u201d wrote his second wife, Anna Larina. \u201cHe wept easily.\u201dBukharin had known Anna since she was a baby. In the summer of 1930, when he was in Crimea mourning the defeat of his opposition to forced collectivization, Anna came to visit. She was then 16, and he was 40. He, too, read \u201cVictoria\u201d aloud to her:\u201cLove was creation\u2019s source, creation\u2019s ruler; but all love\u2019s ways are strewn with blossoms and blood, blossoms and blood.\u201dWhen he finished, he asked her if she could ever love a leper.

{"Headline": "Trump Targets Steel Trade, but China Will Be Tough to Contain", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byHANGZHOU, China \u2014 China\u2019s vast steel industry is a major target of President Trump. But this hulking shell of a mill here shows why China is likely to keep pumping out more and more steel, inflaming trade tensions between the two countries.The Hangzhou steel mill, a vast labyrinth of blast furnaces, warehouses, chimneys and worker dormitories covering hundreds of acres, was one of Mao Zedong\u2019s favorite projects. Built in just 13 months in the late 1950s, it once employed 25,000 workers.Pollution and the march of progress made the mill a liability. But closing a mill eliminates well-paying jobs \u2014 a central reason China keeps factories churning out steel the world doesn\u2019t need.When authorities do manage to shutter a plant, it is a costly ordeal, as the story of Hangzhou shows. With the help of a $34 million grant from government officials, the Hangzhou plant owner, Hangzhou Iron and Steel Group, offered the 12,000 remaining workers lavish severance benefits and pensions.\u201cI don\u2019t have to wake up early,\u201d said Tang Guomin, 49, who had labored at the blast furnaces since he was 18 years old. He received nearly six years\u2019 pay from the company as severance and when he turns 50 in a few months, he will be able to collect an inflation-adjusted pension from the government equal to 90 percent of his previous pay for the rest of his life.\u201cI sleep till I wake and don\u2019t have much to worry about,\u201d he said, while doing his family\u2019s morning vegetable shopping at a street market. \u201cI miss the factory, but that time won\u2019t be back again.\u201dInvoking an obscure trade law, President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday for a 270-day review to determine whether steel imports were harming national security. If the Commerce Department does find harm, Mr. Trump will have up to 90 days to decide whether to impose broad import restrictions.China is an obvious target of the order, though the impact could ripple worldwide. While only about 2 percent of American steel imports come directly from China, global steel makers and industry experts blame China for shipping its surplus steel to other countries, which drives down prices and prompts those countries to further process the steel into high-value products for export to the United States. The Trump administration, which has made it clear that it will take a more aggressive stance on steel, has suggested it could bring trade actions against those countries as well.China denies that it sells excess steel to other markets below the cost of making it, a move called dumping. But China does concede that it has too many steel factories making too much steel.\u201cSteel is the food for China\u2019s industry,\u201d said Wang Guoqing, the research director at the Lange Steel Information Research Center, a Chinese industry group in Beijing. \u201cIt is in a key position for China\u2019s development and infrastructure.\u201dToday, China\u2019s steel sector represents the sort of bloated, wasteful industry that people both inside and outside the country say is holding back economic development. China in early 2016 committed to closing steel mills representing 100 million to 150 million tons of capacity over five years, or roughly a tenth of its capacity then. China closed 65 million tons of capacity last year and plans to close another 50 million tons this year, according to a speech in early March by Premier Li Keqiang.Yet production remains stubbornly high, and new mills have continued to open. China\u2019s steel mills produced a record quantity of steel last month. China hasn\u2019t released more recent data on total steel capacity.\u201cTo me the objective is to make it uneconomic, to make it expensive, to do something that has inefficiency in the market,\u201d said Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to become United States trade representative, at his Senate confirmation hearing.China calls that effort shortsighted, saying it has made itself an indispensable provider of high-quality steel to the world at a time when many American steel mills are aging. Advocates of a more confrontational American trade policy fail to understand this, said Li Xinchuang, the dean of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, a government agency.\u201cI have explained this time and time again, but they won\u2019t listen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing the lute to a cow.\u201dThe former factory looks a little like a postapocalyptic scene on a Hollywood movie set: cavernous warehouses moldered on a damp spring day, windowless and doorless. Conveyor belts and other steel equipment that might have scrap metal value had already been removed, leaving barren concrete tubes and walls. A long row of black hopper cars rusted on a railroad siding.Migrant construction laborers camped in the evening in a dilapidated, three-story concrete building, resting after a long day of tearing apart old buildings as the next step in clearing the site. Tall grass, leafy bushes and even small trees had begun growing vigorously in open areas of the factory, sometimes pushing their way up through cracks in concrete plazas.\u201cIt looks beautiful,\u201d said Le Rong, a 42-year-old migrant worker involved in dismantling the complex. \u201cI even told my wife and kids about it.\u201dA Hangzhou Iron and Steel spokesman declined to discuss what the company would do with the site, saying it had not yet been decided but that the company would find an \u201cinnovative\u201d use for the land. Former steel mill sites in other prosperous Chinese cities like Hangzhou have often been redeveloped as real estate projects.Some of China\u2019s steel plants are outdated and many of them are polluting. Revamping them isn\u2019t cheap. In addition to the $34 million it received to close the Hangzhou plant, Hangzhou Iron and Steel in 2015 received nearly $106 million in subsidies and cheap government loans to help cover overall costs of upgrading its plants.For many locals, closing the mill has meant cleaner air \u2014 the reason officials said the mill was shut down.State-run media said shortly before the Hangzhou mill closed that the aging site had been releasing 7,000 tons a year of sulfur dioxide, an important cause of acid rain, and 3,000 tons a year of soot.Xu Yuemei, another retired steelworker, said that when the factory was still operating, garments that she hung on a clothesline turned black or yellow before they dried. Mr. Tang remembers a pervasive haze.\u201cThere was dust in the air; I couldn\u2019t see guys 100 meters away from me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI could smell choking ammonia gas in the air until the factory shut down.\u201d\u201cAfter it shut down,\u201d he said, \u201ceverything is gone, including the pollution.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsherAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bush Steps Back Into Spotlight to Help Africa Fight Epidemics", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported byWINDHOEK, Namibia \u2014 In a bleak hospital waiting room, a half-dozen women infected with H.I.V. described how they were able to deliver healthy babies because of drugs purchased with money from the United States.One of the mothers wanted to know if she could continue to rely on American compassion, a question that one visitor, former President George W. Bush, was eager to answer.\u201cOne reason we\u2019ve come is because we want the people in our country to understand how effective this program is,\u201d Mr. Bush replied through a translator. \u201cEleven million people now live who wouldn\u2019t have.\u201dAs Congress heads for a bruising showdown over funding this month, Mr. Bush was in Africa this past week to publicize a $6.8 billion assistance program that has done much to save this continent\u2019s future and more than a little to rehabilitate his image.In visits to clinics and schools in Botswana and Namibia, Mr. Bush argued that the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, which he established in 2004, should not only continue to fight the AIDS crisis in Africa but also expand to tackle the deadly and preventable epidemic of cervical cancer.\u201cIt\u2019s in our national interest to help these governments,\u201d he said.President Trump\u2019s budget, released last month, promised to preserve Pepfar, but proposed such deep overall reductions in foreign aid that many of the program\u2019s defenders fear for its future, particularly under an administration that has advocated an explicitly transactional approach to international affairs.For Mr. Bush, a threat to Pepfar imperils not only a population the size of Ohio\u2019s, but also the best part of his legacy.\u201cWhat President Bush did in saving millions of lives in Africa is one of the greatest accomplishments of any American president ever,\u201d said James K. Glassman, the former executive director of the George W. Bush Institute. \u201cAnd, in my opinion, it outweighs what many see as his deficiencies in Iraq and with the economy.\u201dMr. Bush has largely kept out of the public eye since his administration ended in an economic meltdown with his approval ratings near record lows. But he has recently edged back onto the public stage, campaigning in 2015 and early 2016 for his brother Jeb Bush\u2019s unsuccessful presidential bid and doing a round of interviews in recent weeks to promote a book of his paintings.During his visit to Africa, Mr. Bush was a disease prevention advocate \u2014 a path worn smooth by movie and sports stars who agree to talk about themselves with the understanding that the resulting stories will mention the malady they have chosen to fight. But Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, kept their distance; no news conferences or interviews were allowed. Aides were at pains to keep press contingents small, often shooing them away from the Bushes after brief photograph opportunities and remarks.But the former president was relaxed and self-effacing. Touring Windhoek Central State Hospital, he picked up a baby, but when the infant started coughing, he rolled his eyes and said, \u201cOh, no,\u201d and then quickly gave the child back to the mother.Pictures of Mr. Bush in newspapers here show him shaking hands with President Hage G. Geingob of Namibia, who was doubled over in laughter. Mr. Bush\u2019s quick jokes, frequent hugs and obvious delight among children charmed his hosts.Some former presidents, particularly those who leave office deeply unpopular (Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon come to mind), spend their remaining years in tortured pursuits for redemption. Mr. Bush shows no sign of following that path. And while Mr. Bush is devoted to charity, former President Jimmy Carter\u2019s exhaustive efforts are no model, either. Mr. Bush made no apology for bracketing his three days of advocacy with a safari in the Okavango Delta in Botswana at the beginning and a visit to Namibia\u2019s famed coastline at the end.Mr. Bush flew to Botswana on his friend Harlan Crow\u2019s spacious jet. His first stop in Gaborone, the capital, was the Tlokweng Clinic, where a small encampment of cervical cancer advocates had set up colorful tents. Wearing a gray suit, blue tie and starched white shirt in 83-degree heat, Mr. Bush marched through the tents shaking hands and stopped before the press pool to give a brief speech, with his wife by his side.\u201cI hope our government, when they analyze what works around the world, will understand that Pepfar has saved over 11 million lives,\u201d Mr. Bush said, in remarks he would repeat again and again. \u201cAnd that while progress has been made, we\u2019ve got to continue to stay in this battle in order to save lives.\u201dCervical cancer is caused by strains of human papillomavirus, known as HPV, and women with H.I.V. are at a higher risk for the cancer. In the industrialized world, routine Pap smears and other tests have almost entirely eliminated deaths, but in Africa the disease remains among the most deadly. Pepfar spends billions of dollars treating women with H.I.V., only to see them die from cervical cancer, which costs a fraction as much to prevent.The cure, if administered early and regularly, is as simple as a routine vaginal vinegar wash followed by the use of a tool akin to a soldering iron to burn away exposed lesions. Vaccines given to young women before they become sexually active are effective prevention.Botswana now vaccinates every fifth-grade girl in a campaign that costs the government millions, and Pepfar spends about $3 million annually in the country to increase cervical \u201csee-and-treat\u201d screenings. But thousands more women could be saved with a few million dollars more in donations. Namibia\u2019s effort has only just begun.To encourage more vaccinations, the Bushes visited schools in Botswana and Namibia, where Mrs. Bush also made library donations. When they arrived at Ella du Plessis School here, they were serenaded by students performing a rendition of a song from \u201cThe Lion King.\u201dThe visit was in many ways a return to the themes of Mr. Bush\u2019s first presidential campaign, during which he advocated a \u201ccompassionate conservatism.\u201d\u201cWe should believe that every life matters and every soul is precious,\u201d Mr. Bush said at a reception at the American Embassy in Botswana, where he supported better health care for Africans.Will his work here change the minds of his presidency\u2019s critics?\u201cNo,\u201d said Elaine C. Kamarck, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution who once worked for Al Gore, Mr. Bush\u2019s opponent in the 2000 election. Citing the disastrous consequences of the Iraq war and economic crisis, she said, \u201cNothing he can do now will reverse the damage of his presidency.\u201dBut the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin was more forgiving, saying attitudes about presidents shift over time. \u201cPresident Bush has approached his postpresidency with dignity,\u201d she wrote in an email, \u201cand the fact that he\u2019s continuing progress on curbing H.I.V./AIDS, malaria and cancer in Africa will be a chapter that historians will honor.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Roars Again on Trade, Reviewing Steel and Chiding Canada", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump added a new name Thursday to the list of countries he accuses of preying on American workers and exploiting na\u00efve American trade policies: Canada.\u201cWhat they\u2019ve done to our dairy farm workers is a disgrace,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he ordered a sweeping investigation into whether steel imports are harming America\u2019s national security. \u201cWe can\u2019t let Canada or anybody else take advantage and do what they did to our workers and to our farmers.\u201dMr. Trump admitted he was going off script because the steel order is aimed at more familiar trade boogeymen like China and Japan. But his outburst in the Oval Office toward a friendly neighbor punctuated a week when tough talk on trade took center stage in a White House deeply divided over how aggressively to erect the trade barriers that Mr. Trump promised during his campaign.From Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbuy American, hire American\u201d rallying cry in Wisconsin this week to Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s warnings to Japan and South Korea about the need to rewrite trade deals, the Trump administration is moving against free trade on multiple fronts. A senior White House official said there would be two trade-related events a week for the next few weeks.\u201cHe\u2019s manically focused on these trade issues,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist.The outcome of the debate between nationalists and globalists remains far from settled. Last week the globalists appeared to be winning when the administration decided not to formally designate China a currency manipulator, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to do so during the campaign. Mr. Trump also offered President Xi Jinping of China other concessions on his trade agenda in return for China\u2019s help in curbing North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.After that, the president\u2019s \u201cbark quieted down,\u201d said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cNow the volume of the bark is going back up.\u201d\u201cBut these are still barks,\u201d he added. \u201cSo far, no bites.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s steel investigation is much broader than dozens of anti-dumping cases against China and other exporters filed by the Obama administration and its predecessors. It invokes a somewhat novel principle of using national security as the criterion for whether the imports are damaging the United States. The narrow argument is that a depleted American steel industry would be unable to produce enough steel to supply the military. More broadly, White House officials say an economically vibrant country is better able to defend itself.It is unclear what steps Mr. Trump will take once the investigation is completed \u2014 within 270 days but probably sooner. The most obvious would be to impose tariffs on steel imports. Mr. Hufbauer said the United States could also use the results as leverage to persuade countries to accept voluntary export restraint agreements, such as those in the 1980s.\u201cWe are groping here to see whether the facts warrant a comprehensive solution to deal with a very wide range of products from a very wide range of countries,\u201d Wilbur L. Ross, the secretary of commerce, told reporters on Thursday. Mr. Ross\u2019s department will run the investigation.While the directive does not single out any country, the Chinese are clearly in the cross hairs. China accounts for only 2 percent of direct steel exports to the United States, but its excess capacity drives down steel prices worldwide. Surplus Chinese steel, shipped to other countries, ends up in the United States in other manufactured products. Mr. Ross noted that steel imports from China had continued to rise, despite the government\u2019s pledge to cut back its overcapacity.Still, the White House\u2019s competing aims with China were on display as it rolled out the order.When Mr. Trump was asked whether the investigation would affect his efforts to obtain Chinese cooperation on North Korea, he replied: \u201cThis has nothing to do with China. This has to do with worldwide, what\u2019s happening. The dumping problem is a worldwide problem.\u201dCritics of the administration questioned its invocation of national security. Most of America\u2019s largest steel suppliers are friendly countries, like Canada, South Korea and Germany. Analysts also noted that the value of steel imports declined 26 percent from 2015 to 2016, though the White House noted that imports rose 20 percent between February 2016 and February 2017.\u201cThe U.S. has long criticized trading partners for abusively invoking national security as an excuse for trade protectionist actions, most recently China for its new cybersecurity law,\u201d said Daniel M. Price, a trade adviser to President George W. Bush who is now at Rock Creek Global Advisors. \u201cThe administration\u2019s action may render it subject to the same charge.\u201dMr. Trump seemed unconcerned about that. Flanked by chief executives from American steel companies, he said the dumping of steel into the American market posed a threat not only to the economy but also to the military, which depends on steel for tanks, ships and planes.\u201cThis is not an area where we can afford to be dependent on other countries,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe have a product where we actually need foreign countries to be nice to us in order to fight for our people. And that\u2019s not going to happen any longer, believe me.\u201dIn Asia, Mr. Pence brought a similarly blunt message, warning Japan and South Korea that the administration would seek new bilateral trade deals with them. Mr. Ross, a billionaire known for his hard-line trade views and investments in failing steel companies, joined Mr. Pence in Tokyo. The Japanese were sufficiently worried that they sought to exclude him from some of the higher-level meetings, an official said.With Mr. Trump scheduled to attend a meeting of the Group of 7 countries in Sicily next month \u2014 his first foreign trip as president \u2014 some administration officials predicted that Mr. Cohn and Mr. Kushner would try again to moderate his language on trade.But if Mr. Trump\u2019s performance Thursday was any indication, he remains as seized by the subject as he was on the campaign trail. In two weeks, he noted, the White House will present its ideas for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.\u201cNafta, whether it\u2019s Mexico or Canada, is a disaster for our country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster, it\u2019s a trading disaster.\u201d\u201cI was in Wisconsin the other day,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done to our farm workers is a disgrace.

{"Headline": "Zombies of Voodoo Economics", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byAccording to many reports, Donald Trump is getting frantic as his administration nears the 100-day mark. It\u2019s an arbitrary line in the sand, but one he himself touted in many pre-inauguration boasts. And it will be an occasion for numerous articles detailing how little of substance he has actually accomplished.Yet many of these reports will, I suspect, miss half the story. It\u2019s important to note just how little the tweeter-in-chief has managed to achieve; but we also need to focus on what, exactly, it is that he hasn\u2019t achieved.For Mr. Trump sold himself to voters as unorthodox as well as effective. He was going to be a different kind of president, a consummate deal-maker who would transcend the usual ideological divide. His supporters should therefore be dismayed, not just by his failure to actually close any deals, but by the fact that he evidently has no new ideas to offer, just the same old snake oil the right has been peddling for decades.Then George W. Bush cut taxes again, with the usual suspects predicting a \u201cBush boom\u201d; what we actually got was lackluster growth followed by a severe financial crisis. Barack Obama reversed many of the Bush tax cuts and added new taxes to pay for Obamacare \u2014 and oversaw a far better jobs record, at least in the private sector, than his predecessor.So history offers not a shred of support for faith in the pro-growth effects of tax cuts.Still, Donald Trump was supposed to be different. Guess what: he isn\u2019t.To be fair, it\u2019s not clear whether Mr. Trump really believes in right-wing economic orthodoxy. He may just be looking for something, anything, he can call a win \u2014 and it\u2019s a lot easier to come up with a tax reform plan if you don\u2019t try to make things add up, if you just assume that extra growth and the revenue it brings will materialize out of thin air.We might also note that a man who insists that he won the popular vote he lost, who insists that crime is at a record high when it\u2019s at a record low, doesn\u2019t need a fancy doctrine to claim that his budget adds up when it doesn\u2019t.Still, the fact is that the Trump agenda so far is absolutely indistinguishable from what one might have expected from, say, Ted Cruz. It\u2019s just voodoo with extra bad math. Was that what his supporters expected?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Work, Mr. Macron, Work", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Can a graduate of France\u2019s elite schools, a onetime investment banker and the former economy minister of an unpopular Socialist president prevail at a time of French disgust with politics-as-usual?I ask the question because the greatest danger to Emmanuel Macron, at once the fresh face of French politics and a familiar product of the French system, is the assumption that his first-round electoral victory makes triumph in the second round inevitable.It is not. Macron, a political neophyte, has work to do.Marine Le Pen, who took 21.4 percent of the first-round vote to Macron\u2019s 23.9 percent, is not the favorite, but she is plausible in a way her father Jean-Marie Le Pen was not when he was crushed in the second round of the 2002 election. Some 7.6 million French people voted for her, 2.8 million more than her father in the first round 15 years ago. Never before has the National Front, a racist party, taken more than 20 percent of the vote. That this result for Le Pen has provoked relief in some circles is a measure of her party\u2019s steady advance.Disruption is in the air, and Le Pen\u2019s anti-immigrant, anti-European, nationalist agitation is its most powerful expression. The establishment parties of center-left and center-right have been blown away, and with them some of the essential fabric of the Fifth Republic.This same establishment\u2019s calls now to throw up the Republic\u2019s rampart against a xenophobic party issued from the cesspool of Vichy Fascism are sincere but no longer determinant. Macron will have to win this on May 7, not expect Le Pen to lose it. The fracture between globalized metropoles and depressed regions that produced political upheaval in Britain and the United States applies equally to France. Paris gave Le Pen less than 5 percent of the vote; in the struggling east of the country she thrived. Macron has to erect a barrier against the prevailing global cultural upheaval. For France and for Europe, it is critical he does. The European Union can survive a British exit; it will buckle under a French exit.We know the drumbeat of the next two weeks. Le Pen will attack Macron as the puppet of the man he served, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. She will attack him as the Rothschild banker, the man of \u201cthe system,\u201d the elitist and the globalist. She will attempt to exploit the same diffuse anger, resentment and anxiety that produced Brexit and President Trump. She will work on fertile ground; nobody does malaise like the French. Russia, intent on undermining the European Union, will help her where it can.Some 41 percent of French voters of the extreme right and far left voted for candidates favoring a possible exit from the European Union and rejection of the euro. On the left, that candidate was Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, whose \u201cUnbowed France\u201d movement gained almost 20 percent of the vote. M\u00e9lenchon has not yet urged his supporters to stop Le Pen. Many will abstain; some may even vote for her. Extremes do converge. Add to this the defection to Le Pen of the more right-wing supporters of the conservative Fran\u00e7ois Fillon: the threat to Macron becomes clear.Polls, which were accurate on the first round, show Macron with a clear lead over Le Pen. Macron\u2019s worst enemy would be arrogance. Where Hillary Clinton paid little or no attention to the reasons for Bernie Sanders\u2019 popularity, Macron will have to reckon with the M\u00e9lenchon factor.When I was in France last month I listened in some wonder as Macron declared: \u201cModernity is disruptive and I endorse that.\u201d Bracing and brave words, like his emotional support for the European Union and empathy with refugees. But it is preservation of the French welfare state, the construction of a \u201csocial Europe\u201d and the fight against inequality that M\u00e9lenchon supporters focus on. More than any other Western industrialized nation France has philosophical objections to 21st-century capitalism. Macron will have to temper his innovative, tech-friendly, free-market instincts with a heavy dose of Gallic solidarity. That will be a delicate balancing act.Macron, 39, has managed it up to now, conjuring a new movement from nothing in the space of a year. That\u2019s a tribute to his ability to embody renewal and hope despite attempts to portray him as merely young. Now comes his, and the French Republic\u2019s, supreme challenge.The French economic model amounts to a structural choice for high unemployment in exchange for comprehensive social protection. Everyone knows that; nobody has been able to change it. In some measure this impasse explains French anger. The young can\u2019t find work. There\u2019s a feeling of being stuck. Insecurity has exacerbated that frustration, as has the breakdown of the model that integrated generations of immigrants. Le Pen has the facile, vile answers to all this. Macron has the genuine ambition, as he put it to me, to \u201ctransform\u201d France \u201cat its deepest level.\u201dEurope and France need him. His mantra now must be: work, boldness, humility.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Very Short Books on 3 Very Big Ideas", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byThe ShortlistThe months after Donald Trump was elected president have been boom times for scholars of authoritarianism. Masha Gessen wrote a widely circulated essay on the New York Review of Books website entitled \u201cAutocracy: Rules for Survival.\u201d In that vein, Snyder offers practical advice to #TheResistance in \u201cOn Tyranny,\u201d a brief book that started life as a Facebook post.Unlike public intellectuals who casually toss around the word \u201cfascist\u201d to describe a disappointing restaurant salad, Snyder knows this subject cold. He is a Yale University historian who has written at length on fascism, Communism and the Holocaust. That gives \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d a particular urgency. It is littered with vignettes of how Germans in the 1930s aided and abetted Hitler\u2019s rise to power. It is impossible to read aphorisms like \u201cpost-truth is pre-fascism\u201d and not feel a small chill about the current state of the Republic. Snyder warns, \u201cAmericans today are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism or Communism in the 20th century.\u201d He offers political advice ranging from straightforward (\u201cDefend institutions\u201d) to insightful (\u201cBe calm when the unthinkable arrives\u201d). For such a small book, Snyder invests \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d with considerable heft.At times, though, \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d veers toward overwrought. Trump\u2019s brand of populist nationalism may be illiberal, but it is also not very popular. Since his inauguration, a critical free press, independent judiciary, patriotic Civil Service and robust social movements have placed significant constraints on Trump\u2019s actions. When Snyder intimates that 2016 might be the last free election in the United States for a while, one wonders if the book will become self-defeating because of its hyperbole.Of course, just as I was pondering whether \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d exaggerates, Trump tweeted that the press is the enemy of the American people. That sounds awfully pre-fascist to me. So approach this short book the same way you would a medical pamphlet warning about an infectious disease. Read it carefully and be on the lookout for symptoms.Claims of American exceptionalism can be exaggerated. But the First Amendment really does make America unique, even within the industrialized democracies. No other country has such stringent protections against government restrictions of free speech and a free press.Abrams, a constitutional litigator, celebrates that fact in \u201cThe Soul of the First Amendment.\u201d The best part of this short primer is his history of free speech jurisprudence in the United States. Abrams reminds us that federal protections of free speech rights are of recent provenance. A century ago, obscenity laws and community standards provided ample reason to justify government censorship. States, localities and courts restricted the freedom of the press without much constraint for the country\u2019s first 150 years. The First Amendment was not applied to state censorship laws until 1925.Abrams traces the legal history of the First Amendment all the way through to Citizens United, a case in which he represented the plaintiffs. Liberals who despise that ruling would be well served to read this book. Whatever the policy merits of letting corporations spend unlimited amounts on political advertising, Abrams ably defends its legal reasoning.He is on shakier ground, however, when he compares the First Amendment with laws regulating speech in other established democracies. Abrams acknowledges, for example, that Germany\u2019s Nazi past makes it \u201cunderstandable\u201d to restrict hateful speech in that country. He then blithely notes that \u201cthe United States has been fortunate not to have suffered such horrific events.\u201d I suspect that some Native Americans and African-Americans would take issue with Abrams on this point.Abrams recognizes but offers no answers to the policy ramifications of Citizens United. He also seems willing to live with the social costs of actors like WikiLeaks publishing documents with no redaction: \u201cWhat to print? The First Amendment provides no answer to this question. It never does.\u201dEconomic populism has produced a bear market for attitudes about Wall Street. Public trust in banks dropped precipitously after 2008 and has not recovered. During his campaign, Donald Trump complained that \u201cWall Street has caused tremendous problems for us.\u201d As president, however, Trump has appointed several well-connected financiers. How should Americans feel about that?The moment is ripe for a short book that explains the merits and demerits of America\u2019s financial sector. Alas, Cohan\u2019s \u201cWhy Wall Street Matters\u201d is not that book. To be fair, he tries hard. Cohan repeatedly states that Wall Street is a marvelous contraption for allocating capital to the productive parts of the economy. The problem is that he offers no evidence for this claim beyond assertion. The closest he comes is when he stresses the success of Apple\u2019s initial public offering. On the questions of share buybacks or Libor manipulation or the financial sector being responsible for an increasing fraction of the American economy, he is silent.Cohan is correct on some important matters regarding regulation, as when he argues that the revocation of Glass-Steagall was not responsible for the 2008 financial crisis. Unfortunately, elsewhere he offers mere bromides. On Dodd-Frank he quotes a Wall Street executive: \u201cKeep the regulations that work and make sense and eliminate the rest.\u201d Good to know.Part of the confusion lies in what Cohan means by \u201cWall Street.\u201d He has an introduction entitled \u201cWhat Is Wall Street?\u201d that manages never to answer his own question. In the introduction he says Wall Street is not some \u201cstrange form of alchemy\u201d; but in the next chapter, he writes that \u201cit\u2019s a remarkable bit of alchemy.\u201d This kind of confusion persists throughout the book.The biggest problem with \u201cWhy Wall Street Matters\u201d is its black-and-white framing. Cohan asks at the beginning whether Wall Street should be thought of as a force for good or evil. The obvious answer is \u201cneither.\u201d Wall Street should be thought of as an amoral collection of profit-seekers. Alas, Cohan remains a prisoner of that dichotomy for the length of this small book.Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. His latest book is \u201cThe Ideas Industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Siege Has Ended, but Battle Over Public Lands Rages On", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "A year after the armed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge, new and old players wage battle over what and whom the lands are for.Supported byNow that President Trump is in office, people here and in other parts of the 11 states where 47 percent of the landmass is publicly owned are watching to see what he will do on everything related to public lands, from coal mining and cattle grazing to national monuments and parks. In Burns, some ranchers and others are feeling emboldened, hopeful that regulatory rollbacks by the federal government will return lands to private use and shore up a long-struggling economy.But the change in administration has also spawned a countermovement of conservatives and corporate executives who are speaking up alongside environmentalists in defense of public lands and now worry about losing access to hunting grounds and customers who prize national parks and wildlife.In Idaho, for example, a deal to put thousands of acres into private ownership \u2014 exactly the sort of transaction that the militia leader brothers, Ammon and Ryan Bundy, had espoused in seizing the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge \u2014 was met with fierce opposition, by no less than a group of conservative outdoorsmen.The deal had been in the works for years and was backed by Republican elected officials, who said that adding new taxable private land would generate business activity and property tax revenue.But the proposal, to the surprise of many people on both sides, hit a wall with people like Ray Anderson, a machine shop owner in the tiny community of Grangeville, Idaho, who raised money and helped a group of fellow outdoor enthusiasts kill the plan and boot out of office a county commissioner and state senator who had supported it. Mr. Anderson said he feared that Idaho County, rural and in need of cash, would encourage private owners to develop the lands, or put up fences to keep out hunters and fishermen like him.\u201cI\u2019m a businessman and I\u2019m a conservative, but nothing about the plan seemed to make sense,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cWhere I grew up I was told that public lands will be public lands forever.\u201dIn Montana, access to public lands for recreation shaped last fall\u2019s governor\u2019s race, with the incumbent, Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, staking out a position in defense of public lands and portraying his Republican opponent as captive to private interests that would put up gates and fences. Mr. Bullock won.In Utah a new fight over lands has energized the outdoor recreation industry.\u201cWe intend to keep the pressure on until we are confident public lands are protected,\u201d said Rose Marcario, the president and chief executive of Patagonia. \u201cPatagonia and many other companies in the outdoor industry are not going to stand by and watch as elected officials denigrate our public lands. These lands are the backbone of our business,\u201d she said in an email.The ad features a series of children talking about what they want to be when they grow up \u2014 ranchers, doctors, teachers \u2014 underscoring a message that public land designations can bring economic harm, too. \u201cWhen somebody takes away your land and livelihood, can you really be anything you want to be?\u201d a little girl says into the camera.Some scholars who study public lands said the new debates echoed the recent dynamic in Washington over health care reform. The long-held Republican promise by members of Congress from Utah and other Western states to reverse decades of federal lands ownership and restore control to states and counties \u2014 like the repeal of Obamacare \u2014 becomes harder to keep when the bills that would achieve that end are more than just symbolic statements.And the possibility of a land reform victory for conservatives has in turn galvanized people who oppose the idea and had not taken it seriously before, said John Freemuth, a professor of public policy at Boise State University who specializes in Western land issues.\u201cThere\u2019s just more and more alarm from people ranging the gamut from sportsmen to environmentalists and just ordinary folks who aren\u2019t that political but like their access, thinking that they could lose a lot if the states gained ownership,\u201d he said.But supporters of Mr. Bundy and his ideas have also felt energized in the last year as the election of President Trump brought much of the anti-government rhetoric militia leaders preached into the mainstream.Here in Harney County, where about three-fourths of the land is federally owned, jobs and economic growth have always been tied to industries like logging and cattle grazing, rather than the tourism that some public lands supporters hold out as an alternative pathway for struggling rural communities. The Bundys, their supporters said, made those connections clear \u2014 that getting back onto the land for older Western uses creates jobs \u2014 even if the legal means to getting there was murky.In Burns, the county seat with 2,800 people, a decline in timber cutting in the national forests hurt the economy and forest health too, said Brenda Smith, the executive director of the High Desert Partnership, a nonprofit group that tries to bring together government agencies and local people over land disputes. Since the events at the Malheur Refuge and last fall\u2019s election, she said it was a much tougher conversation.People suspicious of government have stiffened in their resolve to say no, Ms. Smith said, even when they agree that an outcome could be positive for the community. \u201cThere are people who see collaboration as a threat,\u201d she said.Butch Eaton, a retired carpenter here in Burns who stood with the occupiers at Malheur, said he felt more optimistic now, especially since the election, that the federal lands presence in Oregon and across the West was waning. \u201cPeople are just tired of being told what to do all the time, and they\u2019re saying, \u2018These are our lands.\u2019 I\u2019m feeling more hopeful for my grandkids,\u201d Mr. Eaton said.The land itself here, meanwhile, is undergoing a kind of healing. At Dan Nichols\u2019s ranch, about 20 miles from the refuge, rains pelted down on a recent afternoon as 500 pregnant cows prepared to give birth in the pastures outside his century-old farmhouse. The drought that has parched the area for years, said Mr. Nichols, a former Harney County commissioner, is abating.The Nichols place depends on public lands, with about 95 percent of the grass that the cattle eat grown on federal rangeland, for which Mr. Nichols said he happily paid the grazing fees. But even he draws the line at talk of expanded protections to the land, through wilderness or national monument designations that would restrict agriculture.\u201cPublic land is supposed to be for multiple use,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is all too often forgotten.\u201dA picture caption on Friday with the continuation of an article about the battle over public lands in the West misstated Monument Valley\u2019s relationship to the Bears Ears National Monument. While Monument Valley is near Bears Ears, it is not part of the national monument.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cash Is King No More", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byCultural StudiesI had a strange experience the other day. I tried to pay for something with cash.It was sort of like going back to writing with a pen. My thumbs, made opposable by evolution so that humans could grab things and not just tap on a screen to acquire them, weren\u2019t working the way they were designed to.I had taken my son to our local stationery store to buy him a pack of Pok\u00e9mon cards. The pack was $5, and the store would not accept credit cards for any purchase under $10. It wasn\u2019t set up for Apple Pay either. So I took out my wallet and found that, though packed with plastic, the pouch where cash goes was empty. I plunged into my pockets and emptied them out on the counter in search of change.One penny, a type of coin that I had not thought much about for years, stuck stubbornly on the counter. I tried all sorts of moves, including quickly sliding both my thumbs toward it from opposite sides as if trying to catch it off guard, but it just slid around the surface. The cashier finally scooped it up with a business card. After I separated the coins from the lint in my pocket, I was able to put together $2.34. In the end, I had to buy two packs of cards so that I could pay with Visa.A dime was 10 cents. Two nickels were a dime. Ten dimes were a dollar. A dollar was a buck. A few bucks were dough. No one ever heard \u201cYour PayPal password or your life!\u201d The word was \u201cmoney,\u201d and money was tangible.These days, when the very idea of using a type of payment that is not also a type of investment in the form of points seems unthinkable, cash has become as rarefied as a public phone booth.Purchasing an item or service is no longer a terminus. It\u2019s the beginning, or rather, the continuation of one long transaction. Buying something used to be the goal of labor. Now it is another form of labor. Abstracted from our wallet into a zillion means by which we accrue rewards, our dollars roll up their green sleeves and go to work harvesting points as if they were grapes.This \u201cmoniverse\u201d has had a long gestation. At the dawn of what would become our modern economy, in the 17th century, the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza wrote that \u201cmoney has presented us with the abstract of everything.\u201d What he meant was that money had become the consummate medium for the human desire to possess.Now, 400 years later, everything has become the abstract of money. From the way we read to the way we eat, travel and entertain ourselves, just about every human experience has become monetized. Money itself, earning points in winding fugues of accumulation, has become monetized.Of course, along with all the many conveniences, pleasant surprises (a friend just made over $3,000 in American Express reward points) and brave new perks, the abstraction of money has its dark side. I glimpsed this as a child.My father, a jazz pianist turned real estate agent, was on a draw at his company; he was paid a salary that he would have to repay out of future commissions. This worked for a while, but when the recession hit in the mid-1970s, rising interest rates made the booming housing economy go bust. My father found himself owing his company $50,000 (about $300,000 today). In short order, he lost his job, his marriage to my mother, and his house. He had to declare bankruptcy and live off the few piano lessons he was able to put together.Aside from a love for expensive shoes and the need to lease a new Buick Electra every year, my father was not an extravagant man. The reason he kept taking the draw, even as he knew he was accumulating piles of debt, was that though the salary was real, both the source of it, and the consequences of continuing to accept it, were abstract.You used to want to make enough money to be able to have leisure time in which you could get away from money altogether. Now the very process of spending and buying is part of the experience of leisure. Why eat dinner in a restaurant in some distant corner of the world as a silver moon rises over a platinum sea if you are not paying for it with your platinum card, so that your shiny new points \u2014 filling up your future like stars clustering in the night sky \u2014 can lead you to ever more silver experiences?Perhaps we have become so used to substitutes for money, and to money as a dense forest of obscure processes like the packaging of derivatives, that there is now a high threshold for the counterfeit and the unknowable at the top levels of politics.Maybe the increasing abstraction of money holds the key to our painfully abstract presidency. A derivative is a security, like a stock, that derives its value from an underlying asset, like a mortgage. If mortgages fail, the stocks they supported come crashing down. What if the assets underlying President Trump are phantasmal, or corrupt? Only the I.R.S., tasked with keeping money real, knows for sure.Societies seem to need tangible money the way lovers must touch each other. Since money is the foundation of security, people seem to have a need to feel it with their hands.In retrospect, no one should have been surprised that Britain pulled out of the European Union. As well as being geographically \u201capart,\u201d it refused to give up its own currency. There is a palpable nostalgia for being able to make a physical connection between your country\u2019s historical figures printed on paper bank notes and your personal portion of happiness and security.An article last Sunday about the decline of cash referred incorrectly to the number of European Union members that retain national currencies. There are nine, not one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s \u2018Hire American\u2019 Order May Affect Tech Worker Visas", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byThe order makes no immediate changes to work visa programs but tells the Departments of Labor, Justice, Homeland Security and State to study existing laws and procedures and recommend changes.In the case of one program, H-1B temporary visas, the order directs the agencies to suggest changes to help ensure that the visas are awarded to the most skilled, best-paid immigrant workers. \u201cRight now, H-1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery, and that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the signing in Kenosha, Wis.The order also calls for a crackdown on fraud and abuse in the current system of work visas \u2014 which the agencies had already signaled they would do.What is the H-1B program, and why is the president focused on it?The H-1B program grants 65,000 work visas a year to foreigners, with 20,000 more visas granted to foreigners with advanced degrees and an unlimited number of extra visas available for universities, teaching hospitals and other nonprofit organizations. The program is aimed at highly skilled workers, and most of the visas are awarded to technology companies, although other specialty industries such as fashion also use the visas. (Melania Trump, the first lady, worked as a model on an H-1B visa.)Under federal law, employers that use a large number of H-1B workers are supposed to document that they tried to hire Americans for the jobs. All H-1B employers are also required to pay prevailing wages to the immigrant workers who receive the visas.Labor Department data shows that about 40 percent of the visas go to entry-level workers and another 40 percent go to people with limited experience and skills. The Trump administration says that more of the jobs performed by those people could and should be filled by Americans.How are the visas allocated?Visa applications must be sponsored by employers. Every April 1, the government begins accepting applications for the next fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. This year, the government received 199,000 H-1B applications in the first five days and then stopped accepting them.Because there are more applicants than visas, the visas are awarded by lottery. Each visa is good for three years and can be renewed for three more years. Immigrants who are applying for a permanent residency visa, known as a green card, can typically stay longer while waiting for approval.In 2015, President Obama expanded the program to allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to also work in the United States, but in a recent court filing, the Trump administration said it was reviewing that policy.It is not clear exactly how many foreigners are in the United States on H-1B visas, but analysts estimate 650,000 to 900,000. In recent years, about 70 percent of the visas have been issued to citizens of India.Who employs these H-1B visa holders?The biggest employers are India-based outsourcing companies like Wipro Technologies, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Tata Consultancy Services. These firms contract with banks, health care companies and other businesses to handle various computing tasks and bring in thousands of immigrants to do the work. Outsourcing companies based in the United States, particularly IBM and Cognizant, also use large numbers of H-1B workers.The leading American technology companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple, employ thousands of H-1B workers. Two companies, Facebook and the chip maker Qualcomm, are heavily dependent on H-1B visas, with at least 15 percent of their American workforces holding the visas, according to federal filings. Thousands of Silicon Valley start-ups also hire some H-1B workers.How do these foreign workers contribute to the American economy?American technology companies argue that there is a shortage of qualified Americans for scientific and programming jobs, forcing them to turn overseas for workers to meet their hiring needs.In addition, immigrants or their children have played key roles in founding many technology companies, including giants like Apple, Google and Intel and up-and-comers like WhatsApp and Airbnb.The Indian outsourcers, which generally pay lower wages and operate in a different part of the technology ecosystem, say they are helping American companies cut spending on certain basic services so they can keep employing higher-paid workers in other parts of their businesses. R. Chandrashekhar, the president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies, a group that represents the Indian technology industry, says that more than three-quarters of the Fortune 500, America\u2019s largest companies by sales, use the Indian outsourcers for some operations.\u201cThese services play a critical role in ensuring that corporate America remains a job-creation engine,\u201d Mr. Chandrashekhar said.Still, Indian outsourcing companies are preparing for a world of fewer visas, shifting the work to people in India and other countries.Are American workers hurt by immigrant work visa programs?Some studies suggest that universities grant technology degrees to more than enough American students to fill all the open jobs in the United States, so critics of the visas say the program is unnecessary. Silicon Valley companies often do not cast a wide net for American job candidates. Instead, they compete to hire the same graduates of the top colleges for many jobs and rely heavily on immigrants to fill out their workforces.Under the H-1B program, all companies have to attest that they are paying foreign workers prevailing wages and that their existing workers will not be adversely affected, said Russ Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, the American branch of IEEE, the largest professional association for computer scientists and electrical engineers. \u201cBut all you have to do is check a box.\u201dForeign workers can also be abused by the visa programs. The H-1B visa is tied to a specific employer, which means the visa holder cannot easily change jobs. Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, who has long pushed for changes, said some H-1B holders earned less than their stated salaries because they were forced to repay their employer for various expenses, such as travel.What changes are under consideration for visa programs?The government will also publicly release more data about other visa programs, such as the L-1, which allows workers officially employed overseas by a company to work in the United States. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many L-1s are here, who employs them, where they are located and what they are paid,\u201d said Ronil Hira, an associate professor of political science at Howard University who has extensively studied immigrant visa programs.Many in Congress support changing the H-1B lottery system to give preference to the highest-paying jobs. \u201cWe should allocate visas based on who wants to pay the highest salary to avoid undercutting the wages of American workers,\u201d said Ms. Lofgren, who has sponsored one of several bills on the topic.Such a change would favor established American technology companies, which tend to pay high wages, and hurt the outsourcing companies, which hire immigrants to do more basic work at lower wages. But there is a risk of collateral damage to start-ups, which pay less in cash but award stock to new hires, and to hospitals, which recruit immigrants for nursing and other nontech jobs.Changes to work visas could also be wrapped into a broader immigration bill. Mr. Trump recently told members of Congress that he was open to discussing that approach.An article on April 19 about President Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d order referred incorrectly to the application process for employers seeking to hire H-1B workers. The employers must attest that they are paying the foreign workers prevailing wages and that the working conditions of existing workers will not be adversely affected. They do not have to attest that they tried to find an American first. This correction was delayed because the error was pointed out to editors only recently.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Financial Markets Can Teach Us About Managing Climate Risks", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byCost of CarbonSay an investor had only two options of what to put money in: gold or stocks. Gold has an average annual rate of return of 3 percent, while the stock market delivers a healthier 5 percent. Which should the investor choose? Seems simple, right? Take the higher payout.But annual averages can be deceiving. In fact, these two have very different risk profiles over time. Stocks tend to pay off steadily in good times when the economy is growing and we are relatively flush, but to decline in bad times. Gold might pay off next to nothing for years at a time and present real opportunity costs, but it delivers handsomely during unexpected economic crises.Investing in gold is a type of insurance policy against tough times. Financial markets are revealing that investors are willing to accept a lower average return for that insurance, precisely because it helps to manage risk.The social cost of carbon, the estimated monetary damages caused by the release of an additional ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, is the linchpin for how the federal government values climate damages. It drives the cost-benefits analyses that have determined the stringency of such things as fuel economy standards and the Clean Power Plan.Before the executive order, the social cost of carbon was set at about $40 per metric ton of carbon released. Under the executive order, President Trump appears to be putting us on a path toward valuing climate damages at much less \u2014 possibly less than $5 per metric ton of carbon.How is it that simple to reduce the estimated cost of climate damages from carbon emissions by 90 percent or more? It all depends on how we choose to value future risks.A concept known as the discount rate makes it possible to translate future damages into their present value. In 2009, President Obama convened an interagency working group, of which I was a co-leader, to come up with a uniform method for estimating the social cost of carbon: the resulting number to be used across all federal agencies. Our group chose to emphasize estimates based on a discount rate of 3 percent.The choice of a discount rate matters a great deal. Consider $100 of damages that occur 100 years from now. Because these damages are so far off in the future, it is natural to value them today at less than $100 \u2014 but how much is not immediately apparent. This is where the discount rate comes in.Although this might seem like an arcane administrative debate, the discount rate is the critical ingredient for how we value the future. And there is arguably no more consequential instance of the need to choose an appropriate discount rate than the case of climate change, because the greenhouse gases we release today will alter the climate for centuries.At its core, using a lower discount rate to calculate the social cost of carbon means paying more to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions today. But, of course, paying more today means that those resources cannot be put to use for food, shelter and other goods.Which discount rate best serves our interest in valuing climate risk? That\u2019s where the financial markets\u2019 lesson comes in.When discounting future costs, the markets tell us to choose a discount rate that matches the risk profile of the investment. So if the risk acts like a tax on the economy (e.g., it reduces G.D.P. by a fixed percentage), a higher discount rate like the stock market\u2019s average annual return of 5 percent would be justified. But if the risk is potentially disruptive, like a severe recession or worse, then markets point to a lower discount rate, perhaps like gold\u2019s annual average return or even lower.In this way, financial markets tell us that spending a little extra now as insurance to protect against potentially disruptive risk is a wise strategy. This lesson was most recently illustrated during the Great Recession. While the stock market declined by 53 percent from December 2007 to March 2009, gold\u2019s value increased by 14 percent during this period.Investors who had put some portion of their investments in gold \u2014 as an insurance policy \u2014 reaped the benefits as gold outperformed the stock market by almost 70 percent at exactly the moment that the job market was deteriorating and other investments were declining in value. In comparison, households with no such insurance policy were left completely exposed to the Great Recession.Could climate change be broadly disruptive? The science suggests that the answer is yes. There is a lot that we don\u2019t know with certainty about climate change: How much will temperature increase for a given increase in greenhouse gas concentrations? How much will sea levels rise?Although we do not have certain answers to these questions, the range of potential answers includes very disruptive possibilities. This means that climate mitigation could protect us from possibly catastrophic events \u2014 mass migration, crop failures, a jarring sea-level rise and spikes in mortality due to high temperatures.If those risks don\u2019t materialize, there will have been costs to spending today on climate mitigation. But if those risks are real, using a low discount rate to choose the degree of climate mitigation today will be like having invested in gold before the Great Recession.Michael Greenstone runs the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and is the Milton Friedman professor of economics at the university.Advertisement"}

But some of the credit is also due to \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d the legal regime that nurtured and protected the open internet and streaming TV in the first place.Streaming, after all, is a cheaper and better form of television. For that reason, it is something the cable industry would not have allowed to thrive had it been left to its own devices. Fortunately, net neutrality rules prevented cable companies from killing or interfering with streaming television during its infancy.In analyzing the attack on net neutrality, one looks in vain for the problem that needs to be fixed. Net neutrality refers to rules intended to ensure that broadband providers cannot block content or provide faster delivery to companies that pay more. The policy was put in place in the George W. Bush administration, where it enjoyed bipartisan support. In the years since, it has sheltered bloggers, nonprofit organizations like Wikipedia, smaller tech companies, TV and music streamers, and entrepreneurs from being throttled by providers like AT&T and Verizon that own the \u201cpipes.\u201dThe policy\u2019s contributions are not just cultural but also economic: Television has been revitalized, and waves of successful internet start-ups have returned America\u2019s high-tech industry to unquestioned global leadership. Net neutrality has been among the most effective economic policies of the 21st century.Make no mistake: While killing net neutrality may be rolled out with specious promises of \u201cfree video,\u201d there is nothing here for ordinary people. Lowering prices is just not something that cable or phone companies will do except under pressure. Instead, the repeal of net neutrality will simply create ways for cable and phone companies to tax the web and increase your broadband bill. Raise your hand if that sounds enticing.The more convincing explanations for this change are more straightforward \u2014 and darker \u2014 than Mr. Pai\u2019s. Much of Silicon Valley and Hollywood have supported both net neutrality and the Democratic Party, making an attack on the policy a kind of punishment. If Mr. Pai\u2019s reasoning sounds forced and unconvincing, it is because this proposal comes right from the swamp, and can be attractive only to those who have lived there long enough to no longer notice the stench.The proposal to kill net neutrality is terrible economic policy and bad politics. It is starkly inconsistent with any populist mandate. There is a reason that net neutrality is called the third rail of internet politics, and Mr. Pai has now grabbed it.Tim Wu, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads,\u201d is a professor at Columbia Law School and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The North Korea Paradox: Why There Are No Good Options on Nuclear Arms", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterNorth Korea, a small and poor country facing far stronger adversaries and the perpetual threat of its own collapse, would not seem a likely state to defy four consecutive American presidents.Yet it is precisely that weakness, analysts say, along with the country\u2019s history and internal dynamics, that drives its leaders to pursue nuclear and missile programs at virtually any cost \u2014 and that robs the world of almost any option to limit them.Those factors, when viewed together, show why Barack Obama warned President Trump that North Korea would be the gravest foreign threat he faced \u2014 and why a solution has proved so hard to find.But Mr. Trump may find that North Korea is driven by dynamics more complex than can be solved with strength or threats alone.North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs are central to a strategy meant to stave off a threat greater than any foreign adversary: the undermining of the North Korean system.For much of the Cold War, North and South Korea were at roughly comparable levels of economic and political development. Both could claim, at least internally, to be the rightful government of the Korean people who had been temporarily disunited.But by the 1990s, the South enjoyed a booming economy and a blossoming democracy. Communist governments worldwide were collapsing, and North Korea seemed likely to follow.This policy sought to explain the country\u2019s shortages and rationing as necessary to maintain its immense military, to justify oppression as necessary to root out internal enemies and to rally the nationalism that often comes during wartime.Today, the country and government appear to be stable. But this came at a cost: a permanent state of near-war to stave off the forces of history that would otherwise tear down North Korea. Neither threats nor concessions from outside have proved able to override this calculus.The Korean War, never officially resolved, was long deadlocked between the Cold War superpowers. When Soviet protection fell away, North Korea became suddenly vulnerable against the vastly more powerful United States and its allies.Mr. Kim, unable to seek peace without risking a German-style reunification that would subsume the North under South Korean rule, sought to make any potential war too costly to consider.Missile and nuclear tests, along with what appears to have been a cultivated appearance of irrationality, put the onus on North Korea\u2019s enemies to manage tensions.At first, analysts believe, weapons programs were intended to one day be traded away in a grand bargain with the United States.But each round of provocation, in deliberately raising the risk of war, made the missile and nuclear programs not just symbolically useful but also strategically necessary.After imposing such threats on its neighbors, North Korea could hardly drop these programs without understandably fearing an attack. Disarmament, in this view, would invite annihilation.Far more powerful states, like Russia or China, dedicate billions in spending and decades of research to similar goals. Small, impoverished North Korea, unable to match their abilities, has compensated with a willingness to accept extreme levels of risk.Its plan, analysts believe, is to halt any American invasion by launching nuclear strikes at the ports and airfields in the south where troops would enter the peninsula. It would then threaten to launch nuclear-armed intercontinental missiles (an ability it does not yet possess but is developing) at major American cities, forcing the United States to stand down.By edging up to the line of such a war, North Korea can also coerce its adversaries in peacetime.This puts the world in a quandary: How could any outside threat possibly exceed the risk that North Korea already takes on itself? How could any concession remove the North Korean weakness that drives its behavior?The United States\u2019 relative strength is also, paradoxically, a weakness. North Korea knows that it would quickly succumb to a full American attack, making its only option to escalate to nuclear strikes almost immediately at the start of a conflict.North Korea also fears that the United States might seek to depose its government in rapid strikes against the leadership, a threat it seeks to deter with repeated warnings of a nuclear response.In this way, North Korean weakness constrains any American options. Punitive strikes, which might otherwise be used to chasten the country, or strikes meant to degrade the missile or nuclear programs, would risk stirring North Korea\u2019s fear of an all-out attack, leading to nuclear conflict.Iran was persuaded to surrender most of its nuclear program by sanctions, which put the government under domestic pressure from citizens who hated their isolation and poverty and from elites who foresaw huge gains from sanctions relief.But North Korea has proved itself capable of withstanding economic devastation far exceeding Iran\u2019s.In the 1990s, North Korea was plunged into a famine that killed up to 10 percent of the population. But it neither succumbed to internal unrest nor sought to end the crisis by opening up to the outside world.The famine, Mr. Myers wrote, \u201cmay have strengthened support for the regime by renewing the sense of ethnic victimhood from which the official worldview derived its passion.\u201d\u201cMany migrants remember a widespread yearning for war with America during the famine,\u201d he added.Some rogue weapons states, such as Iraq under Saddam Hussein, rely on imported technology or assistance. North Korea\u2019s programs, however, appear largely indigenous.This means that, while specific sites could be shut down or weapons removed by a potential agreement or set of strikes, the knowledge to reconstitute them may be there for good.If North Korea remains bent on acquiring a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile, then no obvious action short of all-out war could completely derail this drive. Cyberattacks, for instance, can only slow its progress.North Korea is believed to already have short- and medium-range missiles and rockets hidden around the country. Strikes to rapidly destroy these weapons, analysts believe, would be unlikely to succeed before the country could launch at least some.Seoul, the South Korean capital and a city of 25 million, would be a likely target. Any strike plan, whether to disarm North Korea or punish it, would have to ask whether this was an acceptable risk.Any agreement that North Korea would be likely to consider minimally acceptable would come at huge cost to the United States and its allies. North Korea would be likely to require:\u201cThey want to see the end of that alliance,\u201d said Joshua H. Pollack, the editor of the Nonproliferation Review, suggesting that North Korea has drawn inspiration from the way that the United States broke with Taiwan in order to normalize relations with China in the 1970s.Mr. Pollack emphasized that North Korea probably saw this as a long-term goal to be accomplished over many years, rather than something to demand up front and all at once.Still, he said, North Korea may see this as the only way to reduce the existential threat that its weapons program is meant to curb.Any partial or full American withdrawal would risk sending the American relationship with South Korea and Japan into crisis, empowering North Korea and weakening American influence in Asia.Even if a president deemed these costs worthwhile, he or she might find the politics of such a deal insurmountable.As time goes on, analysts say, the risks only grow.John R. Bolton, the Bush administration\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, told Fox News this week that the only \u201cway to end North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program is to end North Korea\u201d by bringing about the government\u2019s total collapse.Mr. Pollack, asked if he agreed, at first dismissed Mr. Bolton as a \u201chard-liner,\u201d saying a war would risk nuclear devastation, but then he acknowledged that the assessment of North Korea\u2019s determination was probably correct.\u201cThey\u2019re not gonna give this stuff up,\u201d Mr. Pollack said.A picture caption accompanying an earlier version of this article misstated the occasion for a military parade that North Korean troops prepared for last week.

{"Headline": "Mr. Trump\u2019s Fickle Diplomacy", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byEditorialsUntil a few days ago, Americans and the world had reason to think that the Trump administration\u2019s policy toward Russia would involve cooperation and harmony and seek to reverse the acrimony and dysfunction that had come to characterize relations between the Kremlin and the Obama administration.During the campaign, Mr. Trump fawned over Russia\u2019s assertively proud leader, Vladimir Putin, praising him for \u201cdoing a great job\u201d and calling him a \u201cstronger leader\u201d than Barack Obama. As to policy, he seemed almost an apologist for Mr. Putin\u2019s aggressive behavior in Syria, his annexation of Crimea and his transparent efforts to undermine the NATO alliance. Findings by the American intelligence community that Russia had intervened in the election on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf seemed further evidence of a bromance, if not something more sinister.Three months into the Trump presidency, Russia-American relations are as tense as ever, a casualty of Mr. Putin\u2019s ruthless behavior and Mr. Trump\u2019s changing views and whiplash approach to policy, infuriating Russians who had every reason to believe they would have a pal in the White House.While both men could end up losers, there is a greater chance that Mr. Trump, a foreign policy neophyte who has bungled his presidential debut, will find it hard to prevail over the nefarious ways of Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. agent. Mr. Putin\u2019s approach to international engagement, which involves expanding efforts to meddle in countries from Europe to Libya and beyond, has been largely consistent; Mr. Trump\u2019s has been anything but.This, in turn, has shaken the confidence of allies that depend on America for prudent, steady leadership.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s trip to Moscow on Wednesday was further evidence of how low Russian-American relations have sunk since Mr. Trump, reversing earlier opposition to intervening in Syria\u2019s civil war, launched 59 cruise missiles against a Syrian air base after President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against civilians. The Russians have strongly supported Mr. Assad despite his brutality.Russian leaders kept Mr. Tillerson wondering for most of the day whether an encounter with Mr. Putin would take place. Once they did meet \u2014 it was the first between Mr. Putin and a top Trump administration official \u2014 the results were not encouraging. Mr. Putin said bilateral trust has \u201cdegraded,\u201d while Mr. Tillerson said relations were \u201cat a low point.\u201d Back in New York, Russia vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Syria\u2019s chemical attack, the eighth time it has protected Mr. Assad from diplomatic action.One important question is whether the chill in the relationship will make it harder for Mr. Trump to engage Moscow in the struggle to defeat the Islamic State in Syria; cooperation on that front, always questionable, now seems impossible.Another is whether an angry Mr. Putin will intensify his mischief in Europe. He doesn\u2019t have the strongest hand \u2014 his economy is in trouble \u2014 but he has thousands of nuclear weapons and a proven ability to chip away at the Western liberal order. The challenge is for Mr. Trump to develop a coherent strategy to address those threats.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Closed Prisons in Rural Areas Are a Tough Sell", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byWILTON, N.Y. \u2014 At a state prison here that closed in 2014, a businessman from Florida envisions an entertainment complex with a film studio, a concert venue and a theme park where visitors could battle zombies or play superheroes.The businessman, William Browning, recently toured the former Mount McGregor Correctional Facility, one of 13 state prisons that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has closed since 2011.For Mr. Browning, who owns Browning Productions and Entertainment and has a plan to redevelop the site, the prison\u2019s razor-topped fencing, century-old buildings and peeling paint are perfect.\u201cThis is great,\u201d he said, as he surveyed cells that had been used for solitary confinement. \u201cThe theme park would be nothing like Disney or Universal. Zombies are something the market has become obsessed with. We\u2019ll dedicate an entire section of the property to scenarios where people can use survival tactics to dominate the world during a zombie apocalypse.\u201dMr. Browning\u2019s enthusiasm is music to state officials\u2019 ears as they strive to find new life for empty prisons scattered across the state, most of them in rural areas.It has proved a difficult challenge.The closing of so many prisons aligns with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s quest to reform the criminal justice system, but it collides with another of his top priorities \u2014 reviving moribund upstate economies. In many communities, prisons were a major employer, and state officials are eager to replace lost jobs. But because many of the prisons are in isolated, remote regions, they have limited appeal.Of the 13 closed prisons, 10 are upstate and New York has sold three of them. Only one of them \u2014 the former Mid-Orange Correctional Facility \u2014 has been transformed into a new venture. The prison has been turned into the Warwick Valley Office and Technology Corporate Park, though so far just one business, a youth athletic training facility, has opened.Warwick, however, is relatively close to New York City, while Wilton is near the upscale tourist town of Saratoga Springs.The problem with many of the prisons is that \u201cthey\u2019re in the middle of nowhere,\u201d said Peter Bauer, the executive director of Protect the Adirondacks, an environmental group. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge to come up with creative and adaptive reuses of these facilities.\u201dState officials did not directly address the issue of whether the out-of-the-way location of the prison sites was an obstacle. Instead, they are focused simply on trying to find people interested in buying empty prisons.\u201cWhile the unique infrastructure of these sites can be challenging to a developer, these features can also present opportunities,\u201d said Michael Yevoli, a top official with Empire State Development, the state\u2019s economic development agency.The closing of the 13 prisons, all of which were medium- or minimum-security facilities, has been fueled, in part, by a drop in crime as well as a greater emphasis on diverting low-level offenders to programs that would avoid incarceration. The number of inmates has plunged statewide by about 6,000 since 2011, to 51,275 from 57,224.\u201cThe reduction of nonviolent offenders, mostly drug offenders, allowed the state to eliminate about 5,500 underutilized prison beds, saving approximately $162 million, while keeping violent offenders incarcerated for longer periods of time,\u201d said Patrick Bailey, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision.Still, one lawmaker, State Senator Betty Little, a Republican whose district has three shuttered prisons, has strongly opposed the closings, questioning whether the sites can really be turned into job-producing ventures.\u201cWhen the decision is made to close a prison in a rural community, that community loses hundreds of jobs that aren\u2019t going to be absorbed by the private sector,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Little said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge blow that someone from a populated area of New York State wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201dA plan to convert one former prison, Camp Gabriels, which is about an hour\u2019s drive south of the Canadian border, into a summer camp for Orthodox Jewish boys has run into problems because the state land lies within the Adirondack Forest Preserve and the sale of the property would require amending the state Constitution.The state has been somewhat more successful in converting prisons it used to operate in New York City. In the Bronx, the Fulton Correctional Facility is now owned by the Osborne Association, a nonprofit, which plans to overhaul and transform the site into a community center focused on reducing recidivism by providing temporary housing and job training to former inmates.In the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, the NoVo Foundation bought the former Bayview Correctional Facility and is moving forward with plans to open what it is calling the Women\u2019s Building, which will include working space for community service organizations, a restaurant and an art gallery, as well as offices for women\u2019s rights and social justice organizations.But with no large surrounding population base to draw from or easy access to airports and interstate highways, Camp Gabriels and other remote prison sites are harder to market.The two other upstate prisons that were sold remain idle.In 2013, a Westchester County man bought the former Camp Georgetown, about midway between Syracuse and Binghamton, at auction for $241,000 with a plan to create a summer camp for high school students interested in science and technology. But since then, nothing has happened.In 2014, another closed prison, the Summit Shock correctional facility, was bought at auction for $204,000. Zach Thompson, a planner for the Schoharie County Department of Planning and Development, said an application was submitted to turn the prison into a scrap processing center. But it was later withdrawn and no development has occurred, Mr. Thompson said.Of all the remaining prison sites, Mount McGregor has perhaps the most desirable location. Tall, south-facing windows in the old dining hall show views more than 70 miles away to the northern Catskills. That is what had attracted Mr. Browning, the Florida businessman who wants to turn it into an entertainment destination.Creativity runs in Mr. Browning\u2019s family. His grandfather Ricou Browning was a pioneer of underwater filming \u2014 he played the Gill-man in \u201cCreature From the Black Lagoon,\u201d was a creator of the 1960s television show \u201cFlipper\u201d and directed underwater scenes in the James Bond movie \u201cThunderball.\u201d\u201cIf you had to spend time, this is where you\u2019d want to do it,\u201d Mr. Browning said as he walked around the sprawling site. \u201cI don\u2019t need to rebuild what\u2019s here. I just need to utilize it better.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated, using information in a news release from the New York governor\u2019s office, which organizations would have offices in a renovation of the former Bayview Correctional Facility. It will include offices for women\u2019s rights and social justice organizations, not small technology firms.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Proposes Slashing Tax Rates, Significantly Aiding Wealthy", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday proposed sharp reductions in individual and business income tax rates and a radical reordering of the tax code that would significantly benefit the wealthy, but he offered no explanation of how the plan would be financed as he rushed to show progress before the 100-day mark of his presidency.But they offered none of the standard accouterments of such rollouts, such as detailed charts showing the cost of each provision, phase-in periods, the impacts of the proposals on people and testimonials on the program\u2019s potential benefits.\u201cWe have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do something really big,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cPresident Trump has made tax reform a priority, and we have a Republican Congress that wants to get it done.\u201dThe proposal envisions slashing the tax rate paid by businesses large and small to 15 percent. The number of individual income tax brackets would shrink from seven to three \u2014 10, 25 and 35 percent \u2014 easing the tax burden on most Americans, including the president, although aides did not offer the income ranges for each bracket.Individual tax rates currently have a ceiling of 39.6 percent and a floor of 10 percent. Most Americans pay taxes somewhere between the two.Mr. Trump wants to double the standard deduction for individuals, essentially eliminating taxes on around $24,000 of a couple\u2019s earnings. That proposal was met with alarm by home builders and real estate agents, who fear it would disincentivize the purchase of homes. The proposal would scrap most itemized deductions, such as those for state and local tax payments, a valuable break for taxpayers in Democratic states like California and New York.But the president would leave in place popular breaks for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and retirement savings.A point-by-point look at how much it will increase the federal deficit.In a brief session with reporters, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin said they had been toiling for weeks on the proposal, much of which closely resembles the plan Mr. Trump championed as a presidential candidate. They argued that it would spur robust economic growth that would \u2014 along with the elimination of deductions \u2014 cover the potentially multitrillion-dollar proposal entirely, a prospect that even many Republicans privately concede is virtually impossible.\u201cThis will pay for itself with growth and with reduction of different deductions and closing loopholes,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, repeating his optimistic estimate that the plan would spur the economy to grow at a rate of 3 percent annually. \u201cThe economic plan under Trump will grow the economy and will create massive amounts of revenues, trillions of dollars in additional revenues.\u201dDemocrats rejected what they described as magical thinking behind the plan and condemned it as a giveaway to the rich masquerading as a tax overhaul.\u201cThis is an unprincipled tax plan that will result in cuts for the 1 percent, conflicts for the president, crippling debt for America and crumbs for the working people,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said in a statement. \u201cInstead of providing a real tax reform plan as promised, this administration is offering cakes to the fortunate few.\u201dBernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, a forecasting firm, was unsparing.\u201cThe effort to introduce more fiscal stimulus into the economy is genuinely underway,\u201d he wrote to clients. \u201cBut the bare bones plan we saw unveiled today is already conceptually flawed and unlikely to go far in Congress. The final product will bear no resemblance to the principal points highlighted in today\u2019s meager release. Certainly, the first step in this process was unimpressive.\u201dMr. Cohn said the plan was \u201cthe most significant tax reform legislation since 1986\u201d \u2014 the last time a comprehensive tax overhaul was enacted \u2014 as well as \u201cone of the biggest tax cuts in American history,\u201d in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s grandiose portrayal.As expected, the White House did not include in its plan the border adjustment tax on imports that was a centerpiece of a plan developed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin said the White House could not support that proposal \u201cin its current form,\u201d setting up an intraparty struggle over the elements of a tax plan and how to offset the deep reductions envisioned.But Republican leaders who are eager for large tax cuts did not allow their internal divisions over elements of the package to obscure their overall support for Mr. Trump\u2019s effort.Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brady issued a joint statement with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, saying the principles outlined Wednesday would \u201cserve as critical guideposts\u201d as Congress and the administration worked together on a tax overhaul.Mr. Trump also signaled support for revisions to the tax code that would help families with child-care costs, although his document provided no details. He called for ending the 3.8 percent tax on investment income that was imposed by the Affordable Care Act, restoring the capital gains rate to 20 percent.Democrats are ready to battle Mr. Trump over the tax cuts, which they are determined to tie to his refusal to release his tax returns.\u201cTrump\u2019s latest proposal is another gift to corporations and billionaires like himself,\u201d said Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic Party chairman. \u201cTrump must release his tax returns, as millions of Americans are demanding, before Congress can consider any Trump tax plan. We must know how much Trump would personally financially benefit from his own proposal.\u201dQuestioned about that repeatedly on Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin said that Mr. Trump, the first president in four decades not to disclose at least a portion of his tax returns, had \u201cno intention\u201d of releasing them now.\u201cI can\u2019t comment on the president\u2019s tax situation since I don\u2019t have access to that, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said when asked how large of a tax cut the president would receive under his own plan.The plan contrasts starkly with the one championed by House Republicans, who proposed paying for their tax cuts in part with the new tax on imports, an effort to ensure that the measure would not swell the deficit.The White House plan does call for \u201ca territorial system to level the playing field for American companies,\u201d akin to a component of House Republicans\u2019 plan that would allow United States corporations to pay taxes only on their domestic profits.\u201cI worry that the Trump proposal would shift a tremendous amount of income abroad,\u201d said Alan B. Krueger, who was a chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to square that with incentivizing investment in the U.S.\u201dRepublicans have long called for permanent, comprehensive changes to the tax code, but lately they have shown increasing openness to tax cuts with an expiration date. If they embark on a plan to pass legislation that adds to the deficit and cannot be filibustered by Democrats, Senate budget rules dictate that the tax cuts would expire after a decade.\u201cIf we have them for 10 years, that\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Democrats were particularly critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s idea of allowing firms known as pass-through entities \u2014 including hedge funds, real estate concerns like Mr. Trump\u2019s and large partnerships \u2014 that currently pay taxes at individual rates, which top off at 39.6 percent, to be eligible for the 15 percent corporate rate.Critics worry that lawyers, doctors, consultants and other individuals in partnerships could structure much of their personal income as business income, effectively reducing their tax rate from 39.6 percent to 15 percent.Mr. Mnuchin said the administration would not allow that to happen.\u201cWe will make sure that there are rules in place so that wealthy people can\u2019t create pass-throughs and use that as a mechanism to avoid paying the tax rate that they should be on the personal side,\u201d he said.The explanation did not seem to mollify Democrats.\u201cWe don\u2019t need a tax plan that allows the very rich to use pass-throughs to reduce their rates to 15 percent while average Americans are paying much more,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not tax reform. That\u2019s just a tax giveaway to the very, very wealthy that will explode the deficit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s First Year in Power, Dismay Swirls in Myanmar", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported byMAWLAMYINE, Myanmar \u2014 The scene would have been unlikely a year ago. Tens of thousands of demonstrators filled the streets to protest a decision by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government to name a new bridge for her father.\u201cRecognize the will of the local ethnic people,\u201d protesters chanted last month as they marched along the waterfront of this historic city in southern Myanmar.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate once celebrated as a champion of democracy, was insulting the Mon people, the dominant ethnic group in the area, protest leaders said, by naming the bridge for a Burmese leader infamous here for steamrollering over their rights.\u201cThis is not a democratic process,\u201d said Min Zarni Oo, general secretary of the Mon Youth Forum. \u201cThis is a big issue for the local people. The government doesn\u2019t value ethnic diversity.\u201dEven so, her first year has been a disappointment to many.She made it a top priority to end the long-running ethnic insurgencies that have torn the country apart, but her anemic peace effort has proved fruitless so far, and fighting between government forces and ethnic groups has increased.Her government\u2019s growing suppression of speech on the internet seems perverse for a onetime democracy icon who spent 15 years under house arrest.Among the public, patience is wearing thin. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have support like before,\u201d said Zar Zar Oo, 31, a vendor selling bottled water at the Yangon train station. \u201cWe loved her so much before, but it seems like she doesn\u2019t do enough for us. For now, we are in trouble.\u201dIn a televised speech to the nation commemorating her first year in office, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi struck a defensive note, acknowledging her government\u2019s lack of progress and saying people could choose another leader if they were unhappy with her.\u201cIf you think I am not good enough for our country and our people, if someone or some organization can do better than us, we are ready to step down,\u201d she said.Some voters apparently listened. In parliamentary by-elections last weekend, her National League for Democracy won only nine of 19 seats.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 71, cites building roads as one of her biggest accomplishments. The party spokesman Win Htein said her government had doubled spending on health care and education, though he provided no details.And the economy has continued to grow as the country emerges from isolation under military rule.But Richard Horsey, a political analyst and former United Nations official, said that the growth had slowed and that foreign investment had dipped significantly. Washington\u2019s lifting of economic sanctions last year has yet to translate into stronger trade, investment or job creation, he said.\u201cAung San Suu Kyi\u2019s administration has not offered any compelling economic vision,\u201d he said.In Yangon, people are waiting for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to deliver results, said Myat Suu Mon, 28, a department store clerk. The cost of taking the run-down bus to work has doubled, she said, while her pay has remained the same.\u201cSupport is less than before because people\u2019s expectations were too high,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in reality we don\u2019t see things changing here.\u201dZaw Htay, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman, acknowledged that progress had been slow but said the government faced complex problems, such as ethnic conflicts and clashes with the Rohingya, that had been years in the making. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe are not magicians.\u201dIndeed, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi faces daunting challenges. In rebuilding the country, she must overcome decades of mismanagement and profiteering by previous military governments that enriched the generals and their cronies and brought the economy to its knees.Though her party has a strong majority in Parliament, it is hamstrung by a power-sharing arrangement dictated by the military-drafted Constitution, which gives the military control of key ministries and enough seats in Parliament to block any constitutional amendment.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is barred by the Constitution from serving as president because her children are foreigners, a prohibition she circumvented by creating the office of state counselor for herself and declaring that the president would report to her. She also named herself foreign minister.Supporters say her ability to get along with the military is a significant accomplishment. But critics suggest she suffers from Stockholm syndrome, becoming too cozy with her former captors.\u201cShe\u2019s Mary Poppins without a sense of humor,\u201d said David Scott Mathieson, an independent analyst. \u201cShe has a schoolmarmish way where instructions are given and obedience is observed. She takes that approach with government, and it is highly misplaced. Politics is compromise.\u201dShe rarely takes questions from the news media or speaks out on major issues. Her office declined a request for an interview for this article.Under the telecommunications act, defaming someone online is punishable by three years in prison. Anyone can bring a case, and suspects can be held without bail while they await trial.The previous government, which adopted the law in 2013, used it only seven times. In the year since Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi took office, 47 cases have been brought, according to Maung Saungkha, who was once imprisoned under the law and now tracks its use.In one case, two media executives were jailed after posting comments on Facebook questioning why a government official was wearing an expensive watch. Five cases have been brought by supporters of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi against people they claim defamed her, Mr. Maung said.\u201cWithout freedom of expression, there won\u2019t be democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the government wants national reconciliation, this kind of law has to be discarded.\u201dMr. Win, the party spokesman, said Parliament would amend the law in its next session. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will solve this problem.\u201dThe biggest stain on Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s record may be her government\u2019s brutal treatment of the Rohingya, and her tepid response to it.In recent months, government soldiers have been accused of widespread killing and rape of Rohingya in Rakhine State. A United Nations report concluded in February that the army and police had slaughtered hundreds of men, women and children; gang-raped women and girls; and forced as many as 90,000 people from their homes.Although Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has no direct control over the military, she has played down the reports of atrocities and stood by the military.She did appoint a commission led by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, to examine conditions in Rakhine, but reviewing the military\u2019s conduct was not part of its mandate.\u201cEntire villages were razed,\u201d said Matthew Smith, director of the group Fortify Rights. \u201cChildren were thrown into fires. Suu Kyi\u2019s denials and failure to provide a shred of moral leadership to deal with the situation is a really damning revelation of her character.\u201dThe blowback over the bridge-naming in Mon State, seen here as more evidence that the government is out of touch with the concerns of ethnic minorities, should have been easier to avoid.Mr. Zaw, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman, said senior party leaders had been warned that naming the bridge for her father, Gen. Aung San, would turn the population against them. They went ahead anyway, and last weekend it cost them the parliamentary seat in Chaungzon, the township across the bridge from Mawlamyine. \u201cIt was a mistake to name this bridge,\u201d Mr. Zaw said. \u201cIt is a good lesson for N.L.D. leaders.\u201dSaw Nang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Inaugural Drew Big Dollars From Donors With Vested Interests", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byThe casino magnate and philanthropist Sheldon G. Adelson wants some big things from the Trump administration: banning the online poker sites that compete with his luxury casinos, for example, and moving the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.And while President Trump was not Mr. Adelson\u2019s first choice during the Republican primary season last year, he has been generous since: The billionaire donated $5 million to the committee organizing Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration festivities \u2014 the largest single contribution given to any president\u2019s inaugural committee.The stream of money is a striking contrast to the way Mr. Trump funded his campaign, chiefly with small donations and his own fortune. While some big checks for the inauguration came from longtime Trump friends and associates, much of the money came from the industries that have traditionally excelled at wielding Washington influence: telecommunications, tobacco and pharmaceutical giants, which have bankrolled presidential inaugurations for Republicans and Democrats alike. And a generous amount came from people who had been hostile to his candidacy.If the crowds at Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing-in celebrations were relatively small, the checks paying for all the nonofficial festivities were not: Freed of many of the voluntary restrictions adopted by Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors, 48 people or corporations gave $1 million or more, according to the disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission. Besides Mr. Adelson, they included a trust controlled by the coal industry billionaire Joseph W. Craft III; the parent company of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; and Robert Mercer, the billionaire investor and close ally of Stephen K. Bannon, a White House adviser.The donor rolls also included a host of blue-chip American companies, like Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Intel, Google and Bank of America, which contribute significant sums regardless of the incoming president\u2019s political party.\u201cDuring the campaign, he attacked over and over again precisely these kinds of huge contributions,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, the president of the watchdog group Democracy 21 and a longtime advocate of tighter campaign finance rules. \u201cHe also said he knew from personal experience that you can buy influence with politicians by making these kinds of contributions. That didn\u2019t seem to bother him in raising ridiculous amounts of money to pay for the inauguration.\u201dBoeing, the country\u2019s biggest exporter, made a million-dollar contribution in January. This month, Boeing won a major victory when Mr. Trump abandoned his campaign pledge to eliminate the Export-Import Bank, which has provided billions in loan guarantees to help Boeing\u2019s overseas customers finance plane purchases.Central to the money-raising effort was Thomas Barrack Jr., a private equity investor who is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest and oldest friends. It was Mr. Barrack who hosted one of Mr. Trump\u2019s first major fund-raisers at his home in Santa Monica, Calif., last May, and who spoke in Cleveland the night Mr. Trump accepted the Republican nomination. As inaugural chairman, Mr. Barrack was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s chief liaisons to those business executives who had kept him at arm\u2019s length.Contributions to the festivities were not intended to accrue favor with the new president, Mr. Barrack said in a text message, but were made \u201cin support of the coming together of our country and its people to commemorate the cornerstone of our American democratic process.\u201dBut the democratic process moves along more quickly for some than for others. While Mr. Trump promised during the campaign to give Medicare and Medicaid the power to negotiate prices they pay for prescription drugs, two of the biggest drugmakers, Pfizer and Amgen, gave a combined $1.5 million in December.Amgen\u2019s chief executive was among the industry executives who attended a February meeting with Mr. Trump. After entering the meeting promising to do something \u201cto get prices down,\u201d Mr. Trump exited with a more industry-friendly line, saying he would oppose \u201cprice-fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare.\u201d (A White House spokesman later said Mr. Trump remained in favor of negotiating prices.)Few industries have stood to gain as much under Mr. Trump as private prison operators, and they gave generously to his inauguration. Two of the largest such companies, the Corrections Corporation of America, now known as CoreCivic, and the GEO Group, each contributed $250,000.For many Washington interests and for large donors \u2014 particularly those who had not anticipated a Trump victory or had no relationship with his insurgent campaign, or had actively opposed him \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural was an easy way to make inroads with the president-elect.The Ansary family, prominent Iranian-Americans in Dallas who are longtime allies of the Bushes, gave $2 million to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Paul Singer, the billionaire Republican investor who opposed Mr. Trump and once predicted that his policies were \u201cclose to a guarantee of a global depression,\u201d donated $1 million on Dec. 6.The two have mended fences recently. In February, Mr. Singer visited Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, and Mr. Trump declared afterward that \u201cnow he\u2019s a very strong ally and I appreciate that.\u201dMr. Zuberi is now making inroads in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle. After making the donation, he earned a coveted spot at the Chairman\u2019s Global Dinner, a pre-inauguration, black-tie gathering intended to introduce the incoming president to the foreign diplomatic corps. A photo from the event shows Mr. Zuberi in conversation with Mr. Trump and other guests.Mr. Zuberi did not return a phone call seeking comment.Because inaugural committees face few of the regulations that limit campaign fund-raising, each administration sets its own restrictions.George W. Bush, for example, capped gifts at $100,000 for his first inaugural and at $250,000 for his second. Mr. Obama accepted gifts up to only $50,000 in 2009, while banning all gifts from lobbyists and corporations altogether. He loosened those restrictions in 2013, accepting corporate gifts up to $1 million and individual gifts up to $250,000.Just what other perks and souvenirs their donations helped pay for will probably remain a mystery. While donations must be reported, the Federal Election Commission does not require inaugural committees to account for what they spend or how much is left in their coffers when the revelers head home.Mr. Trump\u2019s committee said it was still identifying charities toward which it would direct leftover money.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

In recent years, China has taken to selling dollars to keep its currency from depreciating more.\u201cThe field has not been a level field. Jobs have been leaving our country, going to China and Mexico and lots of other places, and you\u2019ll be seeing what\u2019s happening over the next few weeks. It should be very interesting for you to watch.\u201d \u201cSince China joined, that\u2019s another beauty, the World Trade Organization in 2001, the United States has lost many more than 60,000 factories.\u201d \u201cSo we take in things free, and yet, if you want to take a plant or you want to do something, you want to sell something into China and other countries, it\u2019s very, very hard. In some cases, it\u2019s impossible. They won\u2019t even take your product.\u201dSome 160 countries, including China, also charge a steep value-added tax on domestic and foreign products alike. But these costs are largely shouldered by consumers.\u201cBut over all, since China joined W.T.O. in 2001, more and more American goods and services are allowed into the country without significant restrictions,\u201d Mr. Zimmerman said.Advertisement"}

They used a mostly muted palette in the finishes and textured wall coverings, with bursts of color in the artwork and accessories, outfitting the spacious rooms with modern Italian furnishings.Entry is through two sets of doors, with a small garden in between. The main carved wooden doors open to a hallway. There is a lounge area with a piano that flows into the living and dining rooms, both of which have double-height ceilings. The living room has a wall of custom bookcases at one end and glass doors that open to a garden with a seating area. \u201cThe whole house was designed so all the rooms had a view of some garden,\u201d Ms. Cazarin said.The main floor features a large open space with a home-theater area and an eat-in kitchen with stainless-steel appliances; this portion of the house looks out onto yet another garden and a modest pool.

So he paces the concourse here at Estadio Juan Ram\u00f3n Loubriel, a converted baseball stadium in a commercial neighborhood about 10 miles from San Juan, and fields text messages from his boss.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t they tackling more?\u201d the boss wants to know. \u201cWe need to get tougher!\u201dThe boss is Carmelo Anthony, whose role as owner of Puerto Rico F.C., a second-year club in the North American Soccer League, serves multiple purposes. It is a form of community outreach, a pull he felt as a result of his Puerto Rican heritage. It is an investment opportunity. And it is a welcome diversion from his day job as a starting forward for the Knicks.\u201cI try to watch every game,\u201d Anthony said.As the Knicks lurch toward the end of another disastrous season, Anthony\u2019s future with the organization seems tenuous at best. Phil Jackson, the team president, wants to ship him elsewhere, which would require Anthony to waive his no-trade clause. Anthony has warned of reading \u201cthe writing on the wall.\u201d Amid so much dysfunction, at least he has his other team \u2014 the one he gets to run.The one with playoff hopes. The one that is not wedded to the triangle offense. The one with the team president who actually listens to him.\u201cIt\u2019s nice when his basketball season lessens, because we get a little more time with him,\u201d Payne said.In September, ahead of training camp with the Knicks, Anthony visited Puerto Rico with several teammates \u2014 a bonding trip of sorts. But he carved out time for soccer-related business. He spent five hours with Payne at the team\u2019s offices in San Juan, poring over budget reports. He badgered members of the video team for promotional materials. He gave the players pep talks.\u201cYou can tell he\u2019s invested,\u201d goalkeeper Trevor Spangenberg said. \u201cHe\u2019s not just a name attached to the team that we never see. He\u2019s been here. He\u2019s spoken with us individually.\u201dFor a meeting with officials from a local bank, Anthony decked himself out in his Team U.S.A. sweatsuit from the Olympics.\u201cAnd he looked fantastic,\u201d Payne said. \u201cOnly an athlete at Carmelo\u2019s level could get away with that.\u201dAnthony also rummaged through one of the team\u2019s storage closets, which was full of gear: T-shirts, hoodies, hats, shorts. He wanted to know if he could take a few items home.\u201cHe was in there for a half-hour,\u201d Payne said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like: \u2018Carmelo, you can have anything you want. It\u2019s not like everyone else here. You paid for this stuff.\u2019\u201dAnthony grew up in Baltimore but visited Puerto Rico, where his father was born, when he was a child, and then again after his senior year of high school, he said in an interview last week. The trip left an impression, he said. He even contemplated joining Puerto Rico\u2019s national basketball team before opting to preserve his eligibility to compete for the United States. (Some Puerto Ricans were not pleased. Anthony said he had managed to \u201csmooth things over\u201d since then.)He has returned to the island over the years, funding the construction of seven basketball courts. Then, in 2015, an unusual opportunity presented itself: the chance to buy an expansion team in the N.A.S.L., which sits a rung below Major League Soccer on American soccer\u2019s professional league structure.Soccer has never been as popular as baseball, boxing or volleyball in Puerto Rico, but it does have some history here. From 2004 to 2012, a pro club called the Puerto Rico Islanders played in various leagues, and even advanced to the semifinals of the Concacaf Champions League in 2009, before the franchise folded.Anthony, a longtime soccer fan, said he had observed how the game had grown in recent years, particularly among youths. So when he learned of the opportunity to start a new club, he saw potential: to build something of his own and to contribute to a community that is important to him.\u201cHe wanted to bring something back to Puerto Rico,\u201d said Adrian Whitbread, the club\u2019s coach. \u201cThere was a void.\u201dSome of Anthony\u2019s financial advisers were less enthusiastic. Puerto Rico was (and remains) mired in a deep recession. It was not an ideal environment in which to start a business, especially one so dependent on sponsorship deals and ticket sales. But that, Anthony said, was kind of the point.\u201cWe wanted to get involved when everybody was counting the island out,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to be there from the ground level.\u201dOne of his first hires was Payne, a former president for business operations with the Los Angeles Galaxy of M.L.S. When Payne showed up to interview with Anthony at his offices in Brooklyn, he was surprised when Anthony answered the door. It was a subtle sign, Payne said, of Anthony\u2019s hands-on approach.At one point during their hour-and-a-half conversation, Anthony asked Payne how long he thought it would take the club to become profitable. Payne told him that it would depend on the economy.\u201cThis is a long-term investment,\u201d Anthony said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I\u2019m looking at as a get-rich-quick type of thing.\u201dAsked how much money he had poured into the team, Anthony said, \u201cThat\u2019s undisclosed.\u201d Anthony covers the club\u2019s losses, said Payne, who added that one of his goals was to see the club double its average home attendance, to 8,000 from about 4,000 a game last season. Ticket prices range from about $8 to $50. (Anthony wanted to sell them for $5 apiece before Payne intervened.)Payne wants to see Puerto Rico F.C. turn a profit. He knows it could take years, if it happens at all.\u201cListen,\u201d Payne said, \u201cit\u2019s an interesting time to be trying to start something in Puerto Rico. The economy is not good. But Carmelo\u2019s passionate about Puerto Rico. This matters to him.\u201dAnthony was also drawn to the free-market principles of the N.A.S.L., which does not have a salary cap. While player salaries range from about $20,000 to more than $100,000, the eight clubs in the league can pay whatever they want. If Anthony really wanted to sign someone, he could shell out millions. His players say he cares about the product.\u201cYou can tell he knows a little bit,\u201d said Cristiano Dias, a defender from Brazil. \u201cYou can sit in the stands and watch two players running and tell who\u2019s really putting the effort in. On that part, being an athlete, I think he can judge the game pretty good. On the technical part \u2014 well, I\u2019m not so confident to say that!\u201dLast month, the day after Puerto Rico F.C. lost to a Jamaican club called Portmore United F.C. in a critical round of the Caribbean Club Championship (which doubled as a tuneup before the start of the N.A.S.L. season), Payne arrived for his team\u2019s afternoon training session. He was not in a chipper mood. He had not slept well. He was still dwelling on the previous evening\u2019s result.\u201cIt was poor, honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to a couple of coaches about it. It\u2019s not good enough.\u201dThe club provides housing for the players in a lush, seaside neighborhood near San Juan called Isla Verde. Given the loss to Portmore, Payne said he was reconsidering that arrangement.\u201cI\u2019m thinking we should move them down here, where it\u2019s a little grittier, a little tougher,\u201d he said.He clarified that he was joking \u2014 for now, at least. Anthony, he said, had shown more patience for the process. \u201cHe\u2019s really patient,\u201d Payne said. \u201cLook how he puts up with all that garbage in New York.\u2019\u2019Payne recalled a recent trip to Madison Square Garden. \u201cI went to a game this year,\u201d he said, \u201cand I was like: What am I doing paying this kind of money to watch this?\u201dPuerto Rico F.C., meanwhile, has opened its season with draws against the New York Cosmos and two against the Indy Eleven, the top two teams in the league last season. Anthony said he expected to pay the team another visit soon. He has big plans, which include designing new uniforms for next season.Here, on a distant island, if nowhere else, Anthony has a team that will look exactly the way he wants it to look.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Court Gives Trump Small Victory in Push Against Clean Power Plan", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal court said on Friday it would halt consideration of a major lawsuit over former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature policy aimed at tackling global warming, handing the Trump administration a modest and perhaps temporary victory.The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted a request from the Trump administration to defer for 60 days a decision on litigation over a contested 2015 Environmental Protection Agency regulation, known as the Clean Power Plan. The rule, aimed at shutting down heavily polluting coal-fired power plants and replacing them with renewable energy sources, was the centerpiece of Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to enact a series of ambitious regulations to reduce the United States\u2019 contributions to global warming.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.Twenty-eight states and several major industry groups had sued the Obama administration seeking to overturn the rule, arguing that it was unduly burdensome to utilities and too costly for consumers.The regulation was a major target for Mr. Trump, who called it \u201cstupid\u201d and a \u201cjob killer\u201d on the campaign trail and has begun taking steps to repeal it. In an executive order last month, Mr. Trump directed his E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, to begin the lengthy legal process of dismantling it, and at the same time requested that the court put the lawsuit on hold while the agency came up with a new plan.Had the court rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s request and upheld the Clean Power Plan, it would have made it far more difficult for Mr. Pruitt to roll back the rule.2016 is the hottest year on the historical record and the third consecutive record-breaking year, scientists say.\u201cThis ruling is important, because it means it will now be easier for the Trump E.P.A. to revoke or revise the Clean Power Plan,\u201d said Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer with the firm Bracewell, which represents many of the fossil fuel companies suing to overturn the rule. \u201cAt the very least, it means it will take less time.\u201dThe legal hold will have little practical impact, however, upon the nation\u2019s energy economy and coal industry. The climate change rule has never been formally put in place, after the Supreme Court last year said that states did not have to comply until all litigation had been resolved.But the ruling comes as the environmental movement is galvanized against what many advocates for climate action have called a concerted assault on environmental protections by Mr. Trump. On Saturday, thousands of demonstrators are expected to march in Washington and across the country to protest those actions.\u201cThis further delay by the court comes even as hundreds of thousands around the country prepare to march tomorrow for the climate protection that polls show an overwhelming majority of Americans strongly support,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser for the Clinton administration who is now a lecturer at the Center for Environmental Policy of American University. \u201cComing on top of the unprecedented Supreme Court stay last year, it gives the appearance to average citizens that the courts are standing with the far-right wing against sensible climate action.\u201dFollow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Day of Hardball and Confusion on Nafta", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For much of Wednesday, the Trump administration played hardball, spreading word that it was considering the shocking step of withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement.Advisers to President Trump said he wanted to announce an executive order beginning the process of withdrawing from the deal at a Saturday evening rally marking his 100th day in office. The rally is being held in Harrisburg, Pa. \u2014 in the heart of a region where many people regard Nafta as a dirty word.\u201cI decided rather than terminating Nafta, which would be a pretty big, you know, shock to the system, we will renegotiate,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. He added that he was still ready to pull the United States out of the deal if he could not rework it to his satisfaction.White House officials quickly portrayed the confusion as a vindication of Mr. Trump\u2019s management style and said he had succeeded in bringing Mexico and Canada to the negotiating table \u2014 casting it as a signal accomplishment for a president hungry for victories. But Democrats just as swiftly dismissed the events as another example of what they call Mr. Trump\u2019s feral and feckless government by improvisation. They also noted that Mexico and Canada have long been sitting at the table, waiting for the United States.The Nafta confusion has its roots in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Mr. Trump promised repeatedly that he would either renegotiate the 23-year-old agreement with Mexico and Canada or withdraw from it. It was a theme that resonated deeply in the economically struggling parts of the country where Mr. Trump is the most popular.By the time Mr. Trump was in the White House, his more moderate advisers \u2014 including Gary D. Cohn, his top economic adviser, and the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who communicates regularly with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico \u2014 had persuaded him to temper his attacks on America\u2019s trading partners. But hard-liners like Peter Navarro, the president\u2019s chief adviser on trade, were pushing for a strong statement on trade to close out Mr. Trump\u2019s first 100 days.Administration officials planned a meeting for Wednesday evening on withdrawing from Nafta. Before it was held, some officials told reporters that Mr. Trump was likely to withdraw from the deal. It is not clear whether the officials were reflecting what they thought was going to happen, or whether they had agendas \u2014 either to try to lock Mr. Trump into the decision, or to try to create a firestorm that might persuade him not to withdraw.In any case, the news went viral.Congressional Republicans and business leaders urged Mr. Trump to reconsider. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, called the idea a \u201cdisaster.\u201d The Business Roundtable, which represents large companies and is led by Josh Bolten, a former White House budget director and chief of staff to President George W. Bush, said that \u201cwe strenuously oppose withdrawing\u201d from Nafta. The Mexican peso plummeted.At the White House, Mr. Trump\u2019s moderate advisers urgently tried to convince him that even a first step toward an exit \u2014 his executive order would have begun a six-month waiting period before the United States could actually withdraw \u2014 could cause significant economic disruptions in all three nations, whose economies are increasingly intertwined. Sonny Perdue, Mr. Trump\u2019s agriculture secretary, brought a map to the Oval Office showing the areas of the United States that would be hardest hit.American farmers sold $2.6 billion of corn to Mexico last year, and American agricultural exports to Mexico have increased 64 percent over the last decade. Under Nafta, Mexico cannot charge tariffs on those imports, but if Nafta goes away, Mexico could immediately restore a 37 percent tariff on American corn. On Wednesday, as news of the potential executive order circulated, corn futures dropped 1.3 percent.\u201cMr. President, America\u2019s corn farmers helped elect you,\u201d Wesley Spurlock, president of the National Corn Growers Association, wrote in an open letter to Mr. Trump. \u201cMr. President, agricultural and rural America are counting on you. We urge you not to withdraw from Nafta.\u201dTrade has contributed to economic growth, but changing dynamics have also prompted concerns about lost jobs and the trade deficit. But when something is manufactured in the United States, it is often made up of parts from around the world.By 7 p.m., Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was on the phone. He told Mr. Trump, according to Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, that he shared a desire to begin trade negotiations as soon as possible. But Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto also emphasized that he was \u201clooking for a negotiation that is good for Mexico, a win-win.\u201dMr. Videgaray later told reporters that in his view, Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of withdrawing from Nafta might have been an effort to prod Congress into action. The White House wants Congress to authorize expedited approval of a reworked agreement \u2014 a process known as trade promotion authority \u2014 but so far, it has not been able to win support from congressional Republicans. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said Tuesday that talks with Congress had \u201cstalled.\u201dThe call from Mexico was followed by one from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, who also urged Mr. Trump to focus on negotiations. \u201cNafta has been improved a dozen times over the past 20 years, and we\u2019re happy to sit down and talk about how it can be improved now,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told reporters in Saskatchewan on Thursday. He said he had told Mr. Trump that ending Nafta would cause \u201ca lot of short- and medium-term pain for an awful lot of families\u201d on both sides of the border.By 10:30 p.m., the White House had issued a statement saying Mr. Trump would not pull out of the deal for now. By Thursday morning, Mr. Trump was busily posting on Twitter, saying he had agreed to pleas from the leaders of Canada and Mexico not to withdraw immediately. But he reiterated that he would still pull the United States out if he could not negotiate a better deal.That brought Mr. Trump right back to what he had said all along.Reporting was contributed by Mark Landler from Washington, Maggie Haberman from New York, Kirk Semple from Mexico City and Catherine Porter from Toronto.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Has the Opportunity to Fix Penn Station, but Will He?", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookAlmost every administration has a telltale moment. For Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, it may well have come in 2010, before Bridgegate, when he stopped a plan to build new passenger rail tunnels under the Hudson River, connecting to Pennsylvania Station, claiming they cost New Jersey residents too dearly. In that one decision, he seemed to prove what critics would later say: He put shortsighted politics before constituents, and himself above public welfare.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo may now have reached a similar juncture, and it also involves Penn Station. His legacy may rest on how he handles the crisis there.The urgency to fix the station has reached a peak. But this also creates a great occasion to get something done \u2014 something grander than Mr. Cuomo\u2019s current plan, a project born of political expediency.About 650,000 daily passengers, a number equivalent to the entire population of Boston (and steadily rising), use the station entombed below Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. They ride Amtrak, the Long Island Rail Road, the subways and New Jersey Transit.According to an Empire State Development study, however, only about 20 percent of Penn Station\u2019s daily commuters will end up using the Farley building. Most will still suffer the existing chaos. And Farley does almost nothing to prepare for the still-needed new Hudson tunnels. In effect, the governor wants to slap a two-car garage onto a dilapidated split-level and declare the property good as new.There is a history of politics trumping responsible decision-making when it comes to regional infrastructure. After 9/11, George E. Pataki, New York\u2019s former Republican governor, steered plans for rebuilding the World Trade Center in the wrong direction to suit his own White House dreams. Given the choice to do the right thing for Lower Manhattan or do something quickly, he repeatedly chose short-term gain over long-term vision.Now it seems to be Mr. Cuomo\u2019s turn. His Farley renovation is a step in the right direction. But he has brushed off more sweeping proposals that might tackle once and for all the whole panoply of problems that plague Penn Station.It is widely known, for example, that Vornado Realty Trust, a major developer that jointly won the bid to redevelop Farley with Related Companies, has spent years working with architects, planners and city officials on ways to improve public spaces, circulation and safety in and around Penn Station, where the firm owns a great deal of property. Vornado played a role in having the city create a pedestrian plaza on 33rd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues \u2014 a highly popular move and boon to the area.Vornado also came up with a design for a new entrance to Penn Station along 33rd Street. Those who have seen the plan describe dramatically increased space for passengers to access and exit the hub where congestion is the worst. At the same time, the proposal is said to bring natural light pouring down to the underground dungeon, widening a major, crowded corridor for commuters, and helping orient travelers now lost in a low, miserable, windowless warren.But the governor has declined even to make public Vornado\u2019s proposal or one reportedly submitted to him by JDS Development Group, another real estate company. His fix for the existing trouble beneath the Garden widens that same underground corridor \u2014 but without making it any easier for people to get in or out of the station, a root cause of overcrowding and stampedes. Instead of natural light, he envisions LED screens on the ceiling, displaying puffy clouds and blue skies.As Vishaan Chakrabarti, a New York architect, recently put it: \u201cI think people would rather see an actual blue sky than one on TV.\u201dVornado, according to people who have reviewed its plan, proposed splitting costs between the company and the public. State officials working under Mr. Cuomo have argued that developers making money by leasing retail space at Penn Station should be able to pay for improvements themselves, a concept that smacks of President Trump\u2019s fantasy of the private sector alone solving the nation\u2019s infrastructure crisis.Decades ago, New York lost one of its grand entryways. What if a new one were hiding in plain sight?Mr. Cuomo, as Mr. Christie did by rejecting the tunnels, can insist he is saving the public money and simply being pragmatic in declining Vornado\u2019s more ambitious plan. Companies should contribute their fair share. But the public is mostly paying for the revamp of Farley, which will cost $1.6 billion and still not solve the station\u2019s biggest headaches.But Mr. Cuomo seems to have dropped the ball with the Dolans, too.Gateway is the nation\u2019s most pressing infrastructure project. Millions of lives and a big chunk of the country\u2019s economy depend on it. A chastened Mr. Christie is suddenly singing the tunnels\u2019 praises, whispering their urgency, or so he says, in President Trump\u2019s ear. Steven Roth, the founder and chairman of Vornado, is an old friend and adviser to Mr. Trump on infrastructure. He understands as well as anyone both the need for Gateway and an improved Penn Station.This situation presents Mr. Cuomo with a unique opportunity. Mr. Roth, James L. Dolan and he can tackle the whole of Penn Station. They really don\u2019t need anybody else in the room.They can all benefit by so doing, none more obviously than the New York governor, who could become a true political legend by \u2014 and this is what matters most \u2014 delivering the public what he promised, which Farley alone won\u2019t achieve: a 21st-century station finally worthy of this great city.Advertisement"}

They are also expected to talk, more broadly, about efforts by Mr. Orban\u2019s government to curb the authority of the European Union in areas like immigration and the economy.Vera Jourova, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for justice, said on Monday that, while the law seemed neutral on its face, it was clearly aimed at one university \u2014 a criticism that Mr. Kaye echoed on Tuesday.\u201cThe law must be general, but this is a rather legalistic approach,\u201d Ms. Jourova told reporters, warning that Hungary had also moved \u201cto decrease the power and the influence of civil society\u201d and to inhibit \u201cpolitical pluralism,\u201d or the free expression of multiple and competing positions.Ms. Jourova offered her support to groups resisting the law. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see that the people there are courageous, open, vocal and visible,\u201d she said, a reference to the protests.\u201cI myself do not believe that any administrative steps or infringements or other measures taken by the European Commission in relation or against some member state will help a lot,\u201d Ms. Jourova said, acknowledging that governments in some member states often ignore legal steps taken by Europe for as long as possible.To a large extent, it \u201cmust be the people\u201d who push back against illiberalism, she said.Michael Ignatieff, Central European University\u2019s president and rector, and a scholar of human rights, said in a statement on Monday: \u201cAs I have said before, we are willing to sit down with the Hungarian government to find a solution to enable C.E.U. to stay in Budapest and operate as we have done for 25 years. However, academic freedom is not negotiable. It is a principle that must form the basis of any future agreement.\u201dMr. Orban\u2019s government seems unmoved by the criticism. His allies are not hiding their contempt for Mr. Soros.\u201cGeorge Soros\u2019s thinking on migration is sharply opposed to that of the Hungarian government,\u201d Lajos Kosa, head of Fidesz\u2019s bloc in Parliament, said Tuesday on a morning television show. \u201cWe are saying, \u2018Let\u2019s stop migration,\u2019 and Soros is saying, \u2018Let in as many as possible.\u2019 And he will do everything \u2014 including money and energy \u2014 to destabilize and weaken those governments who oppose his thinking.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

The list-price tuition at these college does indeed run so high, but just a small slice of the population pays the list price. Typically, only families earning at least $200,000 a year fail to qualify for financial aid. For families with middle-class incomes, highly selective colleges are much, much less expensive.The widespread misimpression about the cost of college causes real damage. It leads many middle-class and lower-income families to believe, incorrectly, that college is unaffordable. When they respond by discouraging their child from attending or finishing college, they hurt the child\u2019s long-term economic prospects.The calculator is a joint effort of 15 colleges, including Dartmouth, Pomona, Columbia, Williams, Wellesley, Rice and Colorado College. You use it anonymously, and you answer about six quick questions about your finances, such as your annual income and home ownership status.

I selected Rice as the college. The calculator estimated that this family would have to spend $18,500 a year while receiving a $42,900 scholarship.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Reversals Hint at Wall Street Wing\u2019s Sway in White House", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump made three startling economic policy reversals on Wednesday, stepping away from pledges he made as a candidate and even policies he supported only days ago.Mr. Trump\u2019s latest pronouncements suggest he is moving toward a more mainstream economic approach, although on other issues that he discussed on Wednesday, like a tax overhaul and health care, his policy and strategy appeared muddled.\u201cOne by one, we are keeping our promises \u2014 on the border, on energy, on jobs, on regulations. Big changes are happening.\u201dMr. Trump began the day with an interview with Fox Business Network in which he backed away from the so-called border-adjustment tax favored by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and House Republicans.He also backtracked on his claim last month that he was moving on from his plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act to focus on taxes. Now he is again putting health care first.In an interview published by The Journal midday, Mr. Trump revealed his softer approach to China \u2014 the about-face coming less than a week after meeting with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping \u2014 and made another reversal on health care.Mr. Trump said the threat to withhold subsidies was a way to force Democrats to negotiate with him over the future of the Affordable Care Act.In the Journal interview, Mr. Trump said that \u201cDemocrats will start calling me and negotiating\u201d because they want to avoid any interruption of the \u201ccost-sharing\u201d subsidies, which reduce out-of-pocket costs for seven million low-income people.On Monday, the Department of Health and Human Services had issued a statement saying that \u201cthe cost-sharing subsidies will be funded\u201d while a federal appeals court weighed the legality of the payments.Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks coincided with a letter in which doctors, hospitals, insurance companies and employers pleaded with him and with Congress to help stabilize insurance markets by authorizing a continuation of the subsidies.\u201cTime is short and action is needed,\u201d said the letter, sent Wednesday by eight groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association.The president\u2019s comments on Wednesday recalled his reaction when Republican leaders pulled a bill to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law from the House floor last month.Mr. Trump predicted then that \u201cDemocrats will come to us\u201d in an effort to save the law, which he said was imploding. They did not.To make the muddy waters even murkier, Mr. Trump took his plans to rewrite the tax code into uncharted territory when he threw cold water on the border adjustment tax that is the linchpin of the tax reform plan.After months of waffling on that tax, he instead called for a new \u201creciprocal tax\u201d that appears to be a different kind of levy on imports.\u201cI don\u2019t like the word adjustment because our country gets taken advantage of, to use a nice term, by every other country in the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the Fox Business interview. \u201cSo when I hear border adjustment, adjustment means we lose.\u201dHe added: \u201cI love the idea of reciprocal. You can call it a reciprocal or a matching tax or a mirror tax.\u201dThe notion left tax experts scratching their heads. \u201cI\u2019m genuinely confused,\u201d said Itai Grinberg, a tax expert at Georgetown University\u2019s law school.\u201cIf one imposes a tax that varies based on the country of origin of the good or service, then what one may in substance have is something akin to a country-specific tariff regime.\u201dWhat is clear is that all of the uncertainty surrounding the White House\u2019s economic plans is causing frustration among some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, including those who helped get him elected.Larry Kudlow, the economist who advised Mr. Trump when he was a candidate, panned Mr. Trump\u2019s reciprocal tax idea as a nonsensical approach that would essentially raise taxes.He suggested that the scattershot approach to economic policy coming from the White House was probably because of poor leadership at the National Economic Council, which is led by Gary Cohn, and the diminished role of the Treasury Department, which is steered by Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\u201cIt\u2019s complete chaos,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cIt sows confusion, and people lose confidence. The process is broken.\u201dLast Friday, Mr. Trump named Kevin Hassett, a conservative pro-immigration economist, to lead his Council of Economic Advisers. Ardent supporters worried it was an abandonment of the tough stance he took on the issue during the campaign.Mr. Trump shared few details about how a reciprocal tax would work. It is unclear if, in his thinking, the United States would match tariffs that countries levy on certain American products against other products that those countries produce or if he wants to effectively have a value-added tax with different rates for goods and services from each country.Either way, economists warned that economic effects could be calamitous.\u201cAny economist will tell you that tariffs are often, if not always, self-defeating,\u201d said Michael J.

{"Headline": "What Mississippi Taught Bobby Kennedy About Poverty", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOXFORD, MISS. \u2014 The toddler had no time for this white man in a fine dark suit. Robert Kennedy may have been a former attorney general and the brother of a slain president, but Annie White\u2019s son was focused on the cornbread crumbs scattered on the floor of his dilapidated home in Cleveland, Miss.Mr. Kennedy was in the Mississippi Delta, 50 years ago this week, for a Senate subcommittee examination of War on Poverty programs. While testifying before the panel, Marian Wright, a 27-year-old NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund lawyer, had sounded an alarm: The Delta was in crisis. The senator decided to see for himself.What he saw on his widely publicized trip shocked a nation used to postwar abundance. Americans would be even more shocked to know that 50 years later, the Delta remains desperately poor. In the three counties Senator Kennedy visited, poverty rates for children younger than 18 still hover around 50 percent. Too many families there face a hard knot of problems: food deserts, failing schools, poor infrastructure, unhealthy populations, shrinking economies, the long shadow of segregation and discrimination.It\u2019s easy to conclude that little has changed since Mr. Kennedy\u2019s trip. But a closer look reveals bright spots. Many of the programs that are working well align with Mr. Kennedy\u2019s core convictions about how to improve the lives of poor people.Mr. Kennedy was convinced, especially after his time in Mississippi, that poverty programs are most successful when they are informed by the voices of poor people themselves. He trusted the families he met there, and later in Appalachia, blighted city neighborhoods in the Northeast and the fields of California, to know what would help them the most.Senator Kennedy\u2019s trip to the Delta has become a touchstone for liberal politicians, but he never said government had all the solutions. Instead, he envisioned businesses and charities working with government to provide jobs and strengthen poor neighborhoods in rural areas. He already had a model: In 1966, he worked with other New York leaders on the Bedford-Stuyvesant Renewal and Rehabilitation Corporation, one of the first of its kind.Robert Kennedy was a data guy; he wanted to see hard numbers when searching for solutions. He became brusque when officials couldn\u2019t tell him, for example, how many job-training graduates in Greenville, Miss., had actually found jobs.The report, which includes several Delta counties, is a boon for researchers and program heads. Data for rural communities is hard to find, but essential for getting aid; now, advocates can use this report to support grant applications and push for better policies.In spite of these bright spots, there are still threatening clouds. For many poor families in the Delta, the federal and state safety net, limited as it is \u2014 Social Security, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, free school breakfasts and lunches \u2014 provides most of the meals their children eat. And in the three counties that Senator Kennedy visited, one in three people run out of food each month.Mr. Kennedy\u2019s insights from his trip are as relevant today as they were in 1967, and it\u2019s no coincidence that the programs that follow his lead are some of the region\u2019s most successful. The challenge today is how to grow them and how to bring those insights to programs that are not having the impact they could.If he returned to the Delta today, Mr. Kennedy would cheer the advances but be dismayed at how hard advocates must fight to maintain that limited progress. And his heart would break to see there are still so many children in the Delta, and across America, who, like Annie White\u2019s boy, must grasp for every crumb.An opinion article on April 12, about Robert Kennedy\u2019s 1967 trip to Mississippi, misstated the year that he worked on the Bedford-Stuyvesant Renewal and Rehabilitation Corporation. It was 1966, not 1964.Advertisement"}

By those measures, Tesla \u2014 a company that lost $773 million last year \u2014 is indeed off the charts.Tesla\u2019s market value of nearly $49 billion is not only higher than that of Ford, which earned nearly $11 billion in profit last year, but is within easy striking distance of General Motors, which earned $9.4 billion.In contrast to Tesla, Ford and G.M. shares have dropped recently on fears that auto sales have hit a cyclical peak. Ford and G.M. executives wouldn\u2019t comment on Tesla\u2019s stock surge, but it\u2019s easy to imagine they\u2019d be tearing their hair out in frustration.\u201cIt\u2019s nuts,\u201d Bruce Greenwald, a professor at Columbia Business School and an expert in value investing, said of Tesla\u2019s stock price. \u201cInvestors believe it\u2019s going to dominate a market that no company has ever dominated before.\u201dBut Tesla is not a stock, or a company, that is measured by the past, as Mr. Musk is well aware. He also wrote on Twitter that stock prices represent \u201crisk-adjusted future cash flows\u201d \u2014 and Tesla is about nothing if not a utopian future of safe, reliable, powerful, self-driving electric vehicles powered by solar-fed batteries that are easy on the environment.In that regard, Tesla has ascended into a rarefied realm of so-called story stocks \u2014 companies that have so bewitched investors that their stock prices are impervious to any traditional valuation measures because their stories are simply too good not to be true.And to the dismay of short-sellers, who believe they have ample rational reasons to bet against such stocks, their share prices can stay in the stratosphere for years, even decades.These story stocks \u2014 the term was coined by James Montier, a value investor and a member of the asset allocation team at the investment management firm GMO \u2014 are relatively rare, but hardly new. Amazon\u2019s stock surged for decades even without any meaningful profits. A more recent example is Snapchat\u2019s parent, Snap, which is racking up large losses while its stock trades at an astronomical price-to-sales ratio of nearly 50, far higher than Tesla\u2019s 7. (Ford\u2019s, by comparison, is 0.3.)Amazon and Snap both have stories that are compelling for many investors: Amazon has transformed retailing and is destined to dominate it. Snap is reinventing communication, at least for millennials and those even younger.Early investors in Uber and Airbnb, though they remain private companies, have valued them at stratospheric multiples based largely on the notion that Uber will transform and dominate local transportation and Airbnb will revolutionize the hotel industry.For story stocks, any development that lends credence to the story can cause a surge in already high valuations. This week Tesla reported quarterly sales that were modestly above expectations, and the stock surged 7 percent in a day. Tesla shares are up nearly 40 percent this year, even though many investors considered them overvalued in January.Ron Baron, the billionaire investor and founder of Baron Capital, disclosed last year that he owned about 1.6 million Tesla shares. He predicted on CNBC in February that Tesla shares would quadruple by 2020 and triple again by 2025. By then he expects Tesla to become the largest company in the world as measured by market capitalization.For all the excitement and promise surrounding such companies, there are many cautionary tales.\u201cStories are great before bed, but are disastrous as a stock-selection technique,\u201d Mr. Montier wrote in his 2009 book \u201cValue Investing: Tools and Techniques for Intelligent Investment.\u201d If something is expensive based on traditional valuation metrics, he said, \u201cyou had better believe its story, as that is all you have.\u201d(A Tesla spokeswoman said Mr. Musk could not be reached for comment.)Various studies have shown that stocks with high price-to-sales ratios, on average, significantly underperform market averages. For every Tesla or Uber, there\u2019s a Valeant Pharmaceuticals or Theranos \u2014 two story stocks that seduced an astounding array of prominent investors and supporters based on stories that did turn out to be too good to be true.And while many investors\u2019 memories tend to be short, the so-called dot-com bubble in the late 1990s spawned scores of story stocks, nearly all of them now worthless and forgotten.Still, Mr. Montier acknowledged, \u201cStories are compelling.\u201d They appeal to intuition rather than reason. \u201cBut perhaps investors would be well advised to follow Odysseus\u2019s example of putting beeswax in his crew\u2019s ears and tying himself to the mast in order to avoid the disastrous, but oh so desirable, call of the Siren song.\u201dWill Tesla be one of the rare exceptions and, as Mr. Baron has predicted, emerge as the world\u2019s most valuable company?The company has won over many skeptics with its near-flawless execution, so far, and the high quality of its vehicles and high levels of consumer satisfaction. It is no longer a start-up: It delivered 25,000 vehicles in the last quarter. It is on track to achieve economies of scale, and the company says the gross margin on each vehicle is above 20 percent, far higher than the industry average. That could drive enormous future profits.But that\u2019s not the Tesla story \u2014 or stories \u2014 investors are betting on.Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley automotive analyst who is hardly a starry-eyed optimist about the industry, upgraded Tesla shares to overweight in January. He singles out the company\u2019s new autonomous driving technology as a compelling safety feature that will significantly reduce occupant and pedestrian injuries and fatalities. This week he said he expected \u201cvehicle safety to be the primary differentiator in Tesla\u2019s upcoming product offensive,\u201d referring to the eagerly anticipated introduction of Tesla\u2019s new, lower-price Model 3, which will be equipped with the new technology.That Tesla is an all-electric, environmentally friendly, nonfossil-fuel vehicle \u2014 the story that once excited investors \u2014 is barely mentioned anymore.Even more futuristic is the idea that Tesla cars will be entirely self-driving, able to cruise streets nearly full time (except when they are being charged at Tesla\u2019s high-speed battery-charging stations). In this vision, Tesla owners will share their vehicles with Tesla when not using them, and during that time they will ferry other passengers, serving as Tesla\u2019s version of Uber. Thus Tesla will disrupt Uber\u2019s nascent market dominance.And Tesla is no longer seen just as a vehicle manufacturer. With its solar and battery technologies, it is in a position to dominate two other enormous industry segments. Tesla \u201cis reinventing the electric grid,\u201d as Mr. Baron said on CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s a bigger opportunity than cars.\u201dEven if all that comes to pass, it may not be enough to justify Tesla\u2019s valuation unless it can sustain a competitive advantage over time, as Mr. Greenwald, the value investing expert, put it. Tesla is spending heavily on research and development, and perhaps its technology will be difficult or impossible for others to replicate. The established automakers have had years to catch up to or overtake Tesla\u2019s Model S, with a conspicuous lack of success.But for committed value investors, the writing is on the wall: \u201cIs Tesla going to dominate its industry? That\u2019s the key question,\u201d Mr. Greenwald said. \u201cWhen it comes to the global auto industry, no one ever has, and in all likelihood, no one ever will.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.M.T., With Few Defenders, Is Newly Targeted in Trump Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byAt its most basic, the A.M.T.\u2019s goal is simple: In a tax system with enough loopholes to fill a macram\u00e9 tapestry, the idea was to ensure that the richest taxpayers were not able to skip out on paying altogether. A version was introduced in 1969 after Congress discovered that \u2014 are you ready? \u2014 155 taxpayers with taxable incomes over $200,000 paid no tax.The minimum tax has gone through several iterations, but the essential intent has not changed: to limit the amount of deductions available to the richest Americans. Over the years, though, inflation has eaten away at its effectiveness \u2014 as has the exclusion of interest and dividend income, which insulates the richest Americans.Yet while policy makers on both sides of the aisle want to get rid of the alternative tax, their proposed solutions would have opposite effects. President Trump and congressional Republicans want to eliminate the alternative minimum tax in the context of lowering tax rates \u2014 especially for those at the top of the income ladder. The richest would benefit the most. By contrast, Senator Sanders\u2019s plan to ditch the A.M.T. is part of an effort to raise rates on the wealthiest Americans.What is interesting about the impact on Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 return, however, is that it does not illustrate either side\u2019s criticisms. Rather, it seems to be a rare case where the alternative minimum tax functioned exactly as it was meant to: to require a wealthy multimillionaire to pay more of a fair share. In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, he paid 25 percent of $153 million in taxable income instead of the less than 4 percent that he would have paid without it.\u201cTrump seems to have been hit by the A.M.T.,\u201d Mr. Gale said. \u201cAt least in that one case, it seems to have worked as intended.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Share Sale Keeps the Automaker a Family Affair", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byFerdinand Pi\u00ebch, a former chief executive of Volkswagen who was a dominant presence at the carmaker for more than two decades, has agreed to sell most of his 15 percent stake in the family holding company to his relatives rather than to an outside investor. The stake was valued at more than $1 billion.But critics of the way the family has overseen Volkswagen may see the deal as a missed opportunity to bring in new viewpoints and shake up the carmaker\u2019s insular company culture. The indirect stake in Volkswagen would have been attractive to Chinese investors, among others.\u201cThe transfer underlines the commitment of the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families as co-owners of Porsche Automobil Holding SE and Volkswagen,\u201d the holding company said in a statement.Mr. Pi\u00ebch, who will turn 80 on April 17, is regarded as an automotive genius who oversaw Volkswagen\u2019s rise to become the largest carmaker in Europe by far.The scandal has cost Volkswagen tens of billions of dollars in legal settlements and fines and focused attention on the controlling families, all of whom are descendants of Ferdinand Porsche, who designed the Volkswagen Beetle for Adolf Hitler.The Pi\u00ebch and the Porsche families have been reluctant to appoint outsiders to positions in top management at Volkswagen, opening the company to criticism that it remains dominated by people who were in positions of power as the wrongdoing was unfolding.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.The management of the holding company and Volkswagen are closely intertwined. Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, chairman of the Volkswagen supervisory board, is also chairman of the Porsche Holding management board. Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive of Volkswagen, is a member of the Porsche Holding management board. Another member of the holding company\u2019s board is Manfred D\u00f6ss, Volkswagen\u2019s chief counsel and the person who has overseen efforts to contain the myriad legal challenges that arose from the scandal.Mr. Pi\u00ebch will retain a small stake in Porsche Holding, but he is unlikely to play an active role in Volkswagen, a company that sometimes seemed to be practically created in his image.Mr. Pi\u00ebch will remain a member of the Porsche Holding supervisory board at least until the transfer of shares is complete, the company said. It did not say how much the other members of the family were paying for his shares.After joining Volkswagen\u2019s Audi unit as a junior executive in the 1970s, Mr. Pi\u00ebch rose to become chief of the brand and established it as a rival to Mercedes-Benz and BMW. He became chief executive of Volkswagen in 1993 and led the company from the brink of bankruptcy to dominance of the European car market and near parity with Toyota, which competes with Volkswagen for the title of world\u2019s largest automaker.Mr. Pi\u00ebch was also a force in the development of diesel for passenger cars. Diesel engines offered better fuel economy than gasoline motors but also produced more nitrogen oxide emissions, a major component of smog. As emissions standards became more stringent, Volkswagen engineers struggled to build compliant engines.In 2006, according to admissions the company has made in court, Volkswagen decided to install software in cars sold in the United States that could sense when official tests were underway and temporarily activate equipment to control emissions. The equipment was not capable of meeting pollution standards during regular driving. The authoritarian, unforgiving company culture that Mr. Pi\u00ebch created is seen as one of the elements that led Volkswagen employees to cheat.Mr. Pi\u00ebch became the chairman of Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board in 2002 after retiring as chief executive, but he was forced out in 2015, a few months before the emissions cheating became public.A grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, Mr. Pi\u00ebch has had tense relations with other members of the family for decades, and his departure could make it easier to achieve harmony and pave the way for a younger generation to assume more influence.The sale of Mr. Pi\u00ebch\u2019s share is likely to provoke speculation that he might invest the money in some other way in order to retain influence in the industry to which he has devoted his life. Mr. Pi\u00ebch has given no public indication of what he might do with the money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Low-Inflation World May Be Sticking Around Longer Than Expected", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThere is a worldwide glut that includes oil wells, steel plants and eager would-be workers, and it will take more than a United States presidential election and a few months of solid global growth to fix it.That, in a sentence, is the reality that haunts the world economy a third of the way through 2017.It appeared more of the same was on the way \u2014 or at least that was the future that global investors started to account for. Bond prices last summer suggested consumer prices in the United States were expected to rise only 1.4 percent annually over the next five years; that soared to 1.96 percent in late January.But now that assessment has partly reversed, with the same measure having fallen to 1.85 percent inflation expected over the next half-decade. Measures of core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy, have basically been stable for months. The one the Fed watches most closely, the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, has been at 1.75 percent for three straight months.A big part of what has changed is that it looks clearer that the rise in inflation over the winter was driven by a one-time recovery in oil prices from lows in early 2016.Oil prices have stabilized \u2014 a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude has hovered between about $48 and $54 since the start of December, up from as low as $26 in February 2016. There are few signs that oil will keep feeding a rise in overall prices in the months ahead.Beyond oil patches, the underlying global dynamics are pushing in the direction of lower prices. There appears to be more worldwide capacity for major commodities like steel and aluminum than there is demand, in part because of China\u2019s sheltering of state-run enterprises from the vicissitudes of the marketplace. The integration of highly populous countries like China and India into the world economy continues apace, creating what may be a glut of workers.Essentially, all the factors that have created downward pressure on prices throughout the 21st century continue to do so, regardless of what President Trump does or doesn\u2019t do.Moreover, some of the Trump administration plans that seemed to point toward higher inflation and higher interest rates are looking like vaporware. A large-scale infrastructure investment program, for example, could push both interest rates and inflation higher in the United States. But so far the administration\u2019s focus on infrastructure has not translated to specific policy ideas.The combination of powerful long-term forces and policy gridlock in Washington means that we probably won\u2019t see some magical moment when the low-inflation monster has been vanquished. Rather, the world is going to have to keep climbing out the hard way.\u201cWe have turned the corner on low inflation,\u201d said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, describing that as his baseline expectation. \u201cBut future increases will be gradual and not without occasional setbacks. There are significant risks in both directions.\u201dIf the Trump administration delivers a bigger fiscal boost than is now priced into markets, that could fuel higher inflation; an unexpected spike in commodity prices would do the same. Geopolitical instability, such as open conflict with North Korea, could work in the opposite direction and push the world economy back toward deflation.But absent something surprising, it looks as if the most likely course is a lengthy grinding process: The global demand for goods and services slowly rises until the supply glut gradually gives way to tighter labor markets, and the world economy becomes constrained by its industrial capacity.That is already well underway in the United States, with its 4.5 percent unemployment rate and rising wages. If the economy works the way the textbooks say it should, that should feed back into higher incomes, higher consumer demand and higher prices in the months ahead.It\u2019s a reminder that many of the biggest forces in the economy don\u2019t announce themselves with an election or a central banker\u2019s announcement, but through shifts in the underlying forces that make the global economy tick. And those don\u2019t change overnight.Advertisement"}

He wants recommendations on whether any of those large tracts should be scaled back by presidential authority or by Congress.Mr. Trump, signing the order at the Interior Department, described the designations as a \u201cmassive federal land grab\u201d and ordered the agency to review and reverse some of them.\u201cIt\u2019s time to end these abuses and return control to the people, the people of Utah, the people of all of the states, the people of the United States,\u201d the president said.National monuments are designated by presidents under a century-old law called the Antiquities Act. What does the law do, what changes in it does President Trump want and what lands might be affected?The law was enacted in 1906 to prevent looting of Indian artifacts from archaeological sites. The act has mostly been used since then by presidents to turn public land into national monuments protected forever from commercial development or future mineral exploitation.Most legal scholars and historians agree that the Antiquities Act does not give the president the authority to revoke previous national monument designations, but a president can change the boundaries of a national monument. Congress can convert a national monument into a national park, which it has done many times.Some designations are controversial, as was Mr. Obama\u2019s designation of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah in December. Republicans argued that it would hurt the local economy, but Mr. Miller said wilderness areas can bring in tourists who support local businesses.Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, said he would provide an interim review of the monuments in 45 days and would make specific recommendations about Bears Ears.Ms. Dale said that reducing these monuments or changing them \u201cwould have a chilling effect on tribal federal relations when it comes to protecting landscapes.\u201dIf existing national monuments are reduced in size, it could benefit extractive industries like oil and gas, mining, logging, as well as ranching, Mr. Miller said, because the government could grant more leases on federal land. Given the Trump administration\u2019s recent actions \u2014 including lifting the moratorium on drilling on federal lands and the obligation to limit methane emissions on public lands \u2014 officials might be eyeing new fossil fuel leases on previously protected land, though Mr. Zinke said he was not predisposed to make any such recommendation about the monument land.Mr. Zinke said that he has heard claims that some monument designations have ended in \u201clost wages, lost jobs and reduced public access.\u201d But he added that he believed \u201csome jobs probably have been created by recreational opportunities.\u201d\u201cNo one loves their public lands more than I,\u201d Mr. Zinke said. \u201cYou can love them as much, but not more than I do.\u201dFollow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Poses Biggest Test Yet for Trump\u2019s Brand of Nationalism", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump swept into the White House in January, some of his advisers gleefully predicted that his victory would set off a populist wave across Europe, scattering mainstream parties on the left and right and wedding Europeans to the same nationalist ideology that Mr. Trump espoused in the United States.With far-right parties then on the rise across the Continent, it did not seem that far-fetched a proposition.\u201cThe people of France will not take much more of this,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWill have a big effect on presidential election!\u201dThe White House insisted the president was not trying to tilt the outcome of an election abroad that includes a nationalist candidate. Officials said he was merely extrapolating from his own experience: In late 2015, Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy got a propulsive lift from fears of terrorism in the aftermath of deadly terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif.But Mr. Trump always viewed his victory as part of a global populist movement. His election came just months after Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, commonly known as Brexit. Far-right parties seemed to be on the rise in Austria, the Netherlands and even Germany, where nationalist parties had failed for decades to gain a foothold.The big prize was France. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front party, has a credible chance of winning the presidency, running on an anti-immigrant platform that echoes Mr. Trump\u2019s.Ms. Le Pen still has a chance of winning. But France\u2019s presidential election has become a fragmented affair, with her and three other candidates \u2014 a conventional conservative; a centrist, a former banker; and a rising leftist \u2014 all vying to emerge from the pack in a campaign that has been driven as much by concerns over the economy as terrorism and security. Voters will choose among 11 candidates in the first round of national voting on Sunday.Moreover, Mr. Trump is unpopular in France, and as a result, Ms. Le Pen does not invoke his name on the campaign trail, even if his campaign is in some ways a blueprint for hers.Ms. Le Pen seized on the attack to turn the election into a referendum on what she calls \u201cradical Islam.\u201dFears about Mr. Trump\u2019s influence over elections in Europe deepened after the disclosure that Breitbart News, the far-right website formerly run by the president\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, planned to open offices in Paris and Berlin. (Mr. Bannon has cut his ties with Breitbart, though he continues to talk to its journalists. While many are convinced that the White House exerts influence over its coverage, the website has also been critical of the Trump administration, angering Mr. Bannon in at least one case.)There is little evidence the White House has tried to influence the election in France, beyond Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post. Even that, the White House argued, was simply the president acting as a political analyst.\u201cMajor events have, clearly, effects on voters\u2019 attitudes,\u201d said the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to weigh in. Let the voters of France decide this Sunday what direction they want their country to go in.\u201dAmerican presidents generally avoid meddling too obviously in the politics of other countries, though there is plenty of precedent for their trying to influence outcomes in less obvious ways.Even President Barack Obama, who tried to avoid being accused of meddling, got into trouble when he warned Britain, before the referendum, that it would go to the end of the line in future trade negotiations with the United States if it voted to leave the European Union.\u201cThey want France to be afraid,\u201d Mr. Macron said of the terrorists, sounding a lot like Mr. Obama.In France, where political experts and pollsters were struggling to gauge the consequences of Thursday\u2019s attack on the psyche of voters, Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter message was expected to carry little weight.\u201cIt\u2019s nonexistent,\u201d said Thomas Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, a political scientist and lecturer at Sciences Po, a political science institute in Paris. Voters who would possibly be influenced by Mr. Trump\u2019s views were \u201cvery politicized,\u201d he said, and were probably already voting for Ms. Le Pen.None of the presidential candidates, nor other major French politicians, reacted to Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post, and it was barely mentioned by French Twitter users, said Guilhem Fouetillou, the head of Linkfluence, which monitors the impact of social media services.\u201cIt mostly has Americans reacting,\u201d he said.Benoit Morenne contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

As he looks ahead to securing a second five-year term at the Communist Party Congress in the fall, Mr. Xi appears to have none.When it comes to economic policy, though, Mr. Xi hasn\u2019t been nearly as tough and adventurous as he has on the political front. Understanding why provides insight into the enduring weaknesses of Mr. Xi and the Communist Party: For all of its success, the economy remains an uneasy hybrid of Mao and markets that is difficult to recalibrate without substantial risk to single-party rule.The Chinese economy has developed great strengths that have allowed it to defy the doomsayers since the 1990s. Property rights have been liberalized to permit homeownership, and behind the party\u2019s formidable internet firewall, entrepreneurs have built a politics-free, app-friendly economy that even apparatchiks can like.Still, despite the private sector\u2019s growth, the state remains at the heart of China\u2019s economy, accounting for at least one third of industrial output, much of it from companies that struggle to stay open on commercial grounds alone.Keeping alive many of the so-called zombie companies has a huge cost, for China and the rest of the world. They not only are a drag on the financial system, which has to roll over their loans to keep them afloat, but they also still keep money out of the hands of households and in the hands of the state.In place of consumption, the system retains a bias toward investment, and along with it, overcapacity, which then spills out into the global economy.China\u2019s zombie companies are not generally household names. They are usually smaller businesses, away from the thriving coastal areas, in the northern and central provinces, clustered in industries like steel, cement, coal, metals and glass.\u201cThe more they lose, the more they can borrow \u2014 that\u2019s the only way they can survive,\u201d wrote the economist He Fan, referring to zombie companies, who estimates that at least 10 percent of all locally listed companies are like the \u201cwalking dead.\u201dThe determination to keep the state sector going underpins the economy\u2019s chronic ailments: an addiction to debt to maintain high growth and the administrative state\u2019s reliance on the state sector for stimulus when private investment falls.Over the past year, at a time when the economy was slowing, the state sector has been resurgent, with investment up nearly 25 percent year-on-year, while private companies managed a rise of only roughly 3 percent.Mr. Xi has displayed little stomach for taking on the state sector. The most obvious explanation is ideological: As a career Communist, he retains a bias toward state ownership as a form of political control.The state sector is a powerful special interest in its own right, entangled deeply in the political and economic systems in ways that make it harder to challenge and scale back.A party cadre might be running a state-owned oil company one day, and then be appointed as a provincial governor the next. The top executives of telecom and energy companies have swapped jobs overnight in recent years at the party\u2019s direction, the American equivalent of the C.E.O.s of Sprint and Verizon waking up in the morning running one company and going to bed in charge of its competitor.Top executives of major state enterprises also retain positions on the party\u2019s central committee, which automatically gives them a seat at the table on big economic decisions.Many zombie companies would have closed long ago if China had a financial system that allocated capital according to an enterprise\u2019s viability. But for Mr. Xi and the Chinese political leadership, commercial viability is just one consideration. Just as important is the political stability of the localities in which they reside.Some of Mr. Xi\u2019s supporters argue he has subordinated economic reform to party consolidation and anticorruption in his first term for good reason. By building a stronger and cleaner Communist Party, they say, Mr. Xi is laying the foundation for substantive economic reform in his second term.But party consolidation does not bode well for economic or legal reform, whatever the sequencing may be. The opposite is the case. Mr. Xi\u2019s party consolidation instinctively pushes economic policy-making in a more conservative direction.Put another way, Mr. Xi is not softening the party up to share power more broadly beyond the anointed few. Ahead of a second five-year term, due to start at the end of the year, he is hardening the system to make sure that it survives into the future in the elite\u2019s hands, an outcome that will only hurt the economy.Ultimately, Mr. Xi will need to decide whether he wants to be a political strongman or an economic reformer. He can be one or the other, but not both.Richard McGregor is the author, most recently, of the forthcoming \u201cAsia\u2019s Reckoning: China, Japan and the Fate of U.S. Power in the Pacific Century.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Loans \u2018Designed to Fail\u2019: States Say Navient Preyed on Students", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byAshley Hardin dreamed of being a professional photographer \u2014 glamorous shoots, perhaps some exotic travel. So in 2006, she enrolled in the Brooks Institute of Photography and borrowed more than $150,000 to pay for what the school described as a pathway into an industry clamoring for its graduates.\u201cBrooks was advertised as the most prestigious photography school on the West Coast,\u201d Ms. Hardin said. \u201cI wanted to learn from the best of the best.\u201dMs. Hardin did not realize that she had taken out high-risk private loans in pursuit of a low-paying career. But her lender, SLM Corporation, better known as Sallie Mae, knew all of that, government lawyers say \u2014 and made the loans anyway.\u201cThese loans were designed to fail,\u201d said Shannon Smith, chief of the consumer protection division at the Washington State attorney general\u2019s office.New details unsealed last month in the state lawsuits against Navient shed light on how Sallie Mae used private subprime loans \u2014 some of which it expected to default at rates as high as 92 percent \u2014 as a tool to build its business relationships with colleges and universities across the country. From the outset, the lender knew that many borrowers would be unable to repay, government lawyers say, but it still made the loans, ensnaring students in debt traps that have dogged them for more than a decade.While these risky loans were a bad deal for students, they were a boon for Sallie Mae. The private loans were \u2014 as Sallie Mae itself put it \u2014 a \u201cbaited hook\u201d that the lender used to reel in more federally guaranteed loans, according to an internal strategy memo cited in the Illinois lawsuit.The attorneys general in Illinois and Washington \u2014 backed by a coalition of those in 27 other states, who participated in a three-year investigation of student lending abuses \u2014 want those private loans forgiven.In a pair of cases that could affect hundreds of thousands of borrowers, they have sued Navient. The lawsuits cover private subprime loans made from 2000 to 2009.These cases have parallels to the mortgage crisis that helped drive the American economy into recession, both in scope \u2014 borrowers in the United States owe $1.4 trillion on student loans \u2014 and in the details of the misdeeds claimed. Working together, the lenders and colleges were preying on a vital part of the American dream, the government lawyers say: the belief that higher education can help lift people toward a prosperous future.That was Ms. Hardin\u2019s goal. Today, she is a 33-year-old waitress in Seattle who still owes $150,000 in student loans and pays $1,395 a month, more than her monthly rent, to Navient. If the attorneys general succeed, a chunk of her debt could be erased.\u201cWe have a proven track record of helping millions of Americans access and achieve the benefits of higher education,\u201d said Patricia Nash Christel, a Navient spokeswoman.Sallie Mae said in a statement that Navient \u201chas accepted responsibility for all costs, expenses, losses and remediation arising from this matter.\u201dPerhaps more than any other company, Sallie Mae is synonymous in America with student loans \u2014 and, in the years after the lending boom, crushing student debt.It got its start more than 30 years ago as a government-sponsored enterprise, collecting payments on loans that were backed by a federal guarantee. By the mid-2000s, Sallie Mae had become a for-profit, publicly traded company no longer tied to the government, although it still made most of its money by originating federally guaranteed student loans.But the company also had a sideline in private loans. Those came with higher interest rates and fewer protections for borrowers than the federal loans. And if the borrowers stopped paying, Sallie Mae was stuck with the loss.Private loans were often profitable for the company, but a portion of them \u2014 the riskiest part of Sallie Mae\u2019s portfolio \u2014 were not. The company made subprime loans to students who would not otherwise qualify, including borrowers with poor credit who took out loans to attend schools with high dropout rates.Those subprime loans were a bargaining chip, the government lawyers said, a tool Sallie Mae used to build relationships with schools so that the company could make more federal loans to their students. The federal loans were the real prize, because they came with a built-in safety net: If a borrower defaulted, the government would step in and reimburse the lender for most of its losses.Sallie Mae could afford to absorb the losses from its private loan business as, essentially, a marketing cost of snagging more lucrative loans. In a 2007 internal note, quoted in Illinois\u2019s lawsuit, Sallie Mae described its strategy of using subprime loans to \u201cwin school deals and secure F.F.E.L.P. and standard private volume,\u201d a reference to the Federal Family Education Loan program that generated most of the company\u2019s profits.Illinois filed a lawsuit against Navient, the nation\u2019s largest servicer of student loans, accusing it of extensive mistakes and violations, and of making predatory, subprime loans to borrowers likely to default.Defaults on one set of subprime loan products were between 50 and 92 percent every year from 2000 to 2007, according to Illinois\u2019s lawsuit. Students did not know about the risk, the state said in its lawsuit, but \u201cthis fact was no secret to Sallie Mae.\u201dThose defaults did not discourage Sallie Mae, the lawsuits show. From 2000 to 2006, Sallie Mae increased the number of borrowers with one kind of troubled loan to 43,000 from 165, an increase of some 26,000 percent.Sallie Mae was not the only one with an incentive. The schools themselves often had a reason to push private loans.Under Education Department rules, no more than 90 percent of a school\u2019s tuition payments can come from federal funding. That means at least 10 percent must come from private sources. At for-profit schools, which rely heavily on federal lending, private loans \u2014 even ones to borrowers likely to default \u2014 were crucial for staying under the threshold.Some schools made deals with Sallie Mae to subsidize its losses, regulatory filings show. The owner of the Brooks Institute of Photography, Career Education Corporation, once one of the largest for-profit chains in the country, had a typical arrangement: From 2002 to 2006, it agreed to repay 20 percent of Sallie Mae\u2019s losses. In 2007, it increased its subsidy to 25 percent.The company\u2019s chief financial officer replied, \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely our intent.\u201dAs defaults piled up and heads rolled \u2014 Sallie Mae\u2019s chief executive stepped down \u2014 Sallie Mae abandoned its riskiest practices. In early 2008, the company ended its subprime lending and told at least seven major operators of for-profit schools, including Career Education, that it would stop making private loans to many of their students.In 2014, Sallie Mae and Navient broke apart, and Navient retained the troubled loans the company had originated years earlier.But for the students, containing the damage was not so easy.Lenders can hound students for payments on their debt, or sell it to a collection firm, long after they have written the loan off as soured debt. And because student loans cannot typically be wiped away through bankruptcy, many borrowers have no choice but to continue chipping away at their balance, no matter how dire their financial situation.Ms. Christel, Navient\u2019s spokeswoman, defended the company\u2019s lending practices as typical for the time.\u201cHindsight is always 20/20,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have called for tools to improve upfront borrowing decisions, and we also support bankruptcy reform that would allow struggling borrowers the option to discharge federal and private student loans in bankruptcy after a good-faith effort to repay.\u201dCareer Education did not respond to requests for comment.The school that Tom Panzica, 42, attended shut down nine years ago, but he is still carrying $6,000 in debt for a degree that turned out to be useless. Every month, he sends $100 to Navient.Mr. Panzica, a firefighter in Chicago, enrolled in Medical Careers Institute to learn sonography. But the school offered no clinical training \u2014 and it neglected to tell its students that without that training, they would not be allowed to take the industry\u2019s licensing exam.After Mr. Panzica graduated, he discovered that he had none of the qualifications needed to land a job.Medical Careers closed in 2008, and a group of students sued, accusing it of making false claims. The case was settled. Mr. Panzica received around $3,000, less than half of what he had borrowed from Sallie Mae to pay his tuition.Several students, including Mr. Panzica, then sued Sallie Mae, arguing that it was unfair to expect repayment on a loan made for fraudulent goods. The case went to arbitration, where the students lost.For Adam Wolf, the lawyer who represented the students, the decision still rankles. \u201cSallie Mae facilitated the fraud,\u201d Mr. Wolf said.To Ms. Hardin, that is deeply frustrating. After eight years of payments, her balance has dropped by only $1,000.\u201cI\u2019ve cried on the phone several times,\u201d Ms. Hardin said of her regular fights with Navient.When her husband, a chef, saw that Washington\u2019s attorney general had sued Navient, he asked Ms. Hardin what she would do if the case somehow led to her loans being wiped away.Again, she teared up. Since graduating, she has never had any spare cash to travel, or save or plan any further than the next month\u2019s loan bill.\u201cWe want to open a sandwich shop,\u201d Ms. Hardin said. \u201cThe money could be going toward that.\u201dSusan C.

{"Headline": "New Technology Is Built on a \u2018Stack.\u2019 Is That the Best Way to Understand Everything Else, Too?", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsNearly three decades later, now that computing has become truly ubiquitous, its metaphors are deployed without a moment\u2019s thought. We don\u2019t just talk intuitively about the ways in which people are \u201cprogrammed\u201d \u2014 we talk about our emotional \u201cbandwidth\u201d and look for clever ways to \u201chack\u201d our daily routines. These metaphors have developed right alongside the technology from which they\u2019re derived, starting with hardware and then moving to software, apps and networks. Now we\u2019ve arrived at a tempting concept that promises to contain all of this: the stack. These days, corporate managers talk about their solution stacks and idealize \u201cfull stack\u201d companies; athletes share their recovery stacks and muscle-building stacks; devotees of so-called smart drugs obsessively modify their brain-enhancement stacks to address a seemingly infinite range of flaws and desires.\u201cStack,\u201d in technological terms, can mean a few different things, but the most relevant usage grew from the start-up world: A stack is a collection of different pieces of software that are being used together to accomplish a task. A smartphone\u2019s software stack, for instance, could be described as a layered structure: There\u2019s the low-level code that controls the device\u2019s hardware, and then, higher up, its basic operating system, and then, even higher, the software you use to message a friend or play a game. An individual application\u2019s stack might include the programming languages used to build it, the services used to connect it to other apps or the service that hosts it online; a \u201cfull stack\u201d developer would be someone proficient at working with each layer of that system, from bottom to top.The stack isn\u2019t just a handy concept for visualizing how technology works. For many companies, the organizing logic of the software stack becomes inseparable from the logic of the business itself. The system that powers Snapchat, for instance, sits on top of App Engine, a service owned by Google; to the extent that Snapchat even exists as a service, it is as a stack of different elements. \u201cWhat you end up with is entire companies being built on a set of software tools and services,\u201d says Yonas Beshawred, whose own company, StackShare, lets tech professionals publish their companies\u2019 stacks and see what others are using, comparing technology the way hobbyists might compare gear. \u201cYou can think of them as Lego blocks.\u201d A healthy stack, or a clever one, is tantamount (the thinking goes) to a well-structured company.Other attempts to elaborate on the stack have been more rigorous and comprehensive, less personal and more global. In a 2016 book, \u201cThe Stack: On Software and Sovereignty,\u201d the professor and design theorist Benjamin Bratton sets out to, in his words, propose a \u201cspecific model for the design of political geography tuned to this era of planetary-scale computation,\u201d by drawing on the \u201cmultilayered structure of software, hardware and network \u2018stacks\u2019 that arrange different technologies vertically within a modular, interdependent order.\u201d In other words, Bratton sees the world around us as one big emerging technological stack. In his telling, the six-layer stack we inhabit is complex, fluid and vertigo-inducing: Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface and User. It is also, he suggests, extremely powerful, with the potential to undermine and replace our current conceptions of, among other things, the sovereign state \u2014 ushering us into a world blown apart and reassembled by software. This might sound extreme, but such is the intoxicating logic of the stack.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump Drifts Away From Populism, His Supporters Grow Watchful", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported by\u201cIf you abandon populism,\u201d he added, \u201cthen you will not really have any constituency anymore. Will you be an establishment Democrat? Will you be a neocon? How will people even think of you? You will be adrift.\u201dNed Ryun, founder of American Majority, which trains political activists, said Mr. Trump\u2019s core supporters were watching. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely some concern that\u2019s starting to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cI do believe that Trump has some populist beliefs and undertones himself. But he has to have Steve Bannon whispering in his ear saying, \u2018Hey, stick with these ideas; these are winning ideas.\u2019\u201dEven some of Mr. Trump\u2019s friends worry that he has gotten away from the policies that fueled his success in the campaign. \u201cHe ran as a populist but so far has governed as a traditionalist,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media. Mr. Ruddy praised the president for using his bully pulpit to push companies to keep jobs in America but said his health care plan pushing millions off Medicaid was not true to his roots. \u201cThey might break out and do some more populist stuff, but I wouldn\u2019t call his presidency so far populist.\u201dThat may underscore just how much Mr. Trump\u2019s populist frame was the inspiration of Mr. Bannon in the first place. It was Mr. Bannon who suggested the comparison to Jackson, whose painting now hangs in the Oval Office.Mr. Trump, after all, was always an unlikely populist, a self-proclaimed billionaire with a private plane and gilded estates. Mr. Trump, who by one count switched political parties seven times before last year\u2019s campaign, seems less driven by ideology than by instinct borne out of his own resentment of elites who, in his view, have never given him the respect he deserves.\u201cBannon gave him a worldview to sink those emotions into, to connect those emotions into,\u201d said Michael Kazin, a historian at Georgetown University and author of books on populism and William Jennings Bryan. That does not make Mr. Trump the second coming of Jackson, he added. \u201cThe only comparison, as Bannon knows, is there\u2019s a toughness, there\u2019s a running against the entrenched, educated elite. That part\u2019s true.\u201dPopulism can be found on the political right and left, often fueled by economic disparities, a sense of dislocation and anger at elites. In the United States, populism after Jackson gained steam in the 1890s with the formation of the People\u2019s Party and Bryan\u2019s presidential campaigns. It was revived in the 1930s by Huey Long and his Depression-era Share the Wealth Clubs and had a brief return in the 1990s with Ross Perot\u2019s independent campaigns.While populists have rarely won the White House, they prodded those who did, like Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who enacted progressive policies expanding government power over the \u201cmalefactors of great wealth,\u201d as the first Roosevelt put it. On the other side of the spectrum, Richard M. Nixon appealed to the \u201csilent majority,\u201d while Ronald Reagan was boosted by aggrieved working-class Americans who abandoned the Democrats.\u201cYou\u2019re not a populist if you want to, as he did in his health care bill, raise premiums for low-income senior citizens,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019re not a populist when you want to throw 24 million people off health care. You\u2019re not a populist when you want to do away with nutrition programs for pregnant women and children.\u201d\u201cHis appeal was definitely populist and his rhetoric remains so, but the reality of how he\u2019s governed has been more of a rich-person conservative with feints toward his populist base,\u201d said Sheri Berman, a Barnard College political-science professor who has written about populism. \u201cThere\u2019s this split between rhetoric and reality for those who are paying attention to the details, which of course most voters have neither the time nor the energy to do.\u201dIt may be that nationalist is a better description. \u201cAs long as he does his hard-line stuff on immigrants, he\u2019s going to hold onto a lot of those people,\u201d said John B. Judis, author of the new book \u201cThe Populist Explosion.\u201d Mr. Trump may not succeed in rebuilding the manufacturing sector or winning trade wars with China, Mr. Judis added, but they want to see him trying. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have another downturn for the next three or four years, he\u2019ll keep his support.\u201dRichard D. White Jr., the business school dean at Louisiana State University and author of \u201cKingfish: The Reign of Huey P. Long,\u201d said Long would have seen Mr. Trump as an example of the plutocrats he spent a lifetime battling. But what they have in common, he said, was a pugilistic approach to politics that touches a chord with many constituents.\u201cProbably the best word to define it is \u2018anger,\u2019\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThere\u2019s an anger in the people, whether it\u2019s Huey Long or Andrew Jackson or Donald Trump.

Consisting mostly of apartment buildings, villages, wetlands and empty fields, it has primarily been known for its donkey burgers.But now the area around Xiongxian County has become another example of the frothiness and unpredictability of the Chinese property market \u2014 a market that many experts warn could have severe repercussions for China and the world if it stumbles.On Saturday, China declared that an area that sprawls across three local counties will someday become Xiongan New Area, a gleaming economic powerhouse reminiscent of earlier developments that helped put China\u2019s economy on its fast-growth trajectory. When completed, it will cover nearly 800 square miles, offer favorable regulation to businesses and become a modern urban area crucial to redeveloping the Rust Belt around Beijing.Almost immediately, speculators pounced, setting off a property buying frenzy and sending shares of construction companies soaring. It has been such a chaotic market that local authorities have been forced to freeze purchases and close real estate offices. Chinese social media showed photos of new property developments and real estate offices with signs saying they had been temporarily closed.The price spikes have been fast and furious.In the town of Baigou, about 12 miles north of Xiongxian, prices for an apartment jumped to 12,000 renminbi per square meter \u2014 or more than $160 per square foot \u2014 from 8,750 renminbi within hours after the announcement, according to Wen Yunlong, a local real estate agent. On Sunday, it rose by an additional 3,000 renminbi, he said.\u201cPrices have gone up every day,\u201d Mr. Wen said.Since Saturday, he said, potential buyers had lined up at his agency. \u201cI have been working from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. these days,\u201d he said. \u201cLast night, I worked till midnight.\u201dHe added: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen so many people here before.

Shares of other Hong Kong-traded property-related firms active in the area rose by smaller amounts. Markets in China were closed on Monday for a holiday.In declaring its intent to build Xiongan, the Chinese government invited comparisons to the southern city of Shenzhen and the Pudong area of Shanghai. Shenzhen was part of China\u2019s earliest experiments with private enterprise after the death of Mao Zedong, and it remains one of the richest parts of China. Pudong, home of many of the gleaming skyscrapers that define Shanghai\u2019s skyline, became one of China\u2019s most successful and high-profile development projects.Xiongan will become \u201ca demonstration area for innovative development,\u201d Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, told the official state media.Right now, the Xiongan area has less than 1 percent of the economic output of Beijing, according to state media. It is part of an area known for its donkey burgers \u2014 sandwiches with roasted donkey meat, which tastes something like pastrami.Owen Li took the morning train on Monday from Beijing to sample donkey burgers but had an unusually hard time buying a ticket. Once in Baigou, where property sales had not been shut down, Mr. Li noticed that many cars on the street were brands like Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.He then met many potential apartment buyers from out of town and began talking to them.

People in steerage eat cockroach protein bars.Scientists must start looking into this. Seriously.Aerosols could be loaded into military jets, to be sprayed into the atmosphere at high altitude.

Barring some technology that could pull it out at a reasonable cost \u2014 a long shot for the foreseeable future, according to many scientists \u2014 it will stay there for a long time, warming the atmosphere further for decades to come.Solving the climate imperative will require cutting greenhouse gas emissions down to zero, ideally in this century, and probably sucking some out. But solar geoengineering could prove a critical complement to mitigation, giving humanity time to develop the political will and the technologies to achieve the needed decarbonization.\u201cIf the United States starts going backwards or not going forward fast enough in terms of emissions reductions, then more and more people will start talking about these options,\u201d said Mr. Pasztor, a former United Nations assistant secretary general on climate change.While it is known that solar radiation management can cool the atmosphere, fears that field research would look too much like deployment have so far limited research pretty much to computer modeling of its effects and small-scale experiments in the lab.Critically, the academics noted, the research agenda must include an open, international debate about the governance structures necessary to deploy a technology that, at a stroke, would affect every society and natural system in the world. In other words, geoengineering needs to be addressed not as science fiction, but as a potential part of the future just a few decades down the road.\u201cToday it is still a taboo, but it is a taboo that is crumbling,\u201d said David Keith, a noted Harvard physicist who was an organizer of the conclave.Arguments against geoengineering are in some ways akin to those made against genetically modified organisms and so-called Frankenfood. It amounts to messing with nature. But there are more practical causes for concern about the deployment of such a radical technology. How would it affect the ozone in the stratosphere? How would it change patterns of precipitation?Moreover, how could the world agree on the deployment of a technology that will have different impacts on different countries? How could the world balance the global benefit of a cooling atmosphere against a huge disruption of the monsoon on the Indian subcontinent? Who would make the call? Would the United States agree to this kind of thing if it brought drought to the Midwest? Would Russia let it happen if it froze over its northern ports?Geoengineering would be cheap enough that even a middle-income country could deploy it unilaterally. Some scientists have estimated that solar radiation management could cool the earth quickly for as little as $5 billion per year or so. What if the Trump administration decided to focus American efforts to combat climate change on geoengineering alone?That wouldn\u2019t work, in the end. If greenhouse gases were not removed from the atmosphere, the world would heat up in a snap as soon as the aerosol injections were turned off. Still, the temptation to combat climate change on the cheap while continuing to exploit fossil fuels could be hard to resist for a president who promised to revive coal and has shown little interest in global diplomacy.As Scott Barrett, an environmental economist from Columbia University who was at the meeting in Washington, noted, \u201cThe biggest challenge posed by geoengineering is unlikely to be technical, but rather involve the way we govern the use of this unprecedented technology.\u201dThese ethical considerations should be taken into account in any research program into managing the rays of the sun. Perhaps researchers should refrain from taking money from an American administration that denies climate science, to avoid delegitimizing the technology in the eyes of the rest of the world.But it would be a mistake to halt research into this new technological tool. Geoengineering might ultimately prove to be a bad idea for a variety of reasons. But only further research can tell us that.The best way to think of the options ahead is as offering a balance of risks. On one plate sit whatever pitfalls geoengineering might bring. They might be preferable to the prospect of radical climate change. Thinking in terms of delirious sci-fi fantasies, the trade-off won\u2019t necessarily be between cockroach protein bars and some happy future of cheap, renewable energy. It is more likely to pit cockroach treats against some dystopian, broiling world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revisiting Nafta: The Stakes for Key Industries", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump may not be terminating the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as Nafta, but that doesn\u2019t mean the deal is safe.Whatever his criticisms, Nafta has had a major impact on the American economy in the decades since it was signed, and any renegotiation would affect certain industries.Here are four potentially vulnerable sectors.Perhaps no industry is more closely entwined with Nafta, or has more at stake in any shift in trade policy, than the automotive sector.The sector is a major employer in all three member nations \u2014 Canada, Mexico and the United States. Hundreds of thousands of workers in the United States are tied to the industry, while Mexico and Canada each rely on automaking for tens of thousands of jobs.The countries\u2019 automotive sectors are also tightly linked, exporting and importing billions of dollars\u2019 worth of auto parts from one another.Last year, the United States imported 1.6 million vehicles \u2014 mainly small cars \u2014 from Mexico. But about 40 percent of the value of the components in those vehicles, such as engines and transmissions, came from plants in the United States.A tug-of-war over revising Nafta could disrupt Mexican car-making, which has grown rapidly in the past decade, but there would be consequences for the United States, as well.In a recent study, the research center concluded that withdrawing from Nafta, or restricting automotive trade, would increase costs for manufacturers in the United States, make its auto sector less competitive, and lower the returns for investors. Rather than shifting production to the United States, manufacturers would be more likely to move production to low-cost countries such as China or India.A severe shock to Nafta could put as many as 31,000 automotive jobs in jeopardy in the United States, according to the research organization. And there are domestic politics to consider: Michigan, a state that helped Mr. Trump win the election, could be among those hit hardest if the current terms are upended, because of its concentration of vehicle production and engineering jobs. NEAL E. BOUDETTEFor textile, retail and apparel companies, Nafta is a vital part of the global supply chains that power businesses as varied as billion-dollar brands and small yarn manufacturers in Georgia.To redo the trade deal, the U.S. may have to make concessions that the Trump administration will be wary of offering.\u201cObviously, that\u2019s some pretty big numbers, and so Nafta is obviously extraordinarily important to the United States textile industry,\u201d Mr. Wood said. \u201cThat being said, we agree with the Trump administration that Nafta is due for a comprehensive review to determine whether it can be improved.\u201dFor decades, retailers and the brands they sell have relied on an established flow of goods built around the agreement. If tariffs were to suddenly spike on clothing, for example, companies in the United States could not simply switch overnight to T-shirt factories in another part of the world.Changes could also raise prices for consumers, and there are manufacturing jobs to consider \u2014 as well as related jobs in retailing, shipping and other industries that would be indirectly affected \u2014 according to Stephen E. Lamar, executive vice president at the American Apparel & Footwear Association.Another group, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, has been lobbying for updates to the 23-year-old Nafta that reflect modern shopping realities, including e-commerce.\u201cWe\u2019re looking to see a Nafta that is updated and modernized to reflect current supply chains, but also updated to reflect new sectors like the digital economy,\u201d said Hun Quach, the association\u2019s vice president for trade. RACHEL ABRAMSAgricultural trade between the three countries has significantly expanded under Nafta, but many economists agree that the trade deal was only one factor in that increase. International trade agreements, changes in domestic farm policies, and laws and international trade rulings were all part of the mix.\u201cThe effects of this trade agreement on agriculture, that\u2019s something you can\u2019t assign a number to,\u201d said Ryan Cardwell, an associate professor in the department of agribusiness and agricultural economics at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. \u201cHowever, there is a broad consensus that Nafta did increase integration of agricultural markets in North America.\u201dCertainly, some farmers in all three countries saw immediate and significant changes because of Nafta.American corn, for example, now flows into Mexico, a market from which it was once mostly excluded. And common food safety standards introduced under the pact led to an explosion of Mexican exports to Canada and the United States, particularly of avocados.James Rude, an associate professor of resource economics at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, said that while cross-border integration had certainly increased in the farm sector under Nafta, it is nowhere near the levels found in other industries, like automaking. Integration mainly reflects corporate investment decisions, rather than changes in trade rules, he said. IAN AUSTENMoving that work back to the United States could be complicated, given that the Food and Drug Administration must sign off on even the smallest changes at medical factories.\u201cOur companies make plans five, 10 years into the future, sometimes at the very least,\u201d said Andrew C. Fish, the chief strategy officer at the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade group representing the medical device industry. \u201cUncertainty is always a challenge for our industry, and I think most others. We would certainly welcome policy clarity, sooner rather than later, and would like to work with the Trump administration.\u201d KATIE THOMASAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Merkel Warns Britain Against \u2018Illusions\u2019 About Post-\u2018Brexit\u2019 Ties", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany warned Britain on Thursday not to harbor \u201cillusions\u201d that it can negotiate a deal on future relations with the European Union while simultaneously negotiating its departure from the bloc.Future relations can be negotiated only after the terms of the exit have been agreed upon, Ms. Merkel told Germany\u2019s Parliament on Thursday.\u201cI have the feeling that some people in Britain still have illusions on this score,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be a waste of time.\u201dMs. Merkel was not more specific, but as a leader known for choosing her words carefully, her warning about the high costs of leaving Europe could be interpreted as a subtle message for voters in France, Britain and Germany itself.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a specific Macron thing,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, director of Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels. Europe\u2019s message to France would have been the same if the defeated center-right candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, were to face Ms. Le Pen instead of Mr. Macron, he said.Mr. Wolff added, however, that European leaders should also be leery of overemphasizing the costs of abandoning Europe. \u201cThat is a very precarious message, which ultimately will not work,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cYou cannot sell Europe on the feeling that leaving is painful.\u201dIt is customary for Ms. Merkel to go before Parliament ahead of important European meetings to outline her stance. On Saturday, leaders of the 27 countries that will remain in the European Union after Britain leaves are scheduled to discuss their negotiating position with Britain.In reality, however, talks between Britain and Europe might not become seriously detailed until Germany holds its own elections \u2014 in which Ms. Merkel and her Christian Democratic Union will seek a fourth mandate from voters \u2014 in late September.\u201cThere is great agreement about our common negotiating position towards Britain\u201d after talks in recent weeks with other leaders, she said. \u201cWe can thus assume that the council of the 27 will send a strong signal of unity.\u201dAn outsider country \u201ccannot enjoy the same or even better rights than a member of the European Union,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.Mr. Wolff, a German, noted that, over all, Ms. Merkel stuck to her usual practice of broad statements so she could finesse the outcome as time goes on. That reflects her desire to maintain good relations with Britain \u2014 particularly on security issues and trade \u2014 and to avoid \u201ca break that leads to major disruptions,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cThe one point where she was very clear, and very strict, was that we first have to finish the negotiations on the terms of exit itself, and only then talk about future relations.\u201dSylke Tempel of the German Council on Foreign Relations said Saturday\u2019s meeting, scheduled some weeks ago, was \u201cpurposely timed\u201d to fall between the two rounds of the French election. As things stand, it thus has the effect of backing Mr. Macron, who leaders in Germany believe \u201cwould be the better result, also for most of the French,\u201d she said.Ms. Merkel has stuck to her message since the British referendum: that the remaining 27 countries agree on basics, especially the freedom of movement that Britons blame for what many of them see as mass immigration, and that everything else can be negotiated.\u201cMerkel has said the same, but perhaps a little bit clearer now,\u201d Ms. Tempel said. \u201cIt is easier when you know you have people on board.\u201dThere is general agreement that a country \u201cshould be a bit less comfortable outside than inside\u201d the European Union, she added.Like Mrs. May herself, Britain is often described as pragmatic and taking a cleareyed, unsentimental approach toward the coming divorce negotiations. But Germany, too, is pragmatic, Ms. Tempel said \u2014 in its insistence on working within the European framework.\u201cThat is a conviction, and not a tactic,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As New Zealand Courts Tech Talent, Isolation Becomes a Draw", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported by6 PhotosWELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 In the South Pacific, software no longer needs a hard sell.New Zealand has long wanted to be a tech hub, but distance was an issue. Now, at a moment of political upheaval around the globe, that isolation has become a selling point.For all sorts of reasons, New Zealand suddenly makes sense. The cost of living is less than in San Francisco. Commuting is less wearying. And American politics, \u201cBrexit\u201d and the Islamic State are on the other side of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things where the stars are aligned,\u201d said David Jones, general manager at the Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency.New arrivals describe New Zealand as more idealistic and less frustrating than other places.\u201cIn the U.S., I feel extremely disconnected,\u201d said Alanna Irving, 33, who came here from San Francisco to start two companies. \u201cThings happen all the time that I don\u2019t agree with or understand or think are really good for most people, and I just don\u2019t see any way that I can change that.\u201dThis is the second time New Zealand has tried to use Silicon Valley to jump-start its fledgling tech economy. The current effort is in some ways an outgrowth of the first, featuring the same players.The first time, there were big promises that were never fulfilled. It was a typical Silicon Valley story, in other words, which makes it a bit of a cautionary tale even as everyone assumes that this time will be different.The story began more than a decade ago when a billionaire entrepreneur came here to visit and, like so many others, fell in love with the majestic mountains and sweeping vistas. New Zealand is where Peter Jackson filmed \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d a beloved text for many techies. It is the real Middle-earth, a fantasy come to life.Fantasies are rarely free. People applying for citizenship here are required to have spent 70 percent of the previous five years living in the country, and to commit to living in it afterward. Even humanitarian exceptions are rare.Peter Thiel, the contrarian investor who made his fortune with PayPal and Facebook, made an irresistible financial proposal to New Zealand in early 2011. He would bring the local economy \u2014 whose biggest exports were concentrated milk and the meat from sheep and goats \u2014 into the high-tech era. Mr. Thiel would serve as the country\u2019s roving tech ambassador, opening doors around the world that are closed to mere government officials.Even before applying, he set up Valar Ventures, an investment fund named after the gods in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d Valar put about $3 million into Xero, an online accounting software firm, and was part of a $4 million infusion of cash into Pacific Fibre, which proposed a trans-Pacific undersea cable.And that, Mr. Thiel signaled, would be just the beginning.\u201cI intend to devote a significant amount of my time and resources to the people and businesses of New Zealand,\u201d he wrote in his citizenship application. He donated about $750,000 to earthquake relief after the city of Christchurch was struck in February 2011.\u201cWe were so blown away that Peter Thiel was interested,\u201d said Rod Drury, the chief executive of Xero. \u201cHim getting a passport wasn\u2019t a big deal at the time. No one really thought about it.\u201dWhen the secret was revealed, it created a small uproar.\u201cSomeone being able to invest and get citizenship goes against that important New Zealand value of equality,\u201d Mr. Drury explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why it has played so much in the media here.\u201dMr. Drury is the biggest name in New Zealand\u2019s tech scene, a local version of Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg. He recommended Mr. Thiel for citizenship, and Xero was held up as a model of what, with the investor\u2019s help, all the new start-ups could become.The New Zealand government was so enthusiastic about Mr. Thiel\u2019s investing prowess that it became a partner with him in early 2012, putting about $7 million into a Valar fund. The fund did well, primarily because of its big position in Xero.Valar is now based in New York, where it has been investing in European and Brazilian companies. Mr. Thiel declined to comment.\u201cIt\u2019s sad for New Zealand that Thiel and Valar didn\u2019t follow on with more investments,\u201d Lance Wiggs, a local investor, said. \u201cWe are starved for cash.\u201dXero, which has 1,400 employees and customers in 180 countries, took a different path. Its goal is to turn accountants into \u201cgrowth consultants,\u201d becoming a platform that soars above national borders.\u201cGay marriage, cultural tolerance, refugees, active strategies to address diversity \u2014 more than ever our leadership here is important,\u201d Mr. Drury wrote in an email to his staff immediately after the election. He proposed setting a moral example by bringing \u201csome refugee groups into our Wellington office.\u201dA postelection arrival at Xero from the United States is Nick Piesco, 40, who was writing code for a start-up in Austin, Tex. \u201cI\u2019d say the timing is coincidental but fortuitous,\u201d the programmer said of his move 7,437 miles west. Already he and his wife, Reneau Skinner, 39, are talking about becoming citizens.\u201cOne of the things that attracted me to Xero was the culture \u2014 how they make people feel welcome,\u201d Mr. Piesco said.That means those barred from the United States under the new administration\u2019s policies, or who think they might be, are ripe for recruitment, Mr. Drury said.\u201cEspecially in the U.S. technology industry, where something like 50 percent of the billion-dollar companies have been built by immigrants, it\u2019s nuts that you make it difficult for engineers to come in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy for us not to exploit that.\u201dThe LookSee Wellington initiative to bring in 100 software engineers was initially focused on Americans. Then word began to spread. By the time the contest was finally cut off on March 30, India had overtaken the United States in applications.\u201cWe\u2019re in a global talent war,\u201d said Chris Whelan, chief executive of the Economic Development Agency in Wellington.Mr. Drury is already looking to make LookSee an annual affair. After all, it takes the expensive problem of recruitment off Xero\u2019s hands and lets the government do it.\u201cIt\u2019s boom time for the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Drury said. The more immigrants, the better. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a lot. We\u2019ll take hundreds.\u201dAn article last Friday about New Zealand\u2019s efforts to court technology workers misstated the surname of a local investor. He is Lance Wiggs, not Biggs. Because of an editing error, the article also attributed incorrectly a quotation about immigration and tech labor. It was Rod Drury, the chief executive of the accounting software firm Xero \u2014 not Nick Piesco, a Xero employee \u2014 who said, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy for us not to exploit that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
