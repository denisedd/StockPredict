{"Headline": "Friday Mailbag: A Patriots Photo Lets Trump Score a Point", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byThe Public EditorPromoting the story on its Twitter feed, the Sports section spliced photos of the two events together, both taken on the south side of the White House, to indicate the comparative difference in attendance. (The photos were also included in the story.)The problem, however, was that the photo taken Wednesday included only players and coaches, whereas the photo taken during President Obama\u2019s tenure included over 40 additional support staff \u2014 who, this time around, were seated on the South Lawn \u2014 which greatly exaggerated the difference.After the Patriots pointed this out through the team\u2019s Twitter handle, the Times Sports section promptly sent another tweet to correct the earlier one, then removed the photo from its story and appended a correction.By Thursday morning President Trump had gotten wind of the error.Several readers were upset that The Times provided ammunition for right-wing critics.For every one thousand solid journalistic pieces you produce, each misstep like this puts you in the hole for two thousand more. Please \u2014 we are trying to save the real news, of which you are one of the few remaining outlets.Rick Regan, New Fairfield, Conn.One reader put the issue succinctly:Are you trying to give the right wing more to criticize The Times for?Dan Gerstman, BuffaloWe asked Jason Stallman, the Sports editor, for an explanation.Bad Tweet by me. Terrible Tweet. I wish I could say it\u2019s complicated, but no, this one is pretty straightforward: I\u2019m an idiot. It was my idea, it was my execution, it was my blunder. I made a decision in about four minutes that clearly warranted much more time. Once we learned more we tried to fix everything as much as possible, as swiftly as possible and as transparently as possible. Of course, at that point the damage was done. I just needed to own it.The booking photo of the victim, Demetrius Bryan Hollins, was included near the end.Several readers wrote in to protest the photo choices for the article.The news story uses professional, smiling photos of the two perpetrators and a mug shot of the (African American) victim. This perpetuates the stereotype of African Americans as violent criminals, even when they are the victims of crimes. I am sure that the Times would have been able to find a more appropriate photo of Mr. Hollins to use for this story.Beth Davidson, Washington, D.C.We brought the concern to Beth Flynn, the deputy photo editor, for a response.The only photos readily available for this piece were the handouts of the police officers and the booking mug of Mr. Hollins. That said, I think there were a few missed opportunities here. One, both (civilian) videos showing the horrific behavior by the police officers during the arrest were accessible online, and we should have made the effort to track down usage rights and add one to the top of the piece. Two, the (smiling) handout images of the officers should never have been the top of the article art. And three, the booking mug of Mr. Hollins, if that is all we had access to, could have been captioned to say he was kicked in the head by officers during the arrest (and then seeing his bleeding face in this picture would have added value). Thanks for sending the note along, this is a good post mortem conversation for our editors.We asked Celia Dugger, the editor of Health and Science, to explain the reasoning behind the decision.I began writing about this back in 1996 when I was an immigration reporter on the Metro desk covering the asylum case of Fauziya Kassindja. I decided in the course of reporting that case \u2014 especially after a reporting trip to Togo, her home country, and the Ivory Coast \u2014 to call it genital cutting rather than mutilation. I never minced words in describing exactly what form of cutting was involved, and there are many gradations of severity, and the terrible damage it did, and stayed away from the euphemistic circumcision, but chose to use the less culturally loaded term, genital cutting. There\u2019s a gulf between the Western (and some African) advocates who campaign against the practice and the people who follow the rite, and I felt the language used widened that chasm.This week a reader wrote in to ask The Times to drop the courtesy title \u201cMrs.\u201d for women altogether.Jillian Goodman, New York CityWe asked Phil Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, to address the question.Our style guidelines call for \u201cMs.\u201d as the regular courtesy title for a woman, unless the woman specifically expresses her preference for \u201cMrs.\u201d (or, rarely, \u201cMiss\u201d). So, for example, in the case of Theresa May, we had actually been referring to her as \u201cMs. May\u201d until we learned from her aides that she prefers \u201cMrs. May.\u201d Her Parliament webpage even makes this explicit. This approach is in keeping with our general practice of referring to people and organizations as they prefer. I realize, though, that the Ms./Mrs. distinction troubles many readers \u2014 and I think the use of \u201cMrs.\u201d has grown less and less common, in The Times as well as everywhere else.I just read the article in tonight\u2019s online edition about great old film noir classics now available to Amazon Prime subscribers, complete with in-story links to their pages on Amazon Prime. Is this a paid placement paid for by Amazon Prime meant to encourage readers to subscribe to Amazon Prime, and if so shouldn\u2019t that fact be noted?Christopher Ho, San FranciscoThe article is not paid placement from Amazon Prime. That list ran on Watching, The New York Times\u2019s new film and TV recommendation site. Given that there\u2019s more to watch than ever before \u2014 and more outlets on which to watch that content \u2014 we often try to direct Times readers toward great movies and series on specific streaming services. The idea for the list that Christopher points to came from the editorial staff, the films mentioned were chosen by me and the writer and there was not \u2014 and never is \u2014 any communication with Amazon about such things. Given the topics we write about on Watching, we often hope to provide value to readers by focusing on specific genres or streaming services. If you\u2019re interested in film noir, this list is for you. If you\u2019re not, there are other genre specific lists that might be. If you are already a subscriber to Amazon Prime, we hope to point you to movies that you may not have come across yet. Same can be said for lists we do that pertain to Netflix or Hulu or other streaming services. The goal in each of those cases is to dig into large and scattershot catalogs and tell readers what is worth their time.As for our recommendation for what to watch on Amazon Prime, though it\u2019s not a moody film noir classic, we highly endorse \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Well, one of us does, at least, if you can guess who.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Acorn TV, Urban Movie Channel, Shudder: Exploring Fringe Caves Online", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byStreamingYou also learn that services come and go. If you click on an app for a service and get a message that it hasn\u2019t updated for the current operating system on your device, there\u2019s a good chance its extinction is imminent. Learning that a streaming site has up and disappeared is arguably more irritating than finding out a movie you\u2019ve had on a service\u2019s watchlist has been deleted from the service. That said, much of the excitement of streaming is in the ability to get more of what you love (or think you might love).Better-than-decent adaptations of classic material like Agatha Christie\u2019s \u201cThe Witness for the Prosecution\u201d are plentiful on Acorn. And the movies it does have are largely noteworthy. There\u2019s the 2002 BBC Film \u201cThe Falklands Play,\u201d a fast-paced, quick-witted movie about the Falklands War in which the great British actress Patricia Hodge (\u201cBetrayal\u201d) portrays Margaret Thatcher, a performance that actually gives Meryl Streep\u2019s portrayal of the British prime minister in \u201cThe Iron Lady,\u201d from 2011, a run for its money. \u201c44 Inch Chest,\u201d a 2009 adultery-and-kidnapping drama that\u2019s a sharp critique of male sexual jealousy, has a spectacular cast of indefatigable lads: Ray Winstone, Ian McShane, John Hurt, Tom Wilkinson, Stephen Dillane, Steven Berkoff. The service also features the great Australian director Gillian Armstrong\u2019s 1992 domestic drama, \u201cThe Last Days of Chez Nous,\u201d with Miranda Otto, Kerry Fox and Bruno Ganz. The service is available as a website and an app, and on Roku, Amazon Fire and Chromecast, and costs $4.99 a month (a yearly subscription can be had for $49.99).Some aspects of the site are a little befuddling; a \u201cClassics\u201d section features both the 1977 horror picture \u201cThe Hills Have Eyes\u201d (arguably a classic) and the 1986 affirmative-action blackface comedy \u201cSoul Man\u201d (absolutely not a classic).Just as it has much of everything, Amazon Video has a lot of horror, ranging from last year\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cThe Witch\u201d to the cult classic \u201cThe House on Sorority Row\u201d (1983) to microbudget no-name pictures for which the streaming service provides an ostensible shot at finding an audience. Netflix has a little over 250 horror movies, many of them classics \u2014 \u201cThe Legend of Hell House,\u201d from 1973, loomed large in my early-teen years, because it\u2019s really scary, and also because it touched off my lifelong crush on the actress Pamela Franklin. But some of them aren\u2019t horror movies at all: \u201cScary Movie 2,\u201d from 2001, is a parody of horror movies; last year\u2019s \u201cYoga Hosers\u201d is just an actual horror.Screambox is very full-throttle and fan-oriented, with not just horror fare but also documentaries celebrating the likes of the \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d franchise. The grind-house nostalgist in me was delighted to find two 1981 obscurities: the Italian filmmaker Lucio Fulci\u2019s mortifying gorefest \u201cThe Beyond\u201d and \u201cThe Nesting,\u201d an interesting novelty in which the New York sexploitation filmmaker Armand Weston tried to go mainstream, with mixed results. (It also happens to be the American \u201940s and \u201950s screen siren Gloria Grahame\u2019s final film, and one you are unlikely to see on TCM.) Screambox and Shudder are not exactly replete with transcendent masterpieces, and honestly, neither are Acorn and UMC. But even the most refined viewer knows that masterpieces are not always the point. Digging for something is half the fun.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Uber Uses Psychological Tricks to Push Its Drivers\u2019 Buttons", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "The secretive ride-hailing giant Uber rarely discusses internal matters in public. But in March, facing crises on multiple fronts, top officials convened a call for reporters to insist that Uber was changing its culture and would no longer tolerate \u201cbrilliant jerks.\u201dNotably, the company also announced that it would fix its troubled relationship with drivers, who have complained for years about falling pay and arbitrary treatment.And yet even as Uber talks up its determination to treat drivers more humanely, it is engaged in an extraordinary behind-the-scenes experiment in behavioral science to manipulate them in the service of its corporate growth \u2014 an effort whose dimensions became evident in interviews with several dozen current and former Uber officials, drivers and social scientists, as well as a review of behavioral research.Uber\u2019s innovations reflect the changing ways companies are managing workers amid the rise of the freelance-based \u201cgig economy.\u201d Its drivers are officially independent business owners rather than traditional employees with set schedules. This allows Uber to minimize labor costs, but means it cannot compel drivers to show up at a specific place and time. And this lack of control can wreak havoc on a service whose goal is to seamlessly transport passengers whenever and wherever they want.Uber helps solve this fundamental problem by using psychological inducements and other techniques unearthed by social science to influence when, where and how long drivers work. It\u2019s a quest for a perfectly efficient system: a balance between rider demand and driver supply at the lowest cost to passengers and the company.Employing hundreds of social scientists and data scientists, Uber has experimented with video game techniques, graphics and noncash rewards of little value that can prod drivers into working longer and harder \u2014 and sometimes at hours and locations that are less lucrative for them.To keep drivers on the road, the company has exploited some people\u2019s tendency to set earnings goals \u2014 alerting them that they are ever so close to hitting a precious target when they try to log off. It has even concocted an algorithm similar to a Netflix feature that automatically loads the next program, which many experts believe encourages binge-watching. In Uber\u2019s case, this means sending drivers their next fare opportunity before their current ride is even over.And most of this happens without giving off a whiff of coercion.\u201cWe show drivers areas of high demand or incentivize them to drive more,\u201d said Michael Amodeo, an Uber spokesman. \u201cBut any driver can stop work literally at the tap of a button \u2014 the decision whether or not to drive is 100 percent theirs.\u201dBut an examination by The New York Times found that Uber is continuing apace in its struggle to wield the upper hand with drivers. And as so-called platform-mediated work like driving for Uber increasingly becomes the way people make a living, the company\u2019s example illustrates that pulling psychological levers may eventually become the reigning approach to managing the American worker.Of course, many companies try to nudge consumers into buying their products and services using psychological tricks. But extending these efforts to the work force is potentially transformative.Uber exists in a kind of legal and ethical purgatory, however. Because its drivers are independent contractors, they lack most of the protections associated with employment. By mastering their workers\u2019 mental circuitry, Uber and the like may be taking the economy back toward a pre-New Deal era when businesses had enormous power over workers and few checks on their ability to exploit it.In early 2016, a group of roughly 100 Uber employees responsible for signing up drivers and getting them to drive more voted to change its name \u2014 from \u201csupply growth\u201d to \u201cdriver growth.\u201dThe vote was not unprompted. For much of the previous year, Uber executives had agonized over how to lower the rate at which drivers were deserting the platform.Alongside Uber\u2019s already daunting targets for expanding its pool of drivers to meet mounting demand, the high turnover threatened to cap the company\u2019s growth and throw it into crisis.Uber conducted interviews and focus groups while executives peppered employees with questions like, \u201cWhat are we doing to have more empathy for the driver side of the equation?\u201dThis is particularly true of shortages so pronounced as to create a \u201csurge\u201d \u2014 that is, a higher fare than normal. While surges do mitigate shortages, they do so in part by repelling passengers, something directly at odds with Uber\u2019s long-term goal of dominating the industry. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s better not to surge,\u201d said Daniel Graf, Uber\u2019s vice president of product. \u201cIf we don\u2019t surge, we can produce more rides.\u201dAs a result, much of Uber\u2019s communication with drivers over the years has aimed at combating shortages by advising drivers to move to areas where they exist, or where they might arise. Uber encouraged its local managers to experiment with ways of achieving this.\u201cIt was all day long, every day \u2014 texts, emails, pop-ups: \u2018Hey, the morning rush has started. Get to this area, that\u2019s where demand is biggest,\u2019\u201d said Ed Frantzen, a veteran Uber driver in the Chicago area. \u201cIt was always, constantly, trying to get you into a certain direction.\u201dSome local managers who were men went so far as to adopt a female persona for texting drivers, having found that the uptake was higher when they did.\u201c\u2018Laura\u2019 would tell drivers: \u2018Hey, the concert\u2019s about to let out. You should head over there,\u2019\u201d said John P. Parker, a manager in Uber\u2019s Dallas office in 2014 and 2015, referring to one of the personas. \u201cWe have an overwhelmingly male driver population.\u201dUber acknowledged that it had experimented with female personas to increase engagement with drivers.The friction over meeting demand was compounded by complaints about arrangements like aggressive car leases that required many drivers to work upward of 50 or 60 hours each week to eke out a profit. Uber officials began to worry that a driver backlash was putting them at a strategic disadvantage in their competition with Lyft, which had cultivated a reputation for being more driver-friendly.Now Uber began a process of, in effect, becoming a little less like Mr. Kalanick, and a little more like Lyft.It rethought a lease program, softened the hectoring tone of its messages and limited their volume. At times it became positively cheery.During roughly the same period, Uber was increasingly concerned that many new drivers were leaving the platform before completing the 25 rides that would earn them a signing bonus. To stem that tide, Uber officials in some cities began experimenting with simple encouragement: You\u2019re almost halfway there, congratulations!While the experiment seemed warm and innocuous, it had in fact been exquisitely calibrated. The company\u2019s data scientists had previously discovered that once drivers reached the 25-ride threshold, their rate of attrition fell sharply.And psychologists and video game designers have long known that encouragement toward a concrete goal can motivate people to complete a task.\u201cIt\u2019s getting you to internalize the company\u2019s goals,\u201d said Chelsea Howe, a prominent video game designer who has spoken out against coercive psychological techniques deployed in games. \u201cInternalized motivation is the most powerful kind.\u201dMr. Amodeo, the Uber spokesman, defended the practice. \u201cWe try to make the early experience as good as possible, but also as realistic as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to decide for themselves if driving is right for them.\u201dThat making drivers feel good could be compatible with treating them as lab subjects was no surprise. None other than Lyft itself had shown as much several years earlier.In 2013, the company hired a consulting firm to figure out how to encourage more driving during the platform\u2019s busiest hours.At the time, Lyft drivers could voluntarily sign up in advance for shifts. The consultants devised an experiment in which the company showed one group of inexperienced drivers how much more they would make by moving from a slow period like Tuesday morning to a busy time like Friday night \u2014 about $15 more per hour.For another group, Lyft reversed the calculation, displaying how much drivers were losing by sticking with Tuesdays.The latter had a more significant effect on increasing the hours drivers scheduled during busy periods.Still, Ms. Berman disclosed in an interview, Lyft eventually decided against using the loss-aversion approach, suggesting that the company has drawn brighter lines when it comes to potential manipulation.As he tried to log off at 7:13 a.m. on New Year\u2019s Day last year, Josh Streeter, then an Uber driver in the Tampa, Fla., area, received a message on the company\u2019s driver app with the headline \u201cMake it to $330.\u201d The text then explained: \u201cYou\u2019re $10 away from making $330 in net earnings. Are you sure you want to go offline?\u201d Below were two prompts: \u201cGo offline\u201d and \u201cKeep driving.\u201d The latter was already highlighted.\u201cI\u2019ve got screen shots with dozens of these messages,\u201d said Mr. Streeter, who began driving full time for Lyft and then Uber in 2014 but quit last year to invest in real estate.Mr. Streeter was not alone. For months, when drivers tried to log out, the app would frequently tell them they were only a certain amount away from making a seemingly arbitrary sum for the day, or from matching their earnings from that point one week earlier.The messages were intended to exploit another relatively widespread behavioral tic \u2014 people\u2019s preoccupation with goals \u2014 to nudge them into driving longer.Uber, for its part, appears to be aware of the ludic loop. In its messages to drivers, it included a graphic of an engine gauge with a needle that came tantalizingly close to, but was still short of, a dollar sign.And the ludic loop is far from the only video game feature that Uber has adapted as a way of keeping drivers on the road.At any moment, the app shows drivers how many trips they have taken in the current week, how much money they have made, how much time they have spent logged on and what their overall rating from passengers is. All of these metrics can stimulate the competitive juices that drive compulsive game-playing.\u201cThe whole thing is like a video game,\u201d said Eli Solomon, a veteran Uber and Lyft driver in the Chicago area, who said he sometimes had to fight the urge to work more after glancing at his data.Sometimes the so-called gamification is quite literal. Like players on video game platforms such as Xbox, PlayStation and Pogo, Uber drivers can earn badges for achievements like Above and Beyond (denoted on the app by a cartoon of a rocket blasting off), Excellent Service (marked by a picture of a sparkling diamond) and Entertaining Drive (a pair of Groucho Marx glasses with nose and eyebrows).Of course, managers have been borrowing from the logic of games for generations, as when they set up contests and competition among workers. More overt forms of gamification have proliferated during the past decade. For example, Microsoft has used the approach to entice workers to perform the otherwise sleep-inducing task of software debugging.But Uber can go much further. Because it mediates its drivers\u2019 entire work experience through an app, there are few limits to the elements it can gamify. Uber collects staggering amounts of data that allow it to discard game features that do not work and refine those that do. And because its workers are contractors, the gamification strategies are not hemmed in by employment law.Kevin Werbach, a business professor who has written extensively on the subject, said that while gamification could be a force for good in the gig economy \u2014 for example, by creating bonds among workers who do not share a physical space \u2014 there was a danger of abuse. \u201cIf what you\u2019re doing is basically saying, \u2018We\u2019ve found a cheap way to get you to do work without paying you for it, we\u2019ll pay you in badges that don\u2019t cost anything,\u2019 that\u2019s a manipulative way to go about it,\u201d he said.For some drivers, that is precisely the effect. Scott Weber said he drove full time most weeks last year, picking up passengers in the Tampa area for both Uber and Lyft, yet made less than $20,000 before expenses like gas and maintenance. \u201cI was a business that had a loss,\u201d said Mr. Weber, who is looking for another job. \u201cI\u2019m using payday loans.\u201dStill, when asked about the badges he earns while driving for Uber, Mr. Weber practically gushed. \u201cI\u2019ve got currently 12 excellent-service and nine great-conversation badges,\u201d he said in an interview in early March. \u201cIt tells me where I\u2019m at.\u201dWhen asked whether Uber\u2019s product managers and data scientists were akin to developers at a social gaming company like Zynga, Jonathan Hall, Uber\u2019s head of economic and policy research, accepted the analogy but rejected the implication.\u201cI think there\u2019s something to that, but ultimately Zynga should worry mostly about how fun its games are rather than trying to get you to play a little bit more by some trick,\u201d he said. He argued that exploiting people\u2019s psychological tics was unlikely to have more than a marginal effect on how long they played Zynga\u2019s games or drove for Uber. It is \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d he said.Mr. Hall is clearly right about the effects of certain techniques, like those pitched at drivers\u2019 tendency to set income targets or to focus more on losses than gains. On the other hand, even features that produce relatively small changes in driving patterns can become quite important to a company like Uber.According to Mr. Parker, the former Uber manager in Dallas, increasing the number of drivers on the road by 20 percent at certain hours of the day, or in a busy part of town, can rein in a large fare surge.More important, some of the psychological levers that Uber pulls to increase the supply of drivers have quite powerful effects.Consider an algorithm called forward dispatch \u2014 Lyft has a similar one \u2014 that dispatches a new ride to a driver before the current one ends. Forward dispatch shortens waiting times for passengers, who may no longer have to wait for a driver 10 minutes away when a second driver is dropping off a passenger two minutes away.Perhaps no less important, forward dispatch causes drivers to stay on the road substantially longer during busy periods \u2014 a key goal for both companies.Uber and Lyft explain this in essentially the same way. \u201cDrivers keep telling us the worst thing is when they\u2019re idle for a long time,\u201d said Kevin Fan, the director of product at Lyft. \u201cIf it\u2019s slow, they\u2019re going to go sign off. We want to make sure they\u2019re constantly busy.\u201dWhile this is unquestionably true, there is another way to think of the logic of forward dispatch: It overrides self-control.As with viewers and binge-watching, many drivers appear to enjoy the forward-dispatch feature, which can increase earnings by keeping them busier. But it can also work against their interests by increasing the number of drivers on the road and defusing fare surges. And whether they enjoy it is separate from the question of agency \u2014 whether they have it, or whether the company does.Uber officials say the feature initially produced so many rides at times that drivers began to experience a chronic Netflix ailment \u2014 the inability to stop for a bathroom break. Amid the uproar, Uber introduced a pause button.\u201cDrivers were saying: \u2018I can never go offline. I\u2019m on just continuous trips. This is a problem.\u2019 So we redesigned it,\u201d said Maya Choksi, a senior Uber official in charge of building products that help drivers. \u201cIn the middle of the trip, you can say, \u2018Stop giving me requests.\u2019 So you can have more control over when you want to stop driving.\u201dSometimes all that is necessary is the mere setting of a so-called default. Because humans tend to be governed by inertia, automatically enrolling them in retirement savings plans and then allowing them to opt out results in far higher participation than letting them opt in. Making Post-Play the default can have the same effect.\u201cIf done right, these things can be socially beneficial,\u201d Mr. Laibson said. \u201cBut you can think of all sorts of choice architecture that are quite contrary to human well-being.\u201dEven Mr. Hall, the Uber research director who downplayed the importance of behavioral economics to the company, did make at least one concession. \u201cThe optimal default we set is that we want you to do as much work as there is to do,\u201d he said of the company\u2019s app. \u201cYou\u2019re not required to by any means. But that\u2019s the default.\u201dThere are aspects of the platforms that genuinely do increase drivers\u2019 control over their work lives, as Uber frequently points out. Unlike most workers, an Uber driver can put in a few hours each day between dropping children off at school and picking them up in the afternoon.Uber is even in the process of developing a feature that allows drivers to tell the app in advance that they need to arrive at a given location at a given time. \u201cIf you need to pick up your kids at soccer practice at 6 p.m.,\u201d said Nundu Janakiram, the Uber official in charge of products that improve drivers\u2019 experiences, \u201cit will start to give you trips to take you in the general direction to get to a specific place in time.\u201dThere is also the possibility that as the online gig economy matures, companies like Uber may adopt a set of norms that limit their ability to manipulate workers through cleverly designed apps.Kelly Peters, chief executive of BEworks, a management consulting firm specializing in behavioral science, argued that the same data that makes it easier for Uber to nudge drivers into working an additional 30 or 60 minutes also makes it hard to escape the obligation to look after them.That moment of maturity does not appear to have arrived yet, however. Consider a prompt that Uber rolled out this year, inviting drivers to press a large box if they want the app to navigate them to an area where they have a \u201chigher chance\u201d of finding passengers. The accompanying graphic resembles the one that indicates that an area\u2019s fares are \u201csurging,\u201d except in this case fares are not necessarily higher.Some drivers believe that the intent is to trick them into driving where Uber wants them to go, rather than where driving would be most profitable, by implying that they will find a surge there. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to move people where they want them,\u201d said Mr. Weber, the Tampa-area driver. \u201cBut you get there and it\u2019s nothing. It happens all the time.\u201d Mr. Weber noted that the design of the graphic makes the prompt much easier to accept than decline, which requires pressing a small rectangle in the top left corner.Uber said that the feature was an experiment intended primarily to help new drivers who frequently say they do not know where to find passengers, and that it could be changed if drivers were dissatisfied.Individual features aside, the broader question of how much Uber seeks to influence drivers through behavioral science may come down to how much its business model requires it.While the company has made no secret of its investment in self-driving cars, it could be a decade or more before they completely replace human drivers. In the meantime, as long as Uber continues to set growth and passenger volume as critical goals, it will have an incentive to make wringing more hours out of drivers a higher priority than the drivers\u2019 bottom line whenever it faces a close call between the two.Moreover, the contractor model itself provides a strong impetus for companies like Uber to grow. Many companies in the gig economy simply do not have enough workers, or rich enough data about their workers\u2019 behavior, to navigate busy periods using nudges and the like. To avoid chronic understaffing, they have switched to an employee model that allows them to compel workers to log in when the companies most need them.Once companies achieve a certain scale, on the other hand, they enter a virtuous cycle: The risk of understaffing drops with a big enough pool of workers, and the cost savings of using contractors begins to outweigh the inefficiencies. This in turn frees up money to enter new markets and acquire new customers, which makes the contractor model still more efficient, and throws off still more savings.It is, as a result, not too hard to imagine a future in which massive digital platforms like Uber have an appetite for tens of millions of workers \u2014 not only for ferrying people, but also for delivering food and retail goods. Nor is it hard to imagine workers\u2019 obliging them, perhaps because their skills do not match the needs of more traditional employers, or because they need to supplement their wages.In such an economy, experts say, using big data and algorithms to manage workers will not simply be a niche phenomenon. It may become one of the most common ways of managing the American labor force.\u201cYou have all these players entering into this space, and the assumption is they\u2019ll do it through vast armies of underemployed people looking for extra hours, and we can control every nuance about what they do but not have to pay them,\u201d said David Weil, the top wage-and-hour official under President Barack Obama.When you stop to consider the enormous cost advantages, Mr. Weil said, \u201cit says to me this is an area that will grow fast.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hollywood Writers\u2019 Unions Vote to Authorize Strike Against Producers", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Unions representing 12,000 Hollywood writers said on Monday that members had overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike, bringing show business closer to its first production shutdown in a decade.Leaders of the Writers Guild of America, East, and the Writers Guild of America, West, announced the results of an online strike authorization vote in an email to members. The unions said that 6,310 eligible members voted; 96 percent of the vote was in favor of a strike.\u201cWe thank you for your resolve,\u201d the union email said. \u201cWe are determined to achieve a fair contract.\u201dIn a statement, the producers\u2019 alliance said: \u201cThe companies are committed to reaching a deal at the bargaining table that keeps the industry working. The 2007 writers\u2019 strike hurt everyone. Writers lost more than $287 million in compensation that was never recovered.\u201dIf no agreement is reached, a walkout could happen as soon as May 2 and potentially idle tens of thousands of workers \u2014 not just writers but the drivers, caterers, set carpenters, dry cleaners and other service providers who make Hollywood\u2019s wheels turn. Writers picketed for 100 days in the 2007 strike, bringing TV production to a halt and causing $2.5 billion in economic losses in Los Angeles, according to government economists.A strike would first affect late-night talk shows and soap operas that use guild writers, sending the programs into repeats or forcing hosts to ad-lib. The production of scripted TV series would slow down, as producers burned through scripts. Networks would rely more heavily on news, sports and reality programming. Moviegoers would not experience immediate effects; studios have finished shooting most summer and fall movies.Striking is awkward for Hollywood unions because of optics: The workers involved are not coal miners struggling to feed their families. Some television staff writers earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. A few elite wordsmiths \u2014 Chuck Lorre, Shonda Rhimes \u2014 earn millions.But leaders of the two writers\u2019 unions, which bargain as one, say that the middle-class majority of their members are struggling as never before, even as television production booms in the video-streaming age and some blockbusters take in more than $1 billion at the worldwide box office.Networks are ordering fewer episodes per season \u2014 as few as 10 compared with 22 just a few years ago \u2014 so series writing jobs pay less than they once did. At the same time, staff writers can work for only one series at once, taking them off the market for up to a year. And broadcast network reruns do not attract many viewers anymore, limiting residual payments. On the movie side, studios have cut way back on what is known as development, or the polishing and reworking of scripts to produce a good one.\u201cThere\u2019s a wild disparity between what writers are paid and the profits that are generated from their work,\u201d Howard A. Rodman, president of the West guild, said in an interview this month. \u201cIf you look at the budgets of television shows, the part allotted for writing is generally 2 percent. That strikes me as a very small amount given the importance of writing to the enterprise.\u201dHealth care is also a major union concern. In part because it provides extremely generous benefits \u2014 by some measures, studios say, better than coverage offered to other Hollywood unions \u2014 the writers\u2019 health fund has begun to run steep deficits. Writers want studios to help make up the shortfalls, which can total tens of millions of dollars a year.The movie and television companies point to systemic industry problems as reasons they must limit improvements to the Writers Guild contract. Studios contend that they are facing an uncertain future, with streaming services threatening their enormously profitable cable operations: With the rise of Netflix, HBO Go and Amazon, consumers are downgrading cable TV packages or foregoing connections altogether.Media companies have their own optics problem. While they contend that they are unable to give writers more than small raises, most have boasted to Wall Street of climbing profits. And pay for media moguls has been rising. Earlier this month, CBS disclosed that its chief executive, Leslie Moonves, received a 2016 pay package worth $69.6 million, a 22 percent increase over 2015, when the company did not perform as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "He Buys a Lot of Ads, and He\u2019s Frustrated With Digital", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingLOS ANGELES \u2014 Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble, has become the face of marketers\u2019 frustrations with digital advertising this year. His message to the industry: Grow up.The New York Times talked with Mr. Pritchard during the conference in Los Angeles about the challenges in today\u2019s advertising marketplace. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.What is the biggest problem here?The entire murky, nontransparent and in some cases fraudulent supply chain is the problem. It\u2019s a bigger problem than just any one thing. There\u2019s too much we don\u2019t know and we don\u2019t have validated.Ads showing up on objectionable sites, that\u2019s bad. Ads showing up to bots, through searching, that\u2019s bad. Ads that you place that don\u2019t really get measured by a third party that validates what\u2019s right \u2014 that\u2019s not so good, either. There\u2019s a number of things in the digital media supply chain \u2014 even ads that aren\u2019t viewable or close to viewable.What will cleaning this up do for you?What that will enable us all to do is make logical, data-based, reasonable decisions and, most importantly, spend time on what\u2019s really important, which is great creativity to drive growth.At the basis of this whole point is we\u2019re not growing enough as an industry and the markets aren\u2019t growing enough, so we need to spend time on products and packaging and shopping experiences and advertising to drive growth, and yet we have all this time spent in this opaque media environment. That\u2019s the basis for why we, at least, are poking at this so hard.How have technology companies, in particular, responded? There are a lot of people that have come up to us and said thanks for calling this stuff out because we\u2019ve been feeling the same way. It\u2019s a lot of players out there saying we really need to make sure that we know what we\u2019re getting, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s a business. All we\u2019re really asking for is here\u2019s what we\u2019re paying for, validate that we\u2019re getting it, so we can then evaluate whether it\u2019s a good deal. And if it\u2019s two seconds, and it costs X, and lifts the business, we\u2019ll do that. We just need to know that it really was two seconds, and how much it cost and then we can do that.How does the recent controversy around brands\u2019 ads showing up next to offensive content on YouTube fit into this?Right now, obviously, a big thing is if it\u2019s showing up in content we want to be associated with. That\u2019s one piece of it, but the other piece of it is, is it showing up in a place where people are actually viewing it? So, is it a bot or is it a person? Is it showing up in a place where there\u2019s enough traffic for it to be worth it?Those are really the kinds of questions everybody\u2019s asking, because what you\u2019re really trying to figure out is, where do you want to focus your money to be able to get the most awareness, the most effectiveness, and with the greatest level of efficiency.The issues around brands running on offensive websites and YouTube videos seems like a big departure from the days of P & G funding soap operas and family-oriented shows.The interesting thing about the TV model was that it was free programming paid for by advertisers. I mean, that was it, and radio was the same way. So you get this service for free, but the only price you have to pay is advertising, and that funded it, and that\u2019s essentially what has happened in the digital world.The digital advertising world brought with it user-generated content, and that\u2019s really the big shift, because before, the programs were created by content producers, and then they were bought by media companies who then put programming together, and then advertisers bought advertising on those programs.Are marketers looking for metrics beyond impressions to measure online ads? (Impressions are generally counted each time an ad is shown.)If you think about reach, frequency, impressions \u2014 those are proxies for what the real outcome is that you\u2019d like, which is sales. Where we can get a more direct link to sales, that\u2019s actually preferable if we can possibly do that. There are some ways you can do it with data, but the other ways are if you link up with e-commerce, because then you can get much more of a direct outcome. That\u2019s been around for a while but that\u2019s clearly an area I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see growing.Do the issues around brand safety online make television more appealing to you?We\u2019ll certainly tell our brands to look at all alternatives, and it remains to be seen then whether TV will provide the right value, the right measurement, the right proof and evidence that it\u2019s a good buy, it\u2019s a good value.It\u2019ll all be based on consumer behavior. On TV, people are accustomed to having a commercial interruption. The better networks find ways to make it less interruptive so it\u2019s a better viewing experience. We\u2019re certainly looking for sites where you may have an ad, but it\u2019s not annoying, because you\u2019ve seen this, on some of the ads, pop-ups come, load time takes forever \u2014 it\u2019s all that kind of stuff. We\u2019d rather have a better viewing experience and look for those that can do that.But then there\u2019s some, like the Hulus and Netflix, where they don\u2019t have advertising but we\u2019re still working with them to figure out how we can get at least our brand impressions there. So I think there will be innovations in how advertising is done.Even if you think about the news feed that occurs with Facebook and even a lot of the YouTube videos, you\u2019re talking two or three seconds. So that has created innovation in how we do advertising \u2026 There\u2019s just clever ways where you can do things and get your brand top of mind in a few seconds.I\u2019m not ready to go there yet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Hulu and \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 Revived 2 Careers", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byBut none of this would have been possible without Danny and Fran.Until recently, the production company run by Daniel Wilson, 87, and his business partner, Fran Sears, 70, had more or less been dormant. Work had dried up, and Hollywood had stopped getting in touch many years ago.Whenever the phone rang, they assumed that people were \u201ctrying to find out if we were, in fact, still alive,\u201d Ms. Sears said in a recent interview, laughing.But Mr. Wilson had something special stowed away: He controlled a big chunk of the TV and movie rights to the 1985 Margaret Atwood novel, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which he had made into an otherwise forgettable 1990 feature. If Hulu wanted to bring the story to television, it would have to deal with Daniel Wilson Productions.So through a twist of fate, prescient deal-making and an intensely competitive television landscape \u2014 where studios seem to be willing to turn over any stone to find a hit \u2014 Danny and Fran are back in business.In short order, they had to, among other things, revive a production company that had gone dark and study up on a vastly changed television landscape, in which streaming services were becoming increasingly important. They also had to acquaint themselves with tasks foreign to them \u2014 like creating an online imprint.\u201cWe just looked at each other and said, \u2018Oh, God, we better do this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sears said, about creating a website. \u201cWe\u2019ve been terrible about a Wikipedia page or IMDB. It\u2019s not part of our sensibility.\u201dOn a recent Tuesday in Manhattan, the duo (they are, alas, not a couple) were discussing their unlikely comeback at Mr. Wilson\u2019s Upper East Side apartment. Over the course of an afternoon, Ms. Sears excused herself each time the phone rang. \u201cDaniel Wilson Productions,\u201d she cooed as she answered.A bookshelf in the living room was filled with awards Mr. Wilson had won in the 1970s and \u201980s, including several Emmys. It was difficult to identify what some of the Emmys were for; the plaques were too faded.Though Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears were not in charge of making \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d they found themselves, somewhat surprisingly, in the role of executive producers. They were given a front-row seat to script development, casting and the production process, and offered notes to the writers and executives overseeing the show.They marveled at just how much the business had changed. Television executives nowadays? \u201cMuch less combative,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. And they have been transformed from cigar-chomping titans to, as Ms. Sears put it, \u201cyoung hipster types.\u201dThen there were the dailies, rough cuts from each day of filming. They used to be an exhaustive process that took hours to produce, with filmmakers packing a room to watch poor-quality film reels of scenes shot the day before. Now, Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears could watch high-quality footage from \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d from the comforts of their own homes, at 8 a.m. each day.\u201cI\u2019d get up in the morning, I\u2019d be wandering around, crashing into the wall in my jimjams with a cup of coffee, and I\u2019d watch the dailies and call up Danny and say, \u2018Did you watch that?\u2019\u201d Ms. Sears recalled.Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears met in the 1960s when they were working on a children\u2019s show for ABC. Soon, Daniel Wilson Productions was up and running, and they were making after-school specials with titles like \u201cThe Terrible Secret\u201d and \u201cMe and Dad\u2019s New Wife.\u201dIt was in the late 1980s when, at the suggestion of his wife, Mr. Wilson read \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d the dystopian novel that presents a grim future for women in the United States. Impressed, Mr. Wilson met with Ms. Atwood, secured the film rights to the book and shared them with the independent movie company Cinecom, which helped finance the film.The movie, which starred Robert Duvall and Natasha Richardson and was written by Harold Pinter (Ms. Atwood was not interested in screenwriting), was released in 1990 and was a dud at the box office. (\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as good as perhaps it should have been,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.)Soon, their careers began to wind down. Mr. Wilson learned that his wife had Alzheimer\u2019s, and he put aside work to tend to her. Ms. Sears said she would return to the business only if she actually had passion for a project.\u201cI guess I just didn\u2019t really think that was going to happen,\u201d she said.Then everything changed.\u201cWe realized, \u2018Wait a minute, no, no, no, it\u2019s not all ours,\u201d said Steve Stark, the studio\u2019s president for television development and production. \u201c\u2018We have to call a Danny Wilson. Where\u2019s he at?\u2019 We didn\u2019t know. We couldn\u2019t find him.\u201dIt took some time to track him down, and, initially, Mr. Wilson was unmoved. Cinecom had gone bankrupt, and Mr. Wilson was convinced he owned all the rights to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d In fact, MGM had secured what was once Cinecom\u2019s 50 percent.Even in the sometimes confounding world of Hollywood copyrights, this odyssey was \u201cexceptional,\u201d Mr. Stark said. It took a lengthy negotiation to get Mr. Wilson on board.\u201cWe decided to make him an executive producer, we gave him a nice fee, and we figured it all out,\u201d Mr. Stark said. Mr. Wilson did not disclose financial details, but the deal, if the show reaches a third season (which appears possible, considering the reviews), is expected to be worth $1 million.The show was originally written for Showtime by Ilene Chaiken, a veteran of \u201cThe L Word.\u201d Mr. Wilson did not like her script, which he said was far too \u201cgraphic sexually.\u201d\u201cThey wanted bare-breasted women running around,\u201d he said, sounding exasperated.But Ms. Chaiken was soon tied up with obligations to the new Fox hit \u201cEmpire,\u201d and the story was back on the market. Suddenly, FX and Hulu were neck and neck in pursuit of the series.But Hulu?\u201cFor me, Hulu is where you can watch old episodes of \u2018The Andy Griffith Show,\u2019 if you\u2019re so inclined,\u201d Ms. Sears said.Mr. Wilson was not entirely sure to trust the streaming service until Mr. Stark convinced him it was just fine.\u201cI heard about it from Steve, and I said, \u2018Really?\u2019\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Danny, they\u2019re the new kid on the block; they\u2019re going to back this series to the hilt.\u2019\u201cI said, \u2018Terrific!\u2019\u201dBruce Miller, the new showrunner for \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d wrote scripts that they adored. Elisabeth Moss, a veteran of \u201cMad Men,\u201d seemed ideal to play the main character, Offred. For Hulu, which has failed to match the buzzy original series of rivals like Amazon and Netflix, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d may have finally delivered a drama that can drive up subscriptions.It also didn\u2019t hurt that the Trump administration has made the show\u2019s bleak themes feel more relevant to certain viewers.\u201cIts timing is a hell of a lot better than when the feature was released,\u201d Ms. Sears said. \u201cMargaret\u2019s book was extraordinary, but it was about another time. We didn\u2019t see it coming fast and furious at us the way it is now.\u201dMr. Wilson and Ms. Sears are hopeful that \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is just the beginning of their comeback.And last Friday night, they were able to take their victory lap in earnest.As Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears circled a room in the Beekman Hotel for the show\u2019s premiere party, a remix of Prince\u2019s \u201cRaspberry Beret\u201d blasted at full volume.

But when she and Ms. Theron refused to water down the \u201cGirlboss\u201d concept \u2014 or to ditch the title \u2014 television networks passed. Netflix snapped it up.In the pilot, Sophia is a listless 23-year-old who is allergic to responsibility. She steals a sandwich from her boss and a rug from the side of the street. Only when she finds a cheap vintage jacket and decides to style it and flip it on eBay \u2014 the spark of what becomes a dizzyingly successful online fashion business \u2014 is she challenged to grow up.\u201cI wanted to be able to show how mad she was at the beginning,\u201d Ms. Cannon said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very real response when you\u2019re lost, rudderless and don\u2019t know what your life is about.\u201d If the show had ended up on a network, \u201cI don\u2019t know if we would have been able to really capture that element,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you find her off-putting at the beginning, you\u2019re going to turn the channel.\u201dAdapting Ms. Amoruso\u2019s story for television meant exaggerating her highs and lows. The Sophia of the pilot is more aggressive and less mature than the real woman was. \u201cI am very proud to have not been a petty thief at the time I started my business,\u201d Ms. Amoruso said. \u201cI had outgrown that by the time eBay rolled around.\u201d What\u2019s true, she added, is this: \u201cI was a really lost 23-year-old, and I had no idea what my talents were yet.\u201dMs. Robertson described creating the fictional Sophia as a balancing act. \u201cI was told, \u2018We need her to be tenacious, we need her to be passionate, we need her to be driven, and we need her to be smart and dumb and weird,\u2019 and all of these things that make her appealing to audiences,\u201d she said.\u201cBut she also has a very specific following, so we wanted to cater certain parts of the character to the audience that has followed her and supported her.\u201dPart of the challenge for Ms. Cannon in creating the character was that she was based on a colleague: Ms. Amoruso is an executive producer on the show. \u201cAaron Sorkin wasn\u2019t hanging and having dinners with Mark Zuckerberg,\u201d Ms. Cannon acknowledged, referencing \u201cThe Social Network.\u201dBut she said that she was impressed by Ms. Amoruso\u2019s openness about her own mistakes. Ms. Amoruso contributed styling advice, sometimes lending items from her own closet, and weighed in on anecdotal material from her past. \u201cBeyond that, when there is a show being made about your life, it\u2019s best to stay out of the way, because the last thing you want to be is the person meddling to preserve their reputation,\u201d Ms. Amoruso said.But to Ms. Cannon, the spots and stains in Ms. Amoruso\u2019s success story only give her more material to turn into compelling television. \u201cThat\u2019s all storytelling for us in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Netflix were to give us more seasons, we\u2019d explore her catapult into success and all the problems that come with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Pai said that he agreed with the broad principles of net neutrality but that the rules, created by the commission in 2015, went too far in restricting broadband providers.\u201cI think they were appreciative,\u201d Mr. Pai said of the tech companies. \u201cI have been soliciting thoughts on online protections.\u201dMr. Pai said on Thursday that he wanted to overturn the declaration of broadband as a utility-like service, which puts stricter rules on broadband providers, akin to what phone services face today.Facebook and Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Pai\u2019s remarks. The Internet Association, a trade group that represents Facebook, Google and Netflix, recently met with Mr. Pai and urged him to keep the rules intact.A Cisco spokeswoman said Mr. Pai had asked the company\u2019s chief executive, Chuck Robbins, to gather some Silicon Valley leaders to discuss the future of net neutrality. The informal discussion was held at Cisco\u2019s campus in San Jose, Calif., the spokeswoman said.In a statement, Oracle said its discussion with Mr. Pai this week was broad and did not address any specific policy proposals currently under consideration. Oracle has previously said it supports Mr. Pai\u2019s agenda, and its meetings with him have included one with the company\u2019s chief executive, Safra Catz, who was on Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team.The commission\u2019s direction under Mr. Pai has alarmed consumer groups. Michael Copps, a former Democratic commissioner, said companies like AT&T and Comcast that have heavily lobbied the commission to roll back rules would directly benefit from the recent actions.\u201cThis is the price we pay for the outrageous influence of money in politics,\u201d said Mr. Copps, a special adviser to the consumer group Common Cause. \u201cThe public interest suffers, and we are poorer \u2014 economically and civically \u2014 for it.\u201dIn votes split down party lines on Thursday, Mr. Pai pushed forward a plan that will ease standards to allow telecom carriers like AT&T and CenturyLink to raise fees for small businesses, wireless carriers, hospitals and libraries to connect to the main arteries of their broadband networks. AT&T and other telecom giants had heavily lobbied for the new rule.In a dramatic reversal from the Obama administration, which was pushing for caps on pricing, Mr. Pai said telecom companies should have more freedom to set their own rates. \u201cPrice regulation threatens competition and investment,\u201d he said.The commission also approved a separate proposal easing restrictions on broadcast television corporations seeking to buy more stations. Mignon Clyburn, the Democratic commissioner, voted against the proposal and warned that greater media consolidation would give fewer companies a bigger voice.\u201cThis is industry consolidation month\u201d at the F.C.C., she said.Advertisement"}

Critics of the Murdochs have been eager to draw the connection.In a letter to Ofcom last week, Lisa Bloom, a lawyer representing Wendy Walsh, one of Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s accusers, wrote that \u201cthe similarities between the current harassment scandal and the phone-hacking scandal reveal the company\u2019s approach to business and management \u2014 a lack of oversight, intervention, and decency.\u201dMr. O\u2019Reilly has said the claims against him are unfounded.\u201cI am sure that Ofcom has asked questions about every single misconduct issue anywhere in the world, and above all in the U.S.,\u201d she said.Ms. Enders and other analysts believe that the deal will ultimately be approved, but it is also clear that Sky is an asset the Murdochs do not want to risk losing out on a second time. That appears to be particularly true of James Murdoch, who is the chief executive of 21st Century Fox and the chairman of Sky.\u201cIt will set up his future as a chief executive officer,\u201d Ms. Enders said.Sky is both a giant cable and broadband provider in Britain and a producer of shows like \u201cThe Young Pope,\u201d the Jude Law vehicle that Sky developed with HBO and Canal+. It has divisions in Italy and Germany and deals with Britain\u2019s Premier League and the Bundesliga soccer league in Germany. Its Sky Atlantic channel has rights to American hits like \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dFrom a business perspective, the timing of the deal is good.Sky has a reasonable valuation, and it has become highly profitable. It also has direct experience with consumers that 21st Century Fox lacks, as a provider of cable and broadband services and through NowTV, its rival to Netflix. That expertise is valuable at a time when many consumers are abandoning bundled cable offerings.\u201cA generic problem for a lot of media companies everywhere, in the U.K. or the U.S., is, how do you crack the direct-to-consumer nut?\u201d said Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citigroup. \u201cAnd here is a company that has been doing it very successfully, and that\u2019s part of the consideration alongside the cheap valuation, the weak sterling, and the fact that the group just throws off a lot of cash.\u201dMr. Singlehurst said he expected that the government would ultimately approve the deal.\u201cAt the end of the day, you do have to have proper evidence of something that has gone wrong, and that evidence has to have been provided definitively one way or the other, most likely in a court of law,\u201d he said.With the fit-and-proper test, Ofcom is trying to determine whether the people who would be running the company are fit to do so. While relatively rare, the test is familiar to the Murdochs. The last such review by Ofcom began in 2011, and also examined the fitness of Sky, then called British Sky Broadcasting, amid a bid by News Corporation to acquire full control of the company.It is not even certain that the review of the pending Sky deal would encompass actions that have taken place in the United States.\u201cWe\u2019ve been listening to a range of views around what we should consider relevant to the current \u2018fit and proper test,\u2019\u201d said Joe Smithies, a spokesman for Ofcom.Speaking generally, Mr. Smithies added: \u201cWe have an ongoing duty to be satisfied that holders of our broadcasting licenses are fit and proper, and that duty is a legal obligation from the Broadcasting Act, and it\u2019s something we take very seriously.\u201d\u201cIn considering whether any licensee is fit and proper, we would take into account any relevant misconduct of those who manage and control a broadcast licensee,\u201d he said.Tom Watson, the deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, said in a statement that it was \u201cimportant that full and proper process is followed in the assessment of this bid.\u201d\u201cI have consistently argued Ofcom must consider the serious and systemic corporate governance failures at Fox as part of its inquiry into whether the company should be allowed to take full control of Sky,\u201d he added.A spokeswoman for 21st Century Fox pointed to previous statements by the company. One said the company was \u201cconfident that the proposed transaction will be approved following a thorough review process\u201d; a second said that the company \u201ctakes its regulatory and compliance obligations very seriously. We have a strong record of compliance in all our markets, including in the U.K.\u201dSky declined to comment.Emily Steel contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Internet Privacy, VPNs Are an Imperfect Shield", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byTech FixA VPN was a natural service to consider in response. That\u2019s because the technology creates a virtual tunnel that shields your browsing information from your internet service provider. So Mr. Wilmot researched VPNs in hopes of protecting his own browsing data.\u201cI don\u2019t really want anybody to have any sort of access to what I\u2019m looking at,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone is going to profit off my privacy, I\u2019d prefer it to be me.\u201dBut while VPNs are worth considering, they are an incomplete and flawed solution. For one thing, they often slow down internet speeds significantly. Some apps and services may also stop working properly when you are connected to a virtual network.Still, VPNs are among several tools for better protecting your digital privacy. Here\u2019s an overview of the pros and cons, based on tests of VPN services and interviews with security experts.When you browse the web, a broadband provider helps route your device\u2019s internet traffic to each destination website. Each device you use has an identifier consisting of a string of numbers, also known as an IP address. When you are on the internet, a service provider can see which devices you use and which sites you visit.VPNs help cloak your browsing information from your internet provider. When you use VPN software, your device connects to a VPN provider\u2019s servers. That way, all your web traffic passes through the VPN provider\u2019s internet connection. So if your internet provider was trying to listen in on your web traffic, all it would see is the VPN server\u2019s IP address connected to the VPN service.\u201cWe provide you an encrypted tunnel from you to us,\u201d said Sean Sullivan, a security adviser for F-Secure, a Finland-based company that offers a VPN called Freedome.VPNs are especially handy when you are connecting to a public Wi-Fi network with which you aren\u2019t familiar. For example, when you use public Wi-Fi at a cafe, airport or hotel, it\u2019s often unclear who the service provider is and what its data collection policies entail. In this scenario, a VPN is highly recommended.VPNs also have the ability to make it appear as though your device is connecting from a different location. So if you are in Europe, traveling to Spain from France, and want to stream content that is only viewable in France, you could connect to a VPN server whose IP address is in France.VPN services have their downsides, and the biggest one is speed degradation. Because your internet traffic passes through a VPN provider\u2019s connection, you will likely see a dip in broadband performance.Speeds will vary depending on the VPN provider\u2019s infrastructure. In my tests with a Mac, download speeds dropped about 85 percent after connecting to F-Secure\u2019s Freedome VPN service, and by 50 percent when connected to another VPN service called Private Internet Access. In other words, if you are downloading large files over a VPN, it will take much longer to accomplish those tasks.Another drawback is that VPN services cost money. F-Secure charges $4.17 a month to use its service for a year on three devices, and Private Internet Access charges $6.95 per month or $40 a year on five devices. That\u2019s not a lot of money, but broadband service is generally expensive, and tacking on a few extra dollars a month to use the internet more privately can be annoying.In addition, some services may not work properly on a VPN. Netflix often blocks them to keep people from streaming content that is not licensed for their regions. In tests with Freedome and Private Internet Access, I tried connecting to a server in Mexico to stream the catalog of Netflix movies available there. With both VPN services, Netflix detected I was using a VPN and prevented movies from playing.For VPN providers, this is a known issue. F-Secure\u2019s Mr. Sullivan said that when services like Netflix block VPNs, they are probably \u201cputting up a fight for Hollywood.\u201dThere are hundreds of VPNs on the market, and vetting them can be overwhelming.Runa Sandvik, a director of information security for The New York Times, said that consumers should be scrupulous about reading privacy policies and selecting a VPN they can trust. That\u2019s because a VPN service is also tied to an internet service provider, meaning a VPN provider could share your information with the service provider if it wanted to do so.Based on those recommendations, I tried Private Internet Access and Freedome for my tests. Both products were easy to use: Just install an app on your smartphone, computer or tablet and hit a button to connect to a server. In the end, I preferred Private Internet Access because of its faster speeds.All things considered, VPN is only a partial solution for keeping your browsing data private.\u201cThe real problem is ads are dangerous,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company. \u201cThey\u2019re fully functioning programs and they carry malware.\u201dWith VPNs, most people would probably be better off using them when it seems necessary \u2014 and turning them off when they are not needed. The slowdown in speed is the biggest negative and makes constant use impractical.Many people would probably benefit from using a VPN in certain situations, like when they are connected to a public Wi-Fi network or are browsing sensitive websites. But for watching Netflix or sending emails with large attachments? Turn the VPN off.For Mr. Wilmot, the Los Angeles musician, the slow speeds of internet downloading spurred by VPNs were a dealbreaker. In the end, he opted against getting one at all.\u201cIf I don\u2019t have lightning-fast internet 24 hours a day, it inhibits my workflow and affects deadlines,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019m accidentally relaxing into that kind of \u2018What can you do?\u2019 mentality. There\u2019s no good option.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Strobel\u2019s character \u201cis a skeptic who says he\u2019s being evenhanded and unbiased but he\u2019s looking to debunk Christianity so he\u2019s not as unbiased as he should be.\u201d\u201cI got to make out with his wife for \u2018Mercy Streets,\u2019\u201d Mr. White said with a big laugh.Mr. Gunn said, \u201cAndrea and I are still waiting for our turn.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s getting chilly in here,\u201d Mr. White said. Ms. White, who met her husband at a church in Malibu, Calif., when she had blond dreadlocks and was working as a personal trainer, rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a rainbow-and-unicorn Christian,\u201d she said later.The world of faith-based entertainment feels small and interconnected in this way. Eamonn McCrystal is an Irish tenor whose music career is managed by Elizabeth Travis, the country singer Randy Travis\u2019s ex-wife and ex-manager who is also a Pure Flix partner. Mr. McCrystal, who played an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in Pure Flix\u2019s \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead 2,\u201d strolled amid the friends and family of the film\u2019s cast and crew as Ms. Travis walked the red carpet. He carried a cellphone in a leather case that made it look like a little Bible. \u201cOh, you\u2019re the one that Donald Trump hates,\u201d he said after meeting a reporter for The New York Times.Mr. and Ms. White would also like to star in a reality show. After the success of \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead\u201d in 2014, they took meetings with network executives but the discussions went nowhere.In part \u201cit was a faith thing,\u201d Mr. White said.\u201cThe major networks like the audience of faith,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut when you have to go to the audience and say faith things on television, well, we might be too open.\u201dMs. White responded, \u201cThey\u2019re worried we\u2019ll make the audience uncomfortable, like Jesus freaks.\u201d\u201cI think the climate is different now,\u201d Mr. White said of producing a reality show based on an evangelical Christian family. \u201cI think it eventually will happen.\u201d\u201cWe need to reach a broader audience,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said, \u201cbecause we want to get the moral lessons out.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Christian film and television studio Pure Flix misstated the name of the publisher of \u201cBetween Heaven and Hollywood.\u201d It is Zondervan, not Zonverdan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the South Bronx, Lives Marred and Erased by Firearms", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byMurder in the 4-0Daniel Rice and Kevin Thomas were living emblems of the ravages of gun violence in the South Bronx.Mr. Rice found trouble with striking regularity, despite being in a wheelchair since a bullet hit his spine two decades earlier. Mr. Thomas had been shot twice before and carried two slugs in his body from the first attack, in 2011, when he took eight bullets to the torso.One weekend last October, the men came face to face in the Mott Haven Houses, the authorities say.Mr. Rice, 39, rolled his wheelchair into a small fenced courtyard where an impromptu birthday party was in progress, accompanied by his brother, Darrell, and three friends, the police said. He wore dreadlocks, glasses and a black down vest.Mr. Thomas, 28, rose to to meet them. It was about 1:50 a.m. on Sunday, Oct. 23. Known as Biggie, Mr. Thomas stood 6-foot-3 and weighed about 300 pounds. He had been expecting trouble for weeks, his friends said. He told his mother that the Rice brothers might be looking for him because he had beaten up their uncle.Mr. Rice and Mr. Thomas had long arrest records on charges including crack dealing and gun possession. Both had served time in prison. Both had been suspects in other shootings. Both were feared figures in the Mott Haven Houses and the nearby Patterson Houses, projects notorious for gun violence and feuds between street gangs.The guns are used not only in crimes like robbery and drug dealing, but also in a struggle for respect in some of the city\u2019s most impoverished neighborhoods.That Sunday morning, security cameras recorded a confrontation in the courtyard, the police said. Mr. Rice\u2019s brother, Darrell, walked up to Mr. Thomas and threw the first punch, detectives said. Mr. Thomas absorbed the blow, unfazed, and took off his jacket, squaring up to brawl. Then Daniel Rice, who calls himself Capone, drew a .45-caliber pistol, leveled it at Mr. Thomas and, investigators believe, started firing. Ten bullets tore into Mr. Thomas\u2019s chest, arms, legs and groin.He went down on his belly, blood fanning out. He had a puzzled look, said a friend who arrived just after the shooting but did not witness it.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even talk,\u201d the friend said, asking that his name not be published for fear of the Rice family. \u201cHe died right in my arms right there on the floor. I watched him take his last breath.\u201dThe Rices left the scene with no evident alarm, Darrell Rice pushing his brother calmly toward Willis Avenue, detectives said. They headed several blocks west on East 141st Street and disappeared into an apartment building, their retreat recorded by security cameras along the way.\u201cHe knows no one is ratting him out because they are scared of him,\u201d Detective Oscar Rosa, the lead investigator, said a few days later. \u201cThey fear him.\u201dSigns of gun violence are ubiquitous in the 4-0, which has some of the highest rates of shootings and of gun seizures in the city. Bullet holes pock walls in the area\u2019s projects and the doors of some all-night bodegas. On the sidewalks, wounded men in the prime of life walk with canes or ride in wheelchairs.Gunshots at night are not uncommon in and around the Mott Haven and Patterson projects, residents say. So many shootings between warring crews have occurred along East 143rd Street near Third Avenue \u2014 the nexus between the two developments \u2014 that the police have raised extra lights and an observation tower with cameras.\u201cYou have to have a gun to protect yourself,\u201d said Jesus DeJesus, 46, one of Mr. Rice\u2019s friends. \u201cIt\u2019s the norm.\u201dStill, criminologists say there are small zones where shootings remain a stubborn problem, particularly in public housing complexes, where one in five New York City shootings happen. And agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives say the flow of guns into the city has not diminished, despite efforts to crack down on gunrunners.Guns produce money in New York: A pistol bought for $200 out of state can go for $700 on Brook Avenue in the Bronx. But unlike many drug dealers, gunrunners tend to rely on personal connections and rarely sell in the open, federal officials said. New Yorkers visiting relatives in Virginia or Ohio, for instance, may take orders from people they know and buy guns at pawn shops, at sporting-goods stores, at gun shows or from private sellers, then haul them back, often on economy buses run out of Chinatown, law enforcement officials said. The sales are sometimes arranged on social media, they said.The firearms remain in circulation for decades, being resold again and again, studies show. Some are kept by street gangs as community weapons, stashed in mailboxes, trash cans or the wheel wells of cars, available to use at a moment\u2019s notice, the officials said.In 2015, about 3,674 guns were recovered in the city, with 89 percent of them originating in other states, according to the state attorney general\u2019s office. The Bronx had the most guns recovered per capita in the city, with 902, or 62 for every 100,000 residents. Brooklyn was close behind, with 55 for every 100,000. The South Bronx and northern Brooklyn are also where two-thirds to three-quarters of the city\u2019s shootings take place, Chief Shea said.A 30-year-old man who helps run a heroin-dealing operation in the 40th Precinct said that procuring a gun was simple. \u201cI can walk down the street and buy a gun right now,\u201d said the dealer, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified by name. \u201cIt\u2019s probably used. It\u2019s probably got a body. Somebody\u2019s going to sell it to you.\u201dFive days after he was killed, Mr. Thomas was laid out in a dust-blue coffin with a floral pattern at the Porta Coeli San German Funeral Home on Westchester Avenue. His mother, Rosa Martinez, sat opposite him on a couch, while his girlfriend, Shantice Murphy, handed out prayer cards with his photo.His uncle, James Thomas, a Brooklyn pastor, implored the mourners not to seek vengeance. \u201cThis pain we are going through in my family \u2014 I don\u2019t want any of my loved ones causing it to someone else,\u201d he said.Ms. Martinez said most of her children managed to find jobs and move out of the Mott Haven Houses, but not Kevin, her third and most impulsive son. He began smoking marijuana and getting in trouble with the law when he was 12 years old, around the same time she separated from his father, remarried and moved into the development.She lost control over him, she said. When he was 14, she persuaded a judge to send him to a state-financed boarding school for troubled teens in Westchester County. But he ran away twice and eventually dropped out. Soon he was dealing crack and marijuana behind 350 East 143rd Street, a high-rise in the Mott Haven complex.Mr. Thomas\u2019s family said he seemed happy hustling his nights away in the courtyard, selling drugs, smoking marijuana, bingeing on Netflix and doing as little as he could for money \u2014 not much of it legal. \u201cI can\u2019t say he was an ambitious person, like he had dreams and goals,\u201d said Kary Thomas, his sister. \u201cHe just lived for the moment. He worried about having the latest Jordans, MCM belts and being in fashion, being popular.\u201dBesides stylish clothes and Hennessy Cognac, Mr. Thomas had one other obvious passion: a shiny red motor scooter. He would race around Upper Manhattan and the South Bronx, his huge frame barely fitting on the seat as the machine careened around corners.At 19, he was arrested in the courtyard with his best friend, Alex Martinez, on charges that they tried to kill a father and son. According to court papers, Mr. Thomas was charged with attempted murder after he pistol-whipped the son, Angel Cruz Jr., and tried to shoot him. The gun went off three times during the struggle, hitting Mr. Martinez. Arrested on drug charges while out on bail, Mr. Thomas later pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to nine months in jail.Over the next four years, Mr. Thomas was arrested more than a dozen times on assault, weapons possession and drug-selling charges. He pleaded guilty in March 2009 to selling crack cocaine and was diverted into a drug-treatment program. But he failed to attend, and in February 2012, a judge sentenced him to three years in prison.When he wasn\u2019t behind bars, Mr. Thomas would occasionally find his own place to stay, usually a cheap rental, but always ended up back at his mother\u2019s place. He worked off and on as a janitor and hauled boxes around a warehouse.But mainly he sold drugs, always with the same cadre of friends in the fenced courtyard behind 350 East 143rd Street. He operated independently of other dealers and often fought with them, the police said. \u201cHe sold whatever he wanted; he sold to whomever he wanted,\u201d Detective Rosa said. \u201cThere were no rules in his game.\u201dMr. Thomas\u2019s sister said he enjoyed intimidating rivals. \u201cHe was a never-back-down type of person,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like anybody really liked him. They feared him. That was the problem. They feared him.\u201dHis pugnacity led to trouble. In July 2011, Mr. Thomas became embroiled in a fight with Jamel Fielder, then 21, a diminutive man from the Patterson Houses known as Pee-wee. Mr. Thomas stripped Mr. Fielder of a gun near the Mott Haven Houses and shot him in the buttocks as he ran away, the police said.A month later, Mr. Fielder ambushed Mr. Thomas as he emerged from a pizza shop, shooting him eight times as he crossed the street, the police said. Mr. Thomas collapsed on a metal bench, a half-eaten pizza slice still in his hand, according to the police and the account of a witness. Doctors could remove only six of the slugs, and Mr. Thomas was left with long scars on his torso and arms. (Mr. Fielder was charged with attempted murder but later pleaded guilty to gun possession and received a two-year prison sentence.)After the attack, Mr. Thomas\u2019s mother tried to be moved to an apartment in a different project, arguing that her family had been traumatized. But she was never relocated. Once her son recovered, he went right back to selling in the courtyard, she said, despite her pleas.In September 2015, Mr. Thomas again became a shooting victim. It happened after he accused another person in his circle of having been an informant in a federal drug case and took a swipe at him with a knife, according to one witness. The man shot Mr. Thomas in the leg, leaving him with a limp.Though the police arrested a suspect in the shooting, Mr. Thomas refused to testify and the charges were eventually dropped, the police said. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I say something, they\u2019ll come and kill me and all of us,\u2019\u201d his mother recalled.Among the people who regularly bought crack from Mr. Thomas was Joshua Rice, 57, an addict known as Pop Bucket because he carried a pail and rags everywhere. He washed cars to earn drug money. He was Daniel Rice\u2019s uncle, though he had little regular contact with his relatives and could not be located for comment.Sometime in early October \u2014 no one is sure of the date \u2014 Mr. Thomas gave Joshua Rice a few dollars to wash his prized motor scooter, but the older man never got around to the chore, the police said. Angry, Mr. Thomas confronted Mr. Rice and broke his jaw, the police said.That night, Mr. Thomas told his mother he had been warned the Rice brothers might retaliate. \u201cHe told me his family said they are going to come for him,\u201d Ms. Martinez recalled. Daniel Rice was especially feared, known to carry a pistol secreted in his wheelchair, several acquaintances said.Mr. Rice and his lawyer declined requests to be interviewed for this article. So did his father, his daughter, two of his uncles, his grandmother and several other relatives. Efforts to contact Darrell Rice at his apartment and on the telephone were unsuccessful.The details of the shooting that left him without full use of his legs remain murky. Whatever the cause, it did not deter Mr. Rice from committing crimes. Starting in 1994, he was arrested three times on charges of gun possession and ended up serving a three-year stint in prison after guilty plea.He had been out on parole for just five months when the police barged into his family\u2019s apartment in May 2002, searching for Darrell Rice, who had fled the police and left behind a car full of crack. The officers did not catch him that night, but they found Daniel in his bedroom with a gun and a large quantity of cocaine. This time, he was charged in federal court, where sentences for gun crimes are stiffer.During court proceedings, Daniel Rice\u2019s lawyers argued that the shooting that put their client in a wheelchair as a teenager had left him psychologically scarred. Paranoid about another attack, he had developed an \u201cinfatuation with guns,\u201d his lawyers said.But prosecutors noted the evidence that Mr. Rice dealt drugs. \u201cRice is a crack dealer who also uses guns, not a person scared of being the victim of another random shooting,\u201d the prosecutor, Steven D. Feldman, argued in papers.In the end, Mr. Rice was sentenced to 10 years in a federal penitentiary.After he returned in 2012, he demanded that young people in the projects show him respect, a former friend said, and he talked tough with men like Mr. Thomas, almost daring them to mock him for his disability.\u201cHe\u2019s not to be played with,\u201d the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIt was a lot of people testing him because he was in a wheelchair.\u201dThe man who was with Mr. Thomas when he died said he also had known Mr. Rice for more than 20 years. He said that Mr. Rice was quick to brandish a pistol if he felt slighted. \u201cHe really thinks he\u2019s Al Capone and people owe him and his family respect,\u201d the man said. \u201cHe was a bitter guy.\u201dMs. Martinez \u2014 Mr. Thomas\u2019s mother \u2014 said she could see the spot where he died from the window of his room. She sat there often after he was buried at a cemetery in New Jersey and thought about how he had been murdered \u201cfor slapping\u201d Joshua Rice. \u201cEvery little fight, they take out a gun,\u201d Ms. Martinez said. \u201cYou lose a life for nothing.\u201dIt did not take long for the 40th Precinct\u2019s detective squad to hear chatter that Mr. Rice was behind the shooting, and investigators believed that the man in the wheelchair with long dreadlocks seen on security camera footage matched his description.Still, they waited to question him. The images were too grainy to make out the shooter\u2019s face clearly. As a rule, detectives in the Bronx rarely charge someone on video evidence alone, because a defense lawyer can easily cast doubt on the identification. The investigators needed a witness to confirm the shooter\u2019s identity.\u201dThey\u2019re both scared to death,\u201d said Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the squad commander.Tests on shell casings at the scene linked the gun used to kill Mr. Thomas to another shooting. And the police had evidence that Mr. Rice had provided the pistol used in an additional attack, the 2014 shooting of Latroy Tarver, another Mott Haven man with a history of drug offenses.With no witnesses, Detective Rosa thought the only way to move the case forward was to ask federal prosecutors to step in and use racketeering laws to wrap the three crimes together in one indictment against Mr. Rice.Then the squad caught a break. In late November, the police arrested a man on unrelated charges who said he had seen Mr. Thomas get shot.Sergeant LoPuzzo said he was skeptical at first. \u201cI said, \u2018I ain\u2019t interested in what you heard in the street.\u2019 He says, \u2018I didn\u2019t hear anything, I was there,\u2019 and everything fell into place.\u201dOnce they had a witness, the detectives persuaded a judge to let them track Mr. Rice\u2019s cellphone to locate him. On Jan. 20, it pinged in a barber shop at Westchester and Waterbury Avenues. Mr. Rice, fresh from a haircut, was arrested as he left the shop. He had a loaded Glock pistol tucked under his belt, according to a criminal complaint.Back at the station house, detectives helped Mr. Rice up the stairs, half-carrying him to an interview room. He asked for a lawyer right away. \u201cHe was kind of laughing,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said. \u201cLike he wasn\u2019t taking anything seriously.\u201dIt turned out the gun he was carrying was not the one used in the shooting of Mr. Thomas. Still, the detectives held him on a gun possession charge, and four days later, prosecutors brought the witness before a grand jury and obtained a murder indictment.At his arraignment, Mr. Rice pleaded not guilty and complained to Justice William I. Mogulescu that his court-appointed lawyer had prevented him from testifying before the grand jury. \u201cYou are telling me I have no right to go before the grand jury?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want this lawyer. I want to go before the grand jury.\u201dDuring his next appearance, Mr. Rice sounded nonchalant as he pleaded not guilty to the gun possession charge. As he was wheeled out, he yelled \u201cI love you\u201d to his adult daughter, then glanced at a reporter in the court, smiled and said, \u201cCheese!\u201dBenjamin Mueller and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Steve Martin on Teaching You (and Himself) How to Be a Comedian", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byA Word With\u201cI definitely tried to make it about creativity and also about life,\u201d Mr. Martin said in an interview on Friday. \u201cAll my thoughts about comedy are metaphorical, applying to anything else.\u201dMr. Martin spoke further about why he returned to this chapter of his career, what lessons it offers and the extent to which he keeps up with comedy today. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.What made you want to do a project like this now?I\u2019ve always had empathy with comedians and their struggle. I know it inside out, and the struggles remain the same. I\u2019m always rooting for comedians, especially now that I\u2019m older. Your competitive edge is off. You don\u2019t have to worry about somebody being funnier. Because, as I say, there\u2019s always someone funnier.Is it fair to say you shy away from invitations to talk about that era of your career \u2014 the retrospective thing does not come easily for you?Yeah. You can only talk about it so much. And then there\u2019s diminishing interest in the old you, both from the public and yourself. About 20 years ago, Kevin Kline called me and said: \u201cI\u2019m teaching a course at Juilliard in comedy. Would you like to stop by and talk?\u201d And I thought: There\u2019s nothing you can teach about comedy. I don\u2019t know what that would even be. But I went to the class, and they did some scenes, and I thought, Oh, there is a lot to teach. Through the years, I\u2019ve gathered some knowledge that can be transferred. I actually feel more creative in the last 10 years than I have in that whole time.When you were starting out, did you have people you considered mentors or instructors?One of your episodes is about constructing a stage persona, an idealized version of who you want to be in performance. Is this what you thought you were doing at the time?Certainly, it\u2019s an evolution. It\u2019s not a ray of light that strikes you. When I first started to think, \u201cI\u2019ve got to be a person up there \u2014 how do I be a person?,\u201d all I did was take jokes that said \u201cA guy walks into a bar\u201d and change it to \u201cI walked into a bar.\u201d That was a simple thing to think about. You make everything about yourself.There\u2019s a moment after the fact where you realize, oh, I\u2019m constructing something. At first, you\u2019re just trying to make it through the 15 minutes. There\u2019s absolutely no ideological thing going on \u2014 you\u2019re just trying to survive. But what comes is the Platonic version, which is pure. Then you try to have the real version live up to the Platonic version that\u2019s in your head.Does it feel weird to be talking about a Platonic ideal of stand-up comedy?I studied philosophy in college, so I default to those few references that remain.Was there a point, at your peak, where audiences were coming just for the persona and not the material \u2014 that essentially anything you delivered in that guise worked?I found it was actually almost the reverse of what you\u2019re saying. Because once that persona was established, it was very hard to bring in new material. The thing that was expected was so precise. And I loved being precise onstage. I didn\u2019t want to mess with it. But the only way out was to stop. But I had a great place to go \u2014 the movies.Did you help choose your vintage stand-up and movie clips in the lessons?I only saw those after the fact. I always let other people choose the bits, because I don\u2019t know what works today. I like the idea that someone who wasn\u2019t even born in that era is picking them.What does that spare you from?Having to look at it, for one thing. But also having to understand what works today. Unfortunately, most comedy is ephemeral. People want their own generation of comedy. You look at an old single-panel cartoon from the 1890s, you struggle to figure out what was funny about it. It\u2019s a lengthy paragraph, as opposed to a Roz Chast cartoon in The New Yorker.When you work on a project like this, does it make you want to do stand-up again?By doing this project, are you saying, in a sense, I\u2019m putting this era of my life to bed?You tell a story in one of the episodes about seeing a prime performance from Sam Kinison, whose world did not exactly intersect with yours. Did you get something out of that experience?Oh, yeah. You know when someone\u2019s killing it. But not always immediately. Sometimes it takes a couple of weeks to think about it. You have to go, What did I just see? I say the goal is not to be good \u2014 it\u2019s to be great. The idea is to have the audience leave, and say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to see this.\u201d You have to work backwards from that result.Do you keep up with what\u2019s happening in stand-up now?How do you think the Steve Martin of the 1970s would react to the work you\u2019re doing today?Advertisement"}

She asked the officers in charge of her holding cell in a police station in Queens for a sanitary pad.Sure, they said. But they would need to call an ambulance to get one.After about an hour and a half, they produced a sterile gauze pad, apparently obtained from an ambulance. It was the kind of rectangular gauze used to bandage an arm, with no adhesive.It might seem strange that a place where female suspects are held would not have something as basic as a sanitary pad. Ms. Oldfield-Parker\u2019s story reflects the way menstruation can be treated in New York\u2019s jails: as an inconvenience, almost a surprise, to be met, at times, with an improvised response. Simple supplies like pads and tampons can become bargaining chips, used to maintain control by correction officers, or traded among incarcerated women, according to former inmates and advocates on the issue.Each level of incarceration in New York has a different policy (or no policy) related to menstruation. Ms. Oldfield-Parker\u2019s cell had no supplies. But in the state\u2019s prisons and jails, these women and advocates say, inconsistent access to tampons and pads has less to do with stock and more to do with power. The facilities have enough supplies, but they are not available equally to all the women who need them.At the Rose M. Singer Center on Rikers Island, where about 600 women usually are imprisoned, pads and tampons are distributed weekly. It\u2019s up to officers to determine how the pads reach the women: Some leave them out in a bucket or box; others hand them out to individual women who ask.Since the distribution is left up to individual officers, there is an easy opportunity for mishandling.BettyAnn Whaley, 56, who was released from Rikers last June and now lives in the North Bronx, said pads were accessible \u201cseven out of 10 times,\u201d though they were a flimsy version of what you might buy at a store. Tampons were harder to get.\u201cThey were only given to certain housing units,\u201d Ms. Whaley said in an interview after her release. And even then, she added, \u201cthey were only dispensed to certain individuals \u2014 you had to be sort of chummy-chummy in order to receive them.\u201d\u201cIt turns you on yourself,\u201d Ms. Bozelko said. \u201cYou start to hate your body.\u201dIn both state and city facilities in New York, women recalled humiliating experiences related to getting what they needed.Christine, 24, who requested that her surname not be used because she is incarcerated upstate, said she would never forget what happened to her at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a maximum-security women\u2019s prison in Westchester County that serves as a reception center for newcomers. She was going to be transferred to another prison, so her father came to visit her. She had her period and had not been given any pads. After the visit, she was strip-searched as blood ran down her legs. The female correction officer was cruel, she said.\u201cShe was telling me how disgusting I was, \u2018It\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was so embarrassed.\u201dWhen asked about the episode, a spokesman for the State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, which oversees New York\u2019s state prisons, wrote that the agency was \u201ccontinuously reviewing its policies to best meet female inmates\u2019 personal hygiene needs.\u201d The spokesman added that under departmental policy, \u201cfemale inmates are provided sanitary napkins on an as-needed basis.\u201dMs. Whaley recalled an episode at Rikers when a correction officer threw a bag of tampons into the air and watched as inmates dived to the ground to retrieve them, because they didn\u2019t know when they would next be able to get tampons.The city\u2019s Correction Department, which manages Rikers, looked into the matter after being questioned about it, but said there was no way for it to confirm that it had occurred. The department said that with an average of 500 grievances filed a year at the Singer Center, none in the past three years had been related to menstrual hygiene.Name-brand tampons are available at the jail commissary for about $4 a box, though some women can\u2019t afford them. At Rikers, women said tampons were valuable enough that they could be traded for a bag of chips or a pack of coffee.This sense of scarcity was echoed at other facilities: Frances McMurry, who had been incarcerated at Taconic Correctional Facility, a medium-security prison in Bedford Hills, N.Y., through last September, said sanitary products were \u201ca higher currency than sugar, coffee and cigarettes.\u201dMs. Bozelko said she was often asked about a scene from the Netflix series \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d in which the protagonist wears shower shoes made out of sanitary napkins. Though she recalled that some incarcerated women used pads for other purposes, Ms. Bozelko said she could not understand it.\u201cI\u2019d rather get foot fungus than waste those things,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to go to war for each one of them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Antipodes\u2019 and Ambiguous Brainstorming", "Date": "2017-06-11", "News": "Supported byOne character in this endlessly fascinating work, which opened on Sunday in a Signature Theater production, puts the number of variations at 10. Another insists it\u2019s six. And still another has come up with 36 versions, though when he itemizes them, he only reaches 19.Whatever the quantity, it\u2019s hard to imagine a work that touches on as many of those possibilities as \u201cThe Antipodes,\u201d or makes as strong a case for the pervasiveness of storytelling in all aspects of our existence. What\u2019s more, unlike her perpetually thwarted characters, who chase their ideas with the exasperation of dogs running after their tails, Ms. Baker delivers a complete and confident narrative.Now \u201ccomplete\u201d may not be the term you\u2019d apply to a play as steeped in ambiguities as this one. \u201cThe Antipodes\u201d portrays a never-ending brainstorming session for unspecified purposes in an unspecified place.Yet as directed with a time-blurring seamlessness by Lila Neugebauer, and acted by a perfectly blended ensemble of nine, \u201cThe Antipodes\u201d leaves you glowing with a wondering satisfaction. I mean the happy satiety that comes from being in the hands of a real right-brain/left-brain author who channels her ineffable instincts with a master artisan\u2019s practical skills.\u201cThe Antipodes\u201d is only 115 (intermission-free) minutes long. But while it\u2019s anchored with the character-defining specifics and social detail that naturalistic writers live for, it is also Ms. Baker\u2019s most abstract play. And it has very little plot except that, in another sense, it\u2019s nothing but plot. Or rather plots, of every conceivable stripe, which bubble and spurt from the mouths of everyone onstage.The setting is a conference room, which I would wager is somewhere on the West Coast, though spiritually we may as well be in the far-flung regions of the title. As rendered by the set designer Laura Jellinek, this room is centered on a long oval desk over which hangs a long oval lighting fixture, which is put to subliminally unsettling use. (Tyler Micoleau did the whisper-subtle lighting.)It\u2019s the kind of place you could imagine television writers or Silicon Valley wonder kids gathering for intense group thinks. And as she follows the conversation of those assembled here, Ms. Baker nails the passive-aggressive competitiveness of such gatherings.She also provides evidence of her peerless ear for contemporary language; in this case, it\u2019s the lingo of creative corporate speak, with its calculated humblebrag, masturbational jaw-flapping and implicit sexism. (There\u2019s only one woman among the eight people at the table.)As usual, Ms. Baker is asking us to ponder just how we communicate, or fail to. There\u2019s a hilarious technologically facilitated (and garbled) exchange with an unseen Godlike eminence named Max, voiced by Hugh Dancy.But just what is the objective of all this feverish talk? The team\u2019s leader, Sandy (a perfect Will Patton), a weather-beaten dude swathed in dressed-down black and weary charisma, begins the session with an edict: \u201cNo dwarves or elves or trolls.\u201dSo maybe it\u2019s a new video game they\u2019re trying to come up with? Or a Netflix series? Or a blockbuster fantasy movie?Don\u2019t bother trying to piece together an answer. Ms. Baker deliberately refrains from providing definitive clues. All we know is that these people are being asked to keep coming up with narratives, the more personal the better, in the hopes that something will jell.The important thing, says Sandy, is that \u201cwe don\u2019t feel like we have to self-censor and we can all just sit around telling stories. Because that\u2019s where the good stuff comes from.\u201d So we start off with \u201chow I lost my virginity\u201d anecdotes, and move on to tales of professional mentors and crazy employees and (when Sandy\u2019s out of the room) anxious speculation on how it\u2019s all going.Gradually, an air of surrealism sets in, the distorting hyper-awareness bred of too much talk and too little sleep, and the stories become more fantastical. A tale that might have come from the Brothers Grimm is presented, deadpan, as a true memory of adolescence. By the end, what we\u2019re hearing (and even seeing acted out) are the most primal of creation myths and sacred rituals. These are stories that float into the ether, beyond the think-tanks\u2019 realm of commodification.Time is much discussed in \u201cThe Antipodes.\u201d (Is it vertical or horizontal?) And one of the production\u2019s many interwoven marvels is how it distorts our sense of time passing in the conference room.When did those plates of Japanese takeout materialize? How did that scrap of knitting turn into a full sweater without our noticing? Though there are few scene-defining blackouts, we sense that an uninterrupted conversation might be a composite of many days of talk.Besides, pretty much every time Sandy\u2019s gal Friday, Sarah (a priceless Nicole Rodenburg), shows up, she\u2019s wearing a new outfit. (Kaye Voyce did the spot-on costumes.) Sarah helps alert us as to what\u2019s going on outside, as Sandy takes more and more time off and the weather turns apocalyptic.\u201cThe Antipodes\u201d is also deeply funny, but it\u2019s naturally funny, and if it\u2019s a satire, it\u2019s an organic one. This playwright doesn\u2019t need to exaggerate to elicit what\u2019s absurd in the human condition. Ms. Baker hears the roar of eternity in the babble of our existence, and the futile heroism in our unending attempts to tell tales that might make sense of it all.An earlier version of a capsule summary for this article misspelled the name of the play. As the article correctly noted, it is \u201cThe Antipodes,\u201d not \u201cThe Antidopes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Wanting protagonists to be likable signals a lack of sophistication. Making protagonists \u201cdifficult\u201d is a sign of authenticity.The fictional Sophia \u2014 each episode begins with a note that the show is a \u201creal loose\u201d version of Ms. Amoruso\u2019s story \u2014 is at the far end of the TV scale of difficulty. And she\u2019s all the more realistic for that. If you don\u2019t know a woman whom you love despite her characteristic anger, obsessiveness, insensitivity and refusal to listen to others, you may dismiss Sophia as a caricature. If you do, one moment after another in \u201cGirlboss\u201d will ring surprisingly true.But truth doesn\u2019t necessarily equal drama, or in this case half-hour inspirational dramedy. It\u2019s fine that the Sophia of \u201cGirlboss\u201d isn\u2019t likable. The problem is that she isn\u2019t particularly interesting.It\u2019s a big problem, because for the show to work, we need to see what the other characters \u2014 like Sophia\u2019s best friend, Annie (Ellie Reed), and her maybe-boyfriend, Shane (Johnny Simmons) \u2014 see in her. Neither Ms. Cannon nor Britt Robertson, who plays Sophia, is able to make it apparent.Ms. Cannon\u2019s strategy appears to be to foreground Sophia\u2019s vulnerability and self-hatred \u2014 after episodes of boorishness or violent anger, she\u2019s liable to loudly ask herself why she\u2019s such a jerk. It\u2019s another realistic touch, but it doesn\u2019t make us care any more about her. Ms. Robertson convincingly portrays Sophia\u2019s defensiveness and irritating energy, but there\u2019s a pinched, limited quality to her performance. Sophia needs charisma, and Ms. Robertson hasn\u2019t found it.The bigger issue may be the disconnect between the part of \u201cGirlboss\u201d that wants to be a character study and the part that needs to be a conventionally entertaining series. The roots of Sophia\u2019s personality are addressed briefly, in vague and heavily clich\u00e9d terms (blame the parents). Otherwise her thorniness sits uncomfortably inside a stylized comedy that\u2019s equal parts oddball and striving for the outrageous.(The tech-business side of the story, in which a series of epiphanies takes Sophia from unemployed boho to eBay seller to e-commerce mogul, feels about as savvy as the copy of \u201cStarting an eBay Business for Dummies\u201d that Sophia shoplifts.)As she demonstrated in \u201cPitch Perfect,\u201d Ms. Cannon can write a funny line and sketch in an appealing character, and a number of performers benefit from this in small, spiky roles: Jim Rash as a vintage-clothing store owner, Norm MacDonald as a security guard, Melanie Lynskey as an eBay rival, Louise Fletcher as a curmudgeonly neighbor. They\u2019re all likable, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Louis C.K.\u2019s New Special Mines Comedy From the Middle Ground", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byOn ComedyI once saw George Carlin begin a set with an abortion bit so inflammatory that several people walked out. He framed the issue as one between those who believe a fetus is a baby and those who don\u2019t, then staked out his position. \u201cI believe it\u2019s a baby, and we should kill it,\u201d Carlin said, give or take a profanity.Carlin, who made a career out of taking provocative positions meant to offend and did material about abortion on television specials but never included that particular line, leaned on a specific, strident voice making a taboo claim that almost invited some people to leave.While equally drawn to hot-button subjects, Louis C. K. is a less polemical comic, and his dense, formally clever bit doesn\u2019t argue for or against abortion as much as it mocks the parameters of the debate surrounding it. His joke quickly shifts points of view, undercutting his own take again and again. \u201cI think you should not get an abortion,\u201d he says, pausing. \u201cUnless you need one.\u201d Another pause. \u201cIn which case, you better get one.\u201dSeconds later, he mounts a defense of anti-abortion activists who picket clinics. \u201cThey think babies are being murdered!\u201d he says, adding in a sarcastic hipster voice: \u201cWhat are they supposed to be like? \u2018It\u2019s not cool.\u2019\u201dAt various points, Louis C. K. intentionally contradicts himself, jumping from one extreme to another. It\u2019s risky to start a special talking about abortion, but he has long been a stand-up Houdini who delights in tying himself up in ugly or polarizing claims before using his quick wits to escape offense nimbly. Carlin was a model of intellectual clarity. Louis C. K. has clearly been influenced by him but is just as happy with ambiguity or confusion. Despite what he says at the start of the show, he is less interested in telling us what he thinks about abortion than in dramatizing confusion and anxiety about it.\u201c2017\u201d is not his most original special, covering much familiar territory, including more wonderful jokes about the toil of parenting. And he does not mention the politician dominating discussion this year, though he does seem to make an allusion to President Trump when he mentions people from the future looking back on today from a devastated, rubble-strewn landscape.This makes \u201c2017\u201d a snapshot not so much of our time but of Louis C. K. in his prime, a tight hour and 15 minutes revealing a dizzying number of ways to get a belly laugh: misdirection, juxtaposition, silly voices, act-outs, rambling personal stories, sex jokes.He covers the big (religion, politics, love) and the small (a great joke about soup), the mind-bendingly philosophical as well as a description of the start of an erection. This is a complete bag of tricks, a veteran showing off his range.Louis C. K. does have his hallmarks: He continues to find comedy in imagining the world from a surprising, often alien perspective. In a bit about parenting, he describes being enraged by a football player who said he knew that his mother was watching his game from heaven. \u201cLeave your mother alone,\u201d Louis C. K. says, imagining her in heaven turning down a party with angels because she has to look down on her son. \u201c\u2018Even after they\u2019re dead, you have to go to their games.\u2019\u201dHe also remains masterly at finding laughs on the way to the punch line. Some of this comes from a goofy voice or a wry look. At other times, it\u2019s built into the absurdity of the premise. \u201cThe worst part about being beheaded \u2026 \u201d is the kind of statement that will make you laugh before the sentence is over.His pessimism is intact, describing all relationships as doomed to sour and all life as a prelude to suicide. But it\u2019s leavened by a sense of joy. \u201cLove is the best,\u201d he says, before adding seconds later, \u201cbut don\u2019t be greedy and expect it to last.\u201dThis sets up a long bit about feeling sexually attracted to the beefcake stars of \u201cMagic Mike,\u201d a longer, more involved version of an earlier bit he did about lusting after Ewan McGregor. Some will find these jokes funny for the same reason that tired gay-panic jokes have long gotten laughs. But Louis C. K. doesn\u2019t focus on squirming over these feelings, and there\u2019s not a trace of shame. He luxuriates in his lust, celebrates it, using all his powers of description to map it out before adding that he\u2019s not attracted to most men.Once again, Louis C. K. sets up two sides, then finds comedy in the in-between.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nikolaj Coster-Waldau: The First Time I Recognized My Selfishness", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byThe First TimeIt\u2019s impossible to pinpoint the moment you grow up, but I remember a day when I got a taste of what adults had to deal with. And it\u2019s stayed with me ever since.I was 13. We lived in Tybjerg in the south of Zeeland, Denmark. Our house was part of what in the early \u201970s was to have been a big development in this tiny farming village. Instead, it began and ended with three bungalows.Ours was the first of the three. The whole village probably had 40 people living there. There was a church and a school, which also served children from the nearby towns.Denmark is a Protestant Christian country. It has a state church. Confirmation is a big deal. It symbolizes the move from child to adult, and is a ritual confirming your baptism. I was the youngest, with two older sisters, and my parents had never gotten round to having me baptized. Church never played a part in our daily lives.But I wanted to have my confirmation. So one week before the date, we went up to the church and I was baptized by our local vicar. Confirmation means a big party and an occasion for big presents.The presents: That\u2019s what we kids focused on for sure. There is a lot of pressure on parents to deliver. My mum didn\u2019t have much money, but she threw a party for me. It was great. I got gifts from family and friends but my favorite was from my mum. She\u2019d gotten me a Sanyo mini-stereo with speakers that detached. Unbelievably cool.My oldest sister had left home by then so I now had the corner room. I\u2019d covered the walls with posters \u2014 Duran Duran, Human League, David Bowie. I\u2019d even made a disco light \u2014 three colored bulbs in a box that blinked to the rhythm of the music. I could invite a girl over and woo her with my incredible setup. Welcome to the crib. (At this point the closest I\u2019d been to a girl was an embarrassed shuffling of feet at a school dance, but in my mind I was ready.)Then one day, an afternoon, there was a knock on the front door. This was a little weird, as our door was always open. We literally didn\u2019t have a key. Anyway, a knock, and then a louder knock. Insistent. I opened the door. Outside two men were waiting.One was the county cop, the other from an electronics store. Back then the local cop had many tasks, one of which apparently was to escort local merchants when they had to retrieve goods when the payments had dried up. It turned out my mum hadn\u2019t been able to really afford that mini-stereo and now they had come to take it back.I was shocked and horrified, but let the men in. I walked them down to my room and unplugged the Sanyo, reattached the speakers and handed over my prized possession. I remember that it seemed the men couldn\u2019t get out of there quick enough.I stared at the empty spot where my stereo had proudly sat just a few moments before. I couldn\u2019t believe it. How could this happen to me? Why me? It didn\u2019t seem fair.And then it hit me. The shame. And I felt terrible. Not because I lost a stereo, but because I knew how the repossession would make my mother feel: That she had let me down. And I hated it. Suddenly all my pride disappeared. The stereo didn\u2019t matter. I understood that my mother had felt this stupid pressure to deliver an amazing party, with all the right presents, even though she couldn\u2019t afford it.I don\u2019t remember my mother ever telling me she loved me. I also have never doubted for a second that I was loved. Actions speak louder than words and our mum always had our back. Unconditionally.When I was younger I was very good at telling my mother why I had to have Adidas Copa Mundial soccer boots with screw-in studs to improve my game, or the right glove if ever I was to become a sports shooting club champion. I was the little brother, the youngest, and spoiled.So I found my old cassette player. I put it right in the Sanyo\u2019s place and decided not to care for stuff ever again. (I\u2019ve negotiated an exception with myself for mountain bikes and mountain-bike gear; we agree that\u2019s necessary for all sorts of profound reasons.)I have kids of my own now. They are more sensible than I was as a young teenager. I do spoil them, but I try to pass on the lessons from my mum, too, including one they experienced a couple of summers back.We have a big family from Denmark, England and Greenland, and every other year we rent a place in the south of Europe and all get together for a week of relaxation. On Day 1 we go shopping for the week. We go in three cars and raid the nearest supermarket. It\u2019s amazing how much food and drink you suddenly can\u2019t live without.This specific year we shopped for a feast fit for Caligula. We drove back to the house and unloaded. It was an old Spanish converted mill, and the kitchen had one of those huge tables that could seat 24 people. We filled the table with bags. It was glorious.My daughter came to me to say that grandma wasn\u2019t feeling well. I rushed out to the patio where my mum was seated, drinking a glass of water.She had to sit down, she said, because she felt sick at the sight of all the bags. \u201cIt\u2019s too much, the greed \u2014 we don\u2019t need all this,\u201d she said, a little angry with us.I think her dislike of consumerism and deep-rooted fear of not being able to afford all we had bought played a part as well. I assured her that food for 24 people for a week takes up a lot of space.She calmed down. Later, I relayed the story of the Sanyo to my kids. We all had an amazing week. And when it was over we left quite a bit of stuff behind.Advertisement"}

You know, the bad old days of the 2000s. While the TV renaissance has radically changed the mix \u2014 hello, superheroes, political soaps, brittle sitcoms \u2014 the crime drama hasn\u2019t gone away.

A surreal Arctic thriller, a classic Los Angeles hard-boiled procedural and an operatic Mafia melodrama: Choose one or try all three. (Spoiler alert: Crucial details will be disclosed about the shows\u2019 earlier seasons.)Dennis Quaid joins the cast as a fishing boat captain named Lennox, in keeping with the show\u2019s odd scheme of having British and Scandinavian actors play the Norwegians, while Americans \u2014 Stanley Tucci in Season 1, and now Mr. Quaid \u2014 play characters who are apparently British.Also on Amazon, where its third 10-episode season went live last week, \u201cBosch\u201d couldn\u2019t be more different from \u201cFortitude.\u201d Resolutely naturalistic, and predictable in a way that\u2019s more reassuring than deflating, it\u2019s straight-up Los Angeles noir: a cop with a code (and, in this case, a cool hilltop house) seeking justice amid the moral squalor of Hollywood.The show, based on the novels of Michael Connelly, wears its heart pretty prominently on its sleeve, and sometimes it goes awfully far in its determination not to be flashy. It works because Detective Harry Bosch is embodied \u2014 in some absolute sense of the word \u2014 by Titus Welliver in a performance so natural and convincing that it\u2019s hard to imagine him playing anything else.It\u2019s a shaky one, though, and Ciro (Marco D\u2019Amore), the cool, calculating counterpart to the raging Genny, immediately gets back to work, figuring out how to eliminate everyone above him. (Four of the season\u2019s 12 episodes were available for review.) Ciro is about as anti as TV antiheroes get, and in Season 2, he\u2019s even more ruthless and violent. That\u2019s saying something, given that Ciro got the drop on Genny in the Season 1 finale by opening fire at his own daughter\u2019s children\u2019s choir concert.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The C.E.O. of H.I.V.", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "FeatureMichael Weinstein\u2019s AIDS Healthcare Foundation treats an enormous number of patients \u2014 and makes an enormous amount of money. Is that why so many activists distrust him?Supported byThe question was met with an awkward silence. Most AIDS organizations do accept grants from pharmaceutical companies \u2014 in some cases large ones. It is widely seen as a symbiotic relationship. AIDS nonprofits depend on funding from drug companies; drug companies depend on the organizations to educate patients about their wares. That arrangement rankled Sanders, who views the pharmaceutical industry as a public menace. In the primary, one of his signature issues was support for California\u2019s Proposition 61, a referendum that sought to control drug prices by barring public insurers from paying any more than the prices charged to the Veterans Health Administration, which traditionally gets a big discount. A few of the AIDS activists gathered in San Bernardino \u2014 along with a number of experts and patient groups \u2014 had strong reservations about the unintended consequences of that initiative. Some worried it would drain R.&D. budgets; others feared it would prod drug companies to jack up prices on veterans. Sanders did not share their reservations about Prop. 61. \u201cDrug companies are ripping off the American people in a big way,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are bad-news people, and they need to be taken on.\u201dThe next day, the Sanders campaign circulated a news release about the meeting, which, to Staley\u2019s shock, focused entirely on Sanders\u2019s support for Prop. 61, and, in Staley\u2019s view, gave the misleading impression that everyone present joined Sanders in endorsing the referendum. After Staley took to Facebook to dispute the account \u2014 \u201cFeeling used and abused by the Sanders campaign right now,\u201d he wrote to 12,000 followers \u2014 the Sanders campaign\u2019s policy director, Warren Gunnels, attacked Staley personally on Twitter. Using scare quotes to insinuate that Staley, who once chained himself to a balcony of the New York Stock Exchange to protest high drug prices, didn\u2019t really deserve to be called an \u201cactivist,\u201d Gunnels claimed that Staley had \u201cmade a fortune from big drug companies.\u201d As evidence, Gunnels linked to a post on a website called Stop Pharma Greed that was teeming with opposition research on some of the biggest names in AIDS activism. The post accused Staley of \u201cshilling for big Pharma\u201d and taking funding from companies like DuPont Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead Sciences. \u201cIn short,\u201d the post concluded, \u201cStaley\u2019s livelihood since the year 2000 ... appears to have been wholly dependent on, or funded directly by, the drug industry.\u201d Staley called the accusation a \u201cTrumpian lie,\u201d noting that he has lived entirely on savings for the last five years. (The tweet was later deleted.)The activists hadn\u2019t known what to make of Sanders\u2019s frostiness, but as soon as they saw Gunnels\u2019s tweet, the fog lifted. Staley believed that someone had goaded the Sanders campaign into going nuclear on him, and he had no doubt about who that someone was. Stop Pharma Greed was funded by Staley\u2019s longtime nemesis, Michael Weinstein, the 64-year-old founder and director of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the world\u2019s largest and most controversial AIDS organization. (The Sanders campaign denied Staley\u2019s claim.) Weinstein was also the financier behind Prop. 61, which would go on to become the most expensive referendum of 2016, thanks to the pharmaceutical industry, which spent $120 million on the campaign, and eventually defeated it with 53 percent of the vote. More money was spent against Prop. 61 than was spent on behalf of any candidate for governor or Senate in 2016.Directors of health care nonprofits are traditionally cautious and courtly, fearful of choking the funding streams that issue from nit-picking grant committees and image-conscious donors. Weinstein, an ex-Trotskyite, is no courtier. He runs his organization as a \u201csocial enterprise,\u201d meaning that it generates most of its revenue not from grants and fund-raising but from adjacent businesses. A.H.F.\u2019s main business is a network of pharmacies and clinics that provide primary care to more than 41,000 patients in the United States, most of whom have their insurance claims paid by government insurance programs like Medicaid. The excess income from these patients helps the AIDS Healthcare Foundation provide free care to more than 700,000 H.I.V. patients internationally \u2014 the greatest reach of any AIDS organization. This prodigiously successful model has both insulated A.H.F. from typical funding woes and helped it to expand at an astonishing clip. Over the last six years, A.H.F.\u2019s budget has grown from $300 million to more than $1.4 billion, about the size of Planned Parenthood. If their projections hold, it will reach $2 billion by 2020, giving A.H.F. \u2014 a private entity effectively under the control of one man \u2014 a budget nearly half the size of the World Health Organization\u2019s.Paradoxically, that projected growth depends in part on whether drug costs remain high. While cutting drug prices is an ideological objective for Weinstein, his pharmacies stand to lose revenue should he succeed in that mission. \u201cMost of the time when people benefit from something, they don\u2019t lobby against it,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cBut we\u2019re Robin Hood. If someone was writing an epitaph for this organization some day, it will be: \u2018Bit the hand that fed it.\u2019\u2009\u201dA.H.F.\u2019s rapid ascent has made Weinstein an object of scorn among his peers, who deplore not only his tactics but also his unorthodox positions on public-health issues. Unlike nearly all other AIDS activists and public-health researchers, Weinstein opposes PrEP, the H.I.V.-prevention pill, which he believes will cause a \u201cpublic-health catastrophe\u201d by triggering a dangerous increase in risky sex. He has also campaigned to make condoms mandatory in adult films, even going so far as to introduce a statewide referendum in California, Proposition 60. Weinstein\u2019s positions have been assailed by peers as counterproductive fearmongering. \u201cIt reminds me very much of the Tea Party people with regard to Obamacare,\u201d Ernest Hopkins, director of legislative affairs for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, told me in 2013, referring to Weinstein\u2019s opposition to PrEP. \u201cIf you\u2019re prepared to say whatever you want and lie and demagogue and misrepresent the facts, then you can get a lot of airtime, and you can also persuade a lot of people.\u201dTo his many critics in AIDS activism, Weinstein is the Koch brothers of public health: a mastermind driven by ideology, accountable to no one, with bottomless funds and an agenda marked by financial opportunism and puritanical extremes. It doesn\u2019t help that A.H.F. has been the subject of near-constant litigation and complaints for questionable business practices, including union-busting, giving kickbacks to patients, overbilling government insurers and bullying funders into denying grants to institutional rivals. (A.H.F. has denied these accusations.)To his faithful, however, Weinstein is not only a provider of superior health care but also an evangelist of moral urgency at a time when prevention efforts are floundering and drug prices are surging. Weinstein seems to view himself in loftier terms, as a holy warrior sent to save the innocent, not only from the scourge of H.I.V. but also from those he views as the virus\u2019s human collaborators: a satanic trifecta of greedy executives, vainglorious activists and incompetent bureaucrats.The first time I visited, in February of last year, Weinstein invited me to sit down without shaking my hand. A lean man with a long forehead, bird-of-prey features and a nerdy, pocket-protector vibe, Weinstein had a formal demeanor but was wearing jeans and a hoodie \u2014 a common outfit for a tech leader but unusual for a health care magnate. Weinstein took me on an abbreviated tour, proudly showing off photos he had taken with celebrities and political figures \u2014 Magic Johnson, Alicia Keys, former Senator Tom Harkin. Above his desk hung an Expressionist portrait of his best friend, with whom he founded A.H.F., Chris Brownlie. By all accounts, Brownlie was the softhearted yin to Weinstein\u2019s gladiatorial yang, as charming and consensus-seeking as Weinstein was splenetic and introverted. Brownlie died from AIDS-related complications in 1989.Weinstein has a long history of militancy. Born in Brooklyn\u2019s Bensonhurst neighborhood to a family of left-wing Jews, at age 13 he volunteered for an antiwar congressional candidate and worked as an equipment mule for his filmmaker sister, toting around a 40-pound battery while she shot footage of protesters burning draft cards in Central Park. The next year, he joined a group of activists occupying a new high-rise development to protest what was not yet known as gentrification. Though he realized he was gay early on, he repressed his sexuality for many years, eventually moving in with an older girlfriend. At age 18, he had his first gay encounter with an upstairs neighbor, also officially straight, who knocked on his door one night when both of their girlfriends were out of town.In 1972, when Weinstein was 19, he traveled to California and joined Los Angeles\u2019s gay activism scene. An outsider among both mainstream gays (for being a Marxist) and Marxists (for being gay), Weinstein decided to start his own group, which he called the Lavender and Red Union. The group eventually merged with a gay-friendly Trotskyite organization in New York called the Spartacist League, which offered Weinstein a leadership position, requiring him to move back to the East Coast. He wasn\u2019t at his new post for long, though, before he fell out with his comrades over an unusual matter: the Roman Polanski sexual-abuse case, in which the director was accused of drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. \u201cThey felt that it was not rape, that the girl knew what she was doing,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s boyfriend at the time, Albert Ruiz, told me. Weinstein believed it was rape and felt strongly enough about the matter, among other disputes, that he resigned.Disillusioned with activism, Weinstein briefly ran a candy business in Los Angeles before returning to politics to face an unlikely antagonist. In 1986, the right-wing conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche introduced a ballot referendum in California that would have enabled employers to fire people with AIDS and empowered the government to quarantine them. Early polling suggested that LaRouche\u2019s initiative had broad support. Along with Brownlie and other friends, Weinstein started his own group to fight LaRouche\u2019s proposition. In a move that anticipated his later shock-marketing campaigns, Weinstein distributed leaflets with the headline \u201cSTOP AIDS CONCENTRATION CAMPS\u201d and organized a torch-lit march on LaRouche\u2019s Silver Lake office. Mainstream gay activists abhorred Weinstein\u2019s strong-arm tactics, fearing he might alienate suburban voters. But after the measure lost in a landslide, with 71 percent opposed, L.A. Weekly named Weinstein \u201cBest Young Activist.\u201d Weinstein determined that there was far greater support for his militant approach than he had realized.As the AIDS crisis intensified, Weinstein watched more and more of his friends grow ill and die. Los Angeles County hospital had barely developed procedures for handling dying AIDS patients, and many were left to expire alone on gurneys in crowded hallways. Doctors and nurses would often refuse to care for AIDS sufferers, and when the untreated patients died, undertakers often turned them away, too. In some parts of the country, the deceased ended up in garbage bags delivered directly to crematories. Weinstein wanted to ensure that AIDS patients could die in a respectful, peaceful atmosphere. In 1989, he and Brownlie founded the precursor of A.H.F. \u2014 the AIDS Hospice Foundation. In 1990, as more AIDS medications became available, Weinstein changed the group\u2019s name to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and shifted its focus to medical care for the living. In the late \u201990s, little by little, A.H.F. expanded from Southern California into Florida and New York. Then, in 2000, A.H.F. made a change that would prove crucial to its business model: It opened its first pharmacy.Pharmacy services are, in Weinstein\u2019s words, A.H.F.\u2019s \u201cjet fuel.\u201d That\u2019s because 70 percent of spending on H.I.V. care consists of drug costs. While H.I.V. patients in the United States skew poor, the costly insurance claims they generate by filling prescriptions make them gold mines, not only for pharmaceutical companies but also for certain pharmacies, like Weinstein\u2019s, that take advantage of a federal program called 340B. Passed in 1991, 340B allows pharmacies attached to medical practices serving underprivileged populations to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at, on average, a 35 percent discount but still be reimbursed by insurers for 100 percent of the wholesale price. In effect, 340B allows pharmacies to keep around 35 percent of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s tab, a roundabout way of subsidizing health care for the poor. As the price of AIDS medications has spiraled upward in recent years, A.H.F.\u2019s coffers have swelled. The cost of the latest first-line H.I.V. treatment \u2014 a combination pill from Gilead called Genvoya \u2014 is about $34,000 per patient per year. When a patient uses an A.H.F. pharmacy, about $22,000 of that bill goes to Gilead, and $12,000 goes to A.H.F. The foundation\u2019s pharmacies serve 50,000 patients in the United States, generating approximately $1 billion each year in revenue \u2014 about $200 million of it surplus. That money subsidizes A.H.F.\u2019s expansion and advocacy as well as the group\u2019s political activities.The pool of potential patients for an organization like A.H.F. is oceanic. In 2014, 37,600 Americans were newly infected with H.I.V. That number has declined only slightly over the last decade, as America\u2019s epidemic has settled into a baleful equilibrium of slow growth and rising costs. The lack of progress is especially disheartening considering that H.I.V. medications, when properly administered, render patients almost totally noninfectious. These medications aren\u2019t new \u2014 they\u2019ve existed for two decades. If every infected American took them, our epidemic would be over. Instead, of the roughly 1.2 million Americans with H.I.V., only 40 percent are on medication, a rate lower than South Africa\u2019s. Weinstein believes that America\u2019s AIDS nonprofits, which he refers to derisively as \u201cAIDS Inc.\u201d \u2014 a label meant to evoke sclerotic incumbents who collect renewable grants and stand only for their own perpetuation \u2014 have been useless in the face of the epidemic. To win, he thinks, \u201cAIDS Inc.\u201d has to be sidelined so that A.H.F. can lead the way.To recruit new patients, sales reps are expected to hold several events each month, most of them in high-risk zones. Events vary by location. On Los Angeles\u2019s Skid Row, for example, reps hand out McDonald\u2019s gift cards to anyone willing to take a rapid H.I.V. test. In South Central, the reps sometimes set up a game called Cash Box, in which contestants who agree to a rapid test enter a plexiglass booth where they try to grab cash as it is blown around at high speeds. In gay neighborhoods, reps may invite passers-by to play Dildo Toss \u2014 a carny-inspired game in which players hurl phalluses of varying colors and sizes into a hole carved out of a plank of wood. \u201cWe give them three chances,\u201d explained Edwin Millan, director of sales for the Western United States, \u201cand if it goes in the hole, they get to spin a wheel and they get a prize.\u201d (In 2015, two former employees filed a whistle-blower suit arguing that A.H.F.\u2019s patient incentives amounted to illegal kickbacks; the lawsuit has not yet reached a resolution, and A.H.F. denies the claims.) In addition to seeking out patients directly, sales reps also cultivate referral sources by hosting lunches for area doctors.The retreat\u2019s kickoff dinner was held in the French Quarter, at Deanie\u2019s Seafood. Tucked away in a back room, the gregarious sales reps kibitzed noisily, slurping crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e as Weinstein, seated at the head of a long table, examined his battalion. Like other divisions at A.H.F., this group was anchored by black women in floral prints and gay men of all races in checkered shirts; many were new hires Weinstein was meeting for the first time. \u201cSometimes I have to pinch myself,\u201d Weinstein whispered to me, marveling at how swiftly his organization had expanded.As the sales reps emptied their plates and hailed waiters for second and third rounds of wine, Weinstein tapped his glass with a fork and called the group to attention. \u201cI\u2019d like to officially welcome you to the Big Easy!\u201d he squawked in his blunt Brooklynese. \u201cDo whatever you want as long as you wake up in the morning.\u201d The reps laughed. \u201cYou know, this is a really powerful force on behalf of the organization \u2014 a powerful force on behalf of the growth. Going out there, pounding the pavement, going after new accounts and clients \u2014 you have to be immune to rejection to be successful, and that\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m pretty bad at it myself!\u201d He wasn\u2019t kidding. Weinstein belies the clich\u00e9 that the best fighters develop a thick skin: He has sustained himself through decades of conflict by salting unhealed wounds, nursing unceasing resentment and preserving grudges in amber.The morning after the dinner, the sales reps reconvened in a dreary conference room with red tablecloths and damask carpeting. Programming for the first day called for an icebreaker in which employees were asked to scribble unusual facts about themselves on pieces of paper tossed into a hat. One man, a bodybuilder from South Beach with silver hair and pumpkin-colored skin, wrote that he used to train with Madonna; a copper-haired woman from San Francisco disclosed that she swam through garbage during an initiation ritual for Semester at Sea. Weinstein\u2019s own fact, the one he always uses for such exercises, was that he dropped out of high school.The icebreaker was followed by an exercise intended to explore how to navigate conversations with A.H.F.\u2019s critics. Weinstein gave volunteers the option of representing the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, leaders of which have been vocally critical of A.H.F., or a \u201cPrEP crazy,\u201d someone incensed by Weinstein\u2019s opposition to the H.I.V.-prevention pill. Another volunteer would play A.H.F.\u201cI\u2019ll be S.F.A.F.!\u201d volunteered the copper-haired woman. Her counterpart was a man whose upper lip was adorned with a sumptuous mustache.\u201cI\u2019m here to talk to you about the services that we provide,\u201d he began.\u201cI know all about A.H.F., actually,\u201d replied the copper-haired woman, her eyes narrowing. \u201cYour reputation precedes you.\u201d\u201cO.K., awesome. Did you know that we started the first AIDS hospice in Los Angeles about 28 years ago?\u201d he asked. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve grown rapidly, primarily overseas.\u201dThe reps laughed; they\u2019d all heard some version of this tirade a thousand times. Weinstein took the floor and concluded the session by telling a little story about a nun he once met. She ran a hospital, which required her to make tough budgetary decisions in the name of helping people. Whenever people criticized her for being harsh, she had a canned response: \u201cNo margin, no mission!\u201d This, according to Weinstein, is what A.H.F.\u2019s critics couldn\u2019t bring themselves to understand. \u201cWe should never be in a position of apologizing for our success,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that we take a business model from the private sector and utilize it on behalf of a nonprofit is a great thing.\u201dAnd then there are the billboards. In major American cities \u2014 and increasingly, around the world \u2014 Weinstein\u2019s most visible impact is his trolling approach to sexual-health messaging. In 2013, he put up signs in several cities with the image of a magma-spewing volcano captioned, \u201cSYPHILIS EXPLOSION.\u201d The following year, in South Central, he posted billboards with two black men spooning in bed alongside the leading question \u201cTrust Him?\u201d Some ads have been humorous and topical \u2014 a sendup of the Netflix logo replaced with the mantra \u201cGet Tested and Chill,\u201d a Bernie Sanders parody with the modified slogan \u201cFeel the Burn?\u201d Others have hectored the public with reproachful questions: \u201cFriends With Benefits?\u201d \u201cSexually Reckless?\u201d \u201cWorried?\u201d One A.H.F. billboard managed to cause a national scandal in Uganda. Unusually for a nonprofit, A.H.F. employs a 15-person in-house creative agency to create its messaging. The expense is justified because the billboards are a marketing channel: They seek to stir dread in the libertine masses, not only to stem what Weinstein sees as a rising tide of promiscuity but also to drive traffic to his clinics.In the press, Weinstein has attracted the most attention for his hostility to PrEP, a once-a-day antiretroviral that reduces the likelihood of contracting H.I.V. by 99 percent. In 2015, the C.D.C. began recommending PrEP for anyone at \u201chigh risk\u201d for H.I.V. infection, including any gay man not in a monogamous relationship who has had sex in the last six months without a condom (1.2 million people, according to the C.D.C.\u2019s estimates). Many hailed it as an era-defining advance. Weinstein, virtually alone among major AIDS figures, has assailed PrEP, calling it a \u201cparty drug\u201d that could lead to a collapse in condom use. In a citizen petition to the Food and Drug Administration following PrEP\u2019s approval in 2012, A.H.F.\u2019s lawyer denounced the treatment as \u201cunsafe and ineffective.\u201d Weinstein called on Margaret Hamburg, the agency\u2019s commissioner, to resign over the issue, suggesting she was part of a pharma-led plot to put millions of Americans on a new medication.Weinstein\u2019s critique of PrEP is a fringe view. According to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, support for PrEP among researchers and regulators is all but universal. \u201cIt\u2019s having an extraordinarily positive impact,\u201d he says. Robert Grant, a professor of medicine at U.C.S.F. and a leading PrEP researcher, credits the treatment with \u201ca plummeting decline\u201d in H.I.V. transmission rates among white gay men in San Francisco.Nevertheless, Weinstein is quoted regularly in articles about the treatment, and his noisy skepticism has reverberated across the internet. Some argue that Weinstein\u2019s grandstanding during public hearings delayed PrEP\u2019s approval by the C.D.C., and that his sowing of doubt about the medication is continuing to suppress its use, especially in black and Latino communities. \u201cWhat I find in my practice,\u201d Grant says, \u201cis that A.H.F.\u2019s propaganda does not impress or influence privileged groups of gay men. They can see right through it. But when I talk to some people of color who are clients in my clinics, I find they\u2019ve heard the A.H.F. message, and it gives them pause, it makes them concerned, it appeals to their sense that this isn\u2019t for them.\u201d Despite the C.D.C.\u2019s efforts, very few people, even now, are on PrEP; according to recent estimates, only about 100,000 people take it.Weinstein\u2019s concerns about PrEP are in line with his other heterodox positions, which often cut against the sexual-liberationist doctrine embraced by other activists. Many issues that have been controversial in the gay community, he claims, like laws that make it illegal to intentionally infect a sexual partner with H.I.V., are no-brainers for ordinary voters. \u201cSome people are so extreme,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a group here in California that wants to reduce intentionally infecting somebody from a felony to a misdemeanor. There\u2019s articles being written basically saying we should be proud to bareback\u201d \u2014 slang for condomless sex. \u201cIn the hothouse environment of the gay community, that point of view is very popular, but it isn\u2019t in the community at large, and it isn\u2019t in the medical community either.\u201dWhat motivates Weinstein to adopt such lonely views? Weinstein\u2019s fiercest critics have often searched for a financial motive, some even going so far as to suggest that he aims to profit from the spread of H.I.V. Those who know him personally dismiss this explanation. Phill Wilson, president of the Black AIDS Institute, first met Weinstein in 1980 when Wilson was dating Chris Brownlie. In fact, the first iteration of A.H.F. was founded in Wilson\u2019s living room. \u201cThis is the mistake that people make when they think about Michael,\u201d Wilson told me. \u201cWhether what he does is good or bad, he does what he believes is in the best interests of people living with H.I.V. or at risk of infection.\u201d Weinstein was \u201cprimarily driven by mission,\u201d Wilson said. Even Peter Staley concedes that point. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the money for him,\u201d he told me, unsurprised to learn that in Weinstein\u2019s most recent annual report, he disclosed a comparatively humble salary of $400,000, low for directors of similarly sized nonprofits. \u201cThe core of the business at A.H.F. is not something that has been scandalous,\u201d Staley says. \u201cIt is an empire worth building. A.H.F.\u2019s problem is that once it created the largest AIDS empire on the planet, it started using that power for nefarious purposes: Michael Weinstein\u2019s twisted political views.\u201dEven so, when I visited Weinstein at his office in February, he showed no sign of disappointment. Discussing recent losses, he wasn\u2019t merely philosophical; he was downright giddy. \u201cI had never been involved with a campaign,\u201d he said, referring to the drug-pricing initiative, \u201cwhere people were so enthusiastic about something that didn\u2019t win.\u201d (He would later use the same line with reporters when his anti-density ordinance went down in flames.) As we chatted, he sipped from a radioactive-looking bottle of apple-melon Isopure; he said he liked his chances for this November, when he would try again with a new drug-pricing initiative, this time in Ohio. The problem in California, he said, was that the drug companies had flooded the airwaves \u2014 \u201ctotal aerial bombardment, 3,500 gross rating points a week\u201d \u2014 but he doubted that kind of \u201crazzmatazz\u201d would work in flyover country. \u201cMidwesterners are kind of square-shouldered, common-sense people. I\u2019d think there\u2019d be a backlash if they dumped $80 million into Ohio.\u201dIf that referendum were to pass, Weinstein figured, then Big Pharma\u2019s citadel \u2014 the American market \u2014 would start to crack. Ohio would be copied by other states, and the V.A.\u2019s price for drugs would become the universal price, as even private insurers would demand to pay the new public rate. Billions would be shaved off pharma\u2019s bottom line, meaning the industry would no longer have the muscle to bully Congress into propping up its international patent regime. Drug prices would plummet across the world, AIDS medications would flow freely and the industry\u2019s lobbying operation would shrink so much that it could be drowned in a bathtub. This sequence of events seemed far-fetched, but Weinstein was nevertheless optimistic about the coming year, win or lose. His equanimity in the face of failure reminded me of something he once said to me about Prop. 60, the condoms-in-porn bill. It lost at the ballot box by an eight-point margin, but Weinstein found a reason to declare victory. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more than 10,000 stories on condoms in porn,\u201d he boasted. \u201cForget about porn: That\u2019s a lot of free advertising for condoms.\u201dWeinstein often consoles himself in moments of defeat by reaffirming his commitment to the long game. This is part of what makes him so frustrating to his critics: It is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to distinguish his cynical ploys from his ideological commitments. In his person, the will to power and the will to change the world seem to fuse. It wasn\u2019t simply that he cared more about fighting than about winning. Eventually, he believes, people will come around to his view. And if they don\u2019t, that\u2019s fine, too: A.H.F. will continue to thrive, even in a fallen world.Christopher Glazek is a freelance writer based in New York and the founder of the Yale AIDS Memorial Project.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019: A Newly Resonant Dystopia Comes to TV", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "The Hulu series, which stars Elisabeth Moss and is based on Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian novel, arrives with an unexpected resonance in Trump\u2019s America.Supported byBased on Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 dystopian novel, the series tells the story of a country reinvented: A violent religious coup has turned the United States into Gilead, a theocracy where women have been stripped of their rights and the more fertile conscripted into \u201chandmaids,\u201d forced to bear children for the elite. Though the protest scene was filmed last fall, and, like the series itself, conceived long before a dizzying election season and aftermath that have catapulted Ms. Atwood\u2019s book up the Amazon best-seller list, the television adaptation arrives with a newfound and unexpected resonance in Trump\u2019s America.The tonal dread and brutality of Ms. Atwood\u2019s novel are omnipresent in the series, but there are potential pitfalls to adapting a feminist touchstone so faithfully while also having to speak to a political moment the creators did not anticipate. Will fans of the novel want to subject themselves to 10 hours of immersion into their deep fears?It was still the Obama era when Hulu pursued the property two years ago, as part of a strategy to broaden its identity from a glorified video recorder to a producer of original programming. The showrunner Bruce Miller threw his hat in the ring when Ilene Chaiken, who had been developing the adaptation at MGM, departed for \u201cEmpire.\u201d A veteran writer-producer on shows including \u201cE.R.\u201d and \u201cEureka,\u201d Mr. Miller had been obsessed with the novel since reading it as an undergraduate at Brown, even having his agent continually check to see if the film or TV rights were available.\u201cOffred spoke to me,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cShe\u2019s in this nightmarish situation but she keeps her funny cynicism and sarcasm. She finds really interesting ways to pull levers of power and express herself.\u201dBut Mr. Miller wasn\u2019t a shoo-in for showrunner because producers were looking for a woman, he recalled. \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d has been a seminal rite-of-passage novel for many young women for over three decades; a feminist sacred text.\u201cIt\u2019s sacred to me, too,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a male or female story; it\u2019s a survival story.\u201dMGM and Hulu selected Mr. Miller after he pitched what he described as an adaptation grounded in a recognizable reality, and hewing closely to the book\u2019s first-person point of view through close-ups and Offred\u2019s Atwoodian voice-over. Structured like a thriller where no one can be trusted, the tense adaptation doesn\u2019t sanitize the book\u2019s cruelty either. Offred\u2019s daughter has been taken by the state, and she has become a possession \u201cOf-Fred,\u201d the Commander (Joseph Fiennes). The depths of his control and the horrific absence of hers are unflinchingly displayed when Offred lies impassively between the legs of the Commander\u2019s wife while enduring government-sactioned rape. Close-ups amplify the claustrophobia; Ms. Moss said that the camera sometimes came so near to her face that she would bump up against it.\u201cI was incredibly, and am still incredibly mindful, of the fact that I\u2019m a boy,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cYou always try to find people who support your deficits.\u201dTo that end, when Mr. Miller finished writing the first two episodes, he sent them to Ms. Atwood; she approved. He made sure his writing staff was almost entirely female, and hired women to direct all but two of the 10 episodes.Ms. Moss (\u201cMad Men\u201d) agreed to the part if she could be an active producer, weighing in on scripts and cuts. She pushed to hire the director Reed Morano (Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d movie) for the first three episodes.\u201cWe didn\u2019t pull back or lean in,\u201d Ms. Moss said. \u201cWe just tackled the story we intended to tell and that Margaret Atwood told in 1985. Behind the scenes we were kind of taking a deep breath and saying, \u2018Wow, this is becoming a bit close for comfort.\u2019 You\u2019re in a scene, and the character would say something and it would be a little more meaningful, a little more chilling, more resonant.\u201d Ms. Moss recalled being especially struck when a character said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t look up from our phones until it was too late.\u201dOn a suburban soundstage in January, Ms. Moss sat by the window in Offred\u2019s tiny room-cum-prison. To Atwood fans, the monastic set will be instantly recognizable as an early line from the novel: \u201cA chair, a table, a lamp.\u201d Ms. Moss was wrapped in a modest autumn-red gown, her head bubbled in a white bonnet, staring out the window silently. (\u201cThat\u2019s where the voice-over will go,\u201d Mr. Miller whispered, watching on a monitor.) Carved in the closet was the phrase left by the handmaid who preceded Offred, the one who hanged herself: \u201cNolite te bastardes carborundorum.\u201d Don\u2019t let the bastards grind you down.The edict was scrawled on signs at women\u2019s marches around the world in January, as were other nods to the book. Meanwhile, the debate over legislation to defund Planned Parenthood included frequent references to the measures as Handmaid-ian, and the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood said: \u201cWe\u2019re living \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s all publicity, true, a kind of pop-up grass-roots marketing that a new series on a streaming service trying to compete with Netflix and Amazon can only dream of. But these associations aren\u2019t exactly positive.Bleakness is a hurdle for any dystopia, an imaginary society of the worst kind that articulates anxieties about the world we\u2019re in now. Hulu\u2019s version of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d enters a cultural landscape crowded with the genre: A new film of \u201cBlade Runner\u201d will be released in the fall, and George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d is another retro best-seller, and scheduled for a run on Broadway this summer.The journalist Omar El Akkad has just released his first novel, a dystopia called \u201cAmerican War,\u201d and in an email, he wrote, \u201cI suspect the appetite for dystopian fiction reaches its peak not when things are at their worst, but when it looks like they\u2019re headed there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, we\u2019ve retained that darkness,\u201d Ms. Moss said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also been very important to us to show the hope that exists. At the heart of the story is a woman who has had everything taken away from her: her family, daughter, friends, rights, freedom \u2014 everything. And she will not give up.\u201dGilead is not technically a futuristic society, but a backward (or sideways) glance. Ms. Atwood is something of a scholar of Puritanism, and she said every horrific episode in the story happened somewhere in history already, whether stonings or enslavement, reproductive restrictions or forbidding women to read.\u201cThat will be my image forever,\u201d she deadpanned.Ms. Atwood, who was born in Canada, began writing the novel in \u2014 appropriately \u2014 1984, in West Berlin. At the time, the Christian evangelical movement was finding common ground in the United States with anti-porn feminists, and the ethics of surrogacy were hotly debated. Contemporary audiences are likely to shrug at surrogacy and gravitate toward identity politics instead, and the series subtly updates its feminist bona fides. Pornography was the locus of Gilead\u2019s anti-sex agenda in the book; in the series, the pious headmistress at the handmaid training center spits a mention of Tinder. There\u2019s intersectionality, too, with Moira, a lesbian, played by a black actress, Ms. Wiley. (In the novel, minorities have been shipped to so-called homelands in the Midwest.) In the book\u2019s flashbacks to the heroine\u2019s college days, Moira is writing a paper on \u201cdate rape\u201d; in the TV series, Offred\u2019s composing a paper on \u201ccampus sexual assault.\u201dThe tweak locates the story in the now, flicking at those who rail against collegiate feminist \u201csnowflakes\u201d with their \u201csafe spaces\u201d and \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d \u2014 viewers are invited to recognize a new iteration of \u201980s Moral Majority scorn.But these are small details, and fans will immediately identify the familiar \u201cfeminist dystopia,\u201d as the book is frequently tagged in academia. Ms. Atwood, on the phone from her Toronto home, interrogated the phrase. \u201cWhen you say \u2018feminist\u2019 do you mean: Should women have the same rights as other human beings? Then, yes. But what else do we mean by that term? Do we mean women are angelically more perfect than men? Well, no. Women are human beings. That can be a plus or a minus.\u201dWell, what about the dystopia part? \u201cOh, I\u2019ll put up my hand for that.\u201d\u201cRight after the Iron Curtain came down, people were saying: It\u2019s the end of history \u2014 tra la la! All is well! At those times, dystopia is less chord striking because it seems less possible,\u201d Ms. Atwood said.So perhaps our hunger for the genre serves as catharsis for those in difficult times, which may bode well for Hulu, at least.Almost accidentally, the new \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d enters the culture as its own kind of Offred-like resistance, pushing back against a reality that somehow got ahead of the show\u2019s own imagination. On set in January, several people were wearing a uniform of sorts, as if enlisted: baseball hats that Ms. Moss had bought and distributed. Inscribed on them: Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.An article last Sunday about a new television series based on Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 novel \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d misstated the novel\u2019s opening line. It is \u201cWe slept in what had once been the gymnasium\u201d \u2014 not \u201cA chair, a table, a lamp.\u201d (That is the first sentence of the second chapter.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Doctor Will See You Now (if You\u2019re a Star With a Pimple)", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. \u2014 The movie star had a pimple.It was on the flange of a nostril on the right side of his face. Most every ordinary person has, of course, awakened at some time to an angry and embarrassing eruption. But the movie star was no ordinary person. It was the third week of February. The Oscars were just days away. The actor was to present a big award.Easy enough for civilians to conceal or suffer, a pimple takes on major proportions when it happens to someone whose image will be scrutinized by 32.9 million viewers under the pitiless gaze of high-definition television.Thus, the actor found himself one winter afternoon on a padded baby-blue exam table in the sunny offices of a dermatologist, a syringe filled with lidocaine and cortisone directed toward his nose.The person wielding the syringe, Dr. Peter Kopelson, 54, is a rumpled bear with pierced ears and whiskered jeans who, although he would not make the claim himself, belongs to a small group of medical professionals responsible for keeping the most recognizable faces on the planet looking always young, or at least, \u201cwell rested,\u201d and also pimple free.In the entertainment industry \u2014 now, as always \u2014 who one knows is of substantially greater relevance than what, a truth extending to the agent who selects your scripts and the trainer who tones your thighs and the dentist who bleaches your teeth.\u201cThere is a real mafia\u201d of caretakers charged with the maintenance of boldfaced deities, said John Goldwyn, a film and television producer whose industry lineage qualifies him for that rarefied elite known here as Hollywood royalty.\u201cMy father still refuses to understand why she gets a better table than he does,\u201d Dr. Kopelson said.On a cold, drizzly evening, Dimitri Dimitrov, the beloved ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel at the Tower Bar, greeted Dr. Kopelson in so fawning and grateful a way that, as the producer Brian Grazer once noted, it is impossible to thank him last.Shown to an alcove table, the physician had a ringside seat on a room full of well-toned faces \u2014 some identifiable to anyone, some recognizable mostly to show business cognoscenti, a certain number familiar to Dr. Kopelson at an intimate and even microscopic level.There was a former cinematic superhero whose recent career comeback owes much to his miraculous state of preservation. There was a bulldog Hollywood divorce lawyer with runway-model looks. There was a studio head and a B-list actress and an Academy Award-winning director and a rubber-faced comedian who specializes in angst.What unified these people, beyond their obvious business connections, is how fresh they all appeared, how unlined and dewy, as if each had just awakened from a restorative nap.\u201cI can\u2019t ethically tell you who I treat,\u201d Dr. Kopelson said as he surveyed the room.\u201cThe world is always \u2014 always \u2014 looking for a star dermatologist,\u201d said Joan Kron, a journalist and filmmaker who spent decades chronicling the worlds of surgical and dermatologic cosmetic medicine for magazines like New York and Allure. \u201cThere\u2019s always this tremendous desire to find the best, though, basically, it\u2019s hard to know who the best is.\u201dUntil his death in 2015, many in the entertainment industry viewed Dr. Brandt as that person. A quirky cosmetic dermatologist whose self-administered experiments with rejuvenating substances led to the creation of a buffoonish character on a Netflix show (and, it was suggested, his eventual suicide), Dr. Brandt\u2019s not-so-secret client list included some of the most famous faces in the world.\u201cFred had this tremendous, loyal following and he served them very well,\u201d Ms. Kron said. \u201cPart of it was service \u2014 flying to London for Madonna every time she needed an injection. That was nice.\u201dIn data compiled by the American Academy of Dermatology, its 11,000 practicing members reported spending no more than 8 percent of their office time on cosmetic procedures, a figure that skews differently in a town like Los Angeles, where, as Sandra Ballentine, the beauty editor at large for W magazine, said, \u201cAll the smart people have a regular regimen of \u00e0 la carte treatments where, instead of going invasive with plastic surgery, they do a little something here, a little something there, every month.\u201dWhile Dr. Kopelson may not be a \u201cbig self-promoter,\u201d as Ms. Ballentine added: \u201cHe is one of those Hollywood doctors that people say, \u2018Oh, you need to see him if you\u2019re having work done. He\u2019s the one.\u2019\u201dFor Kevin Connolly, an actor and director best known for his role in the HBO series \u201cEntourage,\u201d visits to Dr. Kopelson are as much part of a regimen \u201cas going to the dentist,\u201d self-maintenance being part of an actor\u2019s job description and aging the enemy of all in a youth-obsessed field. \u201cYou kind of have to try to get out in front of it,\u201d Mr. Connolly said in a phone interview.Still, his visits to Dr. Kopelson are not, he said, for the purpose of being injected with, say, $800 vials of Botox or to have a $475 Genesis laser treatment for pore tightening, or a $1,200 session with a Titan laser to keep his jawline firm. Like every Hollywood person interviewed for this article, Mr. Connolly claimed to see a dermatologist only to keep an eye on suspicious moles.\u201cWhen you look at people in Hollywood now, it\u2019s like you\u2019re looking at an athlete at the peak of performance,\u201d said Linda Wells, the chief creative officer at Revlon and former editor in chief of Allure. In the entertainment industry, she added: \u201cThe bar is set so high now that their skin has to be perfection. Their toes have to be perfect. They are perfect on the bottoms of their feet.\u201dIn the age of Instagram, when every famous face is potentially subject to an iPhone ambush, extreme vanity is more necessity than sin. \u201cSuddenly you find your image is up on someone else\u2019s feed,\u201d Ms. Wells said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t take it down.\u201d\u201cYes, people are much more conscious of every aspect of their appearance,\u201d Dr. Kopelson said one sunny morning at the medical suite he shares with Dr. Sheri Feldman, a former professional partner of Dr. Klein. \u201cTake hair removal. Suddenly straight men are really into getting hair removed from around their genitals. I, personally, don\u2019t really get it, but I think they\u2019re being pushed by their wives.\u201dLocated a block west of Rodeo Drive, Dr. Kopelson\u2019s office is paparazzi-proof, connected by an elevator bank to an underground garage. Decorated with the sprightly sterility of a Swiss clinic as imagined by Stanley Kubrick, the suite is filled with art pieces from the physician\u2019s collection by Ross Bleckner, Jean Cocteau, Catherine Opie and David Shrigley.\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to be a celebrity physician,\u201d said the celebrity physician, an assertion made somewhat more credible in light of the fact that, unlike his competition, he employs no publicist, has a negligible social media presence and has yet to make breakfast appearances at a department store.Burly, bearded, with multiple earrings and an experimental buzz cut, Dr. Kopelson shares a resemblance to Dr. Brandt in at least one way: He tests many of the fillers he employs on himself. Unlike Dr. Brandt, though, whose face was as smooth and unmarked as a baby\u2019s behind, Dr. Kopelson is a human coloring book.\u201cThe tattoos are all about members of my family,\u201d Dr. Kopelson said, pulling off a snug T-shirt, the better to display the large ivory pagoda inked down the length of his spine.The pagoda is a souvenir in flesh of an antique willed to him by his maternal grandfather, a onetime pushcart vendor on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Concealed in its latticework are the names of that grandfather, Jack, and his wife, Belle. On Dr. Kopelson\u2019s bicep is a rendering of a pendant he wears, which contains the stone from his mother\u2019s engagement ring.Scaling his chest is a tiger with its claws sunk into his neck. Opposite it is an image of a crystal deer figurine with a broken antler, a remembrance of a similar one given to him as a child. The Polynesian-style decorative sleeve covering one forearm has no sentimental significance.\u201cWhat about the piano?\u201d Dr. Kopelson asked and then dropped his pants. There, along his right thigh, was a multicolor drawing of a keyboard held in the grip of a stylized dragon, its yellow tongue disappearing into the physician\u2019s shorts: \u201cI played as a child.\u201dSingle and gay, Dr. Kopelson lives in the flats of West Hollywood, Calif., in a Spanish-style house from the 1920s that he shares with a rescue mutt and three West Highland terriers. The drug abuse issues that briefly threatened to derail his professional career are 15 years into the past, he said, and these days he is part of an extended recovery network that probably includes a few of the celebrities he sees professionally.In a clubby town, intersections like that are all but inevitable. As Mr. Goldwyn noted, it is common Hollywood practice to pass along the names of your best people, from your manager at Creative Artists Agency to the doctor who can treat your zit. \u201cIt\u2019s like sharing military secrets with your allies,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Today: Behind the Green Gables, Trade Twists and Strange Skies", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byEach week, Canada Today mixes The New York Times\u2019s recent Canada-related coverage with back stories and analysis from our reporters, along with opinions from our readers.Willa Pakin writes in the Times Magazine that Polish resistance fighters carried the book to the front and that because of Japan\u2019s large number of postwar orphans, it became part of the school curriculum in the 1950s.While the outcome of trade talks often has a powerful influence on a large number of lives and trade issues can stir political passions, trade negotiations usually move at a stately pace and occur mostly in secret. The closest they generally come to drama is the inevitable wait until a final deadline before a deal is announced.Over past week or so, however, President Trump brought some drama to the somnambulant trade world. First his administration used the latest round in an endless lumber dispute with Canada (the first trade story I covered and one my children can likely inherit if they wish) and an obscure dairy dispute to bash Canadian trade policy. That was soon followed up by suggestions that the president was about to sign Nafta\u2019s death warrant.Then that zig was followed by the zag of an announcement that Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t going to rip up Nafta, at least for now, but renegotiate it. The change was partly the result of a coordinated effort by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico.While it\u2019s possible that state of affairs may have spiraled off in yet another direction by the time you read this, it\u2019s more likely that Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government will be focused on figuring out what Canada wants from any talks.

{"Headline": "To Woo Young Moviegoers, AMC Thinks More Like McDonald\u2019s", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Adam Aron, the chief executive of AMC Theaters, the largest multiplex chain in the world, sat in a hotel suite here last month and sang the praises of a new menu item he called \u201cthe Bavarian Beast.\u201dIt\u2019s a pound-and-a-half salted pretzel the size of a steering wheel. \u201cThere\u2019s also a new jalape\u00f1o-flavored Southwestern dog that\u2019s to die for,\u201d he said. But Mr. Aron was most effusive about another new AMC offering, a juicy chicken sandwich with waffles as buns.\u201cSounds fattening just to hear it described,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201clet alone when you eat it.\u201dPopcorn, candy and soda? How quaint. The concession counter at your local AMC is about to turn into a full-fledged fast-food restaurant.It\u2019s part of a strategy to attract younger audiences and stay relevant in the streaming age of HBO Go, Netflix and Amazon Prime. While small theater companies like the 25-location Alamo Drafthouse have been offering full-restaurant cinemas for years \u2014 AMC itself already operates a 60-location chainlet of Dine-In Theaters \u2014 this effort will bring greatly expanded menus to more than 400 theaters in the United States.Beating its national competitors to the punch, AMC Feature Fare will include cheeseburger sliders, four types of stone-fired pizza, chili dogs, salami bites, chicken tenders, three new popcorn flavors and \u2014 for the health-conscious \u2014 seven gluten-free snacks.\u201cAnd, yes, we now have a curly fry in the portfolio,\u201d said Nels Storm, AMC\u2019s senior culinary director, sounding like a proud papa. \u201cWe wanted to think more like a restaurant company.\u201d Mr. Storm promoted the offerings as the most important advancement in multiplex concessions since the invention of the armrest cup holder.AMC Feature Fare, which will begin rolling out nationwide this summer, comes with risks, starting with the cost of installing equipment and retraining staff. Mr. Aron said AMC planned to spend $700 million on theater upgrades in 2017. (That includes improvements well beyond food, including reclining seats.)Some patrons may not be thrilled to find themselves seated within sniffing distance of those curly fries and salami snacks. (Talk about Smell-O-Vision.)\u201cTime to pack a bottle of ketchup in my purse, I guess,\u201d Jeanine Basinger, founder of Wesleyan University\u2019s film studies program, said with a dose of sarcasm. \u201cAnd wet wipes.\u201dBut Mr. Aron, who took over AMC in 2015 after serving as chief executive of Starwood Hotels & Resorts, has made giving the masses what they want a hallmark of his early tenure. In many ways, food is the last component. AMC has already been aggressively installing advanced Dolby sound and projection systems, extra-wide screens, and La-Z-Boy-style seats. AMC now serves alcohol in roughly 200 of its 660 domestic theaters, with plans to add 100 more this year.Even so, AMC cannot stand pat. Over all, domestic attendance was flat last year at 1.32 billion. Under pressure to increase profits, multiplex chains can increase ticket prices only so much before driving attendance down. That means the concession counter must work harder. Analysts say tens of millions of patrons buy tickets but never snacks.Mr. Aron, who was in Las Vegas for the annual CinemaCon movie-theater owners convention, noted that AMC\u2019s culinary staff had spent a year testing ideas for menu items at the company\u2019s headquarters in Leawood, Kan.It\u2019s trickier than you might imagine, said Mr. Storm, the culinary director.\u201cYou have to be able eat in the dark while still paying attention to Hugh Jackman doing something crazy,\u201d Mr. Storm said.The AMC Feature Fare team also thought about smell. In some cases, Mr. Storm said, the goal \u2014 as with popping popcorn \u2014 is actually to create an I\u2019ll-have-what-they\u2019re-having waft.\u201cIf it\u2019s a smell that we feel will complement the experience,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will promote it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It has also introduced teenagers like Daniel Sanchez, 17, to a relic of the analog age.Earlier this month, Mr. Sanchez was walking through a Walmart near his home in Hayward, Calif., when he spotted a display of cassette tapes, which gave him the sort of big idea he had been hoping for.He sat down with the oldfangled equipment and recorded his fondest memories of his times with Ms. Cerda, who is also 17. To make the promposal hang together, Mr. Sanchez made a sign, \u201c13 Reasons Why You Should Go To Prom w/ Me?\u201dHer post ignited a fiery discussion, with some arguing that the promproposal was trivializing a serious issue.Ms. Cerda defended the gesture: \u201cThis promposal is not causing any harm, just shutup and get over it.\u201dThe online response took her boyfriend by surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate this kind of a reaction,\u201d Mr. Sanchez said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think of the show as about suicide. We thought of it as entertainment. Then I read an article about how the show didn\u2019t do a good job making that clear and that it glorified things. Now I\u2019m thinking about things a little differently.\u201dThe prom took place last weekend, and Ms. Cerda re-upped the promposal tweet with a photo of the couple, in school-dance attire, standing in front of a Mustang, the kind of car driven by one of the characters on the show.Ms. Cerda, a senior who plans to attend the University of California, Davis, in the fall, said she and her boyfriend were not diminishing the seriousness of depression and suicide. \u201cIt\u2019s entertainment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend. It\u2019s popular. No one really is going to die. It\u2019s a promposal.\u201dEndless threads on teenagers\u2019 Facebook feeds delve into whether Hannah is to blame for her own misery. And it can be a challenge to scroll through social media and not come upon the new dis, \u201cWelcome to your tape.\u201d\u201cWe were hate-bingeing the show,\u201d Ms. Urick said. \u201cI didn\u2019t care for it. I yelled at the TV.\u201dShe was annoyed by details she found unrealistic (\u201cWhy do 10th graders have so many tattoos?\u201d) and the lack of context for the plight of its protagonist. \u201cIt was about misplaced blame,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was not much in it about the role of depression and mental illness.\u201dBut to build a sizable Instagram following, Ms. Urick must attract adolescents. As she put it: \u201cThere are a huge number of slime accounts there, and the majority of people who seem interested in slime seem younger.\u201dShe included in the caption to her \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d-related video a suicide-prevention link: \u201cIf you or someone you know is in danger, please visit www.13reasonswhy.info to find out more.\u201dOne impassioned online detractor of the show is Joshua Christmas, an 18-year-old high school junior in San Antonio. Given the issues at the heart of \u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d he found the response, including Mr. Sanchez\u2019s promposal, to be inappropriately lighthearted.\u201cI doubt they had ill intentions,\u201d Mr. Christmas said of the promposaler, \u201cbut suicide is a really serious subject and it doesn\u2019t get talked about in a productive light and this doesn\u2019t help the conversation.\u201dHe added that he himself hadn\u2019t watched the show or read the novel on which it is based, but he has read the character analyses and other discussions on his peers\u2019 Instagram and Twitter feeds.The show is also a big topic among parents. Robyn Seiferheld, 44, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said she first heard about it via a group-text message sent by the mother of a girl who studies dance with Ms. Seiferheld\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Zoe. The mothers were grappling with whether \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d was appropriate for their kids.\u201cI had never heard of it, so I assumed Zoe hadn\u2019t seen it,\u201d Ms. Seiferheld said. \u201cI asked her when she got home from school, and she said: \u2018Mom, I\u2019m almost done with the whole series. All my friends watch it, too.\u2019 It just goes to show you how much they do behind our backs.\u201dMs. Seiferheld watched it herself so that she could discuss it with her daughter. As an adult who still thinks about a cousin who killed herself when they were both young, Ms. Seiferheld considers the show \u201cvery well done,\u201d she said, though too graphic for the young people who are attracted to it.\u201cSome of it, I\u2019m worried, is glamorizing of suicide, but if Zoe is talking to me about it, it makes me feel better,\u201d said Ms. Seiferheld, who recounted that her daughter sobbed her eyes out after watching the sad and shocking final episode.Zoe said she was glad her mother saw the show.\u201cI like talking about it with her,\u201d she said. \u201cMostly, we talk about the bullying and how some of the characters are really mean for not good reasons or no reason at all, and I don\u2019t understand why. My mom said you have to be careful what you say, because saying one thing you don\u2019t think is a big deal could have big impact on someone\u2019s life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Technology Has Failed to Improve Your Airline Experience", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut I come to you as a technology columnist to tell you that technology, too, has failed you.People in Silicon Valley pride themselves on their capacity to upend entrenched industries. Uber defeated taxi cartels. Airbnb made getting a room cheaper and more accessible. Streaming services are undoing the cable business. Yet the airline industry has not just stubbornly resisted innovation to improve customer service \u2014 in many ways, technology has only fueled the industry\u2019s race to the bottom.Travel search engines rank airlines based on price rather than friendliness or quality of service. Online check-in, airport kiosks and apps allow airlines to serve customers with fewer and fewer workers. What we are witnessing is the basest, ugliest form of tech-abetted, bottom-seeking capitalism \u2014 one concerned with prices and profits above all else, with little regard for quality of service, for friendliness, or even for the dignity of customers.\u201cThe airline industry has been on a steady downward trajectory when it comes to customer service for nearly 40 years,\u201d said Henry H. Harteveldt, the president of the Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry research firm. He noted that American carriers were improving on some metrics \u2014 on-time service is up, baggage loss is down and prices keep getting better.\u201cConsumers have shown that they\u2019re willing to put up with an awful lot, including lack of legroom, lack of amenities, mediocre or worse customer service, dirty airplanes and more to save money,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. \u201cAnd the airline industry has evolved to meet that desire\u201d for cheap fares.Part of the problem is how we buy tickets today. The whole system is mercilessly transactional. When you search online, you look for price and travel times, and perhaps you consider some airline loyalty program. Customer service \u2014 that is, how the airline treats you \u2014 isn\u2019t often part of the transaction.As a result, airlines have little incentive to reform themselves.\u201cAirline executives will tell you they don\u2019t view themselves as being service companies,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. \u201cThey want Wall Street to view them as industrial companies, and they want consumers to view them as transportation providers. Customer service is just not what the airlines are about.\u201dCan technology improve how airlines work? Some people have ideas for how that may happen.Emirates and Singapore Airlines are rated the best in the world; two American airlines, JetBlue and Alaska, made TripAdvisor\u2019s Top 10 list. But Delta was the only major American airline to receive TripAdvisor\u2019s seal of approval. United and American Airlines did not meet the site\u2019s minimum threshold, though Bryan Saltzburg, senior vice president for TripAdvisor\u2019s global flight business, said that the two had been improving.One can imagine how such reviews could prompt improvements in airlines. If instead of just price, travel search engines included prominent warnings from reviewers \u2014 \u201cThis airline might give you a bloody lip while kicking you from your seat, 1-star!\u201d \u2014 that could alter travelers\u2019 calculations in booking.\u201cThat would be a good idea \u2014 a filter on travel search that says, \u2018Click this filter and it might cost you a few dollars more, but we\u2019ll bias you towards airlines that treat their customers well,\u2019 \u201d said Paul English, the co-founder of the travel search company Kayak who now runs another travel start-up, Lola.That is small potatoes, though. A bigger disruption would come from altering how we pay for airfares. In the same way that Netflix changed the DVD business by charging a monthly fee, some consultants argue that a membership fee could radically improve flying.\u201cWe\u2019ve prototyped a subscription airline in the past, and it basically gets the airline out of the business of reducing service for offering the lowest fares,\u201d said Devin Liddell, the principal brand strategist for Teague, a design firm that works with Boeing and other transportation companies.You might wonder why an airline would dare try such a thing. After all, airlines are doing well; profits are up across the globe, despite your annoyance about flying.But Mr. Liddell warned of long-term competition from other kinds of transportation. If self-driving cars make driving easier and more comfortable, midrange flights would face competition. Counting the time it takes to clear airport security and get to and from the airport, it takes just as long to drive between some places \u2014 Los Angeles to San Francisco, say \u2014 as to fly. If self-driving technology makes driving much more comfortable, too, lots of people might abandon planes for cars, Mr. Liddell said.For now, though, none of that hurts the commercial air business. Airlines are safe from self-driving cars and the Hyperloop. They are content to feed you ever-worse service for lower prices, because that is what the web wants.Your only technological hope for better service is your smartphone camera and the viral push of social networks. If you are violently kicked off your flight, at least your fellow passengers will post a video to Facebook.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Invokes Internet Freedom While Trying to Kill It", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byEditorialHere we go again. The Federal Communications Commission, now led by an anti-regulation ideologue appointed by President Trump, wants to gut the net neutrality rules that keep powerful broadband companies from calling the shots on the internet, at the expense of consumers.Under the cynical guise of \u201crestoring internet freedom,\u201d the new F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, wants to give big telecom companies carte blanche to treat the content of their subsidiaries and partners more favorably than information from other companies \u2014 a practice that AT&T, Comcast and Verizon are already starting to employ. They would also be able to demand fees from companies like Netflix and YouTube to deliver videos and other content to customers.If the commission, which has a 2-to-1 Republican majority, approves Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, there will be little stopping the broadband industry from squelching competition, limiting consumer choice and raising prices. The previous F.C.C. chairman, Tom Wheeler, helped put the rules Mr. Pai is attacking in place in 2015, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld them last year.Large telecommunications companies have been raking in profits in recent years. And they have been making multibillion-dollar acquisitions \u2014 not something you see from an industry that is withering from senseless regulations. Charter spent more than $65 billion last year to buy Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. AT&T bought DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015 and is trying to buy Time Warner, the media company, for $85 billion.Not only is Mr. Pai\u2019s lament for the broadband industry based on alternative facts, it misses the bigger point. Net neutrality is meant to benefit the internet and the economy broadly, not just the broadband industry. That means the commission ought to consider the impact the regulations have on consumers and businesses. In particular, the commission has a responsibility to protect people with few or no choices; most Americans have access to just one or two companies for residential service and just four big operators for wireless.Mr. Pai argues that if the Wheeler rules are revoked, some safeguards will remain. For example, he says, broadband companies would refrain from blocking or slowing the content of competitors. He has not said how he would ensure that. But the F.C.C. is considering using voluntary commitments from the industry.Under that approach, officials at the Federal Trade Commission would have the power to fine or sue companies that make pledges and then fail to uphold them. But it is hard to believe that voluntary standards would be strong enough. It also puts the onus on individuals and small businesses to complain to regulators and request investigations.Big internet businesses like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix will probably be fine under Mr. Pai\u2019s plans, because they are well established and have the money to cut special deals with broadband companies.Smaller firms and start-ups \u2014 some of which may never get started \u2014 will not be as lucky.Ultimately, though, the real losers will be all Americans, because there will be fewer choices and less innovation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ajit Pai, F.C.C. Chairman, Moves to Roll Back Telecom Rules", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported bySince being appointed by President Trump in January to lead the commission, Mr. Pai has abolished a plan to open the cable box market, suspended several participants from a program for low-income broadband subsidies, and chipped away at net neutrality, which guarantees consumers equal access to all internet content. A proposal to roll back net neutrality rules is expected as soon as this month.The efforts by Mr. Pai are an affirmative response to intense lobbying by telecom firms like AT&T and broadcast television companies such as Sinclair and CBS. Corporate lobbyists have recently flooded the F.C.C. and the offices of lawmakers urging a rollback of Obama-era rules that they view as having become too burdensome on their businesses.Mr. Pai\u2019s effort to deregulate price caps on business-to-business internet service, known as business data services, is a stark example of his drastic change of direction from the previous administration. The estimated $45 billion market for business data services is crucial for wireless carriers and is behind credit card swipes, charges at gas pumps and the transfer of medical records from hospitals.Efforts to regulate prices began in 2005, before President Barack Obama took office. Under Mr. Obama, the F.C.C. pushed for stronger limits on telecom firms that provide business data services by imposing stricter standards on connection rates in less competitive markets.The F.C.C. chairman in the Obama administration, Tom Wheeler, had said there was a lack of competition among telecom firms, making small businesses, such as gas stations and retailers, and major wireless carriers like Sprint vulnerable to price increases.Those increases are passed on to consumers as the businesses raise prices for goods and services to recoup the cost of higher internet connection fees, Mr. Berenbroick said.Mr. Wheeler was unable to get his proposal approved before the presidential election in November, and once Mr. Pai was named to run the agency, the proposal was killed.Late last month, after intense lobbying by AT&T and telecom trade groups, Mr. Pai introduced a plan to loosen the standards for rate regulations in business data services.Mr. Pai declined to comment on the proposal.In more than 10 meetings with F.C.C. officials since the November election and in dozens of other meetings last year, AT&T\u2019s top lobbyists argued that the market was competitive, with cable companies also serving business customers.Small businesses criticized Mr. Pai\u2019s deregulatory efforts, saying they were introduced without a period of public comment. The businesses also said cable operators did not serve all business customers and often did not provide the same robust connectivity that telecom companies do for wholesale connections to the internet.This month, the Small Business Administration\u2019s independent office of advocacy met with officials at the F.C.C. to ask for a delay in the vote.The proposed competitive market test \u201cmay result in reduced choices for small businesses,\u201d S.B.A. officials said in a public filing about the meeting.The other vote on Thursday involves lifting a limit on the amount of certain airwaves any one television broadcasting company can own throughout the country. Mr. Pai has argued that media ownership rules are outdated and ignore the increased competition that media firms face from Facebook, Netflix and other internet companies.But without the limits, which were introduced in 2013 by Mignon L. Clyburn, then the acting F.C.C. commissioner and now the sole Democrat on the commission, the agency may be paving the way for industry consolidation, giving too much power to media corporations that can influence public opinion, some Democrats and consumer groups warn.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, wrote a letter to Mr. Pai this week criticizing the proposal. She singled out the possibility that Sinclair would buy Tribune Broadcasting after the F.C.C.\u2019s vote.\u201cThat would be bad news for consumers in Tribune\u2019s markets in two ways,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst, consumers would lose an independent voice in their media market, and second, consumers could see their cable bills go up because Sinclair charges cable operators more than Tribune for retransmission consent.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "At F.C.C., Obama-Era Rules on Chopping Block", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byThe next target is net neutrality, which is the guarantee that all internet content is equally accessible. That could be followed by cuts in broadband subsidies for low-income households and a relaxation in rules preventing media consolidation in local markets.\u201cThere was a good bit of overreach by the past F.C.C. that caused a lot of confusion,\u201d said Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, who was vice chairwoman for President Trump\u2019s transition. \u201cWe are going to have technology and telecommunications policy that is light touch.\u201dIn a major philosophical shift from the Obama administration, Republican leaders have said they will look for proof of harm before creating new regulations for telecom firms. They believe antitrust and consumer protection laws suffice for government oversight of the sector.\u201cThe F.C.C. needs a more evidence-based approach,\u201d said Roslyn Layton, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who was on Mr. Trump\u2019s F.C.C. transition team. \u201cNo one is writing in and asking for Title 2 reclassification of broadband. Consumers are complaining about unwanted calls and billing problems.\u201dThe changes have been a boon for telecommunications and cable firms that had for years fought unsuccessfully against a Democratic-led F.C.C.They have cheered Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to renominate Mr. Pai after his term ends in June. They want to overturn net neutrality and other rules so they can start offering new business plans that consumer groups have protested.\u201cThe repeal of net neutrality would be a clear positive for broadband network providers,\u201d analysts at Pacific Crest Securities wrote in a research note after the election. Internet service providers \u201cwould be able to charge for access to the network and for \u2018fast lanes,\u2019 which would increase potential monetization.\u201dMomentum is with the Republicans. Last month, they voted to overturn privacy rules (scheduled to take effect later this year) that required internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast to get permission from a customer before tracking and selling data browsing and app activity. Mr. Trump signed the measure on April 3.Lawmakers said the F.C.C.\u2019s rules were much stricter than any privacy requirements placed on web firms like Google and Facebook. They argued that the privacy watchdog duties should fall to the Federal Trade Commission, which does not have strong privacy regulations but requires companies to self-police the privacy policies they promise to customers.Republicans lawmakers moved against the privacy rules under the Congressional Review Act, a procedure used to overturn new agency rules.The lawmakers say their next target is the F.C.C.\u2019s declaration in 2015 that broadband should be treated like a common carrier service, such as the phone. That utility-like categorization strapped new rules on broadband providers.The F.C.C. chairman and lawmakers have promised to undo those rules soon. Ms. Blackburn said in an interview that the F.C.C. will likely create an order to overturn them.Democrats and consumer groups have protested, saying the internet has become essential for work, education and commerce, and needs greater oversight.\u201cThe recent weeks are prologue, and I am fearful that we are moving in a direction that will unravel and undo some incredible gains we\u2019ve made for consumers,\u201d said Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democratic commissioner at the F.C.C.The reclassification of broadband also served in 2015 as the foundation for the F.C.C.\u2019s net neutrality rules, which ban broadband providers from blocking or slowing down of traffic on the internet. Google, Facebook and Netflix have been the strongest corporate backers of net neutrality, but smaller start-ups could be most affected.Without strong net neutrality rules, an internet service provider like Verizon or Charter could give preference to certain content, making it harder for an independent streaming service like Vimeo to compete.An example is AT&T\u2019s free service offering mobile streaming of DirecTV videos to customers that does not count against data limits. Consumer groups have balked, saying the practice puts competing video providers at a disadvantage because their videos do count against those customers\u2019 monthly data limits.Mr. Pai has already signaled his approval of such \u201czero rating\u201d programs, saying they did not appear to violate net neutrality \u2014 and that they are popular with consumers. In January, he closed an investigation into zero-rating promotional streaming programs by AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile.Republicans will also look for ways to cut fat in programs they deem wasteful or abused. One target could be the Lifeline broadband subsidy for low-income households. Mr. Pai prevented nine providers from offering the subsidy weeks into his role at the F.C.C.He has also pointed to longtime media ownership rules that prevent a local TV station from also owning a newspaper in the same town. F.C.C. rules also prevent sharing of resources between TV stations. Mr. Pai has said the convergence of tech and media have made such rules too outdated. Companies like Netflix and Google are a bigger threat to broadcast television stations than media consolidation, Mr. Pai said.The greatest uncertainty surrounds telecom and tech mergers. AT&T\u2019s proposed $85 billion merger with Time Warner is being reviewed by antitrust officials at the Justice Department. Republicans are expected to be generally more permissive of mergers, but Mr. Trump remains the wild card.The president has said he would not allow the merger, and analysts say his complaints about news coverage by CNN, which is owned by Time Warner, could complicate the approval. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said he would not be influenced by politics in decisions at the agency.\u201cThis will be the first big test,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, who leads the investment firm Tusk Ventures. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t in Trump\u2019s wheelhouse, expect to get a more traditional Republican look at mergers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Largely gone are the days of swashbuckling moguls with offices big enough to accommodate Cleopatra\u2019s barge. Instead, the job has become corporate in the extreme \u2014 answering to parent-company boards, serving up sequels so related merchandise keeps selling, cutting costs as DVD money vanishes.The real fun (and profit) for much of the Type A executive set has migrated up the coast to Silicon Valley.Talk about a game of thrones.These are all talented executives who know the movie business inside and out \u2014 no small qualification in such a unique mix of art and commerce. Mr. Horn, in particular, has led Disney to astounding success.

With pretty much everyone agreeing that the film business needs shaking up (the analyst Michael Nathanson released a report last week titled, \u201cFilm Industry: Don\u2019t Just Stand There, Do Something!\u201d), why did Paramount go with the tried and true?As Mr. Bart noted, \u201cGianopulos, thoughtful and cautious, does not fit that description.\u201d\u201cThey hire people that have done it before,\u201d she wrote, \u201cso no boss or board can ever say they took a chance on someone without experience!\u201dMost studios are not in the business of building anything.

Danny (Callum Turner), who reluctantly helps his mother run a proxy bookie\u2019s office for her fellow Polish immigrants in their New York kitchen, is wheedled by his incarcerated brother into running a (probably) illegal errand. His contact, Ellie (Grace Van Patten), desperate to escape from Pittsburgh, has taken on a job as the driver on this errand, at the behest of a very ineffectual low-level criminal played by Mike Birbiglia. Danny and Ellie\u2019s initially abrasive relationship is exacerbated by Danny\u2019s ineptitude. Soon the two wind up in a very leafy Westchester County, N.Y., in search of a briefcase. In this case, the viewer just knows the two have to end up together.\u201cFor this movie, I really wanted a kind of classical Hollywood romance in terms of beats and structure but also to do it in a way that felt modern and genuine,\u201d Mr. Leon said. \u201cCertainly I was thinking of \u2018It Happened One Night,\u2019 and also movies where the characters are thrown together for a compressed amount of time \u2014 \u2018Broadway Danny Rose\u2019 and, even though it\u2019s not a romance, \u2018Midnight Run.\u2019\u201dThe project still presented several risks for Mr. Leon, who was determined to bring his characters to life onscreen without even considering making creative trade-offs to get financing.Ultimately, Mr. Leon wanted to make the film his way or not at all.\u201cI did not want the movie to get made via compromises for a production company,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to make a movie that would work for an audience, obviously.

There were a lot of distributors, including Netflix, who looked at \u2018Tramps\u2019 in script form. And eventually the decision on our end was to get producers on board who would enable me to make it in an uncompromised way.\u201dAfter a good impression in Toronto in September, the selling began, at which point Mr. Leon got a call from one of the film\u2019s producers.\u201c\u2018Oh, no one\u2019s told you? Netflix is going to buy the movie,\u2019\u201d Mr. Leon remembered being told. \u201cThey had come to the table very enthusiastic, and very aggressive, and they\u2019re able to move with the kind of freedom that a lot of theatrical distributors, even notable independent ones, no longer have.\u201d\u201cI did not want \u2018Tramps\u2019 to be subject to a \u2018Let\u2019s put it in a random theater for a week to placate the filmmaker\u2019 approach,\u201d he continued. \u201cI want Netflix to do what Netflix does, which is to put a film out there in a way that will help you find its audience.\u201dBecause the Netflix rights are worldwide, Mr. Leon is freed from the task of taking his movie on the road. \u201cI don\u2019t get to worry myself and micromanage in my head what to do in Spain, or France. That\u2019s fun to do, once. But it takes a lot of time away from whatever movie you\u2019re supposed to be making next.\u201dThe Netflix deal also means that the movie gets shut out of consideration for certain awards. Movies that play only on a streaming service, whether they\u2019ve been produced specifically for that service or not, don\u2019t get to the Oscars. And less than two weeks ago, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences enacted a new rule in the documentary category banning film that originated as multipart or limited series \u2014 that would have shut out this year\u2019s winner, \u201cO.J.: Made in America.\u201d (This kills Oscar chances for the recent, highly praised Netflix-produced documentary \u201cFive Came Back,\u201d even though Netflix had taken the step of showing that film in theaters, probably with Oscar hopes in mind.)Tensions will no doubt rise as higher-profile filmmakers seek freedom via the Netflix route. Unless they don\u2019t: Executives like Mr. Rothman might well be delighted to be rid of potentially high-stress auteurs.

{"Headline": "On \u2018Gotham,\u2019 Ben McKenzie Goes From Detective to Director", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byOn a cold night in January, in a dark alley off Great Jones Street in Manhattan, Bruce Wayne was getting ready to fly.\u201cGotham\u201d was a different sort of comic-book show from the start. Conceived as 100 percent origin story \u2014 how Bruce Wayne became Batman \u2014 it was a superhero series without a superhero. The protagonist was Gordon, a cop whose only superpower was his sense of justice. The format was closer to police procedural than the angst-and-battles of most comic-book shows.In the absence of a larger-than-life hero, the show compensated by featuring its villains, including future Batman foes like the Penguin, the Riddler and a prototype of the Joker. Robin Lord Taylor, as Oswald Cobblepot, a thug who rises to become the Penguin, was the show\u2019s breakout performer. Complementing the emphasis on villainy and the story\u2019s film-noir roots have been a dark tone and a high level of violence, particularly for a broadcast-network show.Despite those differences \u2014 or perhaps because of them \u2014 \u201cGotham\u201d has been a bit lost in the shuffle amid the proliferation of superhero series the last five years. On one side, it\u2019s overshadowed by Netflix series like \u201cJessica Jones\u201d and \u201cDaredevil,\u201d which also go for a dark tone but stick closer to the singular-hero comic-book imperative (and which have benefited from the cachet of both Netflix and Marvel Comics). On the other, it gets less attention (though more viewers) than the more lightweight, purely comics-style shows on CW like \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cSupergirl\u201d (based, like \u201cGotham,\u201d on DC Comics characters).Ranking the superhero shows is difficult because they are so different. \u201cJessica Jones\u201d stands out for the quality of its writing and performances, while \u201cThe Flash,\u201d at times, is the most purely exhilarating. But if you like the dark version of Batman popularized in the comics by Frank Miller and onscreen by Mr. Nolan, then \u201cGotham,\u201d with its grimness and its distinctive (and expensive) retro visual style, measures up.\u201cAt first you\u2019re trying to figure out what the show isn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said. \u201cWe wanted to be, very specifically, not a show with true \u2018superheroes\u2019 dressed in white tights, running faster than the speed of light. There\u2019s so many of them out there. Now that we know what the show is, we break our own rules a bit.\u201dMr. McKenzie \u2014 who had wanted to direct since his tenure on TNT\u2019s \u201cSouthland,\u201d which was canceled before he had the chance \u2014 said his episode was more quiet than most. \u201cThe only constructive criticism I got was that it was \u2018still,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is one of the things I like.\u201d But that stillness incorporated not just a decapitation but several shootings, an attack with a garden tool and a suicide.\u201cYou know, it had some violence,\u201d he acknowledged. As director, he handled one bloody scene by focusing primarily on the face of the aggressor, the Penguin.\u201cI like it when our show is able to go to wherever we need to go to, violence-wise, but with a certain, let\u2019s call it class,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always knifing and dicing in the show, but even that\u2019s relatively elegant. So that\u2019s how I tried to handle that.\u201dMr. McKenzie\u2019s episode was the second half of a pair that began with \u201cHow the Riddler Got His Name,\u201d in which the character Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) assumed his comic-book persona. An important part of the Riddler story was the death of a woman he loved \u2014 the latest in a long line of female deaths on the show.\u201cRight, right,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said as he listened to a list of female victims. \u201cNygma\u2019s lover died because that was our way of marking his change from a studious and reserved lab technician to a full-fledged version of the Riddler. People can criticize the show any way they like. My concern is always, are they dying for a reason? Whichever gender.\u201dYou might not find that answer satisfactory, but there\u2019s a basic truth to it: The show is what it is, a violent, male-centric comic-book adaptation (with, to be fair, several female characters who are stronger and more menacing than most such shows can boast).Viewership for \u201cGotham\u201d has slipped from season to season, currently running about five million in the seven-day ratings. Fox hasn\u2019t announced whether there will be a fourth season. Whenever the show ends, Mr. McKenzie was asked, can we expect the superhero to finally appear?\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he said. \u201cMustache, klieg light, Batman.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the other shows do. \u2018Gotham\u2019 is taking the biggest piece of red meat in the comics world, Batman, and trying to take this one specific sliver of it and cook it really, really well and serve it to you. I always hope we\u2019re Steve McQueen in the classic car with the bomber jacket. An archetypal show.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Fox series \u201cGotham\u201d misidentified Danny Cannon\u2019s role in the show. He is an executive producer, not the showrunner.

The title comes from a polemical radio show on which Samantha (Logan Browning) dresses down white students; some react defensively, while others want to prove, overeagerly, that they get it.Sam\u2019s activism is partly a way to work through her biracial identity. Her romantic life echoes that: She\u2019s discreetly dating an earnest, progressive white guy, Gabe (John Patrick Amedori), but is drawn to Reggie (Marque Richardson), a firebrand black protester.The movie was audacious, irreverent and feisty, with a feel for the tripwires of a supposedly postracial era. It also sometimes felt spread thin by trying to represent a broad range of experiences. The series fleshes out its characters by using its extra time well and embracing the episodic structure of TV.Each episode, excepting the finale, focuses on a particular character. These include Troy (Brandon P Bell), son of the dean of students (Obba Babatund\u00e9), who bottles up the stress of his father\u2019s expectations; and Lionel (DeRon Horton), a gay, intellectual student journalist who\u2019s just becoming comfortable with his sexuality.This character deep-diving is a useful way to complicate first impressions. Coco (Antoinette Robertson) is at first blush Samantha\u2019s opposite \u2014 social-climbing, apolitical and concerned with fitting in among white students.But it\u2019s Coco, a scholarship student, who calls out Samantha for being oblivious to how her own \u201clight-skin privilege\u201d gives her leeway with white people: \u201cYou get away with murder,\u201d Coco says, \u201cbecause you look more like them than I do.\u201dDespite the title, \u201cDear White People\u201d is more concerned with intraracial relations: who is real enough, representative enough, woke enough. Whiteness isn\u2019t the show\u2019s subject or object so much as it\u2019s the social medium through which the characters have to wade. In a flashback, we learn that Coco and Samantha, as new friends, adopted the \u201cDear white people\u201d catchphrase as a way to talk to each other: They riff variations on it to bond, commiserate and fight.One of Mr. Simien\u2019s signatures is to have actors stare into the camera directly, both in group shots and in cutaways during one-on-one conversations. The device underlines the show\u2019s mission: to intrude on your safe space, to demand engagement, to make clear that, yes \u2014 whoever you are \u2014 \u201cDear White People\u201d is talking to you.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With a Hollywood Writers\u2019 Strike Looming, Here\u2019s What to Know", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The threat of a Hollywood strike is getting real.A strike would have serious implications. When writers walked out a decade ago, the impasse cost the Los Angeles economy an estimated $2.5 billion. As production halted, income dried up not only for writers but also for set decorators, caterers, limo drivers and florists. Fans were not thrilled, either, as television schedules became a sea of reruns.Here is what you need to know this time around. How likely is a strike?Longtime Hollywood power players \u2014 agents, studio executives, labor lawyers \u2014 put the chance at roughly 51 percent. But it changes by the day. How would it affect television?Late-night comedy shows would instantly revert to reruns. Summer reality shows, such as \u201cBig Brother,\u201d would arrive \u2014 the writer-producers who work on them have a different contract \u2014 but some scripted series scheduled for the fall would most likely be delayed. A strike could be a death knell for daytime soap operas, which rely on a new episode almost every weekday, unless producers bring in nonunion writers, which happened during the last strike.What about movies?At first, it would be business as usual. Because big-budget event films take years to make, summer movies would continue to arrive on schedule. Films with finished scripts \u2014 and perhaps some with not-so-finished ones \u2014 would continue to go into production. Movie executives really started to sweat the last writers\u2019 strike, which took place in the winter, only when it threatened to derail the Academy Awards, a crucial marketing platform.How long could a strike go on?Anybody\u2019s guess. The Writers Guild walked out for 100 days in 2007-8 and 155 days in 1988. In both cases, the most in-demand writers eventually got tired of losing income and applied pressure to wrap it up. (Thousands of guild members are unemployed in any given year.)Why are writers upset? With the boom in scripted television shows, isn\u2019t there more work than ever?There are definitely more union-made series \u2014 at least 300 last season, or about 40 percent more than two years before that. But networks are ordering fewer episodes per season (10 to 13) than in the past (22 to 24). So a series writing job pays less.At the same time, in a contract provision known as exclusivity, most TV writers can write for only one series at a time, taking them off the market for up to a year. And to top it off, reruns don\u2019t attract very many viewers anymore, limiting residual payments.What does the union want?Negotiators started with a laundry list of requests, including easing that exclusivity rule, but it boils down to raises and bigger payments from studios for the guild\u2019s health plan.Why won\u2019t studios give it to them?Studios are also adamant that writers agree to fundamental changes in how the union health plan functions to avoid future bailout demands.Why is it always the writers who go on strike?As a rule, the directors are well paid and feel valued by entertainment companies, and the actors\u2019 union can be a bag of infighting cats. That leaves the writers.According to historians, the friction between \u201cscribes\u201d and studios dates to the end of the silent film era. Studios suddenly needed writers to provide witty dialogue, so they imported wordsmiths from New York. But they treated writers \u2014 or at least many writers have felt this way ever since \u2014 as expendable stenographers.Put another way, writers see their craft as artistic expression. For the most part, studios see it as commerce.An article on Tuesday about a potential walkout by the Writers Guild of America misstated the year of a previous strike. It was 1988, not 1998.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tictail Makes an Argument for the World\u2019s Small Creators", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byCritical ShopperOf all the lies told on \u2014 and about \u2014 the internet, the most egregious is that anyone can, with a few keystrokes and a little search engine optimization, become a mogul. Barriers to entry are low, yes, and access to information is at a high, but it is still perilously easy for a small business to remain small.That won\u2019t stop people from making things and hoping they catch on, trying to will a tiny niche into a mass market. But it emphasizes all of the steps in the chain separating the would-bes from the breakthrough successes.Into that maw have stepped a small number of intermediary companies: Big Cartel, Shopify and also Tictail, which appears to be the least utilitarian of the bunch. Tictail\u2019s users tend toward the aesthetically appealing, with a refined approach that is more art gallery than factory. Of these services, Tictail has the most unified sense of self. That is clear just from visiting each company\u2019s home page: Tictail\u2019s doesn\u2019t bother with the specifics of its own platform and instead solely highlights makers and their goods.But no matter how coherent Tictail\u2019s online vision may be, and how effective it is in promoting its users, there are things that no amount of online interest can replicate: namely, foot traffic, and the unexpected alchemy of the happenstance purchase.Enter the company\u2019s retail shop, Tictail Market, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which opened permanently last year after a pair of pop-up excursions. The bazaar is admirable in size, with clothing, jewelry, art and more from a range of Tictail users, typically those who are closer to professional than amateur.During visits over the past several months, the inventory was consistently charming, and ever evolving. \u201cSupport your global girl gang\u201d read a placard outside the store a couple of weeks ago. For the whole month, the store was stocked with items by female makers. (A sales clerk estimated that new stock was typically brought into the store about every couple of weeks.)The clothes emphasized drape; the colors were restrained but vivid. On the clothing racks that dominate one side of the store, there were several styles of a desert-rose print by Selva\\Negra, which featured hand-drawn squiggles and plants and a girl wearing a top but no bottom (about $180 to $450); and also some eccentric looks from Victor von Schwarz, a designer interested in oversize and elegantly accented silhouettes. Scattered around the room were various shoes, including sharp ones by LAX, handmade in Tel Aviv, including medium-heel boots in loud black-and-white with assuredly pointed toes, and also stern-looking snakeskin platform loafers ($399) by Reschia, from Stockholm.Smaller items were gathered around the register, like a series of sharp geometric earrings, including squares in gold-plated silver ($36), by Plateaux Jewellry; a couple of books by Lydo Le, including the resilient and surprising \u201cSome Feelings,\u201d a series of anti-gnomic declarations of internet-era confusion ($15); and some eccentric fringe to attach to the top of your shoes, made by Raoulle ($42). Up near the ceiling were a collection of umbrellas with scenes by Tictail-approved artists on the undersides ($48), and underneath them was a display of luminous and humorous silk scarves by Tal Drori and Centinelle.By and large, these items felt like obvious candidates to make the leap from small audience to large, though in some cases the handmade feel of the objects felt like obstacles to scaling a business \u2014 like the lovely oversize hot-pink perfectly knit scarf that had an almost serpentine luxury, or the jewelry by Bagavundas in which thin wisps of silver or brass were wrapped around thread spools ($65 to $115).Tictail is the rare retail intermediary for whom a real-world shop makes sense; it is a middleman for products that benefit from tactile assessment. (SoundCloud and Bandcamp are unlikely to open record stores anytime soon; Netflix will almost certainly not open a movie theater, though Amazon has indicated a growing interest in retail locations.) But even though this store does an admirable job of displaying the range of the company\u2019s offerings, it is unclear whether it can stand on its own, or only makes sense as a loss leader that proselytizes for Tictail\u2019s platform.Whatever the case, this store makes a more aggressive argument for Tictail\u2019s users \u2014 the small creators of the world \u2014 than for its own business. On a wall at the rear of the store, there are tiny fliers with, on one side, loving photographs of the various artisans carried by the store, and descriptions of their wares and their aesthetic intentions on the other. They\u2019re like baseball cards for the various Greenpoint-like neighborhoods all over the world. Collect them all! You never know which rookie will go on to become an all-star.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Love and Travel Meet on the Road", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byThe Love IssueBy MAX READOn a map, the Moki Dugway, which runs across the Valley of the Gods in Southern Utah, looks like the accidental record of a cartographer\u2019s sudden stroke, a dense packet of erratic hairpin turns interrupting the long, unswerving line of State Route 261. It is no less confusing from the ground. Turning onto 261 from the south, you find yourself pointed toward a sheer wall of rock, five miles in the distance. It takes some time, barreling toward the cliff that forms the southern side of Cedar Mesa, to realize what\u2019s going to happen: You\u2019re going to climb the whole thing, in your car. As it turns out, the nest of swerves on the map is no mistake but an impressive feat of engineering \u2014 a gravel road that, over three miles, six switchbacks and a minor coronary event or two, moves you 1,100 feet up. Or down. It is a test of your nerves, your skill, your transmission and, if you\u2019re with a partner, as I was, your relationship.I am a good driver. I don\u2019t want to use my platform here to litigate petty, long-running disputes between Ari and me, but perhaps if I can establish the high quality and safety of my driving in this newspaper, she will finally be convinced. Am I easily distracted? Yes. Did I once blithely run a red light in New Jersey? Accounts differ. Did I receive two speeding tickets last year? Let\u2019s call those legal disputes I chose to settle out of court. Over our 12 years of driving together, I have been diligent, defensive and accident-free, while Ari has spent most of her time in the car attempting to activate a nonexistent passenger-side brake pedal.For as long as the two of us have been together, driving has been a minefield. It\u2019s not a rare dynamic in relationships, I know, but we have a bad habit of planning trips that exacerbate it. Our journey to see the Latrabjarg cliffs in Iceland ended in an extremely tense day down a \u201cscenic route\u201d along safety-rail-free blind turns hugging the craggy Westfjords. A road trip to Venice somehow involved us careening down the mountain passes of the Dolomites during the foggy, muddy spring season, each insisting that the other would be responsible for what seemed to be a clearly imminent catastrophic accident.And, last summer, driving from Santa Fe, N.M., to Salt Lake City, we found ourselves approaching the Moki Dugway, rising above the Colorado Plateau \u2014 a great, gravelly taunt of a road carved into the side of a looming mesa. The approach, snaking between large warning signs that read like hair-metal album titles (\u201csharp curves, steep grades\u201d), is not designed to put the driver (or, for that matter, the passenger) at ease. We braced ourselves, teeth gritted.But the drive up Moki was a breeze. O.K., maybe not a breeze, but not the disaster our personal history might have predicted. I don\u2019t remember a whole lot of the drive itself, so intent was I on not careening off the side of the road. But I know we didn\u2019t yell at each other, and I know the view from the top, overlooking the Valley of the Gods, was worth every milligram of expended adrenaline. I remember that view pretty well because my phone\u2019s wallpaper is a photo of Ari standing above it, smugly smiling, arms thrown back, in the pose of a conquering hero.I don\u2019t think that Moki is, necessarily, the place to go if you want to make peace with your partner\u2019s driving (or passengering, for that matter). But if you drive enough gravel switchbacks with the same person, you start to learn to read each other as well as you read the road. And if you do that, you can get pretty good at navigating the hairy stuff together. Or maybe I\u2019m making too much of a dirt road. We\u2019re renting a car in Naples, Italy, this spring. I\u2019ll let you know how it goes.Max Read is the editor of Select All, New York magazine\u2019s technology site.By UNA LAMARCHEMy husband had been on hold with the Delta agent for about 10 minutes when he began to visibly implode. His ears went from pink to an almost bioluminescent red; the veins in his neck seemed to pulse in time with the sheets of rain beating down on the terrace.Let me pause here. Yes, I know. On the spectrum of unfortunate events, this ranks pretty low. But we were on the tail end of a vacation with our 3-year-old son, having spent a week marinating in chlorine and eating our collective weight in poolside chicken fingers. We\u2019d also had a serious fight just before leaving Brooklyn \u2014 a tearful debate about whether our marriage could survive our differences \u2014 and so had been inoculated against enjoying ourselves. We were desperate to escape back to the bleak Northeast, where at least the weather matched our moods.\u201cAll flights are canceled,\u201d Jeff said, covering the receiver with his palm. \u201cNothing to J.F.K., La Guardia \u2014 not even Newark.\u201d\u201cShh,\u201d our son, Sam, chided from the bed, where he was watching Netflix on my laptop.\u201cI guess we\u2019re stuck,\u201d I said with what I hoped came across as a sympathetic shrug. I was trying to achieve a state of Zen, mostly by drinking a steady stream of rum-and-Cokes. Outside, the rain had suddenly abated, giving way to sun and cerulean sky.Jeff cursed and hung up the phone. He went out to the terrace to smoke and I followed him. We stood at the railing and watched as other families flocked out of their rooms, running barefoot toward the beach.\u201cWe can\u2019t leave for at least two days,\u201d Jeff said, tapping his cigarette and inadvertently casting bits of ash into a brilliant flor de maga. His jaw tensed; he knew as well as I did that we couldn\u2019t afford two more nights at the resort, plus meals. The trip had already been a strain on our double-freelance income.During our blowout just a week earlier, I had wept and keened and threatened divorce. There hadn\u2019t been an inciting incident, just years of stress over parenting and finances that had slowly worn us down. Our marriage felt like a once-uncharted exotic isle that had become mundane and claustrophobic. And now we were marooned on that metaphor.\u201cWe can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Jeff said firmly, as if to convince himself.\u201cNope,\u201d I said, as the speakers surrounding the pool turned back on, blasting Katy Perry.\u201cWell,\u201d Jeff said, \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to get ourselves some cocktails with stupid names and suffer through another beautiful day in paradise.\u201d Then he smiled at me. A small smile, and a bit forced \u2014 the kind you summon at the end of a long day, in surrender \u2014 but it was enough.We weren\u2019t going to solve our predicament that afternoon, as our hotel tab clicked ever upward and the runways in New York sat empty. We would have to stay in a holding pattern. But we could try to make the best of it.Sam was beside himself when we told him we were staying. He ran for the door so fast we couldn\u2019t even get his flip-flops on. Within seconds we would be one of those barefoot families running into the waves.No one would know the difference.Una LaMarche, a writer based in Brooklyn, is still married to Jeff. They have not gone back to Puerto Rico.By STEVE FRIEDMANSouth of Moscow and east of the Black Sea, I decided to marry my translator.It was there, close to if not in Ukrainian airspace, that a Russian woman (not my translator) rammed the back of her seat into my soft American knees and, when I yelped, turned and glowered at me, then said something I didn\u2019t understand while she spat in my direction, on purpose or accidentally, I couldn\u2019t swear. My fellow Aeroflot passengers seemed to be drinking inordinate amounts of vodka, swallowing large, greasy chunks of gray, malodorous cold cuts and bellowing what sounded like angry team anthems. Jittery accordion sounds came from the plane\u2019s speakers, accompanied by aggressive harmonica noises. The plane bucked and shook, and I thought I might vomit. That is the moment I fell in love. Her name was Yulia.It was spring, 2003. We\u2019d been in Moscow four hours earlier and were flying to Krasnaya Polyana, a ski town so impoverished, I\u2019d read, raw sewage was dumped in the river a mile from the village, and wild pigs roamed the streets. Vladimir Putin reportedly had plans to modernize the area. Ski Magazine sent me to investigate.Jet-lagged, nauseated, moderately terrified, I turned to Yulia so that she might translate the lady\u2019s growls. But she was sleeping. I had known her for three years (she was a former student), but only then noticed the lushness of her inky eyelashes, the grace of her long, tapered fingers. I closed my eyes and saw our lives happily entwined on the stark and wind-swept Siberian steppes. A tidy yurt was involved.Should I wake Yulia with a gentle kiss, then whisper, in Russian, a phrase I\u2019d memorized back in New York? \u201cYou look just like Anna Kournikova, only prettier.\u201dMaybe I should have, but I didn\u2019t.In town, a ski shop attendant slammed a fiberglass pole on a table, inches from my head, and yelled (Yulia translated) that my feet were so unusually shaped (they are not!) that I couldn\u2019t expect rental boots to fit perfectly. A taxi driver tried to make us pay for a tour we didn\u2019t request. A waitress suggested boiled bear tongue.But I had Yulia. Competent, beautiful Yulia. Wise Yulia. Excellent eyelashes. Yet over the next three days, even Yulia let me down. \u201cEnough with the pigs,\u201d she told me when I asked her a sixth time to inquire if others had seen the elusive porkers. \u201cRelax,\u201d she said when I demanded to know what a gas mask, with instructions, was doing in my hotel room. When I complained that the bathrooms on the slopes were disgusting, she sighed and rolled her black-as-the-Norilsk-night-sky eyes.\u201cMisattribution of arousal\u201d is a term in psychology that describes the tendency to wrongly attribute feelings of excitement \u2014 shallow breathing, heightened blood pressure and flushed skin \u2014 to romantic and sexual longing. One famous experiment involved two groups of men walking across two bridges, one stable, one swaying. After crossing, each man was approached by a woman who offered her phone number. The swaying-bridge walkers were more likely to call. Some doubtless thought they were in love. Really, they were just scared. Below, I always imagined, raged a crocodile-infested river.After returning to New York, I never saw Yulia again. Last I heard, she was running a yoga center in India. The village we visited was developed, and in 2014 it served as a Winter Olympics site.If I had opened my terrified heart, might Yulia and I have shared a thrilling affair? Maybe. More likely, I tell myself now, Krasnaya Polyana was my crocodile-infested river. Yulia just happened to be standing at the end of a swaying suspension bridge.Steve Friedman, the author of \u201cDriving Lessons\u201d and \u201cLost on Treasure Island,\u201d has twice been a National Magazine Award finalist.By SHAUNA SELIYI really wanted my new girlfriend\u2019s parents to like me \u2014 but were they maybe trying to kill me? I had to wonder. It was only the second time I had met them, and they had brought me to a remote wilderness area in Colorado, where we were now stranded, on a cold and snowy afternoon at 10,000 feet above sea level.A few hours earlier, we had climbed into a Sno-Cat, a metal box on tank treads \u2014 me, my new girlfriend, her parents, her sister and brother-in-law. Also a husky and two Newfoundlands. We were headed out on a mountain road that was technically closed for the winter to spend the night at their summer cabin.Her parents made me nervous. I knew their approval would be essential. They were aggressively outdoorsy, and I was not.We had been chugging along in the Sno-Cat for a good while when the driver mused that there was no real reason to stay on the road. We twisted down a hill, across a flat, and plunged into the woods.Then, several miles in, the Sno-Cat coughed and went silent. The driver tried to revive it, but ultimately pronounced it dead. He said he would hike out and get help.We were in a tough spot, my girlfriend\u2019s father explained \u2014 too far from the cabin to reach it by foot, and far enough from town that it would be quite a hike to safety. But it might not be prudent to wait for the driver to return, as the temperature would soon plummet.We were in a corridor of tall pines, snow drifting down. I pictured the cross-country skiers who would glide through the next morning and find a frozen lesbian.Her dad said, in a measured way, that we should probably get started walking toward town. Everyone turned to me \u2014 the potential weak link \u2014 for a second, even the husky. She had two different colored eyes and saw straight through my brave facade. It was our secret, though. I could not fold. I smiled and started hiking.We headed out in a close pack. Then my girlfriend\u2019s mom\u2019s ankle started to hurt. Snow was gathering in the webbing of the Newfies\u2019 feet and freezing into balls of ice, slowing them down. The husky kept circling us, making sure no one got left behind, every loop getting wider.A few hours later, we heard a welcome sound: the buzzing of a snowmobile. We flagged it down, and the snowmobiler whisked away my girlfriend\u2019s mother.Another snowmobile came, and we tried to stretch a 150-pound Newfoundland across its seat, her legs dangling over each side. She kept sliding off. It was clear my girlfriend\u2019s father would have to walk the dogs all the way back to town.There were enough snowmobiles coming for the rest of us, though. The driver who stopped for me was in a stiff black snowsuit, a black visor and helmet. No words were exchanged as we sped away.That was 12 years ago. My girlfriend and I got married this past summer. In his toast, her dad talked about my willingness to scrap through that misadventure as an early indicator that we might be a match.As he spoke, I remembered standing in the parking lot where the snowmobilers had dropped us, exhausted and waiting for him. The last bits of sun were draining from the sky. I felt like we were in a family together already. A family \u2014 a collection of beings working their way across a landscape that is sometimes forgiving and generous and other times unfathomable and callous. The husky makes her laps and you look out at the horizon, willing everyone in to safety.Shauna Seliy teaches in the English department at Northwestern University.By ERIC BENNETTThe Museum of Northern British Columbia in Prince Rupert is arguably the most elegant structure in that port town of about 12,000 people. It has the lines and structure of a traditional long house and the expansive glass of something modern. You can inhale a cedar scent from its massive beams while surveying a harbor where birds and sea mammals hunt. Those animals\u2019 ancestors, centuries ago, inspired the designs on the blankets and bent cedar boxes that fill the space.I visited the museum on my third day in town. For a month I had been traveling by train, riding west from Ottawa, stopping in cities and sleeping in Airbnbs. Prince Rupert, near Alaska, was my most remote destination. Soon I would head back to places with traffic and cocktail bars.Airbnb offers two options: whole homes or shared spaces. The latter are cheaper and come with company. You eat where your hosts eat and shower where they shower. My hosts included a stay-at-home dad in Toronto and a photographer in Winnipeg who orchestrated hootenannies. Here, I was staying with a woman we\u2019ll call Kelli.Kelli lived in a split-level house on a messy dead-end street. She drove a pickup, sold tools to construction crews, hunted moose, enjoyed assault rifles and was raising two sons while earning an M.B.A. She had blond curls and stunningly winsome eyes. Her hospitality was emphatic. As a guest, in general, I try to tread lightly \u2014 to need nothing more than key and bed. But on this trip I needed one other thing: solitude. I was traveling to write, and Prince Rupert seemed ideal. But to Kelli I was a lonely guy with time on his hands.Is there anything more awkward than being pitied for lacking exactly the thing you\u2019re intent on avoiding? Kelli invited me to dinner. She led me and her boys on a hike in the mountains. She drove me around town. And when I mentioned the museum, she smiled and waited. \u201cWould you like to come?\u201d I asked.I was not going to the museum for my own sake. My mother, though not a professor, possesses a doctoral command of cultural anthropology. She consumes monographs on the Mayans like normal people binge-watch \u201cGirls.\u201d In her eyes, my travels in Canada could be about one thing only: Kwakwaka\u2019wakw artifacts.Kelli met me at the museum wearing a plaid cap and matching vest \u2014 she was utterly put together. If she dressed like this for work, I couldn\u2019t picture her at a construction site. I had an overwhelming sensation of being beamed at. It didn\u2019t fade as we stood before the Tsimshian button blanket with dentalium shell or the shamanic grizzly-claw headdress.Airbnb has real emotional overlap with first dates. Effusive amenability, total gameness, is the default. You strive to be liked. But was this an actual first date?Kelli did not admire the artifacts. She admired my admiration of the artifacts. But I did not admire the artifacts either. I had come to pay homage to my mother\u2019s admiration. Which was hard to do under the best of circumstances, and impossible while under Kelli\u2019s consummate cheerful gaze.Two virtual strangers were hungering together for things out of reach. Is mutual pity the inverse of a mutual crush? If so, the inverse in this case seemed to echo with love. Kelli and I didn\u2019t make out later, even after an evening stroll by Cow Bay, where seals barked and huffed in the darkness. But the next morning I accepted a ride to the station and enjoyed a kiss on the cheek \u2014 and, two days later, poured my very soul into her online review from an apartment in Vancouver that I had all to myself.Eric Bennett is the author of \u201cWorkshops of Empire\u201d and \u201cA Big Enough Lie.\u201dBy R. ERIC THOMASI always imagined I would get engaged at a sushi bar. Not just any sushi bar, but a classy sushi bar. I have standards. Can you imagine the thrill of sitting at a sushi conveyor belt, watching the little plates of maki roll by and suddenly spying a ring, balancing on bonito?Perhaps it stems from my love of food that arrives with no effort whatsoever, but when I tried to envision something as improbable as a proposal, the conveyor belt always came to mind. So, it was with no small amount of surprise that I found myself getting engaged 6,436 feet above sea level, outside, with no sashimi in sight.It was the idea of the man who now is my husband. David is an Eagle Scout from the West Coast. He self-identifies as white, outdoorsy and Presbyterian. I self-identify as Vanessa Huxtable. He spent his childhood camping and snow-caving. The closest I got to communing with nature as a child was reading \u201cA Tree Grows in Brooklyn\u201d multiple times.But David thought it would be momentous to hike up Black Butte, a stratovolcano in his home state, Oregon, and exchange engagement rings. \u201cBut who will light a sparkler and cheer for us?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe bobcats?\u201d We had decided that we wanted to marry each other months earlier \u2014 I thought about it after the first night we met \u2014 but neither of us could point to a specific time when we had made a move. Hence the trip.Walking up a mountain never seems like a great idea unless you are Moses. And, yes, I know that it is not a mountain, but I had never heard the term stratovolcano until I searched \u201cWhat is Black Butte?\u201d so most of my jokes about this involve mountains.In the weeks leading up to our cross-country trip, I started building a fortress of jokes: physical exertion jokes, jokes about the things white people do for fun. All of this was done in an attempt to protect myself from the fear that this proposal, so far from anything I imagined, would feel like nothing.David had hiked Black Butte many times before; he used each trip to mark movement in his life. He wanted to share this special place with me as we moved forward. I worried that, like Diana from \u201cA Chorus Line\u201d on the hill, I would not feel the motion.What is a moment supposed to feel like? And how do you know if you are feeling the right thing?I was deeply afraid that the magic of opposites attracting and of moving outside of one\u2019s comfort zone and of recently legalized same-sex marriage and of the thin mountain air and of a pioneering spirit wouldn\u2019t work on me.But with fears intact, I set out on the two-hour hike in late July, wearing convertible pants we bought for the occasion, because I love him. At the summit, we made a cairn, a pile of rocks signifying an important place in a journey. David said that in mountaineering, cairns were used to mark the path when it was difficult to know where to go.David, a pastor, had written promises for us to read as we put rings on each other\u2019s fingers, the setting sun glinting off the metal. Magic. I looked at him, this pile of rocks and the stunning vista, and I felt everything. I felt joy, belonging and connection. I felt embarrassed because I was crying so hard that the other hikers thought he was breaking up with me. I felt exhausted, sweaty, chilly and hopeful. In a place I never imagined I would be, there was a new feeling: motion.I cannot say if it was the right feeling, but I know it was the best feeling I have ever had.Advertisement"}

He is expected to introduce a proposal as early as this month.Was this sincere outreach or window dressing?It is interesting to note that of the four companies, only Facebook was born on the internet and does almost of all of its business online. Intel sells chips. Cisco sells networking gear. Oracle sells software.Yes, they all have internet-based businesses. (Oracle, in particular, says its cloud-computing business is growing fast.) And their bottom lines are all dependent on the healthy growth of the internet.But they are all already cash-rich companies, able to afford all but the most ridiculous internet-access rates. None of them are the sort of businesses that could be hurt most by changes to net neutrality \u2014 internet-based start-ups that can\u2019t afford high prices.If Mr. Pai\u2019s overtures are to be considered sincere by the tech industry, he will have to understand the risks for the little guys that could make up the next generation of giants.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hacker Leaks Episodes From Netflix Show and Threatens Other Networks", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byA hacker who claims to have stolen unreleased television shows from several major networks shared the coming season of the Netflix series \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d on Saturday after the person said the streaming service failed to meet its ransom requests.The breach appears to have occurred at the postproduction company Larson Studios, a popular digital-mixing service in Los Angeles for television networks and movie studios. The hacker or hackers, who go by the name \u201cthedarkoverlord,\u201d also claim to have stolen unreleased content from ABC, Fox, National Geographic and IFC. The Federal Bureau of Investigation learned of the episode at Larson Studios in January but did not start notifying the content companies until a month ago.A message to Larson Studios was not immediately returned.Netflix had announced this year that Season 5 of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d would be released June 9, and it was not immediately clear whether it planned to move up the release date.In a statement, Netflix said: \u201cWe are aware of the situation. A production vendor used by several major TV studios had its security compromised and the appropriate law enforcement authorities are involved.\u201dThe thefts are the latest in a long line of ransom and extortion attacks perpetuated by cybercriminals over the past year. Security experts have been responding, with greater frequency, to breaches in which these criminals threaten to expose or delete proprietary information unless companies pay a ransom.This specific breach highlights a risk posed by the weak security practices in the postproduction studios that manage the release of proprietary entertainment content. While companies like Netflix and Fox might invest in state-of-the-art cybersecurity defense technology, they must also rely on an ecosystem of postproduction vendors, ranging from mom-and-pop shops to more sophisticated outfits like Dolby and Technicolor, which may not deploy the same level of cybersecurity and threat intelligence.The stolen content appears to be dated. In an online post, thedarkoverlord said it had obtained the first 10 episodes of Season 5 of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d; the breach occurred before the final three episodes were released to postproduction studios. The first episode was made public on a file-sharing site on Friday, which the hacker linked to via Twitter with a threat: \u201cLet\u2019s try to be a bit more direct, Netflix.\u201d The nine other episodes were released on Saturday.In a message posted Saturday, thedarkoverlord criticized Netflix for not meeting its blackmail requests. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be this way, Netflix,\u201d the message said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose a lot more money in all of this than what our modest offer was.\u201dThe statement continued: \u201cWe\u2019re quite ashamed to breathe the same air as you. We figured a pragmatic business such as yourselves would see and understand the benefits of cooperating with a reasonable and merciful entity like ourselves.\u201dThe hacker threatened to release content from other studios on Saturday if its demands were not met. ABC, Fox and IFC declined to comment, and a message to National Geographic was not immediately returned.Last summer, the same hacker claimed to have breached at least three health care companies in the United States and a health insurer, and attempted to sell their stolen data on the dark web, on a website called TheRealDeal, for $96,000 to $490,000.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dave Chappelle Is an American Folk Hero", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byEleven years on the road doing standup has given the comedian a unique empathy for the people of this country.Michaels had also specifically wanted Chappelle to be the first postelection host, which might have struck some as mad risky \u2014 \u201cI have this reputation for being, like, unpredictable,\u201d Chappelle admits \u2014 and this was the comedian\u2019s first time performing live on network television, in a divided America no less. For Chappelle himself, the moment \u201cfelt bigger than Trump winning the election,\u201d he says. \u201cTrump winning the election felt like a force of nature. Me coming back to television in that fashion felt like the arduous task. I bumped into Louis CK the night before and he told me, don\u2019t do your actual monologue in rehearsal, and that was probably the best advice anyone had given me. ... I just did a fake monologue at rehearsal.\u201dDAVE CHAPPELLE did not just turn up on \u201cSNL,\u201d or nab a reported $60 million deal with Netflix (for three taped stand-up shows), after years of seclusion. He\u2019s been touring consistently, traveling on buses and planes and, one time, crossing the country on his motorcycle. He never really went anywhere, in other words, except inside himself. For Chappelle that meant briefly traveling to Africa right after quitting the show, then returning to his stand-up roots, performing in intimate spaces when he felt like it, and, yes, it also meant sometimes stopping a show because he didn't like the reaction of members of the audience.I last sat down with Chappelle in 2006, and it was abundantly clear that he was unhappy; the pressures of stardom and the media\u2019s insatiable fascination terrified him. The year before he had left his show at the height of its popularity, and he asked me if he had done the right thing, if he should go back. I told him that I couldn\u2019t possibly answer that question for him. He didn\u2019t go back, of course. He quit \u2014 the way Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Nina Simone quit, the way Kurt Cobain wanted to. People thought he was crazy or stupid, and said so.I think of all of this as I watch Chappelle, in a black hoodie, with his ever-present cigarette bungee-jumping from his mouth, pacing the outer ring of the Gotham Comedy Club in New York one night in March. The packed house has no idea he\u2019s here, or that Jerry Seinfeld will introduce him. It is mostly white folks \u2014 300 millennials, Gen Xers, baby boomers, shoulder to shoulder. The race of the crowd doesn\u2019t matter to Chappelle. \u201cI feel grateful that things are working out, the way people support me,\u201d he had told me earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s really warm, man, like an old friend. I was reflecting on it, and doing stand-up has been one of the most consistent parts of my life, you know what I mean? Like it was the first adult decision I made, and I really stuck to it.\u201dA colossal roar goes up when Seinfeld announces Gotham\u2019s surprise guest. Chappelle arrives onstage to a standing ovation \u2014 the sort of wild applause generally reserved for, say, a populist presidential candidate, like Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump. Except Chappelle has a singular gift for blurring left and right, blue states and red states. His 11 years on the road have taken him from big cities to towns, allowing him to talk with, listen to and feel people, but with the sort of authentic interest a politician can rarely duplicate.That Chappelle is an African-American raised by college professor parents, a Muslim with a Filipino wife, three biracial children and a white stepbrother, speaks to his singular ability to remix cultural boundaries in ways many cannot, or wish they could. He also happens to feel most comfortable in Middle America, on the acres of land he bought in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in the 2000s. So, yes, he is sprawling urban graffiti, with his casual usage of the N-word, his elastic black English and his fusillade of curse words, but he's also small-town folk with a hard-won vulnerability.I have known Chappelle and watched him do stand-up in New York since he was a bone-thin 19-year-old import from the Washington D.C. area, where he spent big chunks of his youth. Today, at 43, the baby face is gone, and there\u2019s gray in his occasional goatee; his years of weight-lifting have yielded cartoonishly thick Popeye biceps. But what I see as I watch him pace that Gotham stage \u2014 freestyling on love, marriage, the ways and words of the LGBTQ community, racism, sexism \u2014 is a master at his game, one with the down-home storytelling of Langston Hughes and the comic fearlessness of Richard Pryor and George Carlin. Chappelle has become, on his own terms, a comedian who not only speaks for us, but ahead of us.\u201cMAYBE THERE IS a purpose for me being here, outside of my own desire,\u201d he said to me on a phone call a few days before the Gotham appearance. \u201cI feel like more of an empathetic person as I age. I have a better understanding of the emotional content just based off certain experiences I went through, and I\u2019m sure it has influenced my work.\u201dChappelle still goes hard at his shows, but more and more, he makes a point of letting you know he\u2019s joking \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be malicious,\u201d he\u2019ll say, even as he challenges white racism, black self-hatred or the contradictions of this or that community. It\u2019s a humility that comes from what he\u2019s been through.\u201cThe experience of having that show, then not having that show, raising kids, and all the different things that happen in a person\u2019s life \u2014 it humbles you. It opens the door for gratitude, and you appreciate things more because you fight for it.\u201dThis year marks three decades since Chappelle first did a stand-up routine at a nightclub, as a 14-year-old. (Five years later he was being hailed as someone to watch.) \u201cYeah, I\u2019m getting to that age where I start thinking of a legacy, not even that I\u2019m that old, but I\u2019ve just been doing it that long,\u201d he says. \u201cI was at Ali\u2019s funeral and I saw Farrakhan there, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and I saw Bill Clinton. They all looked great, but I realized that these guys are getting old. And then I realized I\u2019m getting old, and we\u2019re all here because Muhammad Ali is dead!\u201dHumility means he\u2019s not as concerned with audiences liking what he says. \u201cA person could come to a show like mine, and they could disagree with me, and it wouldn\u2019t ruin the show. They just wouldn\u2019t agree with me,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople say I\u2019m brave. Well, it\u2019s like mutual brave, like we are all in this together,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a messy intersection of what you think about things, what you feel about things, and I think people find solace in informative art, because it reminds them that they\u2019re now \u2014 oh! \u2014 thinking and feeling this way.\u201dChappelle\u2019s shows attract die-hard Republicans and liberals, and each find plenty to laugh at. Perhaps because of this he is less despairing of America than some. \u201cI mean as bad as things feel right now, I can see the common denominators on both sides, and it\u2019s not as divided as people believe.\u201dIf he\u2019s sounding a little statesmanlike, maybe it\u2019s because he has considered entering politics. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, but I don\u2019t think I would do something like that unless I was confident that I could be effective,\u201d he says. \u201cRight now I feel like just using my voice, like anyone else in the community. But political aspirations as a comedian \u2014 I\u2019ve said so much wild [expletive] in my life.\u201dI remind him that the current president has said some wild things, too. \u201cYeah, that guy. He really broke the ice, bro.\u201d Chappelle breaks into one of his uncontrollable laughs.Is he at least comfortable being a star now? \u201cI don\u2019t know that I consider myself a star,\u201d he says. \u201cI just feel whatever this experience is, is more grounded in reality.

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Chairman Pushes Sweeping Changes to Net Neutrality Rules", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday outlined a sweeping plan to loosen the government\u2019s oversight of high-speed internet providers, a rebuke of a landmark policy approved two years ago to ensure that all online content is treated the same by the companies that deliver broadband service to Americans.The chairman, Ajit Pai, said high-speed internet service should no longer be treated like a public utility with strict rules, as it is now. The move would, in effect, largely leave the industry to police itself.The plan is Mr. Pai\u2019s most forceful action in his race to roll back rules that govern telecommunications, cable and broadcasting companies, which he says are harmful to business. But he is certain to face a contentious battle with the consumers and tech companies that rallied around the existing rules, which are meant to prevent broadband providers like AT&T and Comcast from giving special treatment to any streaming videos, news sites and other content.His plan, though still vague on the details, is a sharp change from the approach taken by the last F.C.C. administration, which approved rules governing a concept known as net neutrality in 2015. The rules were intended to ensure an open internet, meaning that no content could be blocked by broadband providers and that the internet would not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for internet and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else.In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Pai said he would undo that classification.Mr. Pai said he was generally supportive of the idea behind net neutrality but said the rules went too far and were not necessary for an open internet. He said he would also seek public comment on how to preserve the basic principles of net neutrality \u2014 the prohibitions of blocking, throttling and paid priority for online traffic.Mr. Pai voted against the current rules as a commissioner. Critics of his ideas for changing the rules warned that making any commitments only voluntary would pave the way for the creation of business practices that harm competition.\u201cIt would put consumers at the mercy of phone and cable companies,\u201d said Craig Aaron, president of the consumer advocacy group Free Press. \u201cIn a fantasy world, all would be fine with a pinkie swear not to interrupt pathways and portals to the internet despite a history of doing that.\u201dThe new policy faces several hurdles before going into effect, including months of comments and revisions. But Republicans have a 2 to 1 majority on the commission, including Mr. Pai, so most proposals he puts up for a vote will generally be expected to pass.Consumer groups and tech companies have warned of a legal challenge, however. The current net neutrality rules were affirmed by a federal appeals court, which could put an extra burden on Mr. Pai to justify his changes.The F.C.C.\u2019s policing of broadband companies has drawn greater interest with recent proposals for big mergers, such as AT&T\u2019s $85 billion bid for Time Warner, that create huge media conglomerates that distribute and own video content. Already, AT&T is giving mobile subscribers free streaming access to television content by DirecTV, which it owns. Consumer groups have complained that such practices, known as sponsored data, put rivals at a disadvantage and could help determine what news and information is most likely to reach consumers.Telecom and cable companies applauded the announcement on Wednesday. Since Mr. Pai\u2019s appointment in January by President Trump, their lobbyists have flooded the agency and the offices of Congress, pushing for an unwinding of rules that they say hamper their businesses. The No. 1 target has been the rules on broadband providers, which they complain have crimped their willingness to invest in their networks.Excerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.\u201cWe applaud F.C.C. Chairman Pai\u2019s initiative to remove this stifling regulatory cloud over the internet,\u201d Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cIt was illogical for the F.C.C. in 2015 to abandon that light-touch approach and instead regulate the internet under an 80-year-old law designed to set rates for the rotary-dial-telephone era.\u201dMr. Pai has been an active figure in the Trump administration\u2019s quest to dismantle regulations. He froze a broadband subsidy program for low-income households, eased limits on television station mergers and eased caps on how much a company like AT&T or Comcast can charge another business to get online.Consumer groups have opposed some of his changes, and they challenged the assertions of telecom companies that broadband regulations harm their businesses. They said publicly traded broadband companies have increased investments in their networks 5 percent since the current rules went into effect.About 800 tech start-ups and investors, organized by the Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator and the San Francisco policy advocacy group Engine, protested the unwinding of net neutrality in a letter sent to Mr. Pai on Wednesday.\u201cWithout net neutrality, the incumbents who provide access to the internet would be able to pick winners or losers in the market,\u201d they wrote in the letter.So far, Google and Netflix, the most vocal proponents of net neutrality in previous years, have not spoken individually about Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal. Speaking through their trade group, the Internet Association, they said the broadband and net neutrality rules should stay intact.\u201cRolling back these rules or reducing the legal sustainability of the order will result in a worse internet for consumers and less innovation online,\u201d Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, said in a statement.Mr. Pai vowed a strong commitment to the plan: \u201cMake no mistake about it: This is a fight that we intend to wage and it is a fight that we are going to win.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect location for the policy advocacy group Engine.

But some of the credit is also due to \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d the legal regime that nurtured and protected the open internet and streaming TV in the first place.Streaming, after all, is a cheaper and better form of television. For that reason, it is something the cable industry would not have allowed to thrive had it been left to its own devices. Fortunately, net neutrality rules prevented cable companies from killing or interfering with streaming television during its infancy.In analyzing the attack on net neutrality, one looks in vain for the problem that needs to be fixed. Net neutrality refers to rules intended to ensure that broadband providers cannot block content or provide faster delivery to companies that pay more. The policy was put in place in the George W. Bush administration, where it enjoyed bipartisan support. In the years since, it has sheltered bloggers, nonprofit organizations like Wikipedia, smaller tech companies, TV and music streamers, and entrepreneurs from being throttled by providers like AT&T and Verizon that own the \u201cpipes.\u201dThe policy\u2019s contributions are not just cultural but also economic: Television has been revitalized, and waves of successful internet start-ups have returned America\u2019s high-tech industry to unquestioned global leadership. Net neutrality has been among the most effective economic policies of the 21st century.Make no mistake: While killing net neutrality may be rolled out with specious promises of \u201cfree video,\u201d there is nothing here for ordinary people. Lowering prices is just not something that cable or phone companies will do except under pressure. Instead, the repeal of net neutrality will simply create ways for cable and phone companies to tax the web and increase your broadband bill. Raise your hand if that sounds enticing.The more convincing explanations for this change are more straightforward \u2014 and darker \u2014 than Mr. Pai\u2019s. Much of Silicon Valley and Hollywood have supported both net neutrality and the Democratic Party, making an attack on the policy a kind of punishment. If Mr. Pai\u2019s reasoning sounds forced and unconvincing, it is because this proposal comes right from the swamp, and can be attractive only to those who have lived there long enough to no longer notice the stench.The proposal to kill net neutrality is terrible economic policy and bad politics. It is starkly inconsistent with any populist mandate. There is a reason that net neutrality is called the third rail of internet politics, and Mr. Pai has now grabbed it.Tim Wu, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads,\u201d is a professor at Columbia Law School and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In House of Murdoch, Sons Set About an Elaborate Overhaul", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Since taking over two years ago, James and Lachlan Murdoch seem determined to rid the company of the old-guard culture on which their father built his empire.Supported byThe sun was setting in New York as James Murdoch, looking confident in cream pants and a dark blazer, stepped before 350 guests in a glass-walled concert hall and waxed poetic about his pet TV channel and its dedication to \u201cscientific literacy.\u201dThis is what generational change at one of the globe\u2019s most powerful media conglomerates looks like.With James and his elder brother, Lachlan, 45, who is the executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, firmly entrenched as their father\u2019s successors, they are now forcibly exerting themselves. Their father remains very involved, but his sons seem determined to rid the company of its roguish, old-guard internal culture and tilt operations toward the digital future. They are working to make the family empire their own, not the one the elder Murdoch created to suit his sensibilities.\u201cThey are both young enough to see and understand that the company has to change,\u201d said Doug Creutz, a media analyst at Cowen and Company. \u201cAt some media companies, there is a feeling that people are being dragged kicking and screaming into the digital future. I don\u2019t get that sense with the brothers at all.\u201dFox executives either did not return calls or declined to comment for this article. But a picture of a new Murdoch era emerged in interviews with more than a dozen people who work at the company or are friendly with James and Lachlan, most of whom spoke anonymously for fear of reprisals.Over his storied career, Rupert Murdoch repeatedly showed that he was willing to trade workplace culture for profits \u2014 ride people hard, overlook putrid behavior as long as the results are there, reward infighting. When his sons took over two years ago, however, they immediately set about creating a warmer and fuzzier workplace, at least in parts of the company, and moving away from an anti-politically correct environment that, at least in the case of Fox News, seemed to enable the kind of behavior of which Mr. Ailes and Mr. O\u2019Reilly have been accused. Both men deny the allegations.Employees at the Fox broadcast network said they were pleasantly surprised, for instance, to be summoned to a town-hall meeting \u2014 something that had rarely if ever been done under the archly conservative Rupert Murdoch \u2014 where the brothers espoused transparency, workplace diversity and greater cooperation between divisions. In the fall, James and Lachlan introduced additional benefits, including more paid vacation, vastly enhanced reproductive coverage for women and \u201cexpanded coverage for our transgender colleagues.\u201dThe brothers concluded the memo on a jaunty note: \u201cEnjoy!\u201dThe brothers have even shaken up 21st Century Fox\u2019s profile in Washington, replacing their father\u2019s Republican lobbying chief with a Democratic one. One Hollywood friend equated their mind-set to moving into an outdated house and looking for wood rot.Still, some of the most dramatic changes at 21st Century Fox over the last two years, including the ouster of Mr. O\u2019Reilly, have been forced on them.As James and Lachlan move to modernize their company, several questions have emerged. The biggest: Can you truly change the culture without losing what made it so successful? It was Rupert\u2019s band-of-pirates mentality that willed the Fox broadcast network into existence, and turned Fox News into a source of astounding profit and political muscle.The brothers eventually rose back to the top. Yet they have not entirely convinced Wall Street analysts that their pairing is workable in the long term. Some people do not see James and Lachlan as equals.\u201cJames has a lot of experience in senior management, and he is capable of running a business,\u201d said Mr. Creutz, the analyst. \u201cLachlan? I don\u2019t know. People don\u2019t know him as well. He is looked at a bit more skeptically by investors.\u201dAnthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, challenged that notion. \u201cAs a manager, Lachlan has grown and developed quite a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the brothers get along well, and that Lachlan\u2019s views are falling into line with James\u2019s.\u201dThe brothers are radically different in style. James is a speed-talking, tightly wound technophile \u2014 cool and calculating, to the degree that he can come across as slick, several associates said. Fashion forward, James socializes with young technology kingpins like Elon Musk, a founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.Lachlan, with his tattooed forearm, avoids the spotlight, rarely popping up in Hollywood watering holes like Tower Bar, where James has a signature table. Lachlan comes across as a more grounded guy\u2019s guy. On his first day as executive chairman, he rolled onto the Fox lot in Los Angeles in a pickup truck.James, the youngest of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s four adult children, has always been seen as bright and willful. He was an earring-wearing rebel in his younger days, dropping out of Harvard in 1995 to found a hip-hop record label, Rawkus Records.But once in the corporate fold \u2014 Rupert bought the rap company \u2014 James made a rapid ascent. At 24, he was put in charge of digital publishing in the United States. At 27, he was sent to Hong Kong to run a television service, Star, which was ailing at the time. (He turned it around, in part by expanding into India.) Three years later, James was installed as chief executive of another family business, British Sky Broadcasting. (Subscriptions soared.)It was at Sky that James pushed through an initiative to make his part of the Murdoch empire carbon neutral. \u201cA lot of people are worried about climate change but are waiting for someone else to do something about it,\u201d he said in a 2006 news release. \u201cWe are showing that you can take action.\u201d He framed it as good business \u2014 to make employees feel good and to win customers by showing that the company\u2019s values were in tune with the times.Kathryn Murdoch has been seen as driving his interest in environmentalism. She worked for the Clinton Climate Initiative and is a trustee of the Environmental Defense Fund.But then came the British phone-hacking scandal, which shut down the family\u2019s News of the World tabloid in 2011. James was never found to have had direct knowledge of the hacking by members of the paper\u2019s staff. But a parliamentary committee investigating the scandal accused him of \u201cwillful ignorance\u201d after he acknowledged that he had failed to read emails that referred to settlement payments made to hacking victims.Lachlan was raised in the United States, graduating from Princeton in 1994. He then spent six years working at his father\u2019s Australian businesses, doing so well that Rupert anointed him \u201cfirst among equals,\u201d which was interpreted as meaning that Lachlan led the succession brigade. (At the time, Rupert also spoke lovingly of Lachlan\u2019s interest in the family news businesses, noting that his son, even as a teenager, would tinker with greasy printing presses.)Lachlan rose to become his father\u2019s deputy chief operating officer and publisher of The New York Post. But he resigned abruptly in July 2005. Lachlan said publicly that he wanted to spend more time in Australia, but most Murdochologists chalked up his departure to friction with his father. Rupert, a workaholic, sided with Mr. Ailes in a turf war and was also annoyed that his eldest son enjoyed lengthy sailing and mountain climbing vacations.Working together will be crucial if 21st Century Fox is going to navigate the shoals ahead.At the moment, 21st Century Fox\u2019s portfolio is relatively healthy. Fox News has continued to dominate in the ratings. The FX cable channel has found a steady stream of hits, including \u201cAtlanta\u201d and \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson.\u201d The Fox broadcast network has struggled to find new must-see shows, but the company\u2019s overseas channels and sports networks are thriving. In its most recent quarter, 21st Century Fox reported income of $856 million, a 27 percent increase from the same period a year earlier.Speaking of those results during a call with analysts in February, Lachlan noted moves the company had made to strengthen its business.\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying this for a while,\u201d he said, \u201cbut actions and outcomes speak louder than words.\u201dElisa Cho contributed research.Advertisement"}

Disney\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d chugged along in third place, generating roughly $10 million in ticket sales.All of those movies share a common DNA. They are glossy, big-budget extravaganzas stuffed with elements to hook global audiences: extreme stunts, Alec Baldwin as a talking infant, boundary-pushing visual effects, song and dance.On the other hand, the five new films vying for attention seemed shipped in from another era. They included a modestly budgeted, star-driven thriller; a nature documentary; and a period drama with romantic overtones. But consumers continued to send a message with their feet: These are the kinds of movies we now watch at home, either on streaming services like Netflix, HBO Go and Amazon Prime or through the vast on-demand platforms operated by cable and satellite providers.Warner Bros., for instance, put forward the suspense film \u201cUnforgettable\u201d in 2,417 domestic theaters over the weekend, backing its release with tens of millions of dollars worth of billboards, television ads and posters at shopping malls \u2014 tried and true marketing tools that used to be able to compel crowds into theaters.

(Memo to studios: Perhaps retire the title \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d There have now been three films and a television series with that name over the last two decades.

But they nonetheless have drained the studio of resources, particularly in marketing.The other weekend arrivals included \u201cThe Promise\u201d (Open Road), a period drama that cost nearly $100 million to make; it collected a catastrophic $4.1 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. The nature documentary \u201cBorn in China\u201d (Disney) had about $5.1 million in ticket sales. A low-budget horror film, \u201cPhoenix Forgotten\u201d (Cinelou), took in roughly $2 million, while the art-house action picture \u201cFree Fire\u201d (A24) played to mostly empty theaters, generating about $1 million.Advertisement"}

What could be easier, or more thrifty, if not necessarily Golden Age of TV-worthy?Joel Hodgson, the creator of the series and one of its first hosts, who has worked as a magician, ventriloquist, stand-up comic and toy designer over the years, said he can\u2019t quite believe his show has reached the big time.\u201cOur show has never been on prime time, and now it kind of is,\u201d Mr. Hodgson said. \u201cWe were always on at 2 in the morning on cable, or on Saturday mornings. Now people can watch at 7 in the evening, if they want.\u201dMr. Hodgson\u2019s original (and ridiculous) conceit is still intact on \u201cMystery Science Theater 3000: The Return.\u201d A hapless pilot aboard an orbiting spacecraft (the Satellite of Love) is forced to watch the endless parade of B-movies as part of a diabolical experiment conducted by mad scientists. To keep himself company (and to stave off madness), the pilot creates two robot pals, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot, who join him in tossing incredulous zingers at the screen as the movies unspool.While several former cast members will return in cameos, including Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, the second duo to serve as the voices of Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot in the original series, the three wisecrackers and supporting cast are all new. Jonah Ray stars as the hapless pilot, Jonah Heston; Baron Vaughn (Servo) and Hampton Yount (Crow) voice his two robotic friends.\u201cA lot of people wanted the old cast,\u201d Mr. Hodgson said. \u201cThey were like, it\u2019s got to be you or Mike [Nelson, who replaced Mr. Hodgson as the lead in the show\u2019s fifth season]. And I was like: \u2018No, I\u2019m 57. I can\u2019t be the guy. That would be like a reunion show.\u2019\u201dThe new version will also have something else the original lacked: big-name stars. In addition to the show regulars Patton Oswalt (\u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d) and Felicia Day (\u201cSupernatural,\u201d \u201cThe Guild\u201d), who play the series villains, guest stars will include Jerry Seinfeld, Mark Hamill, Joel McHale and Neil Patrick Harris.Last September, the cast and crew were filming an episode of the show here at the Apache Studios, which was swarming with producers, puppeteers, artists and deep-pocketed Kickstarter donors. (In one month, more than 48,000 backers contributed $5.7 million to the cause.) Outside the soundstages, freshly painted brains were drying in the warm California sun; in a nearby prop room were extra robots \u2014 full-color ones for the skits, all-black ones for the signature theater scenes, when the characters are shown in silhouette.The featured movie is top secret (the showrunners would rather that viewers come to the movies cold), but it involves a large reptilian monster (not Godzilla) trashing a large metropolitan area (not Tokyo). The three rehearsed a related skit in which Servo tries to persuade Crow to help him open a monster-themed nightclub, complete with monster-created disasters. Crow is skeptical. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be crushed to death,\u201d he countered, sensibly.Servo and Crow were controlled by puppeteers beneath the stage, while other crew members moved bits of scenery to \u201canimate\u201d the action. Offstage, Mr. Vaughn and Mr. Yount read their lines, opening and closing their characters\u2019 mouths remotely by pressing the triggers on jury-rigged model-car controllers. Working the robots is so complicated that the needs of the human actors often go unnoticed. \u201cMy performance is kind of low on the list of things that they\u2019ll go back and fix,\u201d Mr. Ray said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018I flubbed my line,\u2019 but they\u2019ll be like, \u2018Yeah, but that was perfect for the bots.\u2019\u201dAlthough the show often feels as if it were created on the fly, all the episodes are scripted. \u201cA lot of people assume it\u2019s improvised, which would be crazy, because we\u2019d just be talking over each other all the time,\u201d Mr. Yount said.Riffing aside, the series lives or dies on the featured movies. Over its 10-season run, the show has favored forgotten monster movies, schlocky sci-fi and martial arts films, with a particular emphasis on battles royale between unlikely opponents (\u201cSanto vs. las Mujeres Vampiro,\u201d \u201cSanta Claus Conquers the Martians\u201d) and small animals made terrifyingly large (\u201cAttack of the Giant Leeches,\u201d \u201cThe Killer Shrews\u201d).And not just any forgotten movie will do. At the very least, it has to have copious amounts of dead air to accommodate all that riffing, and a decent print to accommodate today\u2019s giant HD television screens.In February, Netflix and executive producers from Shout! Factory presented a sneak peek of the first episode at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood.

{"Headline": "The Other Side of Anne of Green Gables", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "FeatureA new Netflix series aims to explore the trauma behind the heroine. Is there a risk to rewriting a beloved book?Supported byAnne Shirley is the heroine of Lucy Maud Montgomery\u2019s beloved 1908 novel, \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d the chronicle of a spirited but previously unloved orphan taken into the town of Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, Canada, by the unmarried, middle-aged siblings Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert. Over a period of years and a nearly endless series of scrapes \u2014 falling off roofs, dyeing her hair green, accidentally intoxicating her best friend \u2014 Anne transforms the hearts of everyone around her while making a home for herself. The book has sold over 50 million copies and has been translated into at least 36 languages. Polish resistance fighters took \u201cGreen Gables\u201d with them to the front; the novel became a part of the Japanese school curriculum in the orphan-filled postwar 1950s; a television show based on the series aired in Sri Lanka; and the book occupies a pre-eminent place in Canada, where \u201cGreen Gables\u201d is taught in school and featured on postage stamps \u2014 a cultural export matched only by hockey and the Mounties. While contemporaneous tales of motherless girls, like \u201cRebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,\u201d \u201cPollyanna\u201d and \u201cA Little Princess\u201d have faded from popular memory, Anne has thrived, continuing to connect with audiences as she did with Mark Twain, who once described her as \u201cthe dearest and most lovable child in fiction since the immortal Alice.\u201dAnne is also, to use the blunt jargon of the entertainment business, a strong female character with a pre-existing fan base who recently entered the public domain: an adaptation waiting to happen \u2014 again. The novel and its seven Montgomery-penned sequels have already spawned a silent movie, a talkie and more than half a dozen TV shows, including the particularly adored 1985 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation mini-series starring Megan Follows as Anne and a recently aired PBS version starring Martin Sheen as Matthew. There is also a Japanese anime; a Canadian cartoon; multiple musicals, including Canada\u2019s longest-running one; an authorized prequel novel; and the entire bustling branch of the Canadian tourism industry that is the Anne-obsessed summer season in P.E.I. Starting next month, Netflix, in collaboration with the CBC, will air \u201cAnne With an E,\u201d the latest reimagining of \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d \u2014 this time as an ambitious TV drama.\u201cAnne With an E\u201d is being overseen, written and co-produced by Moira Walley-Beckett, a \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d writer from Canada who also created \u201cFlesh and Bone,\u201d a 2015 Starz series about the physically and mentally brutal field of ballet. Walley-Beckett won an Emmy for writing \u201cOzymandias,\u201d the watch-through-your-fingers episode of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d in which the heroic cop Hank Schrader is slaughtered in the New Mexican desert because of his brother-in-law, the meth lord Walter White. This may seem like a counterintuitive credit for someone updating \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d but it is a signal of the project\u2019s aspirations. Walley-Beckett wants to bring the long-term psychological explorations, story arcs and heady themes of virtuosic TV, as well as its production values, to bear on the lighthearted, primarily episodic novel.What this means in practice is that the cheerful novel has, in Walley-Beckett\u2019s hands, become much darker. Extrapolating from asides in the text, Walley-Beckett has fleshed out minor characters; given major ones back stories; drawn out themes of gender parity, prejudice, isolation and bullying; and emphasized the trauma of Anne\u2019s childhood. On Anne\u2019s first journey to Green Gables in the new TV show, she is still, as in the book, so overcome by the beauty of a drive thick with apple trees in bloom that she renames it \u201cthe White Way of Delight.\u201d But in an invention of the show, she is also overcome by memories of being beaten by her former employer. The resulting seven-episode season, the first of a hoped-for five, all based on the first novel, is an amalgam of that which is expected from Anne Shirley (her buoyancy) and that which makes for prestigious television today (her depths).If you begin to ask why Anne has remained popular for as long as she has, you will get multiple explanations and a bounty of adjectives: She\u2019s curious. She\u2019s hopeful. She\u2019s optimistic. She\u2019s timeless. She\u2019s ahead of her time. She\u2019s imperfect, but perfectly so. She is easy to love. Everything about Anne \u2014 her disposition, her gender, her age, her provenance \u2014 is a rarity for acclaimed television. Tony Soprano, Don Draper, Walter White, Hannah Horvath and the rest of the antihero litany are infamously challenging to love, while Anne\u2019s appeal is as plain as the freckles on her face. When I mentioned to Walley-Beckett that Anne is a straightforwardly winning character, her initial reaction was to defend her as if from an undermining charge. \u201cOh, she has got some antihero stuff, which is fun,\u201d Walley-Beckett said. \u201cShe\u2019s not classically beautiful, and she has a bad temper, and she can be heedless.\u201d But then she agreed that yes, \u201cshe is a highly lovable and yummy pleasure to sit down with at night.\u201dWhen Walley-Beckett says that Anne has some antiheroic traits, she is not denigrating Anne\u2019s charms. She is making a claim for Anne\u2019s importance in the terms of our television moment, when antiheroes are seen as self-evidently fascinating but a resilient teenage girl who has been adored for over a century might be dismissed as kid\u2019s stuff. Walley-Beckett is, needless to say, hoping that \u201cAnne With an E\u201d will be meaningful to children, and especially young women, but she is very explicit about refusing to pander to them. \u201cMy bottom line is: Go deep and make the show worthy of watching,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are other versions of \u2018Anne\u2019 out there for 5-year-olds.\u201dWith her TV series, Walley-Beckett is trying to solve a riddle: If everything about \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d is what prestige TV usually avoids, how do you adapt it in a way that is both sufficiently sophisticated and yet not a betrayal of the source material? Can Anne Shirley, the yummy pleasure who has flourished by cheerfully gliding above her trauma, be transformed into an almost-antiheroine who, in the fashion of contemporary television, has to grapple with her awful past directly? And can she do so while remaining quintessentially Anne?\u201cAnne With an E\u201d was filmed briefly on P.E.I. but spent the majority of its six-month shoot at two locations in Ontario: the gum factory for interiors and a farmstead outside the small city of Pickering for exteriors. At the farmstead, the crew painted and stripped the barn; turned its main floor into a hayloft; sank its electric wires underground; fenced in the paddock; added a porch, a roof and an attic onto the farmhouse; and planted a tall tree \u2014 now dead but stapled with a smattering of autumnal leaves \u2014 just outside, so Anne would have the cherry tree mentioned in the novel to stare at reverently from her bedroom window.Walley-Beckett, who has lived in Los Angeles for the last two decades but was born and raised in and around Vancouver, is meticulous in the way of many accomplished creative people, whose imaginations are matched only by a fanatical patience for detail work. She is so devoted to giving Anne what she called a \u201cdocumentary feel\u201d that she assured me the potatoes in Marilla\u2019s pantry were period accurate. (They were smaller than supermarket behemoths but otherwise unremarkable.) She insisted on making room in the budget for a 10-foot-long burbling creek, built behind a schoolhouse also constructed from scratch, because the novel mentions that Anne and her fellow students put their milk bottles in a brook to \u201ckeep it cool and sweet until the dinner hour,\u201d an evocative detail Walley-Beckett said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t do without.\u201dYet, on this November morning, Walley-Beckett was settled into a director\u2019s chair inside Matthew Cuthbert\u2019s bedroom, full of the period, right-angled wood furniture that hurts your back just to look at it, watching as Amybeth McNulty, the 15-year-old Irish actress who plays Anne, filmed a scene that cannot be found anywhere in the novel. Walley-Beckett did not use a writer\u2019s room for \u201cAnne,\u201d writing all seven scripts herself, and told me with no little pride that she was \u201calmost completely off book.\u201d To flesh out what she hopes will be an at-least-35-hour series, she filmed new histories for Matthew and Marilla that explain how they wound up emotionally remote and unmarried; reimagined one of the novel\u2019s many spinsters as one-half of a long Boston marriage; conjured an entire character, the Cuthberts\u2019 young farmhand, Jerry, from a few of Montgomery\u2019s sentences; sent Marilla to a progressive parenting group in which \u201cfeminism\u201d is complimentarily defined; aged Anne from 11 to 13; and accentuated Anne\u2019s abusive upbringing while taking countless other liberties with the plot.Walley-Beckett has long white-blond hair and a dancer\u2019s comportment that give her the air of a romantic disguised in bluejeans. She looked on as, in the scene, Anne both lets loose her imagination and is brought up painfully by her past. Perched on a tabletop, Anne stares into a pewter plate as if it were a mirror, imagining herself to be a Princess Cordelia, talking to her servant Griselda about a new ball gown. \u201cI do so appreciate your attentions, Griselda,\u201d she says to her imaginary maid, but increasingly to herself. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to give credit where credit is due. How awful it would be to be in service to people who neglect you and treat you unkindly. I imagine it would make you feel quite small and hopeless and occasionally despairing and sometimes lacking in confidence. I wonder if those feelings ever go away.\u201dAll these details appear in the book, but Montgomery treats them with such a light touch that they often come to adult rereaders as a surprise, an unexpectedly painful subtext they may not have noticed as children. Walley-Beckett makes it manifest. In \u201cAnne With an E,\u201d Anne is constantly remembering her abuse, filmed in jerky, tightly framed, intentionally disorienting flashbacks of, for example, Mr. Hammond\u2019s dying of a heart attack while beating her with his belt. Crying babies cause her to recall Mrs. Hammond sneeringly describe her as a \u201cmiserable piece of trash.\u201dWhen she realizes that the Cuthberts do not intend to keep her, instead of exclaiming, \u201cTragical!\u201d as she does in the book, Anne falls to her knees and enters a momentary fugue state. Anne\u2019s imagination and bottomless energy are clearly presented in the TV series as coping mechanisms, a frantic and resourceful means of keeping upsetting memories at bay. \u201cI like imagining better than remembering,\u201d Anne says, always choosing between one and the other.It is Walley-Beckett\u2019s interest in trauma that attracted her to both \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cAnne of Green Gables.\u201d \u201cI am drawn to the psychology of wounded people,\u201d she says, linking Walter White to Anne Shirley like a vulture to a moth: It\u2019s true, they both fly. (To get a further sense of Walley-Beckett\u2019s typical interests: She worked on \u201cAnne With an E\u201d while on location for \u201cThe Grizzlies,\u201d a movie she wrote about teenage suicide in Nunavut territory in the Canadian Arctic.) \u201cI was extremely drawn to what it meant to be an orphan in that time,\u201d Walley-Beckett says, \u201cwhat it meant to not belong, what it meant to be derided and abused and maintain the forthright, determined optimism and point of view that Anne has.\u201d If, in \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d hints of Anne\u2019s suffering occasionally waft by, like feathers that escaped from a down pillow, in \u201cAnne\u201d the feathers hang as heavy as if there had just been a pillow fight.Viewers familiar with the books and previous adaptations may feel when watching \u201cAnne With an E\u201d that the emphasis is on the wrong syllable, while also finding something provoking and substantive in the new pronunciation. Walley-Beckett\u2019s series is recognizably \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d but with a grimmer feel. Anne still, for example, smashes a slate over the head of her future husband, Gilbert Blythe, when he has the temerity to call her \u201cCarrots,\u201d but this is no longer foreplay; it\u2019s the culmination of many weeks of bullying, including by an older boy who calls her a \u201ctalking dog\u201d because she is an orphan. Even the show\u2019s handsome look, which Walley-Beckett developed with the director Niki Caro (\u201cWhale Rider\u201d), is naturalistic and washed-out, evoking sepia despite being in color.Anne\u2019s transformations are easy to see as part of a trend in TV and film, one in which suffering has become indistinguishable from gravitas and even the most cheerful superheroes come complete with psychological baggage. In a world where Superman no longer smiles, Archie Andrews is an ennui-filled singer-songwriter and Belle\u2019s mother in \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d tragically dies of the plague, of course Anne has PTSD. But this new interpretation of Anne also treats a young, female character with the attention and focus often reserved for difficult men and the perversions of their machismo. In emphasizing Anne\u2019s past, Walley-Beckett may be roughing up a sunny tale, but she is also insisting that a plucky 13-year-old girl is as worthy a subject as anyone. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point in doing \u2018Anne\u2019 in a way that\u2019s been done, that\u2019s very charming, teacups and doilies and \u2018Oh, Anne\u2019s in another scrape,\u2019\u2009\u201d Walley-Beckett told me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the most realistic way to show the way a girl like this, from a strange place, with enormous prejudices against her, would move through the world?\u201dAnne longs to be beautiful. Not only does she wish for her hair to turn a more dignified auburn, she also tells her best friend, Diana Barry, \u201cI\u2019d rather be pretty than clever.\u201d Praying at Marilla\u2019s behest, she asks God to let her stay at Green Gables and to \u201cplease let me be good-looking when I grow up.\u201d She loves pretty things, because she has had none, and swoons over cherry blossoms, an amethyst brooch and the possibility of one day having a stylish dress with puffed sleeves, which sensible Marilla refuses to make for her.If \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d were written today, it is easy to imagine that over the course of the book, Anne would come to learn that none of these externalities matter: not the color of her hair, not the sleeves of her dress. Instead, in the novel, her hair mellows to the coveted auburn, and Matthew, in a moment of tremendous fatherly kindness, gives her a dress with puffed sleeves. Rather than dispense the message that it\u2019s only what\u2019s on the inside that counts, \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d conveys something more nuanced, that beauty can be a pleasure, that costumes can provide succor, that the right dress can improve your life \u2014 all things that adults know to be true, sometimes, but that we try to simplify for our children.\u201cGreen Gables\u201d is rife with complications like these; it\u2019s an artifact from a different time that, instead of being outdated, speaks to ours in an uncanned, unpredictable voice. Anne has survived for so long because she is more sophisticated than she initially seems.The book, in a manner that is rare for young-adult novels even now, is a celebration of Anne\u2019s intelligence, which is ultimately cherished by her adoptive parents, her community and her future partner, Gilbert \u2014 who is also her closest academic rival and who instead of being threatened by Anne\u2019s brain admires her for it. And yet at the end of \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d Anne quits college and returns to the farm to care for an ailing Marilla, never becoming the writer she wanted to be as a child. This is, perhaps, a disappointing ending (and one that presages a string of follow-up novels in which Anne eventually becomes muted by family life), but it is an honest one: We still live in a world where a woman\u2019s intellect does not preclude her from accruing vast domestic responsibilities.\u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d is also a romance, but a slow-burning one. Anne can\u2019t stand Gilbert until the final pages of the first novel, her attentions turned less to love than her friendship with Diana. In the middle of the third novel in the series, \u201cAnne of the Island,\u201d Anne is still putting Gilbert off, rejecting his proposal of marriage. It is not until the beginning of the fifth book, \u201cAnne\u2019s House of Dreams,\u201d by which point Anne has had other suitors and other proposals, that the two are finally married, going on to have seven children. For all her curiosity, imagination and education, Anne eventually arrives at the traditional ending: a husband, a family and all the attendant duties, the nonconforming woman who conforms. But the novels do not present this as either a great tragedy or a great victory. Instead, these choices look a lot like the fraught and difficult compromises of adulthood, in which you might put aside personal desires to care for your mother or modify your career goals to accommodate children. We would flatter ourselves to think that there is anything particularly old-fashioned about Anne\u2019s trajectory. She is a thoroughly modern girl.\u201cEighties polyester?\u201d Walley-Beckett countered, as if polyester were a bad taste in her mouth.This may sound innocuous enough, but to a certain subset of \u201cGreen Gables\u201d fans, those are fighting words. Walley-Beckett\u2019s series is contending with memories not only of the novel, but also of the 1985 mini-series, which is so beloved among a certain group of \u201cGreen Gables\u201d admirers \u2014 probably women, of impressionable age in the \u201980s, perhaps from Canada, where it was one of the highest-rated programs that had ever aired \u2014 that it has surpassed the books as the canonical text. (\u201cCan \u2018Anne of Green Gables\u2019 overcome 30 years of nostalgia?\u201d an article published in The Guardian recently wondered, as if the 1985 series, not the book, were the original.) The mini-series ensorcelled a generation of \u201cGreen Gables\u201d lovers with its own interpretation of Montgomery\u2019s novel, one that was faithful to the tone of the book but emphasized the romance between Anne and Gilbert. If you think of \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d as a love story and swoon at the name Gilbert Blythe, chances are you watched the mini-series. The director, Kevin Sullivan, accentuated the blooming (and admittedly captivating) romance between Gilbert and Anne to the extent that the scholar Susan Drain argued that the novel\u2019s \u201ccareful character-building had been sacrificed to the television love story\u201d in a 1987 academic article titled \u201cToo Much Lovemaking: \u2018Anne of Green Gables\u2019 on Television.\u201dBut just as evidence of Anne and Gilbert\u2019s love story exists in the text of the first novel, and was drawn out by Sullivan, so does the trauma that Walley-Beckett stresses. The last book Montgomery wrote in the Anne series, \u201cThe Blythes Are Quoted,\u201d is a structurally experimental and grim volume of poetry and short stories, concerning the death of one of Anne\u2019s children, World War I, adultery and murder. It is so wholly a departure from what came before that it was not published in its entirety until 2009, despite purportedly having arrived on Montgomery\u2019s publisher\u2019s doorstep the day she died in 1942.A bleaker interpretation of \u201cGreen Gables\u201d is further supported by the life of L.M. Montgomery herself. Montgomery\u2019s mother died when she was an infant, and her father left her to be raised by her cold grandparents in Cavendish, P.E.I., the future model for Anne\u2019s Avonlea. A high-spirited young woman, at odds with her caregivers, she nonetheless spent years caring for her aging grandmother, eventually marrying a depressive preacher while contending with her own mood disorder. \u201cMontgomery was a woman who wrote about expansive, sunny worlds,\u201d says the professor Mavis Reimer, an Anne scholar who holds the Chair in Young People\u2019s Texts and Cultures at the University of Winnipeg, \u201cbut she lived in a dark little room.\u201d She may have committed suicide. Her official cause of death was coronary thrombosis, but a note was found by her bed that read, in part: \u201cMy position is too awful to endure and nobody realizes it. What an end to a life in which I tried always to do my best in spite of many mistakes.\u201dBut as Margaret Atwood wrote in an essay on the occasion of the \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d centenary, \u201cThe presiding genius of \u2018Anne\u2019 is not the gritty gray Angel of Realism, but the rainbow-\u200bcolored, dove-winged Godlet of the Heart\u2019s Desire.\u201d Montgomery\u2019s life may have been hard, but her writing, purposefully, was not. In another of her novels, \u201cEmily\u2019s Quest,\u201d Emily\u2019s teacher offers his pupil a bit of advice: \u201cDon\u2019t be led away by those howls about realism. Remember \u2014 pine woods are just as real as pigsties and a darn sight pleasanter to be in.\u201d It is not an accident that young readers finish \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d feeling as comforted as the odd child who has found a kindred spirit: They are meant to.You can concede that shaking things up is the creatively fulfilling spirit in which to undertake an adaptation (Say something new!) while also recognizing that adaptations of beloved stories, particularly those worshiped by those sticklers for repetition known as children, will always be subject to reactionary desires (Say something familiar!). We want dear tales to be as we recall them, even as we rely on memories formed when we understood less but could wonder more. It doesn\u2019t matter how accomplished, how polished, how heady and period-perfect \u201cAnne With an E\u201d may be: We want Anne to be as we remember her \u2014 even if we don\u2019t remember her that well.For all the changes that Walley-Beckett has made in adapting \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d she understands this sentiment. \u201cI take nothing away from Anne,\u201d Walley-Beckett insists. \u201cShe is buoyant, she\u2019s optimistic, she\u2019s bright, she\u2019s fiery, she\u2019s sunny, she\u2019s imaginative, she\u2019s curious. I just add in the reality of her history.\u201dAnd so in addition to drawing out the darkness embedded within the text, Walley-Beckett has also included lovely and entirely concocted moments that match the sweetness of the novel, like when Matthew and Marilla ask Anne to sign her name in the Cuthbert family Bible and make herself, officially, one of them. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we hold hands over a running stream and pledge ourselves to each other as Cuthberts forever, or prick our fingers and mingle our blood as a symbol of our lasting devotion?\u201d Anne wonders, by way of asking for a grand ceremony to mark the occasion, before settling instead for a celebratory glass of raspberry cordial and a signature. \u201cWith this pen,\u201d Anne says, her hands shaking, \u201cI take you, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, to be my family forever, to call you mine and to be yours, for always.\u201d Then she writes down her name.Because of a transcription error, an article on April 30 about a new Netflix series based on \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d included an incorrect word in dialogue from the series. The character Anne Shirley says, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we hold hands over a running stream and pledge ourselves to each other as Cuthberts forever, or prick our fingers and mingle our blood as a symbol of our lasting devotion?\u201d The character does not say \u201cbreak our fingers.\u201dWilla Paskin is the television critic at Slate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How YouTube\u2019s Shifting Algorithms Hurt Independent Media", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byCritic's Notebook\u201cThis is an existential threat to the show,\u201d Mr. Pakman said. \u201cWe need that money.\u201dThe architecture of the internet has tremendous influence over what is made, and what is seen; algorithms influence what content spreads further on Facebook and turns up on top of Google searches. YouTube\u2019s process for mechanically pulling ads from videos is particularly concerning, because it takes aim at whole topics of conversation that could be perceived as potentially offensive to advertisers, and because it so often misfires. It risks suppressing political commentary and jokes. It puts the wild, independent internet in danger of becoming more boring than TV.\u201cIt\u2019s getting so bad that you can\u2019t even speak your mind or be honest without fear of losing money and being not \u2018brand-friendly,\u2019\u201d said Ethan Klein, the creator of h3h3. \u201cYouTube is on the fast track to becoming Disney vloggers: beautiful young people that wouldn\u2019t say anything controversial and are always happy.\u201dThis is not all the algorithm\u2019s fault. People create these systems, and they are sensitive to bad press and skittish advertisers. The YouTube ad crisis \u2014 and the company\u2019s response \u2014 also speaks to a persistent public misunderstanding of the worth of digital creators. The mainstream media barely engages with YouTube videos as an artistic product in the way it does traditional television and film. Coverage is focused on how much money YouTube stars make, how improbably famous they are among teenagers and, now, on the small number of racist and extremist videos that have slipped through the cracks of the ad system.Jamie Byrne, director of creators and enterprise at YouTube, said that concerned companies had requested tougher controls to keep their ad dollars flowing. \u201cFor creators to flourish on our platform, we need an incredibly strong advertising community engaged on YouTube as well,\u201d he said. He hopes that as the ad systems learn to decipher context, and advertisers relax, creators will see greater returns.All of that means that new media creators hoping to make a living online need to play by YouTube\u2019s rules, and steer clear of anything \u201cpotentially objectionable\u201d \u2014 not to real people, who might actually be offended, but to robots. If YouTube wants to fulfill its promise of an online environment where independent creators can make interesting work, it will find a way to scrub ads from truly vile content without penalizing the merely controversial.Advertisement"}
