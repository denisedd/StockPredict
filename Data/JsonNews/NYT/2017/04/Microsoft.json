{"Headline": "Reader Idea | How the Found Poem Can Inspire Teachers and Students Alike", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported by_________________What Ms. Avery did and why, in her own wordsI think the first year our students submitted found poems for the contest was 2013, when we were delighted to have three winners and one honorable mention. At that point, I was using it only in my senior elective \u201cArt of Composition\u201d; now my colleague Lance Coon and I are both using the contest in our classes \u2014 he does it with the seniors and I do it with the sophomores.First, a caveat: Neither Lance nor I is eager to take credit for our students\u2019 successes. But in the interest of a collegial exchange of ideas with other teachers, we have identified the following items. I also interviewed some of our winning students and have included their input._________Class culture and ongoing preparation for found poetry:Both Lance and I agree that some aspects of our English curriculum over all are quite conducive to the found poetry assignment.Lance points out that our students \u2014 especially under his guidance \u2014 are adept at close reading of texts and that, throughout the year, he encourages them to \u201clook for a juicy image\u201d in a text or extract a phrase or sentence and explore its figurative potential. I agree.One of the activities I do with sophomores to encourage close reading of prose is to have students choose a passage from the novel we\u2019re reading and do a word inventory. I think this lends itself directly to found poetry \u2014 and, in fact, a winning student specifically cited this activity as a help.A second aspect of ongoing class culture that prepares students for found poetry is our use of in-class journals. My students write for the first eight minutes of every class, often on a prompt, though they are always free to write whatever they want. Prompts are often \u201cstolen\u201d pieces of dialogue, or lines from poetry, or just funny words. This activity prepares students to play with language out of context and to imagine new scenarios for nuggets of words._________Introducing and preparing the lesson:Lance encourages students to look anywhere, including using the classroom as a potential text. He points out that a student once used titles of files on his computer for a found poem! I\u2019ve had students use schoolwide email messages. During this \u201cplay\u201d phase of the lesson, we encourage students to consider the idea of the twist or the tension between the found poem and its source (I find that sophomores love this idea).We talk about borrowing words from a text and creating something that disagrees with or contradicts the text. A student complaining about how boring his chemistry book was decided to steal words from it and create a product that was exciting, magical, thrilling. Several students chose words from political candidates\u2019 websites to try to extract text that they could rearrange to express an opponent\u2019s viewpoint. One used words from Microsoft\u2019s website to write an ad for Apple._________Three activity ideas for found poems:A. \u201cSkye\u2019s Stereoscope\u201dDuring a daily journal session in which I had handed every student a picture torn from a magazine to use as inspiration, one student had the brilliant idea to toggle back and forth between the images on each side of the magazine page, writing one sentence or phrase at a time for each picture and assembling them into a poem made up of lines drawn alternatingly from reverse images.B. \u201cBananaPoems\u201d\u2014 I will place on the work surface many snippets of language \u2014 words, phrases, etc., on small pieces of paper \u2014 including \u201cand,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d \u201cof,\u201d etc.\u2014 Students will be instructed to take a set number of snippets \u2014 say, 15 \u2014 and begin making a poem.\u2014 From there, it follows the rules of Bananagrams (i.e., a person who gets it all to work says \u201cpeel\u201d and everyone takes a new snippet to integrate; a player can \u201cdump\u201d a snippet in exchange for three more, etc.).\u2014 At the end, we will read and appreciate one another\u2019s poems and/or offer suggestions to one another.C. \u201cVisible Listening\u201dThis is an activity that I have done with students in our short story unit, but that I think prepares us well for poetry in general and found poems in particular.We listen to short stories read aloud. To encourage students to listen closely, I provide each with a piece of poster board and many markers. As we listen, students are asked to \u201cmake their listening visible\u201d by pulling out words, images, etc., and/or by writing down their reactions.The result is a set of posters that, alone and in aggregate, depict what students were \u201chearing\u201d \u2014 and allow us to trace patterns of imagery or to linger on and discuss phrases or words that students collected. It\u2019s sort of like a low-tech word cloud._________Composing our found poems:Lance and I both allow students to create their poems in class \u2014 and, crucially I think, we both make found poems right alongside our students.Lance takes this one brilliant step further. He uses his Smart Board to display his work on his poem. So he\u2019ll paste chunks of text up there and then, as kids are working on their own, he moves his around \u2014 so students can look up from their process and watch another poet\u2019s process in action, in real time. I am stealing this idea next year.We encourage our students to start with articles or topics they\u2019re interested in, of course, and then (per Samantha\u2019s comment) start moving away from what the article is about to what good, borrowable, twistable language is in there._________Workshop, peer review, teacher feedback, revision:Lance uses his Smart Board to great effect here, too \u2014 though any regular classroom projector would do. He projects a student\u2019s found poem draft on the screen and then guides the group through a peer review.One of the prompts he might use is \u201cDo the lines follow one another?\u201d He also emphasizes \u201cwringing\u201d out the poem: The group helps the poet cut anything that isn\u2019t earning its place on the page. Students point out words that could go, or lines that seem to retain too much prosiness.I use one-on-one consultations with students that follow what I call a recitation-observation-intention-revision format. When a student brings me her poem, I read it aloud to her, and then I ask, \u201cAnything you noticed as I read that?\u201d Then I continue the conversation by sharing an observation about the poem and asking the student about the intention behind it.With Samantha\u2019s poem, for example, I noticed something going on with the capitalizing of pronouns, but I didn\u2019t understand it. So I asked her to explain her intention, and then I pointed out my confusion, and then she came up with a \u201csolution.\u201d I might also make an observation like, \u201cI see many more words in Stanzas 1 and 2 and very few in Stanza 3 \u2014 why did you make that choice?\u201d Some students seek out a friend to help them decide what lines can go (again, the emphasis is on \u201chelp me trim things away from this,\u201d not \u201cwhat can I add?\u201d)._________Advertisement"}

It is filled with the people who help make our smartphones, our favorite games, the apps we download.But many have also come to make something else, perhaps \u2014 a new life in America.Often, they hope to call the United States home.\u201cWhat I have loved about the U.S. is that it didn\u2019t matter where you came from,\u201d Mr Gopal said. \u201cYour past, your color or religion didn\u2019t matter. If you did good work, there was a place for you here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always on guard because there is a chance that suddenly I\u2019ll get the news that I\u2019m no longer welcome,\u201d said Mr. Gopal, 32, who first came to the United States in 2012.Like many of Silicon Valley\u2019s workers who are here as part of the H-1B visa program, which is aimed at highly skilled workers, Mr. Gopal was born in India, attended university in the United States and got a job at a tech company. He said the Bay Area attracts the smartest engineers from all over the world because it is known as \u201ca magnet for technical skill.\u201dWhile growing up in India, Mr. Gopal was a fan of American television shows and cartoons. After he graduated from Carnegie Mellon University, he was excited to take his parents to Disneyland.H-1B visa holders account for about 15 percent of the American work forces at Facebook and Qualcomm, according to the most recent documents the companies have filed with the Labor Department. Silicon Valley start-ups, which often drive tech innovation, employ many engineers on student and work visas, as do tech giants like Google and Apple.Some visa holders, like Sujay Jaladi, have been in America for so long that they cannot imagine living elsewhere. Mr. Jaladi, 35, has lived here for 15 years, first on a student visa and then on a series of H-1B visas. He applied for a green card in 2012 and is waiting for the application to be approved. His wife, Priya, also holds an H-1B visa and works at a tech company.\u201cMy family lives in India and I love that country,\u201d said Mr. Jaladi, \u201cbut I have spent my adult life in the United States and it definitely feels like more of a home to me.\u201dMr. Jaladi commutes an hour each day to work as the head of information security at Gusto, a company that provides human resources services to small businesses. He enjoys meals at home and weekend shopping trips to Costco. He and his wife love to cook.But visas are always on his mind, along with the possibility that he may have to return to India.\u201cOur ability to stay in the U.S., with good standing, depends on the visa process,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking hard is just one factor. If the financial markets are hit and your job lays people off, H-1B visa holders have a limited time to find another job and get into good standing before we have to leave the country. If the market is down and jobs numbers are low, there will be more H-1Bs in the market looking for jobs.\u201dMr. Jaladi isn\u2019t the only one who has found himself in immigration limbo at Gusto. Shub Jain, a 26-year-old software engineer there, graduated from the University of California, San Diego, in 2014, worked at Microsoft and last fall moved to San Francisco for a job at the H.R. start-up. He has been working on an extended student visa and has lost out on the H-1B visa lottery three times. This is the last year he will be eligible to apply. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave the country.\u201dMr. Jain\u2019s life is like that of many 20-something professionals. He loves cars and driving around California, as well as exploring new restaurants with friends. But the feeling of welcome he has always experienced in the United States has shifted as politicians have changed their views on immigration.\u201cMy conversations with friends have changed,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to look at the news every morning, but now I don\u2019t because I don\u2019t want it to impact my work. I look at night. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll read.\u201dLike many tech employees, Mr. Jain took a gamble on a smaller start-up. But his decision came with extra risk. At Microsoft, he could deal with visa issues by relocating to one of the company\u2019s many global offices. He does not have that option at Gusto.Mr. Jain talks about his anxieties with teammates like Nicholas Gervasi, 32, a Canadian who is working at Gusto on an H-1B visa. Thanks to provisions under the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Gervasi has had an easier time living and working in the United States than his colleagues from India, and he expects his green card application to be approved soon.Mr. Jain\u2019s sister attended the University of Illinois, worked on a trading floor in Chicago and left the country after she was unable to get an H1-B visa. She has since started her own company and talks to Mr. Jain almost every day as he prepares himself for the possibility that he will have to leave.Because of his uncertain situation, Mr. Jain\u2019s best friend from college recently visited for a month to play video games, go on drives and spend as much time together as they could.Some critics of the H-1B visa program say there are more than enough Americans with technology degrees to fill all the technical jobs in the United States. Others say that Silicon Valley companies do not cast a wide enough net for American job candidates. But tech executives have long said that there are not enough Americans with the advanced math and science skills necessary to succeed at their companies.Mr. Gervasi said that companies \u201cshould be empowered to hire the best people.\u201d Joshua Reeves, the chief executive and founder of Gusto, agreed, noting that 8 percent of his work force is on a visa or green card. Gusto\u2019s hiring policy has never taken a candidate\u2019s citizenship into account, and Mr. Reeves said the company was \u201ccommitted to sticking to that mind-set.\u201dThat commitment could be tested over the next few years, given that the White House is continuously looking for ways to curb immigration as it seeks to enact America-first policies.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like living under this \u2014 maybe not fear \u2014 but a worry about what\u2019s next and what will happen,\u201d Mr. Jain said. \u201cThis feeling of being unwelcome in the country. I hadn\u2019t really felt that before.\u201dVindu Goel contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Uber Uses Psychological Tricks to Push Its Drivers\u2019 Buttons", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "The secretive ride-hailing giant Uber rarely discusses internal matters in public. But in March, facing crises on multiple fronts, top officials convened a call for reporters to insist that Uber was changing its culture and would no longer tolerate \u201cbrilliant jerks.\u201dNotably, the company also announced that it would fix its troubled relationship with drivers, who have complained for years about falling pay and arbitrary treatment.And yet even as Uber talks up its determination to treat drivers more humanely, it is engaged in an extraordinary behind-the-scenes experiment in behavioral science to manipulate them in the service of its corporate growth \u2014 an effort whose dimensions became evident in interviews with several dozen current and former Uber officials, drivers and social scientists, as well as a review of behavioral research.Uber\u2019s innovations reflect the changing ways companies are managing workers amid the rise of the freelance-based \u201cgig economy.\u201d Its drivers are officially independent business owners rather than traditional employees with set schedules. This allows Uber to minimize labor costs, but means it cannot compel drivers to show up at a specific place and time. And this lack of control can wreak havoc on a service whose goal is to seamlessly transport passengers whenever and wherever they want.Uber helps solve this fundamental problem by using psychological inducements and other techniques unearthed by social science to influence when, where and how long drivers work. It\u2019s a quest for a perfectly efficient system: a balance between rider demand and driver supply at the lowest cost to passengers and the company.Employing hundreds of social scientists and data scientists, Uber has experimented with video game techniques, graphics and noncash rewards of little value that can prod drivers into working longer and harder \u2014 and sometimes at hours and locations that are less lucrative for them.To keep drivers on the road, the company has exploited some people\u2019s tendency to set earnings goals \u2014 alerting them that they are ever so close to hitting a precious target when they try to log off. It has even concocted an algorithm similar to a Netflix feature that automatically loads the next program, which many experts believe encourages binge-watching. In Uber\u2019s case, this means sending drivers their next fare opportunity before their current ride is even over.And most of this happens without giving off a whiff of coercion.\u201cWe show drivers areas of high demand or incentivize them to drive more,\u201d said Michael Amodeo, an Uber spokesman. \u201cBut any driver can stop work literally at the tap of a button \u2014 the decision whether or not to drive is 100 percent theirs.\u201dBut an examination by The New York Times found that Uber is continuing apace in its struggle to wield the upper hand with drivers. And as so-called platform-mediated work like driving for Uber increasingly becomes the way people make a living, the company\u2019s example illustrates that pulling psychological levers may eventually become the reigning approach to managing the American worker.Of course, many companies try to nudge consumers into buying their products and services using psychological tricks. But extending these efforts to the work force is potentially transformative.Uber exists in a kind of legal and ethical purgatory, however. Because its drivers are independent contractors, they lack most of the protections associated with employment. By mastering their workers\u2019 mental circuitry, Uber and the like may be taking the economy back toward a pre-New Deal era when businesses had enormous power over workers and few checks on their ability to exploit it.In early 2016, a group of roughly 100 Uber employees responsible for signing up drivers and getting them to drive more voted to change its name \u2014 from \u201csupply growth\u201d to \u201cdriver growth.\u201dThe vote was not unprompted. For much of the previous year, Uber executives had agonized over how to lower the rate at which drivers were deserting the platform.Alongside Uber\u2019s already daunting targets for expanding its pool of drivers to meet mounting demand, the high turnover threatened to cap the company\u2019s growth and throw it into crisis.Uber conducted interviews and focus groups while executives peppered employees with questions like, \u201cWhat are we doing to have more empathy for the driver side of the equation?\u201dThis is particularly true of shortages so pronounced as to create a \u201csurge\u201d \u2014 that is, a higher fare than normal. While surges do mitigate shortages, they do so in part by repelling passengers, something directly at odds with Uber\u2019s long-term goal of dominating the industry. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s better not to surge,\u201d said Daniel Graf, Uber\u2019s vice president of product. \u201cIf we don\u2019t surge, we can produce more rides.\u201dAs a result, much of Uber\u2019s communication with drivers over the years has aimed at combating shortages by advising drivers to move to areas where they exist, or where they might arise. Uber encouraged its local managers to experiment with ways of achieving this.\u201cIt was all day long, every day \u2014 texts, emails, pop-ups: \u2018Hey, the morning rush has started. Get to this area, that\u2019s where demand is biggest,\u2019\u201d said Ed Frantzen, a veteran Uber driver in the Chicago area. \u201cIt was always, constantly, trying to get you into a certain direction.\u201dSome local managers who were men went so far as to adopt a female persona for texting drivers, having found that the uptake was higher when they did.\u201c\u2018Laura\u2019 would tell drivers: \u2018Hey, the concert\u2019s about to let out. You should head over there,\u2019\u201d said John P. Parker, a manager in Uber\u2019s Dallas office in 2014 and 2015, referring to one of the personas. \u201cWe have an overwhelmingly male driver population.\u201dUber acknowledged that it had experimented with female personas to increase engagement with drivers.The friction over meeting demand was compounded by complaints about arrangements like aggressive car leases that required many drivers to work upward of 50 or 60 hours each week to eke out a profit. Uber officials began to worry that a driver backlash was putting them at a strategic disadvantage in their competition with Lyft, which had cultivated a reputation for being more driver-friendly.Now Uber began a process of, in effect, becoming a little less like Mr. Kalanick, and a little more like Lyft.It rethought a lease program, softened the hectoring tone of its messages and limited their volume. At times it became positively cheery.During roughly the same period, Uber was increasingly concerned that many new drivers were leaving the platform before completing the 25 rides that would earn them a signing bonus. To stem that tide, Uber officials in some cities began experimenting with simple encouragement: You\u2019re almost halfway there, congratulations!While the experiment seemed warm and innocuous, it had in fact been exquisitely calibrated. The company\u2019s data scientists had previously discovered that once drivers reached the 25-ride threshold, their rate of attrition fell sharply.And psychologists and video game designers have long known that encouragement toward a concrete goal can motivate people to complete a task.\u201cIt\u2019s getting you to internalize the company\u2019s goals,\u201d said Chelsea Howe, a prominent video game designer who has spoken out against coercive psychological techniques deployed in games. \u201cInternalized motivation is the most powerful kind.\u201dMr. Amodeo, the Uber spokesman, defended the practice. \u201cWe try to make the early experience as good as possible, but also as realistic as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to decide for themselves if driving is right for them.\u201dThat making drivers feel good could be compatible with treating them as lab subjects was no surprise. None other than Lyft itself had shown as much several years earlier.In 2013, the company hired a consulting firm to figure out how to encourage more driving during the platform\u2019s busiest hours.At the time, Lyft drivers could voluntarily sign up in advance for shifts. The consultants devised an experiment in which the company showed one group of inexperienced drivers how much more they would make by moving from a slow period like Tuesday morning to a busy time like Friday night \u2014 about $15 more per hour.For another group, Lyft reversed the calculation, displaying how much drivers were losing by sticking with Tuesdays.The latter had a more significant effect on increasing the hours drivers scheduled during busy periods.Still, Ms. Berman disclosed in an interview, Lyft eventually decided against using the loss-aversion approach, suggesting that the company has drawn brighter lines when it comes to potential manipulation.As he tried to log off at 7:13 a.m. on New Year\u2019s Day last year, Josh Streeter, then an Uber driver in the Tampa, Fla., area, received a message on the company\u2019s driver app with the headline \u201cMake it to $330.\u201d The text then explained: \u201cYou\u2019re $10 away from making $330 in net earnings. Are you sure you want to go offline?\u201d Below were two prompts: \u201cGo offline\u201d and \u201cKeep driving.\u201d The latter was already highlighted.\u201cI\u2019ve got screen shots with dozens of these messages,\u201d said Mr. Streeter, who began driving full time for Lyft and then Uber in 2014 but quit last year to invest in real estate.Mr. Streeter was not alone. For months, when drivers tried to log out, the app would frequently tell them they were only a certain amount away from making a seemingly arbitrary sum for the day, or from matching their earnings from that point one week earlier.The messages were intended to exploit another relatively widespread behavioral tic \u2014 people\u2019s preoccupation with goals \u2014 to nudge them into driving longer.Uber, for its part, appears to be aware of the ludic loop. In its messages to drivers, it included a graphic of an engine gauge with a needle that came tantalizingly close to, but was still short of, a dollar sign.And the ludic loop is far from the only video game feature that Uber has adapted as a way of keeping drivers on the road.At any moment, the app shows drivers how many trips they have taken in the current week, how much money they have made, how much time they have spent logged on and what their overall rating from passengers is. All of these metrics can stimulate the competitive juices that drive compulsive game-playing.\u201cThe whole thing is like a video game,\u201d said Eli Solomon, a veteran Uber and Lyft driver in the Chicago area, who said he sometimes had to fight the urge to work more after glancing at his data.Sometimes the so-called gamification is quite literal. Like players on video game platforms such as Xbox, PlayStation and Pogo, Uber drivers can earn badges for achievements like Above and Beyond (denoted on the app by a cartoon of a rocket blasting off), Excellent Service (marked by a picture of a sparkling diamond) and Entertaining Drive (a pair of Groucho Marx glasses with nose and eyebrows).Of course, managers have been borrowing from the logic of games for generations, as when they set up contests and competition among workers. More overt forms of gamification have proliferated during the past decade. For example, Microsoft has used the approach to entice workers to perform the otherwise sleep-inducing task of software debugging.But Uber can go much further. Because it mediates its drivers\u2019 entire work experience through an app, there are few limits to the elements it can gamify. Uber collects staggering amounts of data that allow it to discard game features that do not work and refine those that do. And because its workers are contractors, the gamification strategies are not hemmed in by employment law.Kevin Werbach, a business professor who has written extensively on the subject, said that while gamification could be a force for good in the gig economy \u2014 for example, by creating bonds among workers who do not share a physical space \u2014 there was a danger of abuse. \u201cIf what you\u2019re doing is basically saying, \u2018We\u2019ve found a cheap way to get you to do work without paying you for it, we\u2019ll pay you in badges that don\u2019t cost anything,\u2019 that\u2019s a manipulative way to go about it,\u201d he said.For some drivers, that is precisely the effect. Scott Weber said he drove full time most weeks last year, picking up passengers in the Tampa area for both Uber and Lyft, yet made less than $20,000 before expenses like gas and maintenance. \u201cI was a business that had a loss,\u201d said Mr. Weber, who is looking for another job. \u201cI\u2019m using payday loans.\u201dStill, when asked about the badges he earns while driving for Uber, Mr. Weber practically gushed. \u201cI\u2019ve got currently 12 excellent-service and nine great-conversation badges,\u201d he said in an interview in early March. \u201cIt tells me where I\u2019m at.\u201dWhen asked whether Uber\u2019s product managers and data scientists were akin to developers at a social gaming company like Zynga, Jonathan Hall, Uber\u2019s head of economic and policy research, accepted the analogy but rejected the implication.\u201cI think there\u2019s something to that, but ultimately Zynga should worry mostly about how fun its games are rather than trying to get you to play a little bit more by some trick,\u201d he said. He argued that exploiting people\u2019s psychological tics was unlikely to have more than a marginal effect on how long they played Zynga\u2019s games or drove for Uber. It is \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d he said.Mr. Hall is clearly right about the effects of certain techniques, like those pitched at drivers\u2019 tendency to set income targets or to focus more on losses than gains. On the other hand, even features that produce relatively small changes in driving patterns can become quite important to a company like Uber.According to Mr. Parker, the former Uber manager in Dallas, increasing the number of drivers on the road by 20 percent at certain hours of the day, or in a busy part of town, can rein in a large fare surge.More important, some of the psychological levers that Uber pulls to increase the supply of drivers have quite powerful effects.Consider an algorithm called forward dispatch \u2014 Lyft has a similar one \u2014 that dispatches a new ride to a driver before the current one ends. Forward dispatch shortens waiting times for passengers, who may no longer have to wait for a driver 10 minutes away when a second driver is dropping off a passenger two minutes away.Perhaps no less important, forward dispatch causes drivers to stay on the road substantially longer during busy periods \u2014 a key goal for both companies.Uber and Lyft explain this in essentially the same way. \u201cDrivers keep telling us the worst thing is when they\u2019re idle for a long time,\u201d said Kevin Fan, the director of product at Lyft. \u201cIf it\u2019s slow, they\u2019re going to go sign off. We want to make sure they\u2019re constantly busy.\u201dWhile this is unquestionably true, there is another way to think of the logic of forward dispatch: It overrides self-control.As with viewers and binge-watching, many drivers appear to enjoy the forward-dispatch feature, which can increase earnings by keeping them busier. But it can also work against their interests by increasing the number of drivers on the road and defusing fare surges. And whether they enjoy it is separate from the question of agency \u2014 whether they have it, or whether the company does.Uber officials say the feature initially produced so many rides at times that drivers began to experience a chronic Netflix ailment \u2014 the inability to stop for a bathroom break. Amid the uproar, Uber introduced a pause button.\u201cDrivers were saying: \u2018I can never go offline. I\u2019m on just continuous trips. This is a problem.\u2019 So we redesigned it,\u201d said Maya Choksi, a senior Uber official in charge of building products that help drivers. \u201cIn the middle of the trip, you can say, \u2018Stop giving me requests.\u2019 So you can have more control over when you want to stop driving.\u201dSometimes all that is necessary is the mere setting of a so-called default. Because humans tend to be governed by inertia, automatically enrolling them in retirement savings plans and then allowing them to opt out results in far higher participation than letting them opt in. Making Post-Play the default can have the same effect.\u201cIf done right, these things can be socially beneficial,\u201d Mr. Laibson said. \u201cBut you can think of all sorts of choice architecture that are quite contrary to human well-being.\u201dEven Mr. Hall, the Uber research director who downplayed the importance of behavioral economics to the company, did make at least one concession. \u201cThe optimal default we set is that we want you to do as much work as there is to do,\u201d he said of the company\u2019s app. \u201cYou\u2019re not required to by any means. But that\u2019s the default.\u201dThere are aspects of the platforms that genuinely do increase drivers\u2019 control over their work lives, as Uber frequently points out. Unlike most workers, an Uber driver can put in a few hours each day between dropping children off at school and picking them up in the afternoon.Uber is even in the process of developing a feature that allows drivers to tell the app in advance that they need to arrive at a given location at a given time. \u201cIf you need to pick up your kids at soccer practice at 6 p.m.,\u201d said Nundu Janakiram, the Uber official in charge of products that improve drivers\u2019 experiences, \u201cit will start to give you trips to take you in the general direction to get to a specific place in time.\u201dThere is also the possibility that as the online gig economy matures, companies like Uber may adopt a set of norms that limit their ability to manipulate workers through cleverly designed apps.Kelly Peters, chief executive of BEworks, a management consulting firm specializing in behavioral science, argued that the same data that makes it easier for Uber to nudge drivers into working an additional 30 or 60 minutes also makes it hard to escape the obligation to look after them.That moment of maturity does not appear to have arrived yet, however. Consider a prompt that Uber rolled out this year, inviting drivers to press a large box if they want the app to navigate them to an area where they have a \u201chigher chance\u201d of finding passengers. The accompanying graphic resembles the one that indicates that an area\u2019s fares are \u201csurging,\u201d except in this case fares are not necessarily higher.Some drivers believe that the intent is to trick them into driving where Uber wants them to go, rather than where driving would be most profitable, by implying that they will find a surge there. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to move people where they want them,\u201d said Mr. Weber, the Tampa-area driver. \u201cBut you get there and it\u2019s nothing. It happens all the time.\u201d Mr. Weber noted that the design of the graphic makes the prompt much easier to accept than decline, which requires pressing a small rectangle in the top left corner.Uber said that the feature was an experiment intended primarily to help new drivers who frequently say they do not know where to find passengers, and that it could be changed if drivers were dissatisfied.Individual features aside, the broader question of how much Uber seeks to influence drivers through behavioral science may come down to how much its business model requires it.While the company has made no secret of its investment in self-driving cars, it could be a decade or more before they completely replace human drivers. In the meantime, as long as Uber continues to set growth and passenger volume as critical goals, it will have an incentive to make wringing more hours out of drivers a higher priority than the drivers\u2019 bottom line whenever it faces a close call between the two.Moreover, the contractor model itself provides a strong impetus for companies like Uber to grow. Many companies in the gig economy simply do not have enough workers, or rich enough data about their workers\u2019 behavior, to navigate busy periods using nudges and the like. To avoid chronic understaffing, they have switched to an employee model that allows them to compel workers to log in when the companies most need them.Once companies achieve a certain scale, on the other hand, they enter a virtuous cycle: The risk of understaffing drops with a big enough pool of workers, and the cost savings of using contractors begins to outweigh the inefficiencies. This in turn frees up money to enter new markets and acquire new customers, which makes the contractor model still more efficient, and throws off still more savings.It is, as a result, not too hard to imagine a future in which massive digital platforms like Uber have an appetite for tens of millions of workers \u2014 not only for ferrying people, but also for delivering food and retail goods. Nor is it hard to imagine workers\u2019 obliging them, perhaps because their skills do not match the needs of more traditional employers, or because they need to supplement their wages.In such an economy, experts say, using big data and algorithms to manage workers will not simply be a niche phenomenon. It may become one of the most common ways of managing the American labor force.\u201cYou have all these players entering into this space, and the assumption is they\u2019ll do it through vast armies of underemployed people looking for extra hours, and we can control every nuance about what they do but not have to pay them,\u201d said David Weil, the top wage-and-hour official under President Barack Obama.When you stop to consider the enormous cost advantages, Mr. Weil said, \u201cit says to me this is an area that will grow fast.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cloud Produces Sunny Earnings at Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 The moneymaking machines at the core of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, are notably different. But the respective kings of online retailing, software and internet search should all credit a relatively new line of business for lifting their financial results.In their quarterly earnings reports on Thursday, the three said cloud computing \u2014 through which they rent computing services and online access to software hosted in their data centers \u2014 was growing faster than their larger, older businesses.For the first quarter, which ended March 31, Amazon said its total net income rose to $724 million, or $1.48 a share, from $513 million, or $1.07 a share, a year ago. The company said the $890 million in operating income from its cloud business, called Amazon Web Services or A.W.S., accounted for most of its overall profits.The worry, however, is that this cannot last forever, not with Microsoft and Google making big investments in their own cloud businesses while trying to undercut Amazon with lower prices.That has not happened \u2014 at least not yet. While A.W.S. revenue grew at a slower pace than in the past, it still rose a healthy 43 percent to $3.66 billion. The company\u2019s shares rose 1 percent in after-hours trading.\u201cThere\u2019s always this moment when people think, \u2018Is the magic going to run out?\u2019\u201d said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t panned out.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s Azure cloud hosting business grew by 93 percent from the year-earlier quarter. And the cloud version of its productivity software Office 365, sold to companies as an online service, grew by 45 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing continued strong demand for our commercial cloud-based services,\u201d Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview.Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts that the Google cloud platform was one of the company\u2019s \u201cfastest-growing businesses,\u201d though she offered no details.Still, nearly all of Alphabet\u2019s business comes from advertising on the Google sites and services, which is still expanding despite tough competition from Facebook.First-quarter earnings increased to $7.73 a share while revenue jumped 22 percent to $24.75 billion. Average estimates from Thomson Reuters had been for $7.39 a share in earnings with revenue of $24.19 billion.The stock rose 4 percent in after-hours trading on the news.Alphabet\u2019s speculative ventures, including its home electronics division, Nest, and its autonomous car division, Waymo, are listed as \u201cother bets.\u201d In the first quarter, the other-bets revenue rose 48 percent to $244 million. But losses increased 10 percent to $855 million.Google\u2019s total digital ad revenue has doubled since 2012. But for all the success that demonstrates, so much of advertising is becoming digital that Google\u2019s share of the online portion is actually slipping, according eMarketer. Five years ago, Google had a 35.9 percent share of global digital ad revenue, the data firm said. In 2016, it was 32.8 percent.The pots of money Alphabet is making could provide some consolation after major brands, including AT&T and Verizon, recently learned that their ads were appearing alongside inflammatory YouTube videos that promoted hate speech. Some advertisers vowed to drop YouTube, a Google property, until the problem was fixed.For its part, Microsoft\u2019s overall revenue rose 8 percent in the quarter, to $22.09 billion. That was enhanced by $975 million in revenue from LinkedIn, the professional networking site that Microsoft bought for $26 billion in a deal that closed in December.Microsoft\u2019s total operating revenue, which includes the deferred accounting for sales of its Windows 10 personal computer operating system, was higher, at $23.56 billion. That figure is the focus of Wall Street analysts, and the result was slightly below their consensus estimate of $23.62 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.The modest shortfall was attributable to weaker-than-expected sales of Microsoft\u2019s Surface tablet computers during the quarter, which were down 26 percent. The company\u2019s share price fell about 1 percent in after-hours trading.Microsoft\u2019s net income rose 28 percent to $4.80 billion. Its operating earnings per share, which excludes one-time gains, increased 16 percent to 73 cents a share, ahead of the average analyst estimate of 70 cents a share.The company\u2019s results also added to evidence that the personal computer industry is stabilizing and even growing, at least among corporate customers.Sales of Windows operating systems to PC makers rose 5 percent in the quarter. The market research firm IDC recently reported that PC shipments grew slightly during the first quarter of 2017, the first gain in five years.Microsoft\u2019s Windows sales to PC makers are advancing by more than the rate of PC shipments, because of a shift to higher-priced versions as corporate customers upgrade to Windows 10.Overall revenue at Amazon rose 23 percent to $35.71 billion from $29.13 billion in the same period a year ago. The company\u2019s results were well ahead of the $1.12-a-share average earnings estimate and $35.3 billion revenue estimate of analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters.In a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company was still heavily investing in the creation of new devices, video content and fulfillment centers to bring orders to customers more quickly.\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to look for things customers love, can grow to be large and provide strong financial returns in the long run and can last for decades,\u201d he said.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, David Streitfeld from San Francisco and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Facebook Keeps Beating Every Rival: It\u2019s the Network, of Course", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThe tech world just witnessed a robbery. The heist was so brazen you kind of had to admire it, even if it was pulled off with all the grace of a gas station stickup.His speech had a lot of corny jokes, but that was just Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s way of hiding the shiv. In reality it was a performance that made plain Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ruthlessness as a businessman. It also shows that he understands Facebook\u2019s most important assets. Mr. Zuckerberg realized early on that the most important thing in his business was not necessarily creating the best new features. It doesn\u2019t matter who invents digital mustaches. What matters is owning the biggest and most engaged network. And because he has the network, he always wins.For years now, the world has been doubting Mr. Zuckerberg. Facebook, they said, would never beat Myspace. Then Facebook was going to get a run for its money from every other social network \u2014 Twitter, Pinterest and more. Hey, could it survive Google\u2019s onslaught? Could it survive its own initial public offering? How would Facebook adjust to mobile? What about live video? And then there was Snapchat. By turning the smartphone camera into a communications platform, Snapchat created a novel and compelling social experience. Teenagers couldn\u2019t get enough of it. And teenagers are the future. If Facebook lost teenagers, game over.Hahaha. In the big picture none of these things really made a dent in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s expanding kingdom.Five years ago, after more or less cementing Facebook\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest social network, he began to buy up and build future networks. He bought Instagram, which now has 600 million users. Then he bought WhatsApp, which has more than a billion users. Then he turned Facebook\u2019s baked-in chat feature into its own chat app, Messenger, and now that, too, has a billion users.He offered Evan Spiegel, Snapchat\u2019s co-founder, $3 billion to buy that app. Mr. Spiegel refused \u2014 but perhaps he should have taken a closer look at the networks Mr. Zuckerberg was assembling.Do you know what happens when you control four of the biggest social networks in the world? You get to stop worrying about competitors beating you on features.Mr. Zuckerberg didn\u2019t win all of this stuff; sometimes the features turned out to be less important than initially thought, but that didn\u2019t matter. At the very least he would neutralize his enemy\u2019s growth, cutting it off before it became an existential threat to Facebook.And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve just seen with Snapchat. There is a debate in the tech press about whether Facebook\u2019s shrewd copying has killed Snap, Snapchat\u2019s parent company, or simply wounded it. After all, last week Instagram said that 200 million people a day were using its Stories feature, which is more users than all of Snapchat (160 million at last count).What\u2019s important is that Facebook has forced this coexistence. Facebook\u2019s billions of users will now be introduced to Snapchat\u2019s best features on Facebook\u2019s own platform, eliminating, for a lot of them, any reason to switch. There is essentially no chance now that Snapchat will eclipse Facebook anytime soon, if ever. In other words, Mr. Zuckerberg has done it again; he has neutralized yet another rival.But there is another aspect to the power of large networks: They make other people\u2019s features better.\u201cEven if we were slow to add cameras to all our apps, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re going to be the ones who push this technology forward,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Let\u2019s end with a note on the ethics of all this. Some of you may find it upsetting that a big company can just lift an innovation from a small company and run with it. If it\u2019s not illegal, isn\u2019t it at least something we should discourage?To which I say: Meh. There are lots of different kinds of innovation in the tech industry. Coming up with something first is not the only kind.There is a rich history in this industry of taking someone else\u2019s idea and adding your own spin on it to improve tech for everyone. Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs and the team behind the original Mac were inspired by a bunch of ideas floating around tech research circles, including at Xerox PARC. Then Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, saw the Mac\u2019s success and \u2014 by creating a new business model for the PC industry \u2014 he ushered in an even bigger deal: graphical computers that could get cheap enough for most people to own.Or look at the smartphone. Apple created the iPhone, but if the tech industry had stopped there, smartphones wouldn\u2019t have swept the world very quickly. Instead, Google more or less copied Apple\u2019s software ideas in early versions of Android, and Samsung essentially copied Apple\u2019s hardware. Economics kicked in, smartphones got really cheap, and they flooded the globe. And everyone did better: In time, Samsung hit on its own big idea \u2014 huge phones \u2014 that Apple copied, and Apple then made a bundle.So let\u2019s not get too hung up on copying. All\u2019s fair in love and rainbow vomit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Tries to Turn Its A.I. Ideas Into Dollars", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byTORONTO \u2014 Long before Google started working on cars that drive themselves and Amazon was creating home appliances that talk, a handful of researchers in Canada \u2014 backed by the Canadian government and universities \u2014 were laying the groundwork for today\u2019s boom in artificial intelligence.But the center of the commercial gold rush has been a long way away, in Silicon Valley. In recent years, many of Canada\u2019s young A.I. scientists, lured by lucrative paydays from Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies, have departed. Canada is producing a growing number of A.I start-ups, but they often head to California, where venture capital, business skills and optimism are abundant.Now bringing A.I. home is a priority for the Canadian government, companies, universities and technologists. The goal, they say, is to build a business environment around the country\u2019s expertise and to keep the experts its universities create in the country.There are encouraging signs, including new government funding, big company investments, programs to nurture start-ups, and the changing habits of homegrown entrepreneurs and American venture capitalists.Mr. Hinton, who was hired by Google in 2013 but remains a professor at the University of Toronto, will serve as its chief scientific adviser. The new institute will be in the Mars Discovery District, a cluster of buildings in downtown Toronto, run by a public-private partnership, that is home to many tech start-ups including A.I. companies..Major technology companies, like Google, Microsoft and IBM, are adding to their A.I. research teams in Canada. So are companies in other industries.Last year, General Motors said it was going to locate one of its research and engineering hubs for self-driving cars in the Toronto suburb of Markham. And Thomson Reuters announced it would open a center for \u201ccognitive computing\u201d in Toronto for research into new ways professionals will use information and technologies to assist decision making.Building businesses that use A.I. is an economic imperative for Canada. The Canadian tech industry has stalled in recent years. Nortel, Canada\u2019s big telecommunications equipment maker, declared bankruptcy in 2009, and was wound down over the next several years. And BlackBerry, once a leader, has faded in the smartphone market.The experience of two start-ups applying A.I. technology to drug discovery illustrate the challenges \u2014 and the opportunities \u2014 facing Canadian start-ups.When Mr. Heifets sought funding, he recalled, one potential Canadian investor said people had tried the same thing 20 years ago. \u201cWhat could possibly be new?\u201d Mr. Heifets said the investor had asked, and turned him down.Later, Mr. Heifets went to the Bay Area and met with Timothy Draper, founder of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Mr. Draper observed that he had invested in a couple of companies trying a similar approach 20 years ago. That didn\u2019t deter him from trying again.\u201cThat\u2019s a cultural issue, a different appetite for risk and willingness to accept failure,\u201d Mr. Heifets said.Atomwise moved to San Francisco to be close to its investors and the region\u2019s enormous talent pool.Brendan Frey, the chief executive, studied under Mr. Hinton at the University of Toronto, and he has spent years on research that combines deep-learning A.I. and cell biology. When he hires software engineers, he asks them to make multiyear commitments.\u201cThere are a lot of distractions in the Bay Area,\u201d said Mr. Frey, who is also a professor at the University of Toronto and a co-founder of the new Vector institute. \u201cThe hype is a little too hot down there. Besides, we have some of the best talent in the world here.\u201dIn 2015, the program tilted toward A.I. start-ups, with 25 companies admitted. Last year, 50 A.I. start-ups were admitted, and this year will likely have 75, Mr. Agrawal said.The program lasts nine months, with fall and spring terms, much like a school year. The participants gather every eight weeks in Toronto for two days to make presentations, listen to advice and set goals for the next eight weeks.At every gathering, at least one and sometimes several companies are voted out. The voters are a growing group of tech entrepreneurs and investors whom Mr. Agrawal has recruited.One of the X factors in Canada\u2019s drive to develop an A.I. industry is the Trump administration. Canadian A.I. scientists say they have received a stream of inquiries from researchers in the United States, concerned about the new administration\u2019s stance on immigration and other policies.Should there be a northward migration it wouldn\u2019t the first time. Mr. Hinton settled in Canada in 1987 in part because of America\u2019s clandestine support for the Contra guerrillas who sought to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.Mr. Hinton, who is from Britain, was at Carnegie Mellon University at the time, and he realized that continuing his research in America would have meant accepting funding from the Reagan administration. \u201cI preferred Canada,\u201d Mr. Hinton recalled.Mr. Sutton left the United States to become a professor at the University of Alberta in 2003, after American troops landed in Baghdad. \u201cGeorge Bush was invading Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good time to leave.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

Check below for the latest updates.In his first 100 days as president, Donald J. Trump may have found much of his agenda stymied, from a health care overhaul to a hotly contested immigration order.Many American consumers may not have heard of Synchrony Financial, but there is a good chance they have one of the company\u2019s credit cards.Synchrony issues credit cards in partnership with giant retailers like Walmart and JCPenny, which consumer use to purchase goods typically in return for discounts or other rewards.And on Friday, Synchrony\u2019s share price was getting hammered \u2014 down more than 14 percent in midmorning training.Synchrony, which was spun out of GE Capital in 2014, reported a smaller profit \u2014 61 cents a share \u2014 compared with the 74 cents that many Wall Street analysts had expected.The miss was driven partly by the company\u2019s need to reserve more money to deal with potential defaults from consumers.Investors took that as a worrisome sign that the credit quality of Synchrony\u2019s cards \u2014 which total about $70 billion \u2014 is declining faster than predicted.General Motors said on Friday that strong sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles drove a 34 percent increase in first-quarter earnings and positioned the company for a solid year ahead.The company\u2019s core North American market set a record for pretax profit, $3.4 billion, as buyers continued to flock to G.M.\u2019s truck and S.U.V. lineup.Exxon Mobil posted strong first-quarter earnings on Friday, as expected, with oil prices up by more than 50 percent from this time last year.With cash flow up and capital and exploration spending down, net income jumped to $4.01 billion from $1.81 billion in the year-ago quarter. Exxon Mobil shares, which have slumped so far this year, climbed 1 percent in morning trading.\u2022 The economy barely grew, expanding at an annual rate of only 0.7 percent.\u2022 The growth was a sharp decline from the 2.1 percent annual rate recorded in the final quarter of last year. It was the weakest quarterly showing in three years.\u2022 Consumption, the component reflecting individual spending, rose by only 0.3 percent, well below the 3.5 percent rate in the previous quarter.The economy\u2019s weakness reflected new caution among consumers. Other sectors like housing and business investment turned in a stronger showing, but not enough to offset factors like weaker retail sales.James E. Staley, the Barclays chief executive, offered another apology to investors on Friday about a \u201cmistake\u201d that led to an inquiry by British regulators into his treatment of a whistle-blower.Directors at Barclays have said they will formally reprimand Mr. Staley and make a \u201cvery significant compensation adjustment\u201d to his bonus after the inquiry.\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Mr. Staley said on a conference call with journalists on Friday. \u201cI was trying to protect a vulnerable colleague, but I should have left the organization to handle it. I\u2019ve accepted the judgment of the board. We are cooperating fully with the regulatory investigation.\u201dOn Thursday, Institutional Shareholder Services, a prominent proxy adviser, said that, because of concerns over the inquiry, investors should refrain from voting or abstain when Mr. Staley comes up for re-election to the bank\u2019s board at the annual meeting next month.The generally positive momentum for lenders in Europe in the first quarter continued on Friday as the Swiss bank UBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland reported their results.The quarterly profit was the lender\u2019s first since the third quarter of 2015. The bank has reported annual losses for the past nine years, but says it expects to be profitable in 2018.A consortium of investors led by the private equity firms Hillhouse Capital and CDH Investments have offered to buy China\u2019s Belle International in a transaction that would value the shoe retailer at $6.8 billion.That represents a premium of nearly 20 percent to the company\u2019s share price before trading was halted at the company\u2019s request on April 18.Belle has suffered as China\u2019s vast and fast-growing consumer culture changes the way it shops. Increasingly, Chinese people shop online, leading to booming business for American-traded online Chinese e-commerce firms like Alibaba Group and JD.com. But like in the United States, that shift has resulted in slower traffic at brick-and-mortar stores.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Planned Trump Order Will Discourage Hiring of Low-Wage Foreign Workers", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Tuesday aimed at making it harder for technology companies to recruit low-wage workers from foreign countries and undercut Americans looking for jobs.Mr. Trump will also direct all federal agencies to systematically examine the effectiveness of government rules and trade agreements that require a preference for purchasing from American companies.The president will announce the order during a visit to the headquarters of Snap-on Tools in Kenosha, Wis., senior administration officials told reporters during a briefing Monday afternoon. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the president\u2019s announcement.The expected executive order falls far short of ending that program, but the administration officials argued on Monday that the changes Mr. Trump sought would radically change it.The officials said 80 percent of the immigrants who enter the United States under the current visa program are paid less than the median wage for workers in their fields.The president\u2019s order seeks changes to the program that would require applicants and their potential employers to demonstrate that the visas are going only to \u201cthe most highly skilled workers\u201d in their fields.As a result, the officials said, the H-1B visa would no longer be a cheap way for companies to replace American workers. But technology executives, who have argued that the program is vital to their ability to recruit talent, are likely to be frustrated by the change.Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research group sponsored by several tech companies, predicted in January that a crackdown on H-1B visas would be counterproductive.\u201cThe effect would end up being exactly the opposite of what Trump wants,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies would go offshore, like Microsoft did with Vancouver, Canada,\u201d to seek talent.The changes Mr. Trump is seeking will take some time to carry out, the administration officials said. The order will call for a 220-day review of waivers and exceptions made to decades-old \u201cBuy American\u201d rules.Those waivers are at the heart of about 60 trade deals with foreign countries, the officials said. If the review finds that the waivers are detrimental to American workers, the trade deals could be renegotiated, they added.In addition, all federal agencies will be directed to strictly enforce \u201cBuy American\u201d rules, giving the highest priority to American companies when making purchasing decisions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hacking Group Claims N.S.A. Infiltrated Mideast Banking System", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byFor the past few months, an elite hacking group calling itself the Shadow Brokers has sporadically leaked sensitive data from the National Security Agency. On Friday, just when its leaks had appeared to slow, the group released what appears to be its most damaging leak so far: a trove of highly classified hacking tools used to break into various Microsoft systems, along with what it said was evidence that the N.S.A. had infiltrated the backbone of the Middle East\u2019s banking infrastructure.Swift, short for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is used by about 11,000 banks to transfer money from one country to another. The vast majority of those banks rely on Swift service bureaus, like EastNets, the largest bureau in the Middle East, to handle their transactions. The latest leaks suggest that, by hacking EastNets, the N.S.A. may have successfully hacked, or at minimum targeted, computers inside some of the biggest banks in the Middle East, including ones in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates; Kuwait; Qatar; Syria; Yemen; and the Palestinian territories. Among the leaked documents was a now-patched N.S.A. road map to hacking Swift\u2019s back-end infrastructure, which could be used by cybercriminals in the future.The United States is leading inquiries into North Korea\u2019s possible involvement in the Swift theft. If legitimate, the leaks suggesting that the N.S.A. has also infiltrated the Swift system leave the United States in an awkward position.The N.S.A. did not respond to requests for comment.The group resumed its leaks after the United States carried out airstrikes targeting Syria, Russia\u2019s ally. In a post on April 8, the group said Mr. Trump had abandoned those who helped get him elected. \u201cThe ShadowBrokers is losing faith in you,\u201d it said, adding, \u201cIs appearing you are abandoning \u2018your base,\u2019 \u2018the movement,\u2019 and the peoples who getting you elected.\u201d\u201cWhile we cannot ascertain the information that has been published, we can confirm that no EastNets customer data has been compromised in any way,\u201d Hazem Mulhim, EastNets\u2019 chief executive, said in the statement.But the latest Shadow Brokers leak claims otherwise. One Excel spreadsheet lists what appears to be thousands of stolen credentials belonging to compromised employees and technology administrators at EastNets offices around the globe. Another shows a list of what the group said was computer addresses that have been hacked or targeted by N.S.A. analysts, with the corresponding bank they belong to. Among those listed as having been successfully \u201cimplanted,\u201d or infected with spyware, are Noor Bank, Tadhamon International Islamic Bank, Al Quds Bank for Development and Investment, Arcapita Bank and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.None of the documents suggest that the N.S.A. used its access to steal funds. Instead, it appears that the agency was seeking to track the financial movements of certain Middle Eastern bank clients, ostensibly to gain insight into potential terrorist groups or government officials.The Shadow Brokers\u2019 latest data release also includes a listing of what seemed to be N.S.A. hacking tools, so-called exploits, that allowed the agency to invisibly break into computers and servers running Microsoft Windows. The exploits appear to affect every recent version of Microsoft Windows except its Windows 10 software.But in a statement issued on Friday, Microsoft said it had already patched its software to protect users from many of the exploits listed in the leaks. Phillip Misner, Microsoft\u2019s principal security group manager, said that of the exploits listed in the Shadow Broker leaks, only three had not been patched, but that none of those three worked on any of Microsoft\u2019s supported software, which includes Windows 7 and up.Technology companies typically credit security researchers who turn over problems in their software. But in a somewhat mysterious departure from that procedure, Microsoft did not say how it had learned of the exploits before their release by the Shadow Brokers on Friday.An article last Sunday about the hacking group Shadow Brokers\u2019 release of a trove of highly classified hacking tools used to break into Microsoft systems, which may have been used by the National Security Agency, referred incorrectly to software that was not affected by N.S.A. hacking tools. It is Windows 10, not Microsoft 10. (There is no such software by that name.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slack, an Upstart in Messaging, Now Faces Giant Tech Rivals", "Date": "2017-04-16", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Slack is the classic Silicon Valley accidental success. Born three years ago, with roots in a failed video game, the messaging software is now used by five million people.The company behind it, Slack Technologies, found success by combining something that Silicon Valley fetishizes \u2014 rich data on how people use a product \u2014 with something it often overlooks: How do people actually feel while using it?This combination produced an unlikely hit that, when it became available in 2014, grew mostly by word of mouth, which is unusual for corporate software. Last year, the privately held company was valued at nearly $4 billion.Now Slack faces a significant new challenge. It has become big enough to draw a competitive response from giants like Microsoft, but not big enough to have the roster of large corporate clients it needs to compete with the giants.As a result, Slack, which built up momentum as a lovable underdog, must fend off some of technology\u2019s largest and fiercest competitors if it wants to be more than a niche tool for small businesses and teams.Microsoft, for instance, already offers ways for employees to collaborate. And while its offerings have not been viral hits, they have offered boring but important features that big companies demand, like strong data security and regulatory compliance controls.There is no illusion within Slack that success is certain. But Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive, said small tech companies with new ideas had long defeated larger rivals that tried to copy them. Think of Apple\u2019s beating IBM in personal computing, Google\u2019s beating Microsoft in search and Facebook\u2019s crushing Google in social networks.One advantage Slack does have is focus, Mr. Butterfield maintains. Microsoft, for example, has numerous Slack-like products including Yammer, SharePoint, Skype for Business and now Teams. The executives who run those businesses within Microsoft must \u201ccompete for budget and mind share and attention,\u201d he said, providing an opening for Slack to gain users while Microsoft managers wage internal wars.Microsoft said users would embrace Teams because it had strong encryption and global support and worked seamlessly with software they already used, like Excel. \u201cWe think customers value coherence,\u201d said Bryan Goode, the general manager of Office 365 at Microsoft.Slack is the product of Mr. Butterfield\u2019s second failed attempt to make a video game. His first, called Game Neverending, had a photo-sharing feature that became more popular than the game. It became Flickr, which was sold to Yahoo for $25 million in 2005.In 2011, he introduced another game, Glitch, in which people cooperated to build a shared world. (Misbehaving players got a timeout.) At its height, the game was costing the company $500,000 a month and bringing in $30,000, so Mr. Butterfield shuttered it in late 2012. A few employees stayed on to build out the messaging platform that Glitch engineers had used to talk among themselves. That project became Slack.Slack was officially introduced in February 2014 and today has five million daily users, up from four million in October. Most users are on a free version, but about 1.5 million pay Slack $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search. The 800-person company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable.Initially popular with small teams of software engineers who wanted to work remotely without cumbersome videoconferences or email, Slack was not designed for big companies. Users chat in \u201cchannels,\u201d typically organized around a few well-defined tasks.\u201cThe overhead of working among different offices becomes less of an issue\u201d with Slack, said Nick Coronges, chief technology officer at R/GA, a 2,000-person design and marketing agency with offices in several cities.But Slack has focused on making a product that people love, a strategy that is more common among consumer companies like Apple, Snap and Spotify.Slack modeled itself after consumer messaging apps that let users communicate with GIFs, stickers and emojis. One Slack emoji is a cartoon raccoon with its palms pressed in respectful greeting. Called \u201craccooning,\u201d it signifies, \u201cPlease take this conversation someplace else. You are getting off topic.\u201dIn Slack\u2019s office in Vancouver, British Columbia, designers think about things like color choice, layout and Slack\u2019s sign-in greeting, and how they might affect a customer\u2019s peace of mind. Back at San Francisco headquarters, data jockeys pore over the kinds of signals that tech companies normally study, like time spent with the product and whether moving a button elicits a change in behavior.Unlike some Silicon Valley companies, Slack believes humans are as important as robots. All executives, including Mr. Butterfield, have fielded the 6,000 customer support calls and 2,800 Twitter messages that come in each week. The average turnaround time for a help request is under an hour.\u201cI get worried if I see customer satisfaction scores dip below 97 percent,\u201d said Ali Rayl, Slack\u2019s head of customer experience.If Slack can dovetail seamlessly with how people behave, feel like second nature to use and strongly appeal to employees, taking it away could become \u201clike taking off your astronaut helmet in space,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said.When it began, Slack had fewer features than its rivals had, but that wasn\u2019t seen as a problem at first. Tens of thousands of small teams were creating accounts, some even paying for them, without much prompting. Smaller customers still account for more than 50 percent of Slack\u2019s revenue.But Slack knew it would always be a niche product without basic features like \u201cthreading,\u201d a standard email and chat room feature that groups together replies to a message, and an easier sign-in process. Originally each team required its own sign-in, even if an employee worked on many teams in the same organization.As competition heated up, Slack started to elicit feedback from companies like Capital One. The bank\u2019s teams wanted to log in at one place and get access to all of their Slack rooms. They wanted each channel to allow more people, and they wanted to customize features, like file sharing, to comply with regulations.Slack made those changes, and employees \u201clatched on,\u201d said Jennifer Manry, vice president for work force technology at Capital One, \u201can indication that it was filling a critical need.\u201dAt the end of January, Mr. Butterfield unveiled Enterprise Grid. Aimed at companies and governments, it can manage the conversations of up to 500,000 employees at once. IBM, Jet.com, NASA and Home Depot have all used the product.But Slack has not taken over. Capital One still uses collaboration tools from Microsoft and Atlassian. Facebook and smaller companies like Asana share customers with Slack, too. Microsoft Teams is available in 181 markets around the world in 19 languages. Slack is available only in English, wherever the app is available for download.The battle between Slack and its competitors is essentially a fight over who will make the next piece of workplace software that no one can live without. Many businesses, large and small, depend on Excel from Microsoft, Photoshop from Adobe and Gmail from Google.Slack wants to be in that pantheon \u2014 as the place where people collaborate and hang out online, the world\u2019s virtual conference room and water cooler.Slack\u2019s name \u2014 an acronym for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge \u2014 underscores its big ambition. But to become a Microsoft-size success it needs workers to choose Slack over its competitors.\u201cCompanies want their employees to collaborate more, because better collaboration reduces the need to jump ship,\u201d said Sean Ryan, the head of partnerships at Facebook\u2019s Workplace. \u201cThe No. 1 reason people leave their jobs is they feel isolated.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build empathy at scale,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said. Slack\u2019s office walls are covered with customer feedback, and soothing French pop music is piped into the restrooms. Company engineers say being a good designer is like being a good host, and they use shorthand like \u201cset out the towels\u201d as they create new user features.\u201cI\u2019ve been building software for 15 years, and I\u2019ve become more attuned to how the average person will interact with and experience software in the last 18 months here than in the prior 13 years,\u201d said April Underwood, who joined Slack as vice president of product in 2015.Whether this approach translates into profits for Slack depends largely on how fast the company can expand into more countries and whether employees at big companies push their information technology departments to pay for it. That would necessitate an unusual level of devotion to a piece of workplace software, which is why Slack says it is so devoted to its users\u2019 well-being.\u201cThere are people who will die, get divorced, have children with cancer,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said. \u201cYou really have to put yourself in their frames of mind. If we preoccupy these people for a minute longer than we have to, we\u2019ll lose them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article contained several errors. Users pay Slack $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search, not $8 to $12.50. The company has 800 employees, not 750. And Slack is available in English wherever it can be downloaded, not only in the United States and Britain.An article last Monday about Slack Technologies and the competition it faces from larger companies misstated the number of employees at R/GA, whose chief technology officer commented on the use of Slack\u2019s software. It is 2,000, not 1,000.Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pastoral Living in Stardew Valley: Mesmerized by an Online Game", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byCultural StudiesIt\u2019s morning in Stardew Valley, and I\u2019m a child again! Dawn twinkles. Azure skies. Birdsong. It\u2019s dreadful.The friendship problem is especially grim. I approach a blonde \u2014 a honey with a \u201cHee Haw\u201d vibe \u2014 and present her with a decorative bowl as a gift. She calls me \u201cgross.\u201d Then I give a child named Demetrius some highly useful sap and he says, \u201cThis is disgusting.\u201dAnother way I\u2019m like a child in Stardew Valley is that I\u2019m forever on the brink of getting in trouble \u2014 for hoeing a crooked row, missing my curfew, trying to enter a bus with a pickax. (An accident! My pickax intel was not 100 percent!) This is a game of honest toil, in dirt, with fellow farmers, requiring only the sweat of my brow and an earnest heart. So it\u2019s a little crushing to find that everything I do in Stardew Valley seems wrong.A PC game aimed at the Minecraft demo, Stardew Valley is played on a desktop or a laptop, using a platform like Steam \u2014 which is to say probably Steam itself, as Steam is considered the largest digital distribution platform for computer games.Download Steam, from which Stardew has been downloaded over a million times, and you find a trove of games that, for now, are thought more refined and dignified than console games; they also feature fewer massacres, consume less floor space that the room-swallowing sofa-television-PlayStation matrix, and can easily toggle with, say, Microsoft Word. Using discreet laptop angling you can even play Stardew and look like you\u2019re working.But, see, I can\u2019t play Minecraft. The closest I come is eavesdropping on my children and their friends as they discuss that game\u2019s arcana, including how they might best prosecute digital goat thieves. Not only does the opaque idiom of Minecraft seem infinitely rich in their hands, but when Minecraft \u2014 and now Stardew \u2014 come up on their screens, they intuitively grasp their locations and purpose in nonspace. They also know how to amass the inventory of stuff that drives progress in these games. While I was still walking into Stardew Valley trees, and trying to chop them down with a daffodil, they had built up enough lumber for a log-homes empire.Sigh \u2014 my cabin. My foodless, loveless, plumblingless cabin. Good morning. So my avatar, who looks like a stout Andy Warhol, has learned to water the plant! I give it a good soaking. There\u2019s a bulky tube television I can\u2019t turn on; I have the good idea to sell it. My for-sale bin rejects it. I decide to go for a walk.It\u2019s the game\u2019s tender, clever frame story that distinguishes it. Theorists of narrative often point out that the hard-working opening paragraphs of a novel must briskly transform a person who is not reading into one who is. Stardew Valley gets this just right, with a deathbed scene wherein \u201cmy\u201d grandfather presses on me an envelope, which, in a flash-forward, I open while suffocating at a future office job, strikingly rendered by Mr. Barone as a fading tech enterprise with stained, gunmetal desks that speak of gutting despair. Grandpa\u2019s letter tells me that he once \u201clost of what mattered most in life \u2026 connections with other people and nature.\u201d He \u201cdropped everything and moved to the place where I truly belong,\u201d and suggests I follow his lead: right to a cut screen, and then an arable plot of land and sturdy cabin in the cartoon Eden of Stardew Valley.With this tale, the game brilliantly styles itself as a verdant refuge from the internet \u2014 social media, shooter games and the moral vacuum digital culture is said to open up in us. Though of course Stardew Valley is on a screen itself.I have a surprise knack for violence here. When I sorted out that the ax (not the flower) is for chopping, I became like Once-ler in \u201cThe Lorax\u201d \u2014 hacking away at the old-growth beauties and shipping the fragments off for profits. At midmorning \u2014 time flies here \u2014 I eye a bona fide cherry tree with a newfound perversity that recalls Warhol himself; I go nuts and ax it to bits. The signature transgression of the father of our country leaps to mind. Chopping down a pretty cherry tree turns out to be id-driven, and no joke. Sadly, I have no friend to whom I cannot lie.But then! The key is the daffodil! \u201cWhat a thoughtful gift!\u201d my blonde exclaims this time. I find her warmth heartening. I redouble my commitment to popularity and light off in search of first daffodils and other flowers with which to wow them; filled with purpose, I collect a cheery bouquet.On another screen my 7-year-old daughter now has enough friends for a Shire-like jamboree. I\u2019m not invited.It\u2019s almost night. In the game, that is. Tomorrow, soul refreshed by fellowship, I will actually till my land and do my grandfather proud.On a whim, I glance out my apartment\u2019s real window. It\u2019s a magnificent spring day in the real world, rich with highly realistic graphics. My window needs washing, which speckles the view, so the blue sky is also imperfect, the way the real world can sometimes be, and the Stardew farmscape is not.I\u2019ve been playing this game for hours, and \u2014 it hits me like a sock to the gut \u2014 I seem to have lost sight of what matters most in life, connections with other people and nature. Time for a walk with the children. To my surprise, they\u2019re ready to peace-out on Stardew Valley, too. We drop everything and move to the place where we truly belong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spain Arrests Russian Thought to Be Kingpin of Computer Spam", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 He refused to meet business associates in person and never talked on the phone, preferring instead to communicate via encrypted messaging services. But the elaborate precautions taken by the Russian computer spam kingpin known as Peter Severa appear to have failed him.The initial reports in Russian news media of Mr. Levashov\u2019s arrest did not say if he was suspected by United States intelligence agencies of being involved in attempts by Russian government hackers to meddle in the 2016 American presidential election. The American intelligence agencies have said Russian hackers broke into the servers of the Democratic National Committee and the email of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman and released documents in an effort to sway the election toward Donald J. Trump.But computer researchers who have linked the long-running computer spam business of the man known as Peter Severa to malware used in 2012 to influence a domestic election in Russia say his arrest could give other investigations important information.Mr. Levashov was arrested in Barcelona, where he had been vacationing with his family, according to a report on RT, a state-owned Russian television network. The report cited his wife, who said the Spanish police had detained Mr. Levashov at the request of the American authorities.A Justice Department spokesman, Peter Carr, said Sunday that \u201cthe U.S. case remains under seal, so we have no information to provide at this time.\u201dIf law enforcement officials confirm Mr. Levashov is Peter Severa, his arrest could mark a significant break in prosecuting Russian spam and computer crime.The Russian corner of the internet has a reputation as a repository of pornography and pirated content, and as a birthplace for global fraud schemes.The Russian name Peter Severa, which translates roughly as Peter of the North, could refer to Mr. Levashov\u2019s hometown, St. Petersburg, or Peter North, an actor in pornographic films, in a reference to the online pornography businesses. Along with sending spam advertising, according to Spamhaus, Peter Severa worked with Alan Ralsky, an American spam operator who was convicted in the United States of fraud.Peter Severa\u2019s spam operation ran a sophisticated, evolving family of computer viruses called Waledac and later Kelihos, developed in part by a former military engineer also living in St. Petersburg named Andrei N. Sabelnikov, according to a 2012 American court filing by Microsoft.The court filing and related forensic work on the Kelihos virus illustrated how criminal hacker tools are repurposed for political ends. The filing identified Mr. Sabelnikov as the designer of the Kelihos virus.\u201cPeople in this business don\u2019t care where their money comes from,\u201d Mr. Sabelnikov said last December in a telephone interview about the operators of the Kelihos virus, adding that he did not know who was behind it. He said code he had written for an antivirus company had been used without his knowledge. Mr. Sabelnikov settled with Microsoft and now lives in Bali.The Kelihos virus, which had been devised to spread spam, was used during the Russian election in 2012 to send political messages to email accounts on computers with Russian I.P. addresses. The emails linked to fake news stories saying that Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the businessman running for president against Vladimir V. Putin, had come out as gay.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vanguard Is Growing Faster Than Everybody Else Combined", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byMALVERN, Pa. \u2014 The Vanguard trading floor is the epicenter of one of the great financial revolutions of modern times, yet it is a surprisingly relaxed place.A few men and women gaze at Bloomberg terminals. There is a muted television or two and a view of verdant suburban Philadelphia. No one is barking orders to buy or sell stock. For a $4.2 trillion mutual fund giant that is still growing rapidly, it occupies a small fraction of the space of a typical Wall Street trading hub.You can barely hear the quiet hum of money being invested \u2014 money in scarcely imaginable quantities, pouring into low-cost index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (E.T.F.s) that track financial markets.In the last three calendar years, investors sank $823 billion into Vanguard funds, the company says. The scale of that inflow becomes clear when it is compared with the rest of the mutual fund industry \u2014 more than 4,000 firms in total. All of them combined took in just a net $97 billion during that period, Morningstar data shows. Vanguard, in other words, scooped up about 8.5 times as much money as all of its competitors.\u201cFlows of this magnitude into one company are unprecedented,\u201d said Alina Lamy, an expert on fund flows at Morningstar. \u201cSince the crisis, investors have been saying, \u2018I may not be able to control the market, but I can control how much I pay in mutual fund expenses.\u2019 And when they look for quality funds with low fees, the first answer is Vanguard.\u201dThe triumph of index fund investing means Vanguard\u2019s traders funnel as much as $2 billion a day into stocks like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, as well as thousands of smaller companies that the firm\u2019s fleet of funds track. That is 20 times the amount that Vanguard was investing on a daily basis in 2009. It is manageable, in large part, because no stock-picking is involved: The money simply flows into index funds and E.T.F.s, and through February of this year, nine out of every 10 dollars invested in a United States mutual fund or E.T.F. was absorbed by Vanguard.By any measure, these are staggering figures. Vanguard\u2019s assets under management have skyrocketed to $4.2 trillion from $1 trillion seven years ago, according to the company. About $3 trillion of this is invested in passive index-based strategies, with the rest in funds that rely on an active approach to picking stocks and bonds.More broadly, this deluge of money abandoning higher-price actively managed funds for Vanguard\u2019s plain vanilla cut-rate vehicles has come as an existential shock to a mutual industry that has long been resistant to change.The effect within Vanguard has been no less profound. For decades, the firm has made the case that cheaper index funds will, over time, outperform more-expensive mutual funds that rely on brainy portfolio managers to pick stocks.Unlike its peers, Vanguard is owned by its funds \u2014 and ultimately its investors \u2014 so as money rushes in, expenses are persistently reduced, resulting in perpetual savings for the legions of Vanguard clients. They number well over 20 million and include New York Times employees: Vanguard runs the company\u2019s 401(k) retirement plans.The model has been a powerful one: Since 1976, fees on Vanguard funds have fallen to about 0.12 percent from about 0.70 percent. By comparison, Lipper calculates that the average fee for all mutual funds is currently 1 percent, although it has been coming down rapidly.\u201cMr. Bogle used to say, \u2018This is not our money,\u2019 and I agree,\u201d said F. William McNabb III, Vanguard\u2019s chief executive, referring to the extraordinary inflows. \u201cFor many years, there has been a real move to our way of investing. And it\u2019s more than active versus passive \u2014 it\u2019s high cost versus low cost.\u201dThis no-frills approach has come under some strain as cash flowing into Vanguard funds reaches new highs year after year, some people who follow Vanguard closely say. There have been reports of operational snarls, including website outages, longer-than-usual wait times on the phone and misdirected fund transfers.There is no doubt about Vanguard\u2019s commitment to pinching pennies. In touring the 287-acre campus of pathways, low-slung buildings and a commanding statue of Mr. Bogle, the sensibility is decidedly puritan.There are few flashy cars to be found in the parking lots. The walls are largely devoid of eye-catching art \u2014 with the exception of some musty paintings of the HMS Vanguard, a Napoleonic-era British warship that inspired the company\u2019s name.In sum, the look is slightly drab, certainly by Wall Street standards: rows of uniform cubicles, colorless carpets and an executive boardroom that seems more appropriate for a community college than one of the largest financial institutions in the land.Vanguard executives say they are disciplined in terms of plowing money back into people and technology, but not overly so. \u201cOur true investment spending has doubled in the past five years,\u201d Mr. McNabb said.This tension between breakneck growth and spending restraint is most acutely felt in the firm\u2019s retail division \u2014 or the front lines, as they are referred to here \u2014 where 6,000 customer service representatives attend to the wishes, demands and whims of the close to eight million clients who purchase their mutual funds directly from Vanguard. In 2015 and 2016, this division added 350,000 new accounts each year, numbers never before seen at the firm.\u201cThe spotlight is on us, given the growth, and there have been operational challenges,\u201d said Karin A. Risi, who oversees Vanguard\u2019s retail investor group and is in the midst of an aggressive hiring push. \u201cBut it is not fair to say we are not investing. Bringing in 2,000 crew on a base of 6,000 is not insignificant.\u201dAs with many executives at Vanguard, Ms. Risi gets a glint in her eye when she talks of the virtues of investing in low-cost index funds. Like the majority of her peers, she has spent the bulk of her career at the firm and, as a certified culture carrier, it is clear that she is taking the current growing pains to heart.\u201cMy parents were Vanguard investors, and I was investing in Vanguard funds in high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I feel the burden of this responsibility. We are serving a mission here.\u201dBeyond their devotion to indexing, Vanguard employees talk as if they are working on a frigate, a nod to the nautical images and themes embraced by Mr. Bogle at the company\u2019s founding.Employees are called crew, one eats at the galley (not the cafeteria) and works out in the \u201cship shape\u201d room, and new workers come onboard as opposed to being hired.\u201cYou absorb the culture and you join the cause,\u201d said Joseph Brennan, who, as head of global equity indexing, has had a front-row seat as the firm has expanded. His division embodies Vanguard\u2019s credo of do more with less: The 45 people he oversees globally look after $2 trillion in assets.\u201cOur assets per head are incredible,\u201d he said. At $44 billion per person, that certainly qualifies as an understatement.Already, six out of the 10 largest mutual funds by asset size belong to Vanguard, with the largest, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, now weighing in at $465 billion, according to Morningstar. Only two \u2014 American Funds\u2019 Growth Fund of America and its EuroPacific Growth Fund, both belonging to the Capital Group \u2014 are actively managed, promising higher returns for a steeper fee.An article in the Mutual Fund Quarterly last Sunday about the growth in inflows to the index fund giant Vanguard misspelled the given name of the executive who oversees its retail investor group. She is Karin A. Risi, not Karen. (The error was repeated in a picture caption.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Signs Order That Could Lead to Curbs on Foreign Workers", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byAfter recent policy reversals that have angered his populist base, Mr. Trump described the visa program as an initiative gone awry that has driven down wages for Americans. The order was a means to end the \u201ctheft of American prosperity,\u201d which he said had been brought on by low-wage immigrant labor.Yet the order calls for a series of relatively modest steps, like a multiagency report on changes needed for the H-1B program, under which the government admits 85,000 foreign workers annually, many of them in the high-tech, industrial, medical and science fields. Collectively, the efforts outlined in the order could take years to carry out.The H1-B program has become a focus in the debate over the impact of foreign workers. Mr. Trump has criticized employers for abusing the program and using it to avoid hiring higher-paid American counterparts. He vowed to revamp its lottery-based selection process.The order, signed at the sprawling Snap-on tool factory here, represents a small win for bigger tech companies, which have been in pitched battles for those visas. Companies like Google and Microsoft, which rely heavily on high-skilled foreign workers, had worried that President Trump would make drastic curbs to worker programs that could cripple them.\u201cI think people are cautiously optimistic that this will be O.K., and maybe even better,\u201d said Tom Alberg, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle firm that invests in high-tech start-ups.But the order would likely hurt the biggest users of the visa program, technology outsourcing firms that bring foreign workers to the United States to perform technical jobs, typically from India.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump stoked outrage from his supporters with accounts of companies like Walt Disney forcing laid-off technical workers to train their overseas replacements.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump spoke in terms of an apple-pie populism that helped him pull off upset victories in November in Midwestern states like Wisconsin.H-1B visas \u201cshould include only the most skilled and highest-paid applicants and should never, ever be used to replace American workers,\u201d Mr. Trump told a gathering of about 500 workers and local luminaries, including the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who hails from Kenosha.On this point, many executives at American technology companies agree with Mr. Trump. They argue that they mostly apply for H-1Bs for workers when they can\u2019t find qualified American workers, usually those with advanced degrees like a masters or Ph.D.In recent years, there has been so much demand for H-1B visas that the whole fiscal year\u2019s allocation has run out in a few days in April, when applications are accepted. The visas are then awarded by lottery to qualified applicants. Some 600,000 to 900,000 immigrants are currently in the United States on H-1B visas, researchers estimate.Outsourcing firms \u2014 the top 13 of which accounted for a third of all granted visas in 2014, the last year for which information is publicly available \u2014 typically flood the system with visa applications. The top recipients were Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro, all from India.India\u2019s leading tech trade group, the National Association of Software and Services Companies, said Indian companies were being treated unfairly. \u201cWe believe that the current campaign to discredit our sector is driven by persistent myths, such as the ideas that H-1B visa holders are \u2018cheap labor\u2019 and \u2018train their replacements,\u2019 neither of which is accurate,\u201d the group said in a statement.Companies like Microsoft, Intel and Amazon are also big recipients. At least 15 percent of the American workforces of Facebook and the chip maker Qualcomm hold H-1Bs, according to the most recent documents the companies have filed with the Labor Department.\u201cThis does nothing,\u201d said Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cLike all the other executive orders, it\u2019s just words \u2014 he\u2019s calling for new studies. It\u2019s not going to fix the problem. It\u2019s not going to create a single job.\u201dRepresentative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat whose district includes Silicon Valley, said the issue of foreign workers was real, but dismissed the president\u2019s order as poorly targeted and unlikely to achieve its desired result.\u201cHalf of the start-ups in Silicon Valley were created by highly skilled people from other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president and his staff fully appreciates that fact.\u201dIn a briefing with reporters on Monday, White House officials said the \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d order would also overhaul federal procurement practices to increase the selection of products from American companies, especially in the domestic steel industry, which has faced stiff competition from China.One reform advocated by the Trump administration, which has drawn bipartisan support from Congress, would change the lottery system for awarding H-1B visas, giving extra preference to the highest-paying jobs \u2014 a proposal favored by many in the American technology industry.Representatives from Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google either declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Blake Irving, the chief executive of domain name and web hosting firm GoDaddy, said he supported the idea of changing the system for issuing H-1Bs to give priority to higher-skilled workers. He said GoDaddy typically receives only about 20 percent of the H-1B visas it applies for.\u201cIf anything, it moves the policy towards something that\u2019s preferential to the expert work force,\u201d said Mr. Irving. \u201cAnything that gets us closer to that is goodness.\u201dBut some smaller technology companies said they were concerned about the changes proposed by the Trump administration.Punit Soni, the chief executive of Learning Motors, a six-person company in Silicon Valley that is trying to apply artificial intelligence to health care, said the visa changes proposed by the Trump administration would hurt start-ups.Small companies cannot afford to pay high salaries and are already struggling to attract talent in a tight market, he said. A visa system that favors the highest-paid workers will steer immigrants only to already successful big companies like Google, his former employer.\u201cWe\u2019re a small start-up. Everyone is getting way below-market average salary,\u201d he said.Glen Thrush reported from Kenosha, Nick Wingfield from Seattle and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s Pick for Top Antitrust Cop May Shape Competition", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byAs a young Senate staff member years later, Mr. Delrahim found those early experiences had laid the foundation for his conservative views.In the interview with The New York Times, Mr. Delrahim declined to address AT&T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner, which is now undergoing regulatory review, or other large deals, saying he would \u201cexamine any matter according to evidence and economic analysis.\u201d But he gave other hints of how he might act as the department\u2019s top antitrust official.Specifically, Mr. Delrahim, a former lobbyist, said he would not go after a company just because it was big, and would do so only if there were violations of antitrust law. \u201cJust like any other industry, if there is wrongdoing, we would investigate,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said. But \u201cfederal laws should not be used as a fishing expedition by government.\u201dHe also intimated that he was skeptical of antitrust action against intellectual property rights holders, referring to some earlier comments on the matter. In a 2007 statement, for example, he had warned that cases that blended intellectual property rights with antitrust enforcement could hamper innovation.Legal experts have extrapolated that Mr. Delrahim is also likely to credit mergers with helping competition \u2014 not only reducing it \u2014 and to point out how big deals can promote the United States economy. That \u201cwould be a major change from his most recent predecessors,\u201d the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell recently said in a memo to clients.Mr. Delrahim\u2019s views contrast subtly with those of the Obama administration, which took a more aggressive approach in antitrust toward protecting innovation, especially in the technology industry.Mr. Delrahim would take over antitrust duties at a moment of profound economic transformation, with tech companies like Google and Amazon dominating search and commerce while extending their reach in transportation, media and other industries. Telecom companies are trying to morph into media powerhouses that control the distribution and creation of television and online content.With a wave of corporate mergers in other areas \u2014 chemicals, agricultural products and health insurance \u2014 some Democratic lawmakers have warned that industries have become too concentrated, putting consumers in danger of higher prices and giving them fewer options in vital services.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who will be at the Wednesday hearing, said in a statement, \u201cI plan to ask if Mr. Delrahim will enforce the laws to protect American consumers and if he will commit to being independent, focusing on the merits of each case, not on interference from the White House.\u201dMr. Delrahim has had years of experience in antitrust matters. He graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1991 with a degree in kinesiology and obtained a law degree at George Washington University in 1995. He then joined the law firm Patton Boggs before leaving to be a counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1998. There, he cut his teeth on antitrust working for Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. Mr. Hatch had pushed for an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s practice of tying its web browser, Internet Explorer, to its ubiquitous Windows operating system.In 2005, Mr. Delrahim left Washington and joined the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck in Los Angeles. Over the years, he was the lawyer or federal lobbyist for clients including Ultimate Fighting Championship, Comcast, Google, Johnson & Johnson, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield.Mr. Delrahim endorsed Mr. Trump relatively early in last year\u2019s presidential campaign. In an op-ed in The New York Post in March 2016, he called on conservatives to back Mr. Trump, even if he was not their \u2014 or his \u2014 top choice.Former Democratic and Republican colleagues at the Justice Department describe Mr. Delrahim as fiercely loyal to the Republican Party, though he has a reputation for forging bipartisan relationships. His wife was a Democrat when they met and has voted for Democrats; Mr. Delrahim said he still did not know how she voted in the 2016 election.Democrats recall when Mr. Delrahim became a crucial ally in 2000 to help pass amendments to an antitrust law. House Republicans were unwilling to sign on, but Mr. Delrahim worked to allay their concerns and brokered compromises between them and Senate Democrats, said Jonathan Leibowitz, a partner at Davis Polk who was then working on the bill for Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat. Mr. Leibowitz later was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cHe\u2019s a conservative but his instincts tend toward pragmatism and not ideology,\u201d Mr. Leibowitz said of Mr. Delrahim.\u201cI\u2019m seeing more complaints about enforcement motivated by protectionism, so that will be an important area of inquiry for antitrust enforcement and cooperation,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said.He emphasized that antitrust is intended to support free markets and that the government should intervene only when necessary. A monopoly is perfectly legal until it abuses its monopoly power, he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Learning to Think Like a Computer", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byIn \u201cThe Beauty and Joy of Computing,\u201d the course he helped conceive for nonmajors at the University of California, Berkeley, Daniel Garcia explains an all-important concept in computer science \u2014 abstraction \u2014 in terms of milkshakes.\u201cThere is a reason when you go to the \u2018Joy of Cooking\u2019 and you want to make a strawberry milkshake, you don\u2019t look under \u2018strawberry milkshake,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. Rather, there is a recipe for milkshakes that instructs you to add ice cream, milk and fruit of your choice. While earlier cookbooks may have had separate recipes for strawberry milkshakes, raspberry milkshakes and boysenberry milkshakes, eventually, he imagines, someone said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we collapse that into one milkshake recipe?\u201d\u201cThe idea of abstraction,\u201d he said, \u201cis to hide the details.\u201d It requires recognizing patterns and distilling complexity into a precise, clear summary. It\u2019s like the countdown to a space launch that runs through a checklist \u2014 life support, fuel, payload \u2014 in which each check represents perhaps 100 checks that have been performed.Concealing layers of information makes it possible to get at the intersections of things, improving aspects of a complicated system without understanding and grappling with each part. Abstraction allows advances without redesigning from scratch.It is a cool and useful idea that, along with other cool and useful computer science ideas, has people itching to know more. It\u2019s obvious that computers have become indispensable problem-solving partners, not to mention personal companions. But it\u2019s suddenly not enough to be a fluent user of software interfaces. Understanding what lies behind the computer\u2019s seeming magic now seems crucial. In particular, \u201ccomputational thinking\u201d is captivating educators, from kindergarten teachers to college professors, offering a new language and orientation to tackle problems in other areas of life.In the fall, the College Board introduced a new Advanced Placement course, Computer Science Principles, focused not on learning to code but on using code to solve problems. And WGBH, the PBS station in Boston, is using National Science Foundation money to help develop a program for 3- to 5-year-olds in which four cartoon monkeys get into scrapes and then \u201cget out of the messes by applying computational thinking,\u201d said Marisa Wolsky, executive producer of children\u2019s media. \u201cWe see it as a groundbreaking curriculum that is not being done yet.\u201d\u201cThings were so bad that some universities were thinking of closing down computer science departments,\u201d she recalled. Some now consider her article a manifesto for embracing a computing mind-set.Like any big idea, there is disagreement about computational thinking \u2014 its broad usefulness as well as what fits in the circle. Skills typically include recognizing patterns and sequences, creating algorithms, devising tests for finding and fixing errors, reducing the general to the precise and expanding the precise to the general.It requires reframing research, said Shriram Krishnamurthi, a computer science professor at Brown, so that \u201cinstead of formulating a question to a human being, I formulate a question to a data set.\u201d For example, instead of asking if the media is biased toward liberals, pose the question as: Are liberals identified as liberal in major newspapers more often or less often than conservatives are identified as conservative?Dr. Krishnamurthi helped create \u201cIntroduction to Computation for the Humanities and Social Sciences\u201d more than a decade ago because he wanted students \u201cearly in their undergrad careers to learn a new mode of thinking that they could take back to their discipline.\u201d Capped at 20 students, the course now has a waitlist of more than 100.Just as Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution is drafted to explain politics and business, Dr. Wing argued for broad use of computer ideas. And not just for work. Applying computational thinking, \u201cwe can improve the efficiencies of our daily lives,\u201d she said in an interview, \u201cand make ourselves a little less stressed out.\u201dComputing practices like reformulating tough problems into ones we know how to solve, seeing trade-offs between time and space, and pipelining (allowing the next action in line to begin before the first completes the sequence) have many applications, she said.Consider the buffet line. \u201cWhen you go to a lunch buffet, you see the forks and knives are the first station,\u201d she said. \u201cI find that very annoying. They should be last. You shouldn\u2019t have to balance your plate while you have your fork and knife.\u201d Dr. Wing, who equates a child filling her backpack to caching (how computers retrieve and store information needed later), sees the buffet\u2019s inefficiency as a failure to apply logical thinking and sequencing.Computational thinking, she said, can aid a basic task like planning a trip \u2014 breaking it into booking flights, hotels, car rental \u2014 or be used \u201cfor something as complicated as health care or policy decision-making.\u201d Identifying subproblems and describing their relationship to the larger problem allows for targeted work. \u201cOnce you have well-defined interfaces,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can ignore the complexity of the rest of the problem.\u201dCan computational thinking make us better at work and life? Dr. Krishnamurthi is sometimes seduced. \u201cBefore I go grocery shopping, I sort my list by aisles in the store,\u201d he said. Sharing the list on the app Trello, his family can \u201cbucket sort\u201d items by aisle (pasta and oils, canned goods, then baking and spices), optimizing their path through Whole Foods. It limits backtracking and reduces spontaneous, \u201ci.e., junk,\u201d purchases, he said.Despite his chosen field, Dr. Krishnamurthi worries about the current cultural tendency to view computer science knowledge as supreme, better than that gained in other fields. Right now, he said, \u201cwe are just overly intoxicated with computer science.\u201dIt is certainly worth wondering if some applications of computational thinking are trivial, unnecessary or a Stepford Wife-like abdication of devilishly random judgment.Alexander Torres, a senior majoring in English at Stanford, has noted how the campus\u2019s proximity to Google has lured all but the rare student to computer science courses. He\u2019s a holdout. But \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as having skills missing,\u201d he said. In earning his degree he has practiced critical thinking, problem solving, analysis and making logical arguments. \u201cWhen you are analyzing a Dickinson or Whitman or Melville, you have to unpack that language and synthesize it back.\u201dThere is no reliable research showing that computing makes one more creative or more able to problem-solve. It won\u2019t make you better at something unless that something is explicitly taught, said Mark Guzdial, a professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech who studies computing in education. \u201cYou can\u2019t prove a negative,\u201d he said, but in decades of research no one has found that skills automatically transfer.Still, he added, for the same reasons people should understand biology, chemistry or physics, \u201cit makes a lot of sense to understand computing in our lives.\u201d Increasing numbers of people must program in their jobs, even if it\u2019s just Microsoft Excel. \u201cSolving problems with computers happens to all of us every day,\u201d he said. How to make the skills available broadly is \u201can interesting challenge.\u201d\u2022\u201cIt\u2019s like being a diplomat and learning Spanish; I feel like it\u2019s essential,\u201d said Greer Brigham, a Brown freshman who plans to major in political science. He\u2019s taking the course designed by Dr. Krishnamurthi, which this term is being taught by a graduate student in robotics named Stephen Brawner.On a March morning at the Brown computer science center, Mr. Brawner projected a student\u2019s homework assignment on the screen. Did anyone notice a problem? Nary a humanities hand was raised. Finally, a young woman suggested \u201ccentimeters\u201d and \u201ckilograms\u201d could be abbreviated. Fine, but not enough.Mr. Brawner broke the silence and pointed out long lines of code reaching the far side of the screen. With a practiced flurry, he inserted backslashes and hit \u201creturn\u201d repeatedly, which drew the symbols into a neat block. It may all be directions to a machine, but computer scientists care a great deal about visual elegance. As Mr. Brawner cut out repeated instructions, he shared that \u201cwhenever we define a constant, we want that at the top of our code.\u201d He then explained the new assignment: write a program to play \u201crock, paper, scissors\u201d against a computer.Mili Mitra, a junior majoring in public policy and economics who sat with a MacBook on her lap, would not have considered this class a year ago. But seeing group research projects always being handed off to someone with computing knowledge, she decided that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to keep passing them along.\u201d She has learned to write basic code and fetch data sets through the internet to analyze things she\u2019s interested in, such as how geographic proximity shapes voting patterns in the United Nations General Assembly.Despite finding interactions with a computer much like \u201cexplaining things to a toddler,\u201d Ms. Mitra credits the class for instilling the habit of \u201cgoing step by step and building a solution.\u201d She admits to being an impatient learner: \u201cI jump ahead. In C.S. you don\u2019t have a choice. If you miss a step, you mess up everything.\u201dNot a computer whiz? Not a problem. Try these practice exam questions from Computer Science Principles.Just as children are drilled on the scientific method \u2014 turn observations into a hypothesis, design a control group, do an experiment to test your theory \u2014 the basics of working with computers is being cast as a teachable blueprint. One thing making this possible is that communicating with computers has become easier.\u201cBlock\u201d programming languages like Scratch, released by the M.I.T. Media Lab a decade ago, hide text strings that look like computer keys run amok. That makes coding look less scary. Instead of keyboard letters and symbols, you might select from a menu and drag a color-coded block that says \u201csay ( ) for ( ) secs\u201d or \u201cplay note ( ) for ( ) beats.\u201d The colors and shapes correspond to categories like \u201csound\u201d or \u201cmotion\u201d; the blocks can be fit together like stacked puzzle pieces to order instructions. Students use this to, say, design a game.One need not be a digital Dr. Doolittle, fluent in hard-core programming languages like Java or Python, to code. Block languages cut out the need to memorize commands, which vary depending on the computer language, because the block \u201cis read just the way you think about it,\u201d Dr. Garcia said. Students in his Berkeley course use the block language Snap! for assignments \u2014 he doesn\u2019t teach Python until the last two weeks, and then just so they can take higher-level courses. \u201cWe tell them, \u2018You already know how to program,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said, because the steps are the same.Computer Science A, which teaches Java, is the fastest-growing Advanced Placement course. (The number of students taking the exam in 2016 rose 18 percent over 2015 and nearly tripled in a decade.) But professors complained that \u201cJava was not the right way\u201d to attract a diverse group of students, said Trevor Packer, head of the A.P. program, so a new course was developed.The course, Computer Science Principles, is modeled on college versions for nonmajors. It lets teachers pick any coding language and has a gentler vibe. There is an exam, but students also submit projects \u201cmore similar to a studio art portfolio,\u201d Mr. Packer said. The course covers working with data and understanding the internet and cyber security, and it teaches \u201ctransferable skills,\u201d he said, like formulating precise questions. That\u2019s a departure from what the College Board found in many high schools: \u201cThey were learning how to keyboard, how to use Microsoft applications.\u201d The goal is that the new course will be offered in every high school in the country.\u2022In an airy kindergarten classroom at Eliot-Pearson Children\u2019s School, in the Tufts University Department of Child Study and Human Development, children program with actual blocks. Marina Umaschi Bers, a child development and computer science professor, created wooden blocks that bear bar codes with instructions such as \u201cforward,\u201d \u201cspin\u201d and \u201cshake\u201d that are used to program robots \u2014 small, wheeled carts with built-in scanners \u2014 by sequencing the blocks, then scanning them. Each \u201cprogram\u201d starts with a green \u201cbegin\u201d block and finishes with a red \u201cend.\u201dCoding for the youngest students has become the trendy pedagogy, with plentiful toys and apps like Dr. Bers\u2019s blocks. Dr. Bers, who with M.I.T. collaborators developed the block language ScratchJr, is evangelical about coding. Learning the language of machines, she said, is as basic as writing is to being proficient in a foreign language. \u201cYou are able to write a love poem, you are able to write a birthday card, you are able to use language in many expressive ways,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are not just reading; you are producing.\u201dPeer-reviewed studies by Dr. Bers show that after programming the robots, youngsters are better at sequencing picture stories. Anecdotally, she said, when they ask children to list steps for brushing teeth, they get just a few, \u201cbut after being exposed to this work, they\u2019ll have 15 or 20 steps.\u201dDr. Bers embeds computing in activities familiar to young children like inventing stories, doing dances and making art. At the Tufts school on a recent morning, children puzzled over a question: How does a robot celebrate spring?\u201cHe\u2019s going to dance, and then he will pretend that he is wet,\u201d offered Hallel Cohen-Goldberg, a kindergartner with a mane of curls.Solina Gonzalez, coloring a brown, blue and red circle with markers, peered soberly through pink-framed glasses: \u201cHe just does a lollipop dance.\u201d Solina\u2019s partner, Oisin Stephens, fretted about the root beer lollipop drawing she had taped to a block. \u201cThe robot won\u2019t be able to read this,\u201d he said. (It\u2019s an invalid input.)As they lurched around the carpet on their knees, the children executed computer science concepts like breaking instructions into sequenced commands, testing and debugging. One team used \u201crepeat\u201d and \u201cstop repeat\u201d blocks, forming a programming \u201cloop,\u201d a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.It may be a leap to think of talking to machines as child\u2019s play. But when Dr. Bers chats with students as they sequence blocks, they hardly notice they are coding. \u201cThey say, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not programming,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said.Consciously or not, this next generation may be effortlessly absorbing the computational thinking skills so many covet, and in the process refining what we mean by digital native.Laura Pappano is author of \u201cInside School Turnarounds: Urgent Hopes, Unfolding Stories.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Sees Augmented Reality Ecosystem in Facebook", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported bySAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has long rued the day that Apple and Google beat him to building smartphones, which now underpin many people\u2019s digital lives. Ever since, he has searched for the next frontier of modern computing and how to be a part of it from the start.Now, Mr. Zuckerberg is betting he has found it: the real world.On Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg introduced what he positioned as the first mainstream augmented reality platform, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras.But in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s telling, there are few boundaries for how this technology will evolve. He said he envisioned a world in which people could eventually point smartphone cameras at a bowl of cereal and have an app create tiny sharks swimming in the milk. Friends can leave virtual notes for one another on the walls outside their favorite restaurants, noting which menu item is the most delicious.\u201cThink about how many of the things around us don\u2019t actually need to be physical,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in an interview last week. \u201cInstead of a $500 TV sitting in front of us, what\u2019s to keep us from one day having it be a $1 app?\u201dFacebook does not expect to build all of these software experiences itself. At its annual developer conference on Tuesday, it called for computer programmers to help by building augmented-reality-based apps to work with what Facebook calls its Camera Effects Platform. Facebook announced new tools to aid developers and will begin the initiative with a small number of partners in a closed test.Still, Mr. Zuckerberg said he intended to create the next major app ecosystem that would work with Facebook\u2019s in-app camera. If successful, Facebook could be in a position similar to that of Apple, which relies on the hundreds of millions of apps in its store to keep users buying the company\u2019s smartphones and tablets every year. Facebook, in turn, wants developers to build experiences that entice people to visit its website and apps on a daily \u2014 if not hourly \u2014 basis.\u201cJust like Apple built the iPod and iTunes ecosystem before the iPhone, you want to make sure there\u2019s a set of content there, even if there\u2019s not everything,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Facebook has been building toward this goal for some time. Mr. Zuckerberg has spent the last 18 months reorganizing his company and its suite of consumer apps \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 around a new interface, focused almost entirely on the camera. Slowly, the company has played down the role of text inside its apps, instead encouraging people to take and send photos and videos to one another by using the in-app camera features.In time, Facebook hopes that companies like Electronic Arts, Nike and Warner Brothers \u2014 which are part of the initial set of partners \u2014 will be the ones to bring immersive augmented reality experiences to Facebook\u2019s platform.One early partner app is Giphy Thoughts, made by Giphy, a start-up that acts as a search engine for animated GIFs, which play as something like short-form videos. With Giphy Thoughts, for instance, people can place cartoon thought bubbles above the heads of others they view through their Facebook camera lens.\u201cIt goes back to creative expression,\u201d said David Rosenberg, director of business development at Giphy. \u201cFacebook Camera is just going to be this massive audience of people ready to make deeply personal content they can share with their friends.\u201dWhether Facebook can make it worth the time of more developers to create such apps remains a question.\u201cSoftware developers might ask, why would I create something for Facebook\u2019s platform that I am presumably giving away for free?\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst for Jackdaw Research, an industry analysis firm. \u201cAnd then when competitors introduce A.R. offerings, will I have to create it for Facebook and then a different lens for Snapchat? Or do I wait for Apple and Google to release their A.R. platforms?\u201dThen came Facebook\u2019s most aggressive move, the acquisition of Oculus in 2014. Facebook is investing hundreds of millions of dollars more in V.R. content and apps in the hopes that it will mature into a full-fledged ecosystem similar to Apple\u2019s App Store, but sales of the Oculus Rift goggles have been slow.\u201cThey are shaking things up there but haven\u2019t quite found their stride,\u201d said Stephanie Llamas, head of virtual reality and augmented reality strategy at SuperData Research, a game industry research firm.Mr. Zuckerberg has said the efforts with Oculus will take longer than he and his team initially believed, and probably billions of dollars more in investment. But in the interview last week, he said some of the technology acquired in the Oculus purchase had helped produce the seeds of the new augmented reality platform.Another dark horse is Magic Leap, the secretive augmented reality start-up that has an enormous investment from Google and Alibaba and is working on hardware to offer a similar experience. The company has yet to unveil an official product.For the near term, however, Mr. Zuckerberg sees the smartphone camera as the first step forward.\u201cWe want to get to this world in the future where you eventually have glasses or contact lenses where you can mix digital or physical objects in the digital world,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Persuasive Business Leaders Parade Through White House", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a meeting at the White House with business leaders two weeks into his presidency, Donald J. Trump turned to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase.Aren\u2019t the Chinese manipulating their currency? Mr. Trump asked, according to two people who were there.\u201cNo, Mr. President, they\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Dimon replied. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to be responsible.\u201dOthers at the meeting, including the former Boeing chief W. James McNerney, agreed. Their advice echoed arguments by members of Mr. Trump\u2019s staff and cabinet that he should abandon his campaign pledge to punish China over its currency.Mr. Trump was listening. Two months later, facing a strengthened United States dollar and the need for Chinese support against a pugilistic North Korea, he reversed his position.The meeting with Mr. Dimon and other corporate executives was just one of dozens of sessions Mr. Trump has convened with top businesspeople since becoming president. Nearly 300 executives have visited the White House this year, according to a New York Times tabulation, an open-door policy that is a sharp break with the Obama administration and puts corporate chieftains on par with senior lawmakers in the pecking order of who has influence in Washington.Frank and occasionally confrontational, the conversations have become a defining feature of Mr. Trump\u2019s young presidency, inspiring policy debates and in some instances 180-degree shifts by the president, according to White House officials and executives who have participated in the discussions.And while some Democrats and other critics complain business leaders are being granted unfettered access to Mr. Trump \u2014 who ran as a businessman planning to apply executive principles to Washington\u2019s problems \u2014 the White House is unapologetic. The relationship-building is acting as a welcome substitute for a lack of legislative accomplishments, and presidential aides suggest the rapport positions Mr. Trump for future success.\u201cThe whole idea is, do something with all of this communication and feedback,\u201d said Chris Liddell, the president\u2019s assistant for strategic initiatives and a former chief financial officer at Microsoft and General Motors. \u201cAnd some of that happened in the first hundred days, but we\u2019re really setting ourselves up for the next thousand days.\u201dMany executives said that they were rarely given face time with President Barack Obama, and that even when they were, they sensed he wasn\u2019t fully engaged. \u201cThe feedback from the Obama White House was, \u2018We\u2019ll listen to what you have to say, but we know what we\u2019re doing,\u2019\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group.The parade of chief executives has included familiar Republican faces, like Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone and Jack Welch, the former chairman and chief executive of General Electric.But it has also included Democrats. Larry Fink, the chief of BlackRock, was a potential Treasury secretary had Hillary Clinton won the presidency; on Friday, he blasted the administration\u2019s approach to immigration and cast doubt on the economic models underpinning its proposed tax cuts, saying, \u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty due to the new administration.\u201dEric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, was a Clinton supporter who predicted in January that Mr. Trump would do \u201cevil things\u201d as president. And Charles Phillips, chief executive of the software company Infor, sat on Mr. Obama\u2019s Economic Recovery Advisory Board.\u201cAs he\u2019s shaping his view, he is kind of learning a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Phillips said of Mr. Trump. \u201cSo this is a good time, in this first six months, to go in there.\u201dAlcoa\u2019s chief executive, Roy Harvey, experienced that firsthand on Thursday, as he watched Mr. Trump sign a memorandum directing the Commerce Department to investigate the effects of aluminum imports on national security.\u201cWe appreciate the support of the administration to try to make a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Harvey said.Mr. Trump\u2019s dialogue with business leaders has at times been freewheeling, and at times focused on topics that were first dissected in small sessions with staff or cabinet members. At the gatherings, some executives, who have been cowed by the president\u2019s itchy Twitter finger and tendency to take quick offense to perceived slights, have found Mr. Trump open to disagreement.At the meeting when the Chinese currency was discussed, Elon Musk, the South African-born chief of Tesla and SpaceX, attacked a newly signed executive order banning travel and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Not only did Mr. Trump welcome the criticism, said the people who were present, he calmly defended his position, noting that public-opinion polls supported his viewpoint before sharing the floor with John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary.Some business leaders have parlayed their White House access into support for specific causes. In a TED talk on Friday, Mr. Musk said, \u201cI\u2019ve used the meetings I\u2019ve had to argue in favor of immigration and climate change,\u201d according to a Twitter post published by the organization. Mr. Schwarzman of Blackstone encouraged Mr. Trump to soften his hard-line stance on deporting so-called Dreamers \u2014 the young, undocumented foreigners living in the United States.\u201cBecause of these conversations, it really became a significant focus of the administration,\u201d said Reed Cordish, assistant to the president for intergovernmental and technology initiatives.Executives are hoping the White House will support putting federal education grants toward skills-training programs rather than just traditional college. So far, however, the administration hasn\u2019t taken a public stance on the legislative efforts to do so.Mr. Trump\u2019s unofficial business cabinet was handpicked, in many cases, by influential companies and trade associations. On the president\u2019s first full weekday in office, he welcomed a dozen industrial executives who had been convened by Andrew Liveris, head of the Dow Chemical Company. A senior staff member at the Retail Industry Leaders Association put together a panel of executives drawn from her group\u2019s ranks.Mr. Schwarzman recruited a range of business leaders, economists and policy experts for the president\u2019s strategic and policy forum, which regularly meets at the White House and has emerged as the most elite outside counsel.To be invited to the policy forum, there were a few criteria, according to someone who was briefed on the selection process: Be an expert in your field who is respected by Mr. Schwarzman, be a United States citizen and don\u2019t be vetoed by Mr. Trump.The task of dealing day to day with the chief executives falls largely to Mr. Liddell, a New Zealander by birth, and Mr. Cordish, a Baltimore real estate scion, who share a cramped office in the West Wing. It is decorated with a laminated United States map and a full-page ad, ripped from The Wall Street Journal, that thanks Mr. Trump for agreeing to reconsider fuel-economy standards. It was purchased by auto trade groups.During a recent interview, Mr. Liddell and Mr. Cordish were upbeat. Since the White House \u201clistening groups\u201d began, Mr. Cordish said, they\u2019ve been barraged with ideas from executives and trade groups for deregulation, job creation and the streamlining of services.In a meeting in early April, a group of 50 or so chief executives involved with the Partnership for New York City proposed adding public housing to Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure initiative. The idea was recirculated at another trade group meeting about a week later, suggesting that the White House was seriously considering it.Some of the infrastructure changes under consideration would improve the government\u2019s own inner workings, including at the White House itself. \u201cA lot of technology here is 20 years out of date,\u201d Mr. Liddell said.But even with all the access, some chief executives are frustrated with what they describe as well-intentioned but so far fruitless talk \u2014 and a public environment that can be leery of any cooperation with the Trump administration.Robert Hoopes, a consultant who advises nonprofit groups and large companies and has done work for prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said executives were making a careful calculation when they traveled to Pennsylvania Avenue. If the topic for discussion is core to your business, Mr. Hoopes said, \u201cyou want to be a part of that conversation.\u201d But if the session is peripheral or unrelated to your business, he said, the \u201crisk calibration\u201d is very different.Two dozen trade-group officials and chief executives, some of them suggested as potential interview subjects by the White House, either refused to speak for this article or didn\u2019t respond to messages. Others declined to be quoted on the record, citing the toxic environment and the potential fallout among the public and their own employees for being regarded as an ally of Mr. Trump.\u201cUsually, when a campaign is over, things settle down and people feel they can work with the president without having a backlash,\u201d Ms. Wylde of the Partnership for New York City said. \u201cIn this case, there continue to be divisive forces that don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d C.E.O.s, she said, \u201cfeel pressure from all sides.\u201dLandon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting from Chicago.

{"Headline": "Pamela Edstrom, Who Helped Shape Microsoft\u2019s Public Image, Dies at 71", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byPamela Edstrom, a communications strategist who shaped the public image of Microsoft and its founder Bill Gates during the company\u2019s reign as the most powerful technology player in the world, died on Tuesday at her home in Vancouver, Wash. She was 71.When Ms. Edstrom joined Microsoft in Seattle in 1982 as its first director of public relations, the company was an obscure maker of software, and personal computers were only beginning to climb out of hobbyist culture and into everyday business.Ms. Edstrom continued to exert huge influence on Microsoft, becoming one of Mr. Gates\u2019s most trusted outside advisers and helping to promote the company\u2019s mission of putting a PC in every home.Later, as Microsoft became more powerful, it became ensnared in a series of bruising antitrust battles, emerging blemished with the image of a corporate bully toward partners and competitors.Ms. Edstrom was one of a handful of counselors who helped the PC industry\u2019s early entrepreneurs translate their work from engineering-speak into language the mainstream news media and the public could understand. Tech company founders were pitched as boy-genius wizards out to change the world. Steve Jobs, a founder of Apple, had a similar communications adviser in Regis McKenna.\u201cPam was a creative pioneer who defined new ways of doing P.R. that made a huge mark on Microsoft and the entire industry,\u201d Mr. Gates, who retired from Microsoft in 2008 to focus on philanthropy, wrote in an email.In that era, before computer technology had seeped into the public consciousness and the internet and social media had transformed the media landscape, the traditional press was the gatekeeper to getting Microsoft\u2019s story out. Ms. Edstrom \u2014 animated by what her partner, now named Melissa Waggener Zorkin, called a \u201crelentless pursuit of relationships\u201d \u2014 was a master of cultivating connections with journalists.In the 1990s she organized sleepovers for select groups of journalists at Mr. Gates\u2019s vacation compound on Hood Canal, near Seattle, where they got to hear him share his vision of technology.David Kirkpatrick, then a technology writer at Fortune magazine, said that when his daughter was born 24 years ago, Ms. Edstrom mailed him aspirin and caffeine tablets in what she described as an emergency tool kit for new parents.\u201cShe was a person who had an unusually deft ability to befriend and advise the journalist in a way that was truly beneficial while also serving her client,\u201d said Mr. Kirkpatrick, who founded Techonomy, a technology conference.Pamela Edstrom was born on Feb. 15, 1946, in Minneapolis to Richard Henley Newsome and Barbara Estelle Johnston. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Minnesota and a master\u2019s from Portland State University.In a commencement speech at the University of Minnesota last year, Ms. Edstrom said that she had wanted to pursue a career in law enforcement but that, at five feet tall, she was told she was too short to get a job as a police officer or an F.B.I. agent.Instead, she talked herself into a public relations job at Tektronix, a maker of oscilloscopes in Oregon, where she got her first exposure to an early technology company.Steven A. Ballmer, who succeeded Mr. Gates as chief executive of Microsoft, recruited and hired Ms. Edstrom. In an email he recalled the time that Ms. Edstrom, in the mid-1980s, organized a press event at a trade show in Las Vegas called the Windows Roast to commemorate the launch of the first version of that Microsoft operating system.Microsoft was exceedingly late in delivering the product, and Ms. Edstrom decided that the best way to deal with that was with self-deprecation, which did not come naturally to Microsoft\u2019s hard-charging executives.\u201cI thought it was nuts to make fun of ourselves for being two years later than we announced in shipping, but Pam was right on,\u201d Mr. Ballmer, now the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association, wrote.In her commencement speech last year, Ms. Edstrom described how she approached the risk of failure in her professional life by asking herself a question. \u201cI mean, what is the very worst thing that could happen if I do this project?\u201d she said. \u201cI could die.\u201cHallelujah!\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m not going to die.\u201dBesides her daughter, from her first marriage, which ended in divorce, her survivors include her husband, Joseph Lamberton; four stepchildren, Suzanne Goodman and Todd, Bryan and Greg Lamberton; and seven grandchildren.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is It Time to Break Up Google?", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byOpinionIn just 10 years, the world\u2019s five largest companies by market capitalization have all changed, save for one: Microsoft. Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Citigroup and Shell Oil are out and Apple, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon and Facebook have taken their place.They\u2019re all tech companies, and each dominates its corner of the industry: Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising, Facebook (and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic and Amazon has a 74 percent share in the e-book market. In classic economic terms, all three are monopolies.We have been transported back to the early 20th century, when arguments about \u201cthe curse of bigness\u201d were advanced by President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s counselor, Louis Brandeis, before Wilson appointed him to the Supreme Court. Brandeis wanted to eliminate monopolies, because (in the words of his biographer Melvin Urofsky) \u201cin a democratic society the existence of large centers of private power is dangerous to the continuing vitality of a free people.\u201d We need look no further than the conduct of the largest banks in the 2008 financial crisis or the role that Facebook and Google play in the \u201cfake news\u201d business to know that Brandeis was right.While Brandeis generally opposed regulation \u2014 which, he worried, inevitably led to the corruption of the regulator \u2014 and instead advocated breaking up \u201cbigness,\u201d he made an exception for \u201cnatural\u201d monopolies, like telephone, water and power companies and railroads, where it made sense to have one or a few companies in control of an industry.Could it be that these companies \u2014 and Google in particular \u2014 have become natural monopolies by supplying an entire market\u2019s demand for a service, at a price lower than what would be offered by two competing firms? And if so, is it time to regulate them like public utilities?Consider a historical analogy: the early days of telecommunications.In 1895 a photograph of the business district of a large city might have shown 20 phone wires attached to most buildings. Each wire was owned by a different phone company, and none of them worked with the others. Without network effects, the networks themselves were almost useless.The solution was for a single company, American Telephone and Telegraph, to consolidate the industry by buying up all the small operators and creating a single network \u2014 a natural monopoly. The government permitted it, but then regulated this monopoly through the Federal Communications Commission.In a 1956 consent decree in which the Justice Department allowed AT&T to maintain its phone monopoly, the government extracted a huge concession: All past patents were licensed (to any American company) royalty-free, and all future patents were to be licensed for a small fee. These licenses led to the creation of Texas Instruments, Motorola, Fairchild Semiconductor and many other start-ups.True, the internet never had the same problems of interoperability. And Google\u2019s route to dominance is different from the Bell System\u2019s. Nevertheless it still has all of the characteristics of a public utility.We are going to have to decide fairly soon whether Google, Facebook and Amazon are the kinds of natural monopolies that need to be regulated, or whether we allow the status quo to continue, pretending that unfettered monoliths don\u2019t inflict damage on our privacy and democracy.It is impossible to deny that Facebook, Google and Amazon have stymied innovation on a broad scale. To begin with, the platforms of Google and Facebook are the point of access to all media for the majority of Americans. While profits at Google, Facebook and Amazon have soared, revenues in media businesses like newspaper publishing or the music business have, since 2001, fallen by 70 percent.There are a few obvious regulations to start with. Monopoly is made by acquisition \u2014 Google buying AdMob and DoubleClick, Facebook buying Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon buying, to name just a few, Audible, Twitch, Zappos and Alexa. At a minimum, these companies should not be allowed to acquire other major firms, like Spotify or Snapchat.The second alternative is to regulate a company like Google as a public utility, requiring it to license out patents, for a nominal fee, for its search algorithms, advertising exchanges and other key innovations.The third alternative is to remove the \u201csafe harbor\u201d clause in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which allows companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube to free ride on the content produced by others. The reason there are 40,000 Islamic State videos on YouTube, many with ads that yield revenue for those who posted them, is that YouTube does not have to take responsibility for the content on its network. Facebook, Google and Twitter claim that policing their networks would be too onerous. But that\u2019s preposterous: They already police their networks for pornography, and quite well.Removing the safe harbor provision would also force social networks to pay for the content posted on their sites. A simple example: One million downloads of a song on iTunes would yield the performer and his record label about $900,000. One million streams of that same song on YouTube would earn them about $900.I\u2019m under no delusion that, with libertarian tech moguls like Peter Thiel in President Trump\u2019s inner circle, antitrust regulation of the internet monopolies will be a priority. Ultimately we may have to wait four years, at which time the monopolies will be so dominant that the only remedy will be to break them up. Force Google to sell DoubleClick. Force Facebook to sell WhatsApp and Instagram.Woodrow Wilson was right when he said in 1913, \u201cIf monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of the government.\u201d We ignore his words at our peril.Jonathan Taplin is the director emeritus of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Google, Facebook and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Games Help Model Brain\u2019s Neurons", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byBut while those games are entertainment designed to grab players by their adrenal glands, Dr. Popovi\u0107\u2019s latest creation asks players to trace lines over fuzzy images with a computer mouse. It has a slow pace with dreamy music that sounds like the ambient soundtrack inside a New Age bookstore.The point? To advance neuroscience.That is far more than professional neuron analysts at places like the Allen Institute can ever hope to handle. Enlisting novices through a game like \u201cMozak\u201d helps with the task. But the real goal is to use high-quality neuron reconstructions done by humans \u2014 the more the better \u2014 to train computers to do the job more accurately than they can now.\u201cIf we create a corpus of thousands of these neurons, the chances are the computational methods will become better,\u201d Dr. Popovi\u0107 said. \u201cYou can see this as symbiosis \u2014 computers learn from what people are doing and they do better.\u201d\u201cMozak\u201d has helped the Allen Institute increase the number of neuron reconstructions from 2.33 a week that a team of professional analysts were doing on their own, to 8.3 reconstructions a week, said Staci Sorensen, senior manager of morphology at the Allen Institute. That reflects both the contributions of players and the productivity benefits of an internal version of \u201cMozak\u201d that the institute\u2019s professionals now use.About 200 people a day play \u201cMozak\u201d now, and with more players will come more reconstructions.\u201cI\u2019m hoping ultimately for an order of magnitude, a factor of 10, acceleration,\u201d said Christof Koch, president and chief scientific officer of the Allen Institute. \u201cHow big is the community willing to do this? Is it 20 oddballs or thousands?\u201dThe spark for \u201cMozak\u201d came from Jane Roskams, a professor of neuroscience at the University of British Columbia and former executive director for strategy and alliances at the Allen Institute, when she attended a White House workshop on brain science initiatives a couple of years ago. After meeting with Dr. Popovi\u0107 back in Seattle, the two applied for and received a National Science Foundation grant that they used to develop the game.\u201cThere are some clear opportunities for really engaging a much broader public audience for tackling some of these big data challenges,\u201d Dr. Roskams said. \u201cMost of the time experts think they need to turn to experts.\u201dPlaying \u201cMozak\u201d doesn\u2019t offer the slick graphics and sugar rush of matching gems in \u201cCandy Crush.\u201d The game \u2014 the name of which means \u201cbrain\u201d in Serbo-Croatian, Dr. Popovi\u0107\u2019s mother tongue \u2014 presents players with images of mouse and human neurons captured on powerful microscopes by the Allen Institute in its laboratories.The neurons in the images, their dendrites and axons emanating from their somas, look like spiders with dozens of legs stretched to the breaking point in all directions. The images are grainy, with dandruff-like flakes floating around that are not part of the neurons. Computers just are not very good yet at constructing 3-D models out of all that noise.But humans, if they are focused and patient, can be pretty adept at it. \u201cMozak\u201d players ring up points as they trace the structure of neurons, then advance to a new neuron once they have finished reconstructing one. When multiple people trace the same 3-D models, there is a good chance they are accurate.Bob Bondi, a retired software developer in Bend, Ore., has been playing \u201cMozak,\u201d initially logging as much as 10 hours a day but has now tapered back to about three.

{"Headline": "Wealthy in the White House: President Trump\u2019s Inner Circle ", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byMany of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have sprawling assets and income sources, according to their financial disclosure forms. President Trump has surrounded himself with an extraordinarily wealthy group of advisers, who have sprawling assets and income sources. Here are some intriguing highlights from their financial disclosure forms:The director of the National Economic Council and a former Goldman Sachs executive, he is among the wealthiest of the president\u2019s advisers, with assets worth as much as $611 million. He owns stock in Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, McDonald\u2019s and the food giant Kraft Heinz, and has at least $191.1 million in Goldman-related holdings. He and his wife reported at least $48 million to $78 million in income last year.She is best known for her once-ubiquitous cable television appearances, but Ms. Conway has earned significant money through speechmaking and consulting. Among the groups that paid her last year were the National RIfle Association, the National Right to Life Committee, the Tea Party Patriots and the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group that gained notoriety in 2015 when it secretly recorded a video that purported to show Planned Parenthood officials trying to profit from the sale of fetal tissue. She and her husband, a lawyer, are worth at least $11 million to $44 million, the records show.His real estate interests are vast \u2014 with properties in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana and Maryland \u2014 but he still carries a lot of debt. Mr. Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, has at least $19 million worth of debt from various banks, as well as $115,000 worth of debt on two Visa credit cards, at a 13.74 percent interest rate. He and his wife, Ivanka Trump, are beneficiaries of a real estate and investment portfolio worth as much as $740 million. Mr. Kushner also reported $4.5 million in advertising revenue from The New York Observer LLC, the New York media company that he reportedly put into a family trust this year.The lifestyle of the former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant is modest compared with some of her wealthy colleagues. She held positions as an adjunct professor at Howard University in Washington and as a substitute teacher for children with disabilities in Los Angeles into 2016. She is also a partial beneficiary of a trust of at least $3 million from the estate of her deceased fianc\u00e9, the actor\u00a0Michael Clarke Duncan. And at 43, she still has at least $50,000 in student loan debt.The president\u2019s press secretary, now a household name because of the attention generated by his news conferences \u2014 and subsequent parodies on shows like \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014\u00a0earned rent or royalties from four properties in Alexandria, Va. He is connected to two family trusts: one that includes three properties in Rhode Island worth at least $1 million and another that includes two commercial properties in Madison, Ala., worth at least $500,000.His assets include stocks of at least $15,000 of Coca-Cola; $50,000 of McDonald\u2019s; $15,000 of Verizon; $15,000 of AT&T; $1,000 in Las Vegas Sands Corp., a company owned by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson; and $1,000 in Exxon Mobil. A onetime typist in the Nixon White House, she is now among Mr. Trump\u2019s affluent advisers, with assets worth between $9 million and $28 million. Ms. McFarland, the deputy national security adviser, earned $63,000 last year from Fox News and $125,000 from speeches she gave to various trade and business groups like American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, Air Movement and Control Association, and the Associated Equipment Distributors. Over all, she and her husband made between\u00a0$377,000 and $634,000 last year. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Activist Investment in Whole Foods Exposes Shifting Power on Wall St.", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byAs a steward of pension funds and retirement accounts, Neuberger Berman has traditionally employed a staid strategy familiar among big Wall Street money managers: Buy and hold stocks, sit back, and hope for the best.But recently, the firm has eschewed its nearly 80-year-old tactic of playing nice. Instead it turned to the bare-knuckled world of activist investors made famous by the likes of Carl C. Icahn and William A. Ackman.Last year, as Neuberger Berman\u2019s roughly $200 million investment in Whole Foods Market languished, the firm quietly approached some hedge funds and urged them to agitate for change at the high-end grocer.Two weeks ago, Jana Partners took up the fight.Neuberger Berman\u2019s behind-the-scenes campaign to shake up Whole Foods is the latest example of a dynamic that is upending relations between public companies and the big investors that own their stock.For decades, Neuberger Berman \u2014 which invests some $267 billion for pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and individuals \u2014 and peers like T. Rowe Price and BlackRock were reluctant to rock the boat at the companies they invested in. Agitating for change was left to the activist hedge fund managers like Mr. Icahn and Mr. Ackman, rabble-rousers with a reputation for shaking up companies, raising their stock prices and making big profits.Traditional money managers in search of market-beating returns are demanding a seat at the table, turning to activists for help and even employing some hedge fund tricks of their own. And activists, once the black sheep of the investment world, are now accepted as regular, if meddlesome, investors.Do companies \u201creally listen to the feedback they get from their mainstream investors?\u201d said Michelle Edkins, global head of corporate governance at BlackRock. \u201cI think they are certainly making an effort to listen more.\u201dBut activists, she added, \u201ccan act as an important \u2018check and balance\u2019 on management that has lost its way.\u201dBefore Neuberger Berman approached the activists, it talked to Whole Foods representatives and made its case for change. While the company undertook some reforms \u2014 for one, scrapping its dual-chief-executive structure in November \u2014 the conversations yielded little effect on the company\u2019s dwindling share price.So Neuberger Berman executives prepared an inch-thick presentation, the kind of document usually produced by activists. It took broad aim at Whole Foods, criticizing everything from its cozy board and wilting produce to its pricey real estate in well-heeled neighborhoods like Columbus Circle, where Whole Foods has a store in the Time Warner Center \u2014 one of the most expensive retail spaces in New York City. With that in hand, they approached several hedge funds, including Starboard Value and Elliott Management.Before long, Jana was amassing shares of Whole Foods. On April 10, as it unveiled its stake in the company, it ticked off a list of complaints that echoed Neuberger Berman\u2019s concerns: The brand was suffering, customer service was lagging and the company needed fresh blood on the board.Jana declined to comment.Neuberger Berman declined to comment about its interactions with hedge funds regarding Whole Foods, but said the firm was willing to take a more active role in certain situations. \u201cWe have engaged with the company quite aggressively over the course of the last period of time,\u201d said Joseph Amato, president and chief investment officer of Neuberger Berman, referring to Whole Foods.Earlier this week, Neuberger Berman sent a letter to the board of directors at Whole Foods, praising it for undertaking \u201cpositive changes\u201d in recent months. But Neuberger Berman also strongly urged the board to consider a potential sale of the company or a merger or alliance with another company, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by The New York Times.Relations between institutional investors and activists have evolved in recent years, and it is not unheard-of for big investors to support activists who have set their sights on a high-profile company. In 2013, T. Rowe Price teamed up with Mr. Icahn to oppose a leveraged buyout of Dell.Neuberger Berman has taken a more confrontational approach before. Last year it campaigned for change at another company in which it had invested, the technology company Ultratech. It secured two board seats, but the process, Mr. Amato said, was \u201cin all honesty expensive and time-consuming.\u201dIn the case of Whole Foods, Neuberger Berman lobbied for the activists to do the messy work of battling the company in public.But it is less common for an institutional investor to share its work on a specific target with activists in the way Neuberger Berman did with Whole Foods. Mr. Ackman has described receiving occasional calls from institutional investors hoping to pique his interest in a company. There is even a term for the interplay: \u201cR.F.A.s\u201d or \u201crequests for activism.\u201dFor many large shareholders, the 2008 financial crisis was the turning point that led to greater collaboration with activists. Investors watched as the value of their stock portfolios plummeted.At the same time, activists, who at times could be brash, have softened their images. Third Point\u2019s Daniel S. Loeb \u2014 once famous for the verbal invective that he lobbed at chief executives \u2014 has opted more recently for the quiet approach of complimenting executives but emphasizing \u201cundervalued\u201d aspects of their businesses. In a letter to investors two years ago he sought to dispel the notion that activists were \u201chit and run\u201d investors.\u201cIt might surprise people to hear that we completely agree that the sort of activism they describe is abominable,\u201d he wrote.In the case of Whole Foods, Jana has focused on a broad range of issues with the business \u2014 which has earned the nickname \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d for its expensive products. It pointed to failures in how Whole Foods handled its brand development, and to what it said were customer service deficiencies and a poor strategy for distribution.Once the vanguard of the natural and organic food movement, Whole Foods now faces competition from big-name grocers like Safeway and Costco that have started to offer similar organic products at lower prices.As its share price slid last year, Whole Foods cut its prices, offered promotions and started a loyalty program. After Jana\u2019s announcement, the company said it was \u201ccommitted to driving value for all Whole Foods Market shareholders and will continue to act to achieve this important objective.\u201dBut analysts have speculated the company could be a takeover target, which would result in a big payday for Jana, Neuberger Berman and other investors. A flurry of reports of takeover interest \u2014 the supermarket chain Albertsons and the e-commerce giant Amazon are reported to have explored bids \u2014 has helped to lift the share price.Charles Kantor, who oversees Neuberger Berman\u2019s investment in Whole Foods, said that the company had \u201ca phenomenal brand and had executed the difficult things,\u201d but that \u201cthey haven\u2019t done well with the basic Retail 101.\u201dMr. Kantor said it was normal for his group to speak with other investors. But, he added, \u201cWe\u2019ve never made an investment predicated on an activist showing up.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Taylor, Innovator Who Shaped Modern Computing, Dies at 85", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byLike many inventions, the internet was the work of countless hands. But perhaps no one deserves more credit for that world-changing technological leap than Robert W. Taylor, who died on Thursday at 85 at his home in Woodside, Calif.Indeed, few people were as instrumental in shaping the modern computer-connected world as he.His seminal moment came in 1966. He had just taken a new position at the Pentagon \u2014 director of the Information Processing Techniques Office, part of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as ARPA \u2014 and on his first day on the job it became immediately obvious to him what the office lacked and what it needed.At the time, ARPA was funding three separate computer research projects and using three separate computer terminals to communicate with them. Mr. Taylor decided that the department needed a single computer network to connect each project with the others.\u201cI went to see Charlie Herzfeld, who was the head of ARPA, and laid the idea on him,\u201d Mr. Taylor recalled in an interview with The Times. \u201cHe liked the idea immediately, and he took a million dollars out of the ballistic missile defense budget and put it into my budget right then and there.\u201d He added, \u201cThe first funding came that month.\u201dHis idea led to the Arpanet, the forerunner of the internet.A half-decade later, at Xerox\u2019s storied Palo Alto Research Center in Northern California, Mr. Taylor was a key figure in another technological breakthrough: funding the design of the Alto computer, which is widely described as the forerunner of the personal computer.Mr. Taylor even had a vital role in the invention of the computer mouse. In 1961, at the dawn of the space age, he was about a year into his job as a project manager at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Washington when he learned about the work of a young computer scientist at Stanford Research Institute, later called SRI International.\u201cAny way you look at it, from kick-starting the internet to launching the personal computer revolution, Bob Taylor was a key architect of our modern world,\u201d said Leslie Berlin, a historian at the Stanford University Silicon Valley Archives project.At NASA, as the newly elected Kennedy administration was putting the nation on a path to the moon, Mr. Taylor became a friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of J. C. R. Licklider, a psychologist and computer scientist who had written a pioneering paper titled \u201cMan-Computer Symbiosis.\u201dAs much as any single document, the paper became a road map for the development of the internet and the personal computer, as well as spectacular advances in artificial intelligence and robotics.Robert William Taylor was born on Feb. 10, 1932, in Dallas and was adopted 28 days later in San Antonio by the Rev. Raymond Taylor, a Methodist minister, and his wife, Audrey. Growing up, Robert moved frequently as his father was assigned to different parishes; he often spent summers in Austin with an aunt and uncle.After studying for a while at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, he went on to earn bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the University of Texas at Austin. It was while working on his master\u2019s thesis in experimental psychology that he developed a fascination with new forms of human-computer interaction.His thesis research focused on how the ear and the brain localize sound. To analyze his data, he had to bring it to the university\u2019s computing center, where a staff member behind a protective glass wall helped operate the center\u2019s mainframe computer. The operator showed him the laborious process of entering his data and his program onto computer punch cards, the standard of the era.\u201cI was appalled,\u201d Mr. Taylor recalled years later in an interview at the university, \u201cand after I thought about it for a while, I was angry.\u201d The data entry process, he said, was \u201cridiculous.\u201d\u201cI thought it was insulting,\u201d he added.He left the center, went back to his laboratory and used a desktop calculator instead.He knew, he said, that the calculator \u201ccould manipulate symbols \u2014 it used high voltages and low voltages to represent 1s and 0s \u2014 and that 1s and 0s could be combined to represent letters, and letters could be combined to represent text, and text could be combined to represent knowledge.\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t computers do that?\u201dTwo years later, he read \u201cMan-Computer Symbiosis,\u201d and the paper would serve as a basic reference for his work at NASA, the Pentagon, Xerox and later at the Digital Equipment Corporation. In 1968, he and Dr. Licklider wrote a paper together, \u201cThe Computer as a Communications Device,\u201d which drew the broad outlines of how computer networks might transform society.At the Pentagon in the 1960s, Mr. Taylor was called on to help in the war effort in Vietnam. President Lyndon B. Johnson, he was told, was upset at getting what he believed to be inaccurate \u201cbody count\u201d numbers, and he had demanded that his defense secretary, Robert S. McNamara, fix the problem.Mr. McNamara called the director of ARPA, and Mr. Taylor was ordered to travel to Vietnam to straighten out the information systems being used to report the progress of the war. By the end of his second trip, Mr. Taylor said, he was convinced that the United States military had no business being in Southeast Asia.He left the Pentagon in 1969 and taught for a year at the University of Utah before joining the newly formed Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, in California. There, he joined a small group of researchers who were refining many of the technologies that had been pioneered by Mr. Engelbart at the Stanford Research Institute and who were also creating new ones, including graphics-based personal computing.Mr. Taylor\u2019s team built a prototype personal computer called the Alto, and another group, led by Alan Kay, added a software system that pioneered the so-called desktop metaphor, in which documents are represented by graphical icons on the computer display.That technology in turn became the inspiration for Apple\u2019s Lisa and Macintosh computers and for Microsoft\u2019s Windows software.The laser printer was also invented at PARC, and, besides generating profit for Xerox, it would play an important role in the \u201coffice of the future\u201d ideas that were being explored by Mr. Taylor\u2019s group.It was Steve Jobs, however, who profited the most when Xerox management allowed him to visit with Mr. Taylor\u2019s group at the Palo Alto center. Mr. Jobs, drawing on ideas he encountered there, went on to be the first to successfully market the new style of computing.Similarly, Charles Simonyi, a young software designer who developed an early word-processing software program for the Alto, took many of the PARC ideas with him when he joined Microsoft.Toward the end of his career, in the 1990s, Mr. Taylor created and ran the Digital Equipment Systems Research Laboratory in Palo Alto, which helped create one of the first internet search engines, AltaVista.Mr. Taylor died of complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease, his son Kurt said.Besides his son Kurt, Mr. Taylor is survived by two other sons, Erik and Derek; and three grandchildren. His marriage to Joanne Honnold ended in divorce.At Xerox PARC, Mr. Taylor was particularly known for fostering a weekly meeting of computer scientists to discuss a wide range of issues, from computing technology to the feats of Uri Geller, the Israeli illusionist. At each meeting, one member of the group would present a topic for discussion.The meetings were known as Dealers, because the presenter would sit like a blackjack dealer in the center of an imposing circle of computer scientists reclining in beanbag chairs. No-holds-barred discussions and debates would ensue, and no one profited more from them than Mr. Taylor.\u201cBob amped up tension of the Dealer meetings to get people to perform well,\u201d recalled Ted Kaehler, who attended the meetings as a young PARC software designer, \u201cand he used it to figure out what was good and what wasn\u2019t.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misstated the day Mr. Taylor died. It was Thursday, not Friday.An earlier version of this obituary, using information from Mr. Taylor\u2019s family, misstated the given name of his mother. It was Audrey, not Marie.An obituary on Saturday about the computer scientist Robert W. Taylor misidentified the institution from which he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. It is the University of Texas at Austin (where he also did graduate work), not Southern Methodist University in Dallas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Facebook Fix Its Own Worst Bug?", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "FeatureMark Zuckerberg now acknowledges the dangerous side of the social revolution he helped start. But is the most powerful tool for connection in human history capable of adapting to the world it created?Supported byZuckerberg used to be a nervous speaker, but he has become much less so. He speaks quickly but often unloads full paragraphs of thought, and sometimes his arguments are so polished that they sound rehearsed, which happened often that morning. \u201c2016 was an interesting year for us,\u201d he said as the three of us, plus a P.R. executive, sat around a couple of couches in the glass-walled conference room where he conducts many of his meetings. (There are many perks to working at Facebook, but no one, not even Zuckerberg, has a private office.) It was an understatement and a nod to the obvious: Facebook, once a mere app on your phone, had become a global political and cultural force, and the full implications of that transformation had begun to come into view last year. \u201cIf you look at the history of Facebook, when we started off, there really wasn\u2019t news as part of it,\u201d Zuckerberg went on. But as Facebook grew and became a bigger part of how people learn about the world, the company had been slow to adjust to its new place in people\u2019s lives. The events of 2016, he said, \u201cset off a number of conversations that we\u2019re still in the middle of.\u201dAfter the election, Zuckerberg offered a few pat defenses of Facebook\u2019s role. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite proud of the impact that we were able to have on civic discourse over all,\u201d he said when we spoke in January. Misinformation on Facebook was not as big a problem as some believed it was, but Facebook nevertheless would do more to battle it, he pledged. Echo chambers were a concern, but if the source was people\u2019s own confirmation bias, was it really Facebook\u2019s problem to solve?It was hard to tell how seriously Zuckerberg took the criticisms of his service and its increasingly paradoxical role in the world. He had spent much of his life building a magnificent machine to bring people together. By the most literal measures, he\u2019d succeeded spectacularly, but what had that connection wrought? Across the globe, Facebook now seems to benefit actors who want to undermine the global vision at its foundation. Supporters of Trump and the European right-wing nationalists who aim to turn their nations inward and dissolve alliances, trolls sowing cross-border paranoia, even ISIS with its skillful social-media recruiting and propagandizing \u2014 all of them have sought in their own ways to split the Zuckerbergian world apart. And they are using his own machine to do it.Underneath it all was a nagging feeling of complicity. Trump had benefited from a media environment that is now shaped by Facebook \u2014 and, more to the point, shaped by a single Facebook feature, the same one to which the company owes its remarkable ascent to social-media hegemony: the computationally determined list of updates you see every time you open the app. The list has a formal name, News Feed. But most users are apt to think of it as Facebook itself.If it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that News Feed has become the most influential source of information in the history of civilization, it is only slightly so. Facebook created News Feed in 2006 to solve a problem: In the social-media age, people suddenly had too many friends to keep up with. At the time, Facebook was just a collection of profiles, lacking any kind of central organization. To figure out what any of your connections were up to, you had to visit each of their profiles to see if anything had changed. News Feed fixed that. Every time you open Facebook, it hunts through the network, collecting every post from every connection \u2014 information that, for most Facebook users, would be too overwhelming to process themselves. Then it weighs the merits of each post before presenting you with a feed sorted in order of importance: a hyperpersonalized front page designed just for you.Scholars and critics have been warning of the solipsistic irresistibility of algorithmic news at least since 2001, when the constitutional-law professor Cass R. Sunstein warned, in his book \u201cRepublic.com,\u201d of the urgent risks posed to democracy \u201cby any situation in which thousands or perhaps millions or even tens of millions of people are mainly listening to louder echoes of their own voices.\u201d (In 2008, I piled on with my own book, \u201cTrue Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society.\u201d) In 2011, the digital activist and entrepreneur Eli Pariser, looking at similar issues, gave this phenomenon a memorable name in the title of his own book: \u201cThe Filter Bubble.\u201dEmployees got the same message. \u201cWhen Facebook cares about something, they spin up teams to address it, and Zuck will come out and talk about it all the time,\u201d one former executive told me. \u201cI have never heard of anything close to that on the filter bubble. I never sensed that this was a problem he wanted us to tackle. It was always positioned as an interesting intellectual question but not something that we\u2019re going to go focus on.\u201dFacebook, under criticism, reinstated the picture, but the photo incident stuck with Zuckerberg. He would bring it up unbidden to staff members and to reporters. It highlighted, for him, the difficulty of building a policy framework for what Facebook was trying to do. Zuckerberg wanted to become a global news distributor that is run by machines, rather than by humans who would try to look at every last bit of content and exercise considered judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s something I think we\u2019re still figuring out,\u201d he told me in January. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to do here than what we\u2019ve done. And I think we\u2019re starting to realize this now as well.\u201dIt struck me as an unsatisfying answer, and it later became apparent that Zuckerberg seemed to feel the same way. On a Sunday morning about a month after the first meeting, I got a call from a Facebook spokesman. Zuckerberg wanted to chat again. Could Mike and I come back on Monday afternoon?What\u2019s striking about that 2012 letter, read through the prism of 2017, is its certainty that a more \u201copen and connected\u201d world is by definition a better one. \u201cWhen I started Facebook, the idea of connecting the world was not controversial,\u201d Zuckerberg said now. \u201cThe default assumption was that the world was incrementally just moving in that direction. So I thought we can connect some people and do our part in helping move in that direction.\u201d But now, he said, whether it was wise to connect the world was \u201cactually a real question.\u201dZuckerberg\u2019s new manifesto never quite accepts blame for any of the global ills that have been laid at Facebook\u2019s feet. Yet by the standards of a company release, it is remarkable for the way it concedes that the company\u2019s chief goal \u2014 wiring the globe \u2014 is controversial. \u201cThere are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone,\u201d Zuckerberg writes, \u201cand whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course.\u201d He also confesses misgivings about Facebook\u2019s role in the news. \u201cGiving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality.\u201dAt the time of our second interview, the manifesto was still only a draft, and I was surprised by how unsure Zuckerberg seemed about it in person. He had almost as many questions for us \u2014 about whether we understood what he was trying to say, how we thought it would land in the media \u2014 as we had for him. When I suggested that it might be perceived as an attack on Trump, he looked dismayed. He noted several times that he had been noodling over these ideas since long before November. A few weeks earlier, there was media speculation, fueled by a postelection tour of America by Zuckerberg and his wife, that he was laying the groundwork to run against Trump in 2020, and in this meeting he took pains to shoot down the rumors. When I asked if he had chatted with Obama about the former president\u2019s critique of Facebook, Zuckerberg paused for several seconds, nearly to the point of awkwardness, before answering that he had.Facebook\u2019s spokespeople later called to stress that Obama was only one of many people to whom he had spoken. In other words: Don\u2019t read this as a partisan anti-Trump manifesto. But if the company pursues the admittedly airy aims outlined in \u201cBuilding Global Community,\u201d the changes will echo across media and politics, and some are bound to be considered partisan. The risks are especially clear for changes aimed at adding layers of journalistic ethics across News Feed, which could transform the public\u2019s perception of Facebook, not to mention shake the foundations of its business.For the typical user, Cox explained when I met him on a morning in October at MPK20, News Feed is computing the relative merits of about 2,000 potential posts in your network every time you open the app. In sorting these posts, Facebook does not optimize for any single metric: not clicks or reading time or likes. Instead, he said, \u201cwhat you really want to get to is whether somebody, at the end of the day, would say, \u2018Hey, my experience today was meaningful.\u2019\u2009\u201d Personalizing News Feed, in other words, is a very big \u201cmath problem,\u201d incorporating countless metrics in extraordinarily complicated ways. Zuckerberg calls it \u201ca modern A.I. problem.\u201dLast summer, I sat in on two meetings in another glass-walled MPK20 conference room, in which News Feed\u2019s engineers, designers, user-research experts and managers debated several small alterations to how News Feed displays certain kinds of posts. The conversations were far from exciting \u2014 people in jeans on couches looking at PowerPoints, talking quietly about numbers \u2014 and yet I found them mesmerizing, a demonstration of the profound cultural differences between how news companies like The Times work and how Facebook does. The first surprise was how slowly things move, contrary to the freewheeling culture of \u201cthe hacker way.\u201d In one meeting, the team spent several minutes discussing the merits of bold text in a certain News Feed design. One blessing of making social software is that you can gauge any potential change to your product by seeing how your users react to it. That is also the curse: At Facebook, virtually every change to the app, no matter how small or obviously beneficial, is thoroughly tested on different segments of the audience before it\u2019s rolled out to everyone.The people who work on News Feed aren\u2019t making decisions that turn on fuzzy human ideas like ethics, judgment, intuition or seniority. They are concerned only with quantifiable outcomes about people\u2019s actions on the site. That data, at Facebook, is the only real truth. And it is a particular kind of truth: The News Feed team\u2019s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want \u2014 what they find \u201cmeaningful,\u201d to use Cox and Zuckerberg\u2019s preferred term \u2014 and to give them more of that.This ideal runs so deep that the people who make News Feed often have to put aside their own notions of what\u2019s best. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve all learned over the years is that our intuition can be wrong a fair amount of the time,\u201d John Hegeman, the vice president of product management and a News Feed team member, told me. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t expect will happen. And we learn a lot from that process: Why didn\u2019t that happen, and what might that mean?\u201d But it is precisely this ideal that conflicts with attempts to wrangle the feed in the way press critics have called for. The whole purpose of editorial guidelines and ethics is often to suppress individual instincts in favor of some larger social goal. Facebook finds it very hard to suppress anything that its users\u2019 actions say they want. In some cases, it has been easier for the company to seek out evidence that, in fact, users don\u2019t want these things at all.If a human editor ran News Feed, she would look at the clickbait scourge and make simple, intuitive fixes: Turn down the Upworthy knob. But Facebook approaches the feed as an engineering project rather than an editorial one. When it makes alterations in the code that powers News Feed, it\u2019s often only because it has found some clear signal in its data that users are demanding the change. In this sense, clickbait was a riddle. In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them? Was there something Facebook\u2019s algorithm was missing, some signal that would show that despite the clicks, clickbait was really sickening users?To answer these questions, Cox and his team hired survey panels of more than a thousand paid \u201cprofessional raters\u201d around the world who answer questions about how well News Feed is working. Starting in 2013, Facebook began adding first dozens and then hundreds and then thousands of data points that were meant to teach the artificial-intelligence system that runs News Feed how people were reacting to their feeds. Facebook noticed that people would sometimes click open a clickbaity story but spend very little time on it. In other cases, lots of people would click on a story but few would share or Like it. Headlines on stories that people seemed to reject often contained a set of signature phrases (\u201cyou\u2019ll never believe,\u201d \u201cthis one trick,\u201d etc.) or they came from a set of repeat-offender publishers.This approach \u2014 looking for signs of user dissatisfaction \u2014 could curb stories that constitute the most egregious examples of misinformation. Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s vice president in charge of News Feed, says that Facebook has begun testing an algorithm change that would look at whether people share an article after reading it. If few of the people who click on a story decide to share it, that might suggest people feel misled by it and it would get lower billing in the feed.But the solution to the broader misinformation dilemma \u2014 the pervasive climate of rumor, propaganda and conspiracy theories that Facebook has inadvertently incubated \u2014 may require something that Facebook has never done: ignoring the likes and dislikes of its users. Facebook believes the pope-endorses-Trump type of made-up news stories are only a tiny minority of pieces that appear in News Feed; they account for a fraction of 1 percent of the posts, according to Mosseri. The question the company faces now is whether the misinformation problem resembles clickbait at all, and whether its solutions will align as neatly with Facebook\u2019s worldview. Facebook\u2019s entire project, when it comes to news, rests on the assumption that people\u2019s individual preferences ultimately coincide with the public good, and that if it doesn\u2019t appear that way at first, you\u2019re not delving deeply enough into the data. By contrast, decades of social-science research shows that most of us simply prefer stuff that feels true to our worldview even if it isn\u2019t true at all and that the mining of all those preference signals is likely to lead us deeper into bubbles rather than out of them.\u201cAt some point, if they really want to address this, they have to say, \u2018This is good information\u2019 and \u2018This is bad information,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Emily Bell, the director for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School. \u201cThey have to say, \u2018These are the kinds of information sources that we want to privilege, and these others are not going to be banned from the platform, but they are not going to thrive.\u2019 In other words, they have to create a hierarchy, and they\u2019re going to have to decide how they\u2019re going to transfer wealth into the publishing market.\u201dDuring our first meeting in January, I posed this question to Zuckerberg: \u201cWhen you see various problems in the media, do you say to yourself, \u2018I run Facebook, I can solve that?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cUm,\u201d he started, and then paused, weighing his words as carefully as American presidents once did. \u201cNot usually.\u201d He argued that some of Facebook\u2019s critics\u2019 proposed fixes for news on the service, such as hiring editors, were impractical due to Facebook\u2019s scale and global diversity. Personalization, he said, remained a central tenet. \u201cIt really gets back to, like, what do people want at a deep level,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this oversimplified narrative that a company can get very successful by just scratching a very superficial itch, and I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s right over the long term.\u201dYet by our second meeting, Zuckerberg\u2019s position seemed to have evolved. Facebook had by then announced plans for the Facebook Journalism Project, in which the company would collaborate with news companies on new products. Facebook also created a project to promote \u201cnews literacy\u201d among its users, and it hired the former CNN news anchor Campbell Brown to manage the partnership between it and news companies. Zuckerberg\u2019s tone toward critics of Facebook\u2019s approach to news had also grown far more conciliatory. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to get to the core of the actual problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI also really think that the core social thing that needs to happen is that a common understanding needs to exist. And misinformation I view as one of the things that can possibly erode common understanding. But sensationalism and polarization and other things, I actually think, are probably even stronger and more prolific effects. And we have to work on all these things. I think we need to listen to all the feedback on this.\u201dStill, in both our conversation and his new manifesto, Zuckerberg remained preoccupied with the kind of problems that could be solved by the kind of hyperconnectivity he believed in, not the ones caused by it. \u201cThere\u2019s a social infrastructure that needs to get built for modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving more people oriented not just toward short-term things but toward building the long-term social infrastructure that needs to get built across all these things in order to enable people to come together is going to be a really important thing over the next decades.\u201d By way of example, he pointed to Safety Check, Facebook\u2019s system for letting people tell their friends that they\u2019ve survived some kind of dangerous event, like a natural disaster or terrorist attack.\u201cWe\u2019re getting to a point where the biggest opportunities I think in the world ... problems like preventing pandemics from spreading or ending terrorism, all these things, they require a level of coordination and connection that I don\u2019t think can only be solved by the current systems that we have,\u201d Zuckerberg told me. What\u2019s needed, he argues, is some global superstructure to advance humanity.This is not an especially controversial idea; Zuckerberg is arguing for a kind of digital-era version of the global institution-building that the Western world engaged in after World War II. But because he is a chief executive and not an elected president, there is something frightening about his project. He is positioning Facebook \u2014 and, considering that he commands absolute voting control of the company, he is positioning himself \u2014 as a critical enabler of the next generation of human society. A minor problem with his mission is that it drips with megalomania, albeit of a particularly sincere sort. With his wife, Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg has pledged to give away nearly all of his wealth to a variety of charitable causes, including a long-term medical-research project to cure all disease. His desire to take on global social problems through digital connectivity, and specifically through Facebook, feels like part of the same impulse.Yet Zuckerberg is often blas\u00e9 about the messiness of the transition between the world we\u2019re in and the one he wants to create through software. Building new \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d usually involves tearing older infrastructure down. If you manage the demolition poorly, you might undermine what comes next. In the case of the shattering media landscape, Zuckerberg seems finally to have at least noticed this problem and may yet come up with fixes for it. But in the meantime, Facebook rushes headlong into murky new areas, uncovering new dystopian possibilities at every turn.Just as quickly, though, Zuckerberg then pivoted to Facebook\u2019s next marvel, a system for digitally augmenting your pictures and videos. The technical term for this is \u201caugmented reality.\u201d The name bursts with dystopian possibilities \u2014 fake news on video rather than just text \u2014 but Zuckerberg never mentioned them.

Here\u2019s what we learned:Precipitation is heavier in April, he said, but there are more rainy days, on average, in May.This time of year, we\u2019re shifting from a drier, colder air mass in the winter to a warmer, more humid air mass in the summer, Mr. Homenuk explained. And as with anything, he said, \u201cWhen you go through a transition, you have to go through a rough patch.\u201dAnd the flowers?April showers are certainly good for flowers, but the aphorism leaves out two major factors that contribute to their blooming: temperatures and sun.And too many showers aren\u2019t good, either.\u201cIf it rains for a very long time, days in a row, the water sitting on top of the flowers can sometimes damage them,\u201d Ms. Schleiter said, \u201cso a little bit of sun and a little bit of breeze will help dry them out and bring them back to perfection.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:The new K Bridge will span 1,001 feet across the Newtown Creek and will replace the original bridge, which is 78 years old.For now, there will be six lanes on the bridge, three running in either direction.

{"Headline": "Steve Ballmer Serves Up a Fascinating Data Trove", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byDealBookGuess what Steven A. Ballmer has been up to for the last several years. (No, not just cheering for the basketball team he owns, the Los Angeles Clippers.) It\u2019s a novel project, and he plans to take the wrapping off it Tuesday.But first the back story, which is a valuable prelude to a description of the project itself.When Mr. Ballmer retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014, he was only 57 and quickly realized \u201cI don\u2019t, quote, \u2018have anything to do.\u2019\u201dAs he looked for a new endeavor \u2014 before he decided to buy the Clippers \u2014 his wife, Connie, encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic efforts, an idea he initially rejected.\u201cBut come on, doesn\u2019t the government take care of the poor, the sick, the old?\u201d Mr. Ballmer recalled telling her. After all, he pointed out, he happily paid a lot of taxes, and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net.Her answer: \u201cA, it won\u2019t, because there are things government doesn\u2019t get to, and B, you\u2019re missing it.\u201dMr. Ballmer replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201dThat conversation led Mr. Ballmer to pursue what may be one of the most ambitious private projects undertaken to answer a question that has long vexed the public and politicians alike. He sought to \u201cfigure out what the government really does with the money,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cWhat really happens?\u201dWant to know how many police officers are employed in various parts of the country and compare that against crime rates? Want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking tickets and the cost to collect? Want to know what percentage of Americans suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it? That\u2019s in there. You can slice the numbers in all sorts of ways.Mr. Ballmer calls it \u201cthe equivalent of a 10-K for government,\u201d referring to the kind of annual filing that companies make.\u201cYou know, when I really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing, Amazon or Apple, I\u2019d get their 10-K and read it,\u201d he told me in a recent interview in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s wonky, it\u2019s this, it\u2019s that, but it\u2019s the greatest depth you\u2019re going to get, and it\u2019s accurate.\u201dIn an age of fake news and questions about how politicians and others manipulate data to fit their biases, Mr. Ballmer\u2019s project may serve as a powerful antidote. Using his website, USAFacts.org, a person could look up just about anything: How much revenue do airports take in and spend? What percentage of overall tax revenue is paid by corporations? At the very least, it could settle a lot of bets made during public policy debates at the dinner table.\u201cI would like citizens to be able to use this to form intelligent opinions,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cPeople can disagree about what to do \u2014 I\u2019m not going to tell people what to do.\u201d But, he said, people ought to base their opinions \u201con common data sets that are believable.\u201dSo how exactly does one go about collecting and ordering the nation\u2019s data?Before he started, Mr. Ballmer was convinced someone must have already done this.His first instinct, naturally, was to go to a search engine. \u201cMy favorite one, of course: I go to Bing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, I check it with Google, just to make sure there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m missing.\u201dBut neither option led him to what he was looking for.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at federal, state and local together,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a citizen, I don\u2019t care whether I give my money to A, B or C. I just want to know how it lands, how it impacts what\u2019s going on.\u201dWith an unlimited budget, he went about hiring a team of researchers in Seattle and made a grant to the University of Pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together. Altogether, he has spent more than $10 million between direct funding and grants.\u201cLet\u2019s say it costs three, four, five million a year,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to fund the damn thing.\u201dFor Mr. Ballmer, the experience has been worth every cent simply for the surprises that he has discovered looking at the data.\u201cI love this one!\u201d he said, showing me a slide of information about government employees. \u201cDon\u2019t look, don\u2019t look!\u201d He instructed me to cover my eyes from the number at the bottom of the page.\u201cHow many people work for government in the United States?\u201d he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. \u201cAlmost 24 million. Would you have guessed that?\u201d\u201cThen people say, \u2018Those damn bureaucrats!\u2019\u201d Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. \u201cWell, let\u2019s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education \u2014 they are government employees.\u201d And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows.\u201cAnd you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?\u201d Mr. Ballmer continued. \u201cWell, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201dSuddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we\u2019re very glad to have.\u201cNow people might not think they\u2019re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people \u2014 and most of these people you like,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said.His other big surprises?\u201cMost of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said, referring to various efforts to fight poverty that he has supported. \u201cI mean it\u2019s funny, but I didn\u2019t realize all these not-for-profits were in a sense almost like government contractors.\u201dMr. Ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical. He has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle. But as he speaks, you can tell that some of his findings from the new data \u2014 which rebut his preconceptions \u2014 could change his own politics.At one point, as he showed me the value of certain tax deductions and blurted out, \u201cIf you look at these tax deductions for employer-provided health or for state and local taxes or mortgage-interest deductions, they\u2019re really subsidies to the affluent, which I guess I hadn\u2019t thought about them.\u201d\u201cTake the mortgage deduction,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes. That is worth, to a middle-income family, a hundred bucks a year. I was a little surprised by that. You can have your own reaction; I was a little surprised by that.\u201dOne rule Mr. Ballmer said his team made early on was to use only government data \u2014 no outside providers \u2014 to avoid accusations of bias. But this created its own challenges.For example, Mr. Ballmer, said: \u201cYou know it\u2019s not legal to know how many firearms that are in this country? The government is not allowed to collect the number.\u201dThere is data for the number of firearms manufactured, licenses, inspections, \u201calong with other data, but not a total,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t show it! I\u2019m shocked! But the N.R.A. apparently has lobbied in such a way government can\u2019t report the data.\u201dMr. Ballmer is hoping that the website is just the beginning. He hopes to open it up so that individuals and companies can build on top of it and pull out customized reports.\u201cWe\u2019re making philanthropic donations elsewhere \u2014 I think of this as another,\u201d he said, referring to himself and his wife. \u201cI don\u2019t even deduct this for my taxes. I pay this with after-tax money, no pretax money, because I don\u2019t want anybody being able to think that factors in. But I feel like it\u2019s a civic contribution more than anything else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Carolina\u2019s Dominance Fails to Cover Cheating\u2019s Stain", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported bySports of The TimesRival coaches bow as his acolytes.\u201cWhen it all shakes out,\u201d Gonzaga Coach Mark Few said, \u201che\u2019ll be one of the Mount Rushmore types in college coaching.\u201dI\u2019d genuflect myself, if only I could administer a mind wipe.Amid the blue-and-white pompoms, few are so rude as to mention that the University of North Carolina, the Microsoft of college basketball, remains enmeshed in a scandal of spectacular proportions. Put simply, for two decades until 2013, the university provided fake classes for many hundreds of student athletes, most of them basketball and football players.Coach Williams\u2019s longtime man Friday, Wayne Walden, a former academic counselor, played switchman, steering basketball players to these classes. A touch of plagiarism, a no-show, were O.K. if it gave the young man more time to work on his drop step. There was one goal: Keep those grade-point averages at the minimum needed to compete for the university.The N.C.A.A. gumshoes have recently awakened from their slumber and, in December, filed a tough set of accusations against the university, the latest in an investigation bending and twisting \u2014 some might say stalling \u2014 during the past few years.University officials take great umbrage at this. They claim to have investigated thoroughly. This is nonsense. I waded through their reports, and it was like watching a reluctant striptease.The first reports, declared definitive by top administrators, found a problem with a professor and an administrator in the department in question, African and Afro-American studies. No one else knew, not the athletic director, the dean, or the army of tutors and athletic support personnel. \u201cAberrant\u201d and \u201cirregular,\u201d the report\u2019s authors harrumphed. Sleepy N.C.A.A. officials signed off: No real scandal here; let\u2019s move on.Emails show, however, that behind the scenes, the university officials and board members knew that the misconduct extended deeper. The chairman of the Board of Governors wrote in an email that he had repeatedly asked administrators to purge people who were involved in \u201cfake classes.\u201d\u201cTheir inability to answer this basic question undermines their credibility,\u201d he wrote.It\u2019s important to stop here and bow in the direction of one newspaper, The News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., and its reporter on the story, Dan Kane, who took to the scent like the finest of bloodhounds. He exposed nearly every corruption, including the emails mentioned here.A historian, Jay Smith, has written a book, \u201cCheated,\u201d on this case, and recently taught a class: \u201cBig-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1956 to the Present.\u201d Students loved it; his classroom was filled. Last fall, the university canceled the class for a year.\u201cIt\u2019s very disillusioning to live through the last six years here,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cThe university is operating like a crime family, and it shows the lengths to which they will go to protect their athletic machine.\u201dAdministrators finally commissioned a thorough report by Kenneth Wainstein, a former United States assistant attorney general, in 2014. The dimensions of the scandal he unearthed were daunting.He reported that 3,100 students had received one or more semesters of lousy instruction and that poor work found reward in high grades. Student athletes, particularly those from the \u201crevenue sports\u201d \u2014 basketball and football \u2014 were steered to these poor or nonexistent courses, and in some cases, they were told they could sleep in class.Many shared in the dirty secrets.\u201cBeyond those university personnel who were aware of red flags,\u201d Wainstein wrote, \u201cthere were a large number among the Chapel Hill faculty, deans and athletics personnel, who knew that there were easy-grading classes with little rigor.\u201d\u201cLittle rigor\u201d is a term of art that begs for definition.Wainstein asked three outside experts to look at a sample of class papers. They found that in 40 percent of the papers, one-quarter or more of the content was plagiarized. The average grade for those papers was close to an A-minus.It is worth noting that The News & Observer unearthed concrete evidence of worse, which is to say that athletes were given classes and \u201cindependent studies\u201d that flat-out did not exist. And Rashad McCants, a former player on the Tar Heels\u2019 basketball team, said that tutors regularly wrote papers for students. A number of his teammates have disputed this.As always, mum was the word. Wainstein notes that many administrators \u201cmade a conscious decision not to ask questions\u201d about irregularities. Some faculty members took the role of useful fools, vigorously defending the indefensible.So the outlines of the mess came into focus. And the university dropped pretense. Last fall, its lawyers acknowledged that, yes, we have deeply flawed classes, but that is a matter for an accrediting organization. It is none of the N.C.A.A.\u2019s business. They argued that N.C.A.A. investigators had had their chance to unearth this years ago. They muffed it, and so, tough luck.\u201cWe\u2019ve worked collaboratively with the N.C.A.A. enforcement staff,\u201d said Bubba Cunningham, the university\u2019s director of athletics. \u201cWe have serious concerns about the process.\u201dCunningham is a man under much pressure. College sport, however, has its rewards. Last autumn, the university gave him a $60,000 raise, bringing his salary to $705,853.Woven into the issue are questions of race, and class, and the grotesque economics of big-time college sports.A few years back, Reginald Hildebrand, who is black and is a retired professor of history who taught in the department of African and Afro-American studies, wrote a searching essay. He pointed to evidence that, made-up classes aside, it was an otherwise rigorous department.He wrote of the fundamental conflict between the educational mission of a great university and \u201crunning a successful professional minor league franchise\u201d such as Tar Heels basketball. A good coach, he noted, for a revenue-producing sport is paid more than some entire departments. When athletics sets the priorities, one cannot help but corrode the other.Then there\u2019s the question of athletes who arrive at this elite university with often ragged academics.\u201cEverybody believes in affirmative action when it comes to the admission of athletes,\u201d Hildebrand wrote.North Carolina has made a show of addressing this, hiring a legion of tutors and note takers and building a 29,000-square-foot academic support center. This, Hildebrand notes, is done so that the athletes can survive in the classroom while never losing their focus on athletics, which is why they are at the university.The athletes could be pulled into the mainstream of the university, he wrote, but to do so would require many hours of extra study in those first semesters, and time away from sport.\u201cIt isn\u2019t that coaches don\u2019t really care about the welfare of the young men,\u201d Hildebrand noted. \u201cIt\u2019s just that they have millions of dollars at stake.\u201dSo we have a truth outburst. Few coaches of sound mind would think of echoing it. In October 2014, reporters asked Williams about the N.C.A.A. investigation. He sighed.\u201cIt\u2019s been a pain in the rear end,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel strongly, strongly, that we did things the right way.\u201dHe was strongly incorrect. Then again, he makes $2 million a year and got more than $500,000 for making it to the Final Four. So what do I know?The expired are more honest. Butch Davis was fired as football coach in 2011 during the investigation into the academics of his program.The Wainstein report described his awakening when he arrived at Chapel Hill in 2006: \u201cHe quickly realized that there was lots of talk about the importance of academics without anything to back up that talk. He found Chapel Hill\u2019s attitude toward student-athlete academics to be like an Easter egg: Beautiful and impressive to the outside world but without much life inside.\u201dEmail: powellm@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Movers: Dan Loeb Takes Aim at Honeywell", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byWe\u2019re following major developments in the markets throughout the day. Check below for the latest updates.Third Point, the $16 billion activist hedge fund run by Dan Loeb, has taken aim at the technology and manufacturing company Honeywell International. In a letter just issued to investors, Third Point urges Honeywell to spin off its aerospace unit.Such a spinoff, Third Point argues, would result in a \u201csustained increase in shareholder value\u201d of more than $20 billion and would prevent Honeywell from trading at a \u201csubstantial discount\u201d to its peer group of companies, as it does now.\u25a0 Amazon reported first-quarter revenue and profit that exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates, a result of sustained growth in online retail sales and its profitable cloud business, sending the company\u2019s shares up more than 4 percent in extended trading on Thursday.The company\u2019s net income rose to $4.80 billion, or 61 cents per share, in the third quarter ended March 31, from $3.76 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.Ford\u2019s stock was down more than 1 percent in midday trading.The company\u2019s revenue grew by 4 percent to $39 billion, but it said its vehicle sales and market share dropped from the same period a year earlier. Ford executives acknowledged that the company needed to retrench as it prepared to deliver several promising new sport-utility models this year in the American and Chinese markets.As has been the case for several years, Ford\u2019s North American operations were the source of the bulk of its earnings. The company reported a pretax profit of $2 billion in the region, primarily from sales of its pickup trucks and S.U.V.s in the United States.Its international operations posted mixed results, with pretax earnings of $176 million in Europe and $124 million in Asia, and losses of $244 million in South America and $80 million in the Middle East and Africa.The bank said on Thursday that net earnings had more than doubled, to 575 million euros, or $627 million, from a year earlier. But revenue fell 9 percent to \u20ac7.3 billion.And despite frothy stock markets, Deutsche Bank\u2019s revenue from trading in equities fell 10 percent in the quarter. Revenue from sales and trading of bonds and other debt \u2014 traditionally the bank\u2019s strong suit \u2014 rose 11 percent, but analysts judged that performance inferior to those of rivals like Bank of America or Citigroup.\u201cRelative to the U.S. banks, this is a weak outcome,\u201d analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note to clients.The news sent Lloyds shares up 3 percent in early trading on Thursday.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to knowledge of Third Point\u2019s stake in Honeywell. The stake was listed in Third Point\u2019s last regulatory filing; it is not the case that the stake had not previously been disclosed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Zeal for China Dims, Global Companies Complain More Boldly", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 When Amazon announced its entry into the Chinese cloud computing market last year, Chinese state media celebrated it as \u201ca strong signal\u201d that \u201cthere is tremendous room for foreign firms to expand in the Chinese market as long as they comply with local regulations.\u201dToday, cloud computing is the latest area of contention between China and increasingly frustrated global companies.In late March, a group of more than 50 American lawmakers sent a letter to the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, taking direct aim at China\u2019s restrictions on cloud computing. They wrote that current and draft regulations would force the transfer of valuable intellectual property to Chinese companies and effectively bar foreign cloud service providers \u201cfrom operating or competing fairly in China.\u201d\u201cAs we see it,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, \u201cthese restrictions are fundamentally protectionist and anticompetitive.\u201d Many of the lawmakers hail from states where two major cloud computing players, Amazon and Microsoft, have operations.Big global companies, which have long worked to keep from rocking the boat in China, are showing a bit more tolerance for making waves. The business groups that represent them have become more critical of China\u2019s industrial policies and ambitions. Businesses are increasingly complaining to friendly lawmakers, and those lawmakers have become more vocal on their behalf.Profiles in courage are still hard to find, as businesses fear Chinese retaliation if they complain directly or too loudly. For example, among the companies that would benefit most from any shift in China\u2019s cloud computing regulations, Microsoft, through a spokesman, declined to comment, and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.The shift is also a gradual one, taking place in the years since the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, as the promise of a more open China faded. Still, people in business circles in China say the sense of disappointment in China\u2019s business prospects is growing.\u201cThe enthusiasm is gone,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. \u201cForeign businesses here used to be very excited about China and quite enthusiastic. Now, it\u2019s kind of a grind and a battle.\u201dChina remains a lucrative market for foreign-branded cars, iPhones, high-value engineering equipment and other costly items. Still, the growing frustration has muddled the corporate response to President Trump\u2019s tough anti-China rhetoric.\u201cThere are companies, which in prior years have been strong supporters in Washington of the U.S.-China relationship, who are much quieter, and even waiting to see if a tougher approach might get more results with China,\u201d said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council.\u201cIf the United States gives concessions in the trade area so that we don\u2019t push as hard on leveling the playing field in all these different areas,\u201d Mr. Zarit said at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday, \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame.\u201dIn public, businesses work hard to strike a sunny note. Last November, Jay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for global corporate affairs and former White House spokesman, made no mention of his company\u2019s challenges there when speaking at China\u2019s World Internet Conference, according to a Chinese-language transcript of his remarks in state media.That reticence has bred frustration among some United States officials. In 2015, President Barack Obama told the Business Roundtable, a business group, regarding its complaints about China, \u201cDon\u2019t tell us on the side, \u2018We\u2019ve got this problem, you need to look into it, but then \u2014 but leave our names out of it.\u2019\u201dStill, executives say complaining can have an impact. Earlier that same year, Mr. Obama publicly criticized proposed Chinese rules that would require technology companies to turn over encryption keys to Chinese authorities. His administration had also expressed concern about Chinese draft regulations that would require China\u2019s financial sector buy only from \u201csecure and controllable\u201d suppliers, which trade groups said effectively meant Chinese companies. In both cases China relented, temporarily scrapping the banking laws and tempering the language in the antiterrorism law.Some intermediaries between business and China are pushing the government to do even more.\u201cCountries need to be persuaded. Words don\u2019t do it,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former United States ambassador to China, adding that the United States needs to use \u201cproperly targeted\u201d leverage.\u201cI don\u2019t think the United States has done much of that,\u201d Mr. Baucus said. \u201cWe need to have a more strategic economic approach to China.\u201dHe said Mr. Obama had raised the issue of American companies\u2019 unequal access to the Chinese market repeatedly with Beijing, but these appeals were \u201cinsufficient.\u201dOf all the sectors that China has set its sights on, tech has come under the most pressure. Services like Facebook and Twitter have long been blocked. Last November, China passed a cybersecurity law that would impose security checks on companies in industries like finance and communications and mandatory in-country data storage. In 2015, the American chip maker Qualcomm said it would pay $975 million for violating China\u2019s antimonopoly law. In 2016, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. In the same year, China said it would demand answers to new questions about Microsoft\u2019s business practices in the country.In cloud computing, China mandates that foreign companies work with a local partner, and the foreign companies are subject to equity restrictions that prevent them from owning a controlling stake in the cloud company. New draft regulations would make it even more difficult for them to get licenses for operation, block them from using their brands and logos to market their services and require them to \u201cterminate the transmission of\u201d and report any information posted or transmitted by users that \u201cviolates relevant Chinese laws and regulations.\u201dIn China, the cloud computing market is estimated to be worth $20 billion by 2020, up from $1.5 billion in 2013, according to the consulting group Bain. Both Amazon and Microsoft operate in China through partnerships with local companies. In contrast, Aliyun, the cloud services unit of the Chinese web giant Alibaba, has its own data centers in the United States.For decades, Western companies have stood with China even during rocky moments in the Sino-American relationship. When Congress threatened to revoke China\u2019s most-favored-nation trading status in the 1990s because of concerns over human rights, the American Chamber of Commerce in China, or AmCham, headed to Washington to defend Beijing.More recently, the complaints from Western companies have gotten louder, as China\u2019s economic growth slows and unease grows about Beijing\u2019s failure to deliver on its promise to open markets for foreign companies as well as its Made in China 2025 plan to push for greater self-sufficiency in several industries. AmCham\u2019s 2016 survey of its members showed that 81 percent of its companies felt less welcome in China than before, up from 77 percent in 2015. The survey also showed that 31 percent of its members said the investment environment was deteriorating \u2014 the most pessimistic response AmCham has received since it started asking the question in 2011.\u201cChina\u2019s heavy emphasis on building global champions through industrial policies is spiking new levels of concern about China\u2019s commitment to a mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d said Jeremie Waterman, senior director for the Greater China region for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Mr. Zarit, of AmCham, said a \u201cmixed bag\u201d of companies were unhappy about the investment climate in China, adding that \u201cthey are afraid if anything is done, it will upset the apple cart.\u201dMr. Zarit, who led a delegation of eight former AmCham chairmen to meet with the Trump administration officials in Washington in February, said there was a new realization in Washington \u201cthat this asymmetrical commercial relationship needs to be addressed in some way.\u201dMr. McGregor, who was on the trip, said they met Peter Navarro, a strident China critic in charge of trade and industrial policy, and Matthew Pottinger, Mr. Trump\u2019s top Asia policy maker. There, the delegation pushed the concept of reciprocity, meaning that if American companies are bound by restrictions in China, their Chinese counterparts should be subject to the same limits in the United States.Mr. McGregor said the idea got \u201cquite a bit of traction.\u201d He added, \u201cOur attitude is China should be treated as an equal, and an equal needs reciprocity.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Facebook Loses Appeal to Block Bulk Search Warrants", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byNew York State\u2019s highest court dealt a blow to Facebook and other social media companies seeking to expand privacy protections, ruling on Tuesday that Facebook had no right to ask an appellate court to quash search warrants ordering the company to hand over information from hundreds of accounts in a disability fraud case.The state Court of Appeals, in a 5-to-1 decision, with one judge recusing himself, upheld lower court rulings that New York law does not allow a social media company to appeal a judge\u2019s decision to issue search warrants in a criminal case, even if the company believes those warrants violate the constitutional rights of its users.The Facebook case is part of a broader battle between the government and technology companies over the limits on law enforcement requests for data under the federal Stored Communications Act. Much of that fight is playing out in New York.The ruling was a setback for civil libertarians and social media companies hoping the court might create new legal guidelines for search warrants aimed at seizing all the information in electronic accounts, treating them more like civil subpoenas, which can be challenged as overly broad before they are executed.But Judge Leslie E. Stein, writing for the majority, said state courts had held for decades that search warrants issued by judges cannot be appealed to a higher court. Instead, they may be challenged by a defendant only during a pretrial hearing, as illegal searches.\u201cIndeed, to hold otherwise would be to impermissibly and judicially create a right to appeal in a criminal matter that has not been authorized by our Legislature,\u201d Judge Stein wrote in her 25-page decision.She acknowledged that Facebook had presented the court with \u201cnovel and important substantive issues regarding the constitutional rights of privacy and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure\u201d but said the court was \u201cconstrained by law\u201d to dismiss the company\u2019s appeal. Because search warrants cannot be appealed, she said, the court did not need to rule on Facebook\u2019s central contention \u2014 that the warrants were so sweeping they amounted to an unconstitutional search.One judge dissented: Judge Rowan D. Wilson, who argued that the federal law authorizing the warrants \u2014 the Stored Communications Act of 1986 \u2014 did not distinguish between warrants and subpoenas. In his reading, that statute gives service providers a right to appeal all overly broad court orders, including search warrants. \u201cState rules of procedures applicable to garden-variety warrants cannot be used as a device to contravene or frustrate federal law,\u201d he wrote.Judge Wilson noted that the framers of the State Constitution in 1938 had specifically warned against the invasion of privacy in electronic communications. \u201cThe New York Constitution commands us to guard vigilantly against that evil,\u201d he said. He characterized the warrants as \u201cauthorizing the seizure of private information en masse,\u201d including deleted content and content shared by users not under investigation.The case \u2014 known formally as In Re 381 Search Warrants Directed to Facebook Inc. \u2014 had been closely watched as a test as Facebook sought to expand its ability to fight what it sees as fishing expeditions by prosecutors. Several tech giants, including Google, LinkedIn, Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter, filed amicus briefs, as did the New York Civil Liberties Union.The search warrants were signed in 2013 by Justice Melissa C. Jackson on the strength of a 96-page affidavit that has never been made public. In an unusual procedure, Facebook moved to quash the warrants, saying they were too broad and objecting to the judge\u2019s order prohibiting the company from telling its clients about them.Judge Jackson denied the motion, saying Facebook, as a service provider, could not argue the searches were unconstitutional on behalf of its clients, any more than a landlord could stop the police with a warrant from searching a storage facility. She also said there was enough evidence of fraud to justify the mass warrants.The warrants ordered Facebook to turn over all of the information in the accounts of 381 people, including private photos and conversations. That information was used by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to obtain indictments for disability fraud against more than 130 police officers and other former public employees. None of the people indicted challenged the search warrants.Mr. Vance personally argued the case before the court, underscoring its importance to his office, which has used private information in Facebook accounts not only as evidence of the enormous disability fraud scheme but also to help make conspiracy cases against hundreds of members of street gangs in housing projects.One of the concurring judges, Jenny Rivera, wrote a separate opinion, saying she agreed with the majority but on the narrower grounds that Facebook had not made the right arguments under federal law for quashing the warrants: that they would cause an undue burden and harm its business. Judge Rivera said she agreed with Judge Wilson that the federal law permitted Facebook to appeal a judge\u2019s decision on search warrants to a higher court.Jay Nancarrow, a spokesman for Facebook, said the company had yet to decide whether to take its case to the federal courts.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the court\u2019s ruling,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are encouraged to see the thorough dissent that supports Facebook\u2019s position arguing for people\u2019s online privacy.\u201dDonna Leiberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said she was heartened the court ruled only on procedural grounds, leaving the constitutional battle for another day.\u201cThis ruling does not reject our important claim that the state and federal Constitution do not permit district attorneys to rummage around in people\u2019s Facebook accounts like they did here,\u201d Ms. Leiberman said.Vindu Goel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s \u2018Hire American\u2019 Order May Affect Tech Worker Visas", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byThe order makes no immediate changes to work visa programs but tells the Departments of Labor, Justice, Homeland Security and State to study existing laws and procedures and recommend changes.In the case of one program, H-1B temporary visas, the order directs the agencies to suggest changes to help ensure that the visas are awarded to the most skilled, best-paid immigrant workers. \u201cRight now, H-1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery, and that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the signing in Kenosha, Wis.The order also calls for a crackdown on fraud and abuse in the current system of work visas \u2014 which the agencies had already signaled they would do.What is the H-1B program, and why is the president focused on it?The H-1B program grants 65,000 work visas a year to foreigners, with 20,000 more visas granted to foreigners with advanced degrees and an unlimited number of extra visas available for universities, teaching hospitals and other nonprofit organizations. The program is aimed at highly skilled workers, and most of the visas are awarded to technology companies, although other specialty industries such as fashion also use the visas. (Melania Trump, the first lady, worked as a model on an H-1B visa.)Under federal law, employers that use a large number of H-1B workers are supposed to document that they tried to hire Americans for the jobs. All H-1B employers are also required to pay prevailing wages to the immigrant workers who receive the visas.Labor Department data shows that about 40 percent of the visas go to entry-level workers and another 40 percent go to people with limited experience and skills. The Trump administration says that more of the jobs performed by those people could and should be filled by Americans.How are the visas allocated?Visa applications must be sponsored by employers. Every April 1, the government begins accepting applications for the next fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. This year, the government received 199,000 H-1B applications in the first five days and then stopped accepting them.Because there are more applicants than visas, the visas are awarded by lottery. Each visa is good for three years and can be renewed for three more years. Immigrants who are applying for a permanent residency visa, known as a green card, can typically stay longer while waiting for approval.In 2015, President Obama expanded the program to allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to also work in the United States, but in a recent court filing, the Trump administration said it was reviewing that policy.It is not clear exactly how many foreigners are in the United States on H-1B visas, but analysts estimate 650,000 to 900,000. In recent years, about 70 percent of the visas have been issued to citizens of India.Who employs these H-1B visa holders?The biggest employers are India-based outsourcing companies like Wipro Technologies, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Tata Consultancy Services. These firms contract with banks, health care companies and other businesses to handle various computing tasks and bring in thousands of immigrants to do the work. Outsourcing companies based in the United States, particularly IBM and Cognizant, also use large numbers of H-1B workers.The leading American technology companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple, employ thousands of H-1B workers. Two companies, Facebook and the chip maker Qualcomm, are heavily dependent on H-1B visas, with at least 15 percent of their American workforces holding the visas, according to federal filings. Thousands of Silicon Valley start-ups also hire some H-1B workers.How do these foreign workers contribute to the American economy?American technology companies argue that there is a shortage of qualified Americans for scientific and programming jobs, forcing them to turn overseas for workers to meet their hiring needs.In addition, immigrants or their children have played key roles in founding many technology companies, including giants like Apple, Google and Intel and up-and-comers like WhatsApp and Airbnb.The Indian outsourcers, which generally pay lower wages and operate in a different part of the technology ecosystem, say they are helping American companies cut spending on certain basic services so they can keep employing higher-paid workers in other parts of their businesses. R. Chandrashekhar, the president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies, a group that represents the Indian technology industry, says that more than three-quarters of the Fortune 500, America\u2019s largest companies by sales, use the Indian outsourcers for some operations.\u201cThese services play a critical role in ensuring that corporate America remains a job-creation engine,\u201d Mr. Chandrashekhar said.Still, Indian outsourcing companies are preparing for a world of fewer visas, shifting the work to people in India and other countries.Are American workers hurt by immigrant work visa programs?Some studies suggest that universities grant technology degrees to more than enough American students to fill all the open jobs in the United States, so critics of the visas say the program is unnecessary. Silicon Valley companies often do not cast a wide net for American job candidates. Instead, they compete to hire the same graduates of the top colleges for many jobs and rely heavily on immigrants to fill out their workforces.Under the H-1B program, all companies have to attest that they are paying foreign workers prevailing wages and that their existing workers will not be adversely affected, said Russ Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, the American branch of IEEE, the largest professional association for computer scientists and electrical engineers. \u201cBut all you have to do is check a box.\u201dForeign workers can also be abused by the visa programs. The H-1B visa is tied to a specific employer, which means the visa holder cannot easily change jobs. Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, who has long pushed for changes, said some H-1B holders earned less than their stated salaries because they were forced to repay their employer for various expenses, such as travel.What changes are under consideration for visa programs?The government will also publicly release more data about other visa programs, such as the L-1, which allows workers officially employed overseas by a company to work in the United States. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many L-1s are here, who employs them, where they are located and what they are paid,\u201d said Ronil Hira, an associate professor of political science at Howard University who has extensively studied immigrant visa programs.Many in Congress support changing the H-1B lottery system to give preference to the highest-paying jobs. \u201cWe should allocate visas based on who wants to pay the highest salary to avoid undercutting the wages of American workers,\u201d said Ms. Lofgren, who has sponsored one of several bills on the topic.Such a change would favor established American technology companies, which tend to pay high wages, and hurt the outsourcing companies, which hire immigrants to do more basic work at lower wages. But there is a risk of collateral damage to start-ups, which pay less in cash but award stock to new hires, and to hospitals, which recruit immigrants for nursing and other nontech jobs.Changes to work visas could also be wrapped into a broader immigration bill. Mr. Trump recently told members of Congress that he was open to discussing that approach.An article on April 19 about President Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d order referred incorrectly to the application process for employers seeking to hire H-1B workers. The employers must attest that they are paying the foreign workers prevailing wages and that the working conditions of existing workers will not be adversely affected. They do not have to attest that they tried to find an American first. This correction was delayed because the error was pointed out to editors only recently.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Changes to Tech Worker Visas Are Cosmetic. For Now.", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byThe announcements came as the government began accepting applications on Monday for H-1B visas that will be issued for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.How do the announcements change the government\u2019s policies toward foreign workers?The changes are more cosmetic than substantive. Visas for entry-level computer jobs have already been getting more scrutiny from immigration officials, and the Justice Department is reminding companies to follow the law.Still, critics of the H-1B program say the Justice Department\u2019s warning to companies not to discriminate against Americans might lead to enforcement action.\u201cIf the Department of Justice concludes that these companies are discriminating against Americans, the entire outsourcing model becomes deeply suspect,\u201d said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, a group that represents American tech workers.Why is the H-1B program important? H-1B visas are commonly used by companies to bring foreign workers to the United States to fill technical positions like software developers. Some tech companies say they need foreign workers because they cannot find enough Americans with the skills for these jobs.How do the new policies affect Microsoft, Facebook and other big American technology companies? The large tech companies are unlikely to be affected much in the near term, immigration lawyers and technology executives said. Technology companies usually apply for H-1B visas when they need to fill a job with higher-skilled workers holding bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees.William Moss, a spokesman for Intel, said the chip maker does not expect any impact from the change. \u201cIntel\u2019s foreign national population in the U.S. is largely comprised of individuals possessing unique and difficult to find skills which can only be acquired through advanced-degree, university-level education,\u201d Mr. Moss said.What about the Indian outsourcing firms? Indian outsourcing firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and Infosys get a large number of H-1B visas, as do outsource companies that are based in America, such as I.B.M. and Cognizant.Although they do hire some entry-level programmers, they have been shifting their hiring to higher-skilled and better paid workers.Benjamin Trounson, a spokesman for Tata Consultancy Services, said the company has cut back on its use of H-1B visas in the past few years, receiving only 1,500 in 2016.Why is this happening now?On Monday, the federal government began accepting applications for next year\u2019s visas. Demand for the H-1B visas so far exceeds the supply that the government is likely to cut off applications within a week, and visas will be awarded by lottery. Congress allows for 65,000 H-1Bs each year, with an additional 20,000 for workers possessing a master\u2019s degree or higher.The Trump administration may be using the moment to discourage what its views as abuse of the work visa.\u201cThe timing is not coincidental,\u201d said Ted Ruthizer, an immigration lawyer with Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to show a mastery of the situation, that they know what companies are up to with H-1Bs and they\u2019re not going to let them get away with any shenanigans.\u201dAre more changes coming that could affect the technology sector?

{"Headline": "Trump Inaugural Drew Big Dollars From Donors With Vested Interests", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byThe casino magnate and philanthropist Sheldon G. Adelson wants some big things from the Trump administration: banning the online poker sites that compete with his luxury casinos, for example, and moving the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.And while President Trump was not Mr. Adelson\u2019s first choice during the Republican primary season last year, he has been generous since: The billionaire donated $5 million to the committee organizing Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration festivities \u2014 the largest single contribution given to any president\u2019s inaugural committee.The stream of money is a striking contrast to the way Mr. Trump funded his campaign, chiefly with small donations and his own fortune. While some big checks for the inauguration came from longtime Trump friends and associates, much of the money came from the industries that have traditionally excelled at wielding Washington influence: telecommunications, tobacco and pharmaceutical giants, which have bankrolled presidential inaugurations for Republicans and Democrats alike. And a generous amount came from people who had been hostile to his candidacy.If the crowds at Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing-in celebrations were relatively small, the checks paying for all the nonofficial festivities were not: Freed of many of the voluntary restrictions adopted by Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors, 48 people or corporations gave $1 million or more, according to the disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission. Besides Mr. Adelson, they included a trust controlled by the coal industry billionaire Joseph W. Craft III; the parent company of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; and Robert Mercer, the billionaire investor and close ally of Stephen K. Bannon, a White House adviser.The donor rolls also included a host of blue-chip American companies, like Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Intel, Google and Bank of America, which contribute significant sums regardless of the incoming president\u2019s political party.\u201cDuring the campaign, he attacked over and over again precisely these kinds of huge contributions,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, the president of the watchdog group Democracy 21 and a longtime advocate of tighter campaign finance rules. \u201cHe also said he knew from personal experience that you can buy influence with politicians by making these kinds of contributions. That didn\u2019t seem to bother him in raising ridiculous amounts of money to pay for the inauguration.\u201dBoeing, the country\u2019s biggest exporter, made a million-dollar contribution in January. This month, Boeing won a major victory when Mr. Trump abandoned his campaign pledge to eliminate the Export-Import Bank, which has provided billions in loan guarantees to help Boeing\u2019s overseas customers finance plane purchases.Central to the money-raising effort was Thomas Barrack Jr., a private equity investor who is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest and oldest friends. It was Mr. Barrack who hosted one of Mr. Trump\u2019s first major fund-raisers at his home in Santa Monica, Calif., last May, and who spoke in Cleveland the night Mr. Trump accepted the Republican nomination. As inaugural chairman, Mr. Barrack was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s chief liaisons to those business executives who had kept him at arm\u2019s length.Contributions to the festivities were not intended to accrue favor with the new president, Mr. Barrack said in a text message, but were made \u201cin support of the coming together of our country and its people to commemorate the cornerstone of our American democratic process.\u201dBut the democratic process moves along more quickly for some than for others. While Mr. Trump promised during the campaign to give Medicare and Medicaid the power to negotiate prices they pay for prescription drugs, two of the biggest drugmakers, Pfizer and Amgen, gave a combined $1.5 million in December.Amgen\u2019s chief executive was among the industry executives who attended a February meeting with Mr. Trump. After entering the meeting promising to do something \u201cto get prices down,\u201d Mr. Trump exited with a more industry-friendly line, saying he would oppose \u201cprice-fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare.\u201d (A White House spokesman later said Mr. Trump remained in favor of negotiating prices.)Few industries have stood to gain as much under Mr. Trump as private prison operators, and they gave generously to his inauguration. Two of the largest such companies, the Corrections Corporation of America, now known as CoreCivic, and the GEO Group, each contributed $250,000.For many Washington interests and for large donors \u2014 particularly those who had not anticipated a Trump victory or had no relationship with his insurgent campaign, or had actively opposed him \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural was an easy way to make inroads with the president-elect.The Ansary family, prominent Iranian-Americans in Dallas who are longtime allies of the Bushes, gave $2 million to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Paul Singer, the billionaire Republican investor who opposed Mr. Trump and once predicted that his policies were \u201cclose to a guarantee of a global depression,\u201d donated $1 million on Dec. 6.The two have mended fences recently. In February, Mr. Singer visited Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, and Mr. Trump declared afterward that \u201cnow he\u2019s a very strong ally and I appreciate that.\u201dMr. Zuberi is now making inroads in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle. After making the donation, he earned a coveted spot at the Chairman\u2019s Global Dinner, a pre-inauguration, black-tie gathering intended to introduce the incoming president to the foreign diplomatic corps. A photo from the event shows Mr. Zuberi in conversation with Mr. Trump and other guests.Mr. Zuberi did not return a phone call seeking comment.Because inaugural committees face few of the regulations that limit campaign fund-raising, each administration sets its own restrictions.George W. Bush, for example, capped gifts at $100,000 for his first inaugural and at $250,000 for his second. Mr. Obama accepted gifts up to only $50,000 in 2009, while banning all gifts from lobbyists and corporations altogether. He loosened those restrictions in 2013, accepting corporate gifts up to $1 million and individual gifts up to $250,000.Just what other perks and souvenirs their donations helped pay for will probably remain a mystery. While donations must be reported, the Federal Election Commission does not require inaugural committees to account for what they spend or how much is left in their coffers when the revelers head home.Mr. Trump\u2019s committee said it was still identifying charities toward which it would direct leftover money.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Elections Like Georgia\u2019s Help Predict Future Races?", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byThe congressional election in Georgia this week was billed as having potential national implications, as an early test of whether anti-Trump energy could fuel Democratic victory in a traditionally Republican district. It seems likely that the same will be said for scattered upcoming special elections in other states.But political scientists and pollsters who analyze races for a living say that so-called bellwether races are tricky to evaluate \u2014 if they even exist at all.Edward R. Tufte, a professor of political science and statistics at Yale who wrote a landmark paper on the subject in 1975, was brief in his response to a question about the validity of using such races to predict the results of midterm elections in 2018.\u201cBellwethers only exist after the fact, are astrology, and indicate only that it\u2019s a slow day at the national news desk,\u201d he wrote in an email.Other experts were more circumspect. While races for seats like the Sixth Congressional District in Georgia this week, the Fourth District in Kansas last week and the coming election for Montana\u2019s sole House seat in May do not necessarily have predictive power, they said, the outcomes could serve as a finger in the wind for the political conditions that President Trump\u2019s administration has imposed on the country.David Rothschild, an economist at the Microsoft Research Lab who studies forecasting and public sentiment, said that elections like those in Georgia give experts actual voting data, a contrast to the stream of polling and punditry that usually animates political conversation.While cautioning that the election result could not be mapped onto future races (\u201cthey call it a special election for a reason\u201d), he said the results in Georgia were meaningful. The election on Tuesday pitted 18 candidates against one another, but Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, managed to receive 48.1 percent in a heavily Republican district. He will face Karen Handel, a Republican who won just under 20 percent of the vote, in a runoff in June.\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable to get really excited and to try to extrapolate from mid-midterm elections because it gives us an outcome variable,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of polling and a lot of loose talk is great, but we like action, we like outcomes, and these are outcomes.But David Paleologos, the director of the political research center at Suffolk University in Massachusetts, said that national analyses were often in danger of missing facts on the ground, viewing candidates as vessels of broader Democratic and Republican ideologies, rather than politicians with distinct views informed by local issues.He recalled the Massachusetts special election of Senator Scott Brown, who defeated the Democratic candidate, Martha Coakley, in January 2010. When Mr. Brown came from behind to surpass Ms. Coakley forecasters took it as a signal that other long-held Democratic seats in Massachusetts were about to fall. But it didn\u2019t turn out that way.\u201cBrown\u2019s race turned up a big fat zero goose egg for the Republican Party in the congressional races that year,\u201d Mr. Paleologos recalled. \u201cAnd four of the 10 races were decided by less than 35,000 votes but every Democrat prevailed.\u201dHe concluded that \u201cit was not fair for people to report it as this big Obama backlash that Brown was riding,\u201d and said that Ms. Coakley herself \u201cbore the brunt of responsibility\u201d for the loss.However, as Mr. Paleologos said, Mr. Brown\u2019s election could have been viewed as a more general indicator of a surge in conservative fortunes. Republican lawmakers, many of them fueled by the Tea Party movement, took 63 seats in Congress and recaptured the majority, a sea change in American politics. Even some Republican incumbents were swept away in the change.Could Mr. Ossof\u2019s strong showing on Tuesday represent a similar shift in the tide, but for the left?And if the atmosphere that led Mr. Thompson to be so competitive in Kansas held into next year, Mr. Wang said, then \u201cDemocrats would have as large a majority in the House of Representatives as they did when Barack Obama was first elected in 2008.\u201d\u201cIs that going to hold up? There\u2019s no telling,\u201d he added. \u201cBut what it does is, it shows what is possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Sunday, Prince Hamdan shared a video on Twitter that presented it as a powerful tool for self-expression.\u201cExpression knows no boundaries or limits,\u201d the video said. \u201cExpression is strength and freedom. It defines who you are.\u201dA spokesman for Microsoft did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Sunday.What it does have is wealth, derived largely from its role as a global business hub. On Twitter, the crown prince described the new font as an important step toward elevating the country\u2019s global business profile. He did not explain how exactly that would work.Human rights activists have accused the U.A.E. of using its great wealth to silence dissent and present a positive image of itself to the outside world.
