{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos Says He Is Selling $1 Billion a Year in Amazon Stock to Finance Race to Space", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byCOLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 Standing against the backdrop of his New Shepard rocket booster and a full-scale mock capsule for carrying humans into space, Jeff Bezos revealed on Wednesday that he was selling about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company.Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, showed off the reusable rocket booster and the mock-up of the capsule that will take people up for panoramic views back down at earth, during a symposium here.Mr. Bezos, who hopes to build Blue Origin into a commercial and tourist venture, also disclosed that it would cost about $2.5 billion to develop an even bigger rocket, New Glenn, capable of lifting satellites and, eventually, people into orbit.Like his fellow technology titan Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, Mr. Bezos has identified reusable rocket parts as a key to lowering the price of admission to the field, which he said on Wednesday would lead to a \u201cgolden age of space exploration.\u201d\u201cIf we can make access to space low-cost, then entrepreneurs will be unleashed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see creativity, you will see dynamism, you will see the same thing in space that I\u2019ve witnessed on the internet in the last 20 years.\u201dMr. Bezos has repeatedly expressed caution about setting timetables for the start of Blue Origin\u2019s commercial or passenger trips, and he did not diverge from that on Wednesday. He would not say when New Shepard would undergo its next round of test flights, or set a specific date as a goal, merely mentioning next year for possible tourist trips.\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to race to a deadline when you\u2019re talking about a flying vehicle, especially one that you\u2019re going to put people on,\u201d he said. \u201cI still think we can do commercial paying passengers in 2018.\u201dAsked how much passengers would pay, Mr. Bezos said he did not know yet, but he predicted ticket prices would decline as spaceflight became more common. (Hundreds of people have already put down deposits to reserve places on similar commercial trips on Virgin Galactic that could cost $250,000 a ticket, although that company\u2019s spaceplane has yet to take anyone up.)New Shepard is a modest start for Mr. Bezos\u2019s ambitions to tap into the nascent space tourism market. It is a single-stage booster with a capsule on top that is designed to carry six passengers at a time on trips of about 10 to 11 minutes.There will not be a Blue Origin crew on the spacecraft. Passengers wearing sleek jumpsuits will be able to peer out what the company says will be the largest windows in space, taking up about one-third of the surface area of the dome.About 12 feet in diameter, the passenger capsule holds six black seats that resemble recliners, with panels offering details about altitude and other features of a trip.The engine that powers the booster produces up to about 110,000 pounds of thrust.On ascent, passengers will experience forces of about 3 Gs, about three times the normal force of gravity that humans experience on earth. When the booster reaches a certain altitude, the capsule will detach and coast above the Karman line, which is 62 miles above sea level, officially entering into space.There, the passengers will experience about four to five minutes of weightlessness. They can unbuckle their harnesses and do somersaults, if desired, in the padded-dome interior.On descent, they will encounter forces of 5 Gs.The capsule will parachute back to the plains of West Texas, slowing to a coasting speed of about 20 miles per hour, while the booster drops and fires its engine to slow down and make a vertical landing. The capsule slows to 3 m.p.h. before touching down. Both pieces are reusable to make the trips more economical.\u201cReusability is the key to getting millions of people living and working in space,\u201d Mr. Bezos said.New Shepard has a simpler flight path: just up and down, almost like a big roller coaster that slows to a stop at the top of its arc.The abort system worked. To the pleasant surprise of the engineers, the booster survived the force of separation, righted itself and descended to a landing. (It would have still been considered a successful test if the booster had crashed.)A Virgin Galactic test flight in 2014 crashed, killing one pilot and severely injuring the other.Both Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk have much more ambitious goals beyond their current rockets. Mr. Musk wants to send settlers to Mars. Mr. Bezos has said his long-term vision involves having millions of people living and working in space.Kenneth Chang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The increase from the fourth quarter was smaller, however. In the final quarter of 2016, Tesla delivered 22,252 cars and S.U.V.s.The first-quarter total is a preliminary figure that could change when the company reports its first-quarter earnings next month. Tesla also said it produced a record 25,418 vehicles in the quarter, up from 15,510 a year ago, although again the rise was much smaller when compared with the fourth quarter, when it built 24,882 cars.Mr. Musk has said that with the Model 3 in the mix, the company is aiming to push annual production to 500,000 cars in 2018. At that rate, Tesla would need to average production of more than 40,000 cars a month, more than it now produces in a quarter.\u201cSales have been good for Tesla in the last three months, but the Model 3 will be their biggest challenge yet as I imagine most of their company resources are focused on that vehicle,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com, an auto-information website.At the same time, Tesla\u2019s automobile business faces some uncertainty because sales are currently helped by a $7,500 tax credit the federal government offers on environmentally friendly cars. \u201cA worry on the horizon is the Trump administration\u2019s stance on the tax credits,\u201d Ms. Caldwell said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Winemakers Wonder: Who Will Pick the Grapes?", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byCalifornia Today Good morning.It will be many months before any grapes are ready to pick but winemakers in the Napa and Sonoma valleys are already fretting that they will not have enough workers for the harvest.\u201cI\u2019m super-worried about it this year,\u201d said Nico Cueva, winemaker at Kosta Browne, a high-end winemaker in Sonoma County. \u201cOur industry is based on immigration.\u201dMore than two-thirds of California farmworkers are undocumented immigrants and the Trump Administration\u2019s threatened crackdown is scaring many of them away, winemakers say.The labor crunch is hurting all types of agricultural businesses in California but the upscale vineyards of Napa and Sonoma have particular needs. Unlike the industrial grows of the central coast, where grapes are often mechanically harvested, grapes in Napa and Sonoma are almost always handpicked. Winemakers say this helps avoid bruising the fruit, among other advantages.Another factor, says Mr. Cueva: California\u2019s cannabis industry has been poaching some workers and outdoor-grown marijuana and grapes are harvested at around the same time.Austin Peterson, winemaker at Ovid, a boutique winery on the hills overlooking Napa Valley, says winemakers have already had trouble finding workers to prune the vines this year.\u201cThere\u2019s already a shortage of labor \u2014 more than in recent memory,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone in agriculture is hopeful that immigration reform comes soon.\u201dThe shortage has overtaken water concerns as the No. 1 problem for vineyards, says David E. Block, the chairman of viticulture and enology at the University of California, Davis.At elite wineries the optimum harvest window can sometimes be as short as six or 12 hours \u2013 even less if unfavorable weather arrives around harvest time. So having crews available is crucial to the quality of the grapes.Could the labor shortage hurt the quality of this year\u2019s top California wines?\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s gotten bad enough to where people are thinking it will compromise the quality of the harvest,\u201d Mr. Block said. \u201cBut everyone is racing to get a crew ready to pick.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Before Indianapolis, the heart of American auto racing was in Los Angeles.It was this week in 1910 that the inaugural race was held at the Los Angeles Motordrome, the world\u2019s first wooden plank track built for automobile racing.Until then, races commonly happened in the dirt and across big distances. At the Motordrome, erected near the beach in Playa del Rey, fans had a view of all the white-knuckle action on a one-mile circular track.Crowds of more than 10,000 people came to see the early stars of the sport push the limits of the big machines at more than 90 miles an hour around the banked track, essentially a scaled-up version of a bicycle velodrome.Later, around the 1930s, said Mr. Osmer, the sport\u2019s center of gravity began to shift to Indiana, home of the famed Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Market Surge Has Even Fans Looking for Feet of Clay", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byIn the past four weeks, exuberant investors have driven up the share price of Tesla, putting the upstart in the league of car companies that have been in the business for a century.But there are others who think Tesla, for all its potential, has become an overpriced investment \u2014 and something of a risky play in the near or medium term, given the challenges of turning battery-powered cars into mass-market products.Among the skeptics are some of Tesla\u2019s biggest fans.Take Dennis Pascual, a tech industry consultant in Long Beach, Calif., and owner of two Teslas \u2014 a Model S sedan and a two-seat Roadster, the first car Tesla put on the road. He is such a fan, in fact, that he has put down deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts once Tesla starts making the car later this year.He also owns some Tesla stock, but is not about to buy more.\u201cIt\u2019s a little pricey for me to jump back in,\u201d he said, speaking by phone from his Model S. \u201cRight now, I think we\u2019re in a hold.\u201dMoreover, he worries about Tesla\u2019s ability to carry out the bold expansion plans it has for this year and next. Tesla\u2019s high-profile chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the company expects to begin production this summer on its first mass-market offering, the Model 3, ramping up to 5,000 cars a month by the end of the year and driving output to several hundred thousand cars over the course of 2018.\u201cThey really need to deliver, and that has me concerned,\u201d Mr. Pascual said, who has worked at start-up companies and has years of experience in the technology business. \u201cI\u2019m bullish long term, but yes, I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m always worried about companies executing.\u201dTesla\u2019s market surge has been extraordinary. Since March 13, its shares are up 25 percent, in a period when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has declined slightly.Along the way, the market value of Tesla, which sold fewer than 80,000 cars last year and does not yet generate steady profits, has grown to $50 billion \u2014 roughly equal to that of General Motors, which sold more than 9.8 million vehicles worldwide and earned $9.4 billion. (On Tuesday, Tesla closed at $308.71, a decline of 1.2 percent, pushing it slightly below G.M. in market capitalization a day after surpassing it.)That Tesla and G.M. are comparably valued is \u201ctotally inexplicable,\u201d Michael J. Jackson, the chief executive of the dealership chain AutoNation, said on Tuesday at an auto-industry conference in New York. He added that Tesla \u201cis either one of the great Ponzi schemes of all time\u201d or will somehow work out for investors.The run-up was fueled in part by some encouraging signs that Tesla\u2019s Model 3 is proceeding on schedule. Early this year the company began production of batteries at its gigantic new plant in Nevada, known as the Gigafactory. Then it announced that Model 3 production would start in July, despite concerns among some analysts that the debut would be delayed until late this year.A smooth Model 3 rollout could propel Tesla to new heights. It has customer deposits of $1,000 for close to 400,000 orders of the new model, which is priced at $35,000, making it affordable to far more buyers than Tesla\u2019s existing models, which go for $90,000 with options.\u201cThe market seems to be thrilled,\u201d said David Whiston, an equity analyst at Morningstar. \u201cThe thinking seems to be that this could be the next Amazon or Apple, and people want to get in early.\u201dAdding to this enthusiasm seems to be a belief in Mr. Musk\u2019s vision of the future. He is trying to revolutionize the auto industry with Tesla, which has jumped ahead of traditional automakers in both battery-powered cars and self-driving technology. At the same time, he is promising to bring affordable renewable energy to homes with SolarCity, which merged with Tesla last year, and commercialize the heavens with SpaceX, a separate company he founded.Tesla, in Mr. Musk\u2019s view, is more than a carmaker. It is leading the shift to renewable energy \u2014 on the road and at home.While Mr. Musk\u2019s vision has captured the imagination of both car buyers and investors, the company\u2019s financial situation is less compelling. Tesla has reported losses in each of the past five years, and must invest heavily to achieve his goals. It had $3.4 billion in cash at the end of 2016, but some $7 billion in debt after the SolarCity acquisition. It has debt payments coming due in 2018, 2019 and 2021. Problems or delays in Model 3 production could make it harder to meet its obligations.\u201cRight now, nobody seems to care about balance-sheet risk,\u201d Mr. Whiston said. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t seem to be concerned about cash-flow risk. People are looking at the potential, and the old-fashioned analysis of fundamentals aren\u2019t seen as important.\u201dAnother question overshadowed by Tesla\u2019s stock surge is whether the company can make the big leap to making, shipping, selling and servicing a half a million cars a year \u2014 a fivefold increase in production of cars that are made out of thousands of parts and components.\u201cAll you need is a problem with one part to delay the Model 3,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book.Producing a half a million cars a year in one plant will not be easy even without such problems. Other car plants in the United States typically make only 200,000 to 300,000 vehicles a year.Pete Cordaro, the owner of a vending-machine company in Connellsville, Pa., drives a 2015 Model S and loves the car. Mr. Cordaro is such a fan, in fact, that he has put down deposits to buy two Model 3s once they are available.But the stock? He is not sold on it. He said he knew well from his own business how important a sound financial footing was.\u201cI think there\u2019s too much enthusiasm in the market like with any growth company,\u201d Mr. Cordaro said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bubble.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. Takes a Back Seat to Tesla as America\u2019s Most Valued Carmaker", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 By almost every measure, General Motors has been on a roll.Its bellwether pickups and sport utility vehicles have hit the sweet spot in a record-setting American market for two years. The company is steadily increasing profits and revenue. And President Trump has vowed to ease regulations and put cars at the forefront of his crusade to add manufacturing jobs.In short, G.M. has come a long way from a near-death experience eight years ago, when it filed for bankruptcy and needed a $49 billion government bailout. But apparently investors have yet to be convinced that G.M., the nation\u2019s largest automaker, has put its troubled past behind it.In a sign of how the industry\u2019s future is being reimagined, the electric-car maker Tesla passed G.M. on Monday as America\u2019s most valuable auto company.With its stock gaining more than 3 percent for the day to $312.39, Tesla has a market capitalization of $50.9 billion, just a hair ahead of G.M.\u2019s.G.M. is working hard to establish its own bona fides in automotive innovation, developing home-grown technology, acquiring or investing in Silicon Valley companies with promising approaches to self-driving or ride-hailing systems, and bringing a new electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt, to market.\u201cWe are spending money on the future, whether it is in mobility, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence or electrification,\u201d said Mark L. Reuss, G.M.\u2019s executive vice president for product development.Yet the moves have so far failed to impress investors. The company\u2019s shares are about 13 percent lower than they were when Mary T. Barra became chief executive in early 2014. And now an activist shareholder, the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, is pushing for a financial restructuring to unlock more of the company\u2019s value.But G.M. epitomizes both the frustration attached to the old American auto industry, and the determination to prove the skeptics wrong over the long term.A G.M. spokesman played down the company\u2019s loss of its title as the most valuable American automaker. \u201cWe have a track record of strong financial performance, with a great outlook for 2017,\u201d the spokesman, Tom Henderson, said on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay focused on delivering outstanding results, generating strong cash flows and investing capital where it will drive the highest returns.\u201dStill, G.M. executives know that investors worry whether the company owes its recent success mostly to a strong domestic market, buoyed by low oil prices that have indulged car buyers\u2019 tastes for big, profitable sport utility vehicles \u2014 conditions that could be at risk if the economy falters.\u201cNo one is going to believe we are for real until we successfully go through a downturn, and go through it well,\u201d Mr. Reuss said at a company event last week. \u201cWe have to prove it.\u201dThe company has taken some drastic steps recently to shed the baggage of past decades, when its desire to be the world\u2019s biggest automaker seemed to be its driving ambition.Moreover, the company has pared back incentives it once relied on to reduce bloated inventories, and eliminated factory shifts to better align production with demand.The newfound discipline, along with a consistent flow of new models, has helped G.M. outperform the United States market so far this year. Through March, its sales are up slightly less than 1 percent, while the industry over all is down 1.5 percent.The company is also aggressively updating older models and adding new ones. Its Buick division, for example, will take the wraps off new versions of its midsize Regal sedan and Enclave S.U.V. at media previews this week for the New York Auto Show. And the battery-powered Bolt has been on sale for months, while Tesla is still gearing up to produce its first mass-market electric car, the Model 3.Yet despite the expectations that G.M. will increase earnings and sales this year, the company suffers by comparison with Tesla, which has rarely made a profit but has huge potential to grow.Industry analysts see the race for stock market value as a competition tilted in favor of the little electric automaker that produces a fraction of the vehicles made by the big Detroit manufacturer.\u201cTesla is viewed as a high-tech start-up driven by lots of stock speculation, while G.M. is an old-line industrial business with lots of institutional investors,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the firm Autotrader.The frustration with G.M.\u2019s share price led Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund overseen by the billionaire investor David M. Einhorn, to propose creating two classes of stock \u2014 one that pays a dividend on the company\u2019s core business, and a second that tracks its growth in ventures such as autonomous vehicles and ride-hailing services.G.M.\u2019s board rejected the proposal, but the hedge fund \u2014 which owns about 3 percent of the company\u2019s stock, according to the automaker \u2014 has promised to take the fight to the annual meeting, likely to be held in June.The meeting could become a forum for Ms. Barra to defend the company\u2019s step-by-step strategy to innovate, while it continues to refine its older, core operations.Mr. Reuss, who has worked for G.M. for more than 30 years, said the company was taking a long view of its destiny, while at the same time defending its market share in North America and China.\u201cYears ago, G.M. was fixated on the next quarter or the next year \u2014 and not the next 10 years,\u201d he said.For now, the company can ill afford to allow a stagnant American market, or its costly restructuring efforts overseas, to crimp its momentum. Even the smallest setback could depress its market value \u2014 and allow Tesla to pull further ahead.\u201cThey have no choice but to keep focusing on what makes money, and that\u2019s selling pickup trucks and S.U.V.s,\u201d Ms. Krebs said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In NoLIta, a Tribute to Forgotten History", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported bySide StreetWhen Steve Stollman talks about the energy that once pulsed around the intersection of Houston and Mulberry Streets, he is not indulging some touchy-feely sensibility (even if he did make a living in the 1960s distributing hippie-friendly underground newspapers). He\u2019s being literal.In the late 19th century, before this neighborhood in Manhattan was called NoLIta, Nikola Tesla had a laboratory on Houston Street, where he conducted experiments on electricity that challenged his onetime employer, Thomas Alva Edison.In homage to that spirit, he has plastered portraits and cartoons on the blue fence that guards the empty lot where his building once stood. The display honors Tesla and his friend Mark Twain; Joseph Keppler, the immigrant who founded Puck magazine; Jacob Riis, the crusading photographer; and Theodore Roosevelt, who as police commissioner had his office a few blocks away. Some of them knew each other, but each in his own way challenged the status quo.His ad hoc pantheon is a tribute to the area\u2019s forgotten history and a call to arms in a neighborhood that has been supercharged by gentrification and luxury development, like the Puck Building, which is owned by the family of the real estate mogul Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser.That call is summed up in a meditation Mr. Stollman wrote: \u201cNow that we have entered a new Gilded Age, or perhaps more accurately a Shiny Brass-Plated Age, the need to find the current heroes, to soften the blows of so much inequality, danger to our futures and corrosion of our values, becomes ever more critical.\u201dHad things gone as expected when he sold the building for $5.5 million in 2008, he would have returned to the area and occupied a ground-floor space to continue his work with various community groups. He said the new owner, Michael Hirtenstein, had agreed to the suggestion but reneged, leaving the site empty.Litigation followed, which led to another recent offer from Mr. Hirtenstein that gave him until Sept. 15 to find a new buyer willing to pay at least $15 million for the property. Mr. Stollman is to get half of anything above $11 million. If not, Mr. Stollman gets $1.6 million and walks away (or takes the train upstate, where he now lives with his partner, Melissa Miller).Neither Mr. Hirtenstein nor his lawyer would comment on the arrangement.Given the area\u2019s extreme makeover, it\u2019s hard to find traces of its recent past, much less the 19th century. When Mr. Stollman arrived on the block in 1974, the city was going broke \u2014 and looked it.\u201cIt was the Bowery, skid row,\u201d said Mr. Stollman, 74. \u201cIt was a classic New York tenement neighborhood. You had people sleeping in front of the place, a candy store run by a nice Italian couple, and a restaurant owned by John Ballato, who was in the movie \u2018Reds.\u2019 Limos would pull up to this little restaurant and out came movie stars who stepped over bodies to get in.\u201dWell, at least celebrities still flock to the area. Mr. Stollman is unsure who might buy the property, though he just put up a sign in Chinese hoping to attract buyers who want to be near Chinatown. And while he had long hoped to return to the area, he admits too much time may have passed.\u201cWhen I sold this, the neighborhood was an active one, with activism very much part of the community,\u201d he said. \u201cBut gentrification in this part of Manhattan over the last eight years has just been fierce. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to come back. The energy that was there is gone.\u201dWhile it may not help him court big money, he would like his sidewalk display \u2014 and planned nighttime projections \u2014 to suggest that perhaps a new era of activism is called for in the Trump age.\u201cIn the late 1800s people didn\u2019t give a damn about each other, and it was cold,\u201d Mr. Stollman said. \u201cBut Tesla and the others talked about humanity and brought forth ideas that gave people more fulfilling lives. They represented important ideas. Each of them did a lot to have people live better lives and be closer together, all within the same area. Yet today nobody know what Puck was, and they think Tesla is just a car.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But its founder, Jia Yueting, invested in a dizzying array of new business lines \u2014 movie production, smart TVs and phones, sports broadcasting and goods, electric cars and car sharing, cloud computing and online finance.The conglomerate embarked on a string of debt-financed acquisitions, including stakes in the Chinese electronics companies Coolpad Group and TCL Multimedia. LeEco also acquired the car sharing start-up Yidao Yongche.Mr. Jia adopted a high profile. He publicly pledged to take on Apple and Tesla and began wearing black hoodies and black long-sleeve shirts like the tech icons of Silicon Valley, adopting just the initials YT in contacts with his employees.

{"Headline": "California Today: Defying Trump With Sanctuary Bill", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byCalifornia Today Good morning.Let\u2019s turn it over to Jennifer Medina, a correspondent based in Los Angeles, for today\u2019s introduction.Another day, another example of California\u2019s continued fight with the Trump administration. The State Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation Monday that essentially turns California into a so-called \u201csanctuary state\u201d for undocumented immigrants. The bill expands protections for immigrants at a time when the Trump administration has expanded who is considered a priority for deportation. The legislation prohibits any state or local law enforcement agency from using resources to investigate, detain, report or arrest people for immigration violations. Under the legislation, county jails would not be able to allow officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to work inside the jails or notify them when a prisoner is being released.After the bill came under fierce criticism from the California State Sheriffs\u2019 Association, it was amended to allow local law enforcement officials to notify ICE of the release date of serious and violent felons. It also enables local law enforcement officers to alert federal officials if they come across someone who has a violent felony record and has been previously deported. Language in the bill was also changed to explicitly allow local agencies to participate in task forces even if they include immigration enforcement in investigations. The amendments did little to mollify the opposition. One Republican senator warned that the Legislature would be \u201ckicking the president right in the groin,\u201d with the law and warned that \u201che will strike back.\u201dAfter the vote, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the leader of the state Senate and sponsor of the bill, said, \u201cOur communities will become more, not less, dangerous if local police are enlisted to enforce federal immigration laws.\u201d He called the passage of the bill a \u201crejection of President Trump\u2019s false and cynical portrayal of undocumented immigrants as a lawless community.\u201dJust before the Senate passed the sanctuary state bill, lawmakers approved legislation to start a fund that would pay for lawyers for undocumented immigrants facing deportation. Several Republicans spoke out against the legislation, saying it was an unfair use of taxpayer money and also contradicted the idea that the state wants to stay out of immigration enforcement. Both bills will now move to the Assembly. Gov. Jerry Brown has not indicated whether he would sign either one.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Some visitors to Big Sur go bird watching or relax with a novel at a seaside resort.Others suspend themselves high above the Pacific\u2019s crashing waves on a narrow strip of nylon known as a slackline.Billy Rudiger, a reader in Carmel, shared a photo he captured of a slackliner traversing a cove just south of Monterey last November.In the last five or so years, social media has helped to propel its popularity.\u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to pay respect in a very unique way.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Persuasive Business Leaders Parade Through White House", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a meeting at the White House with business leaders two weeks into his presidency, Donald J. Trump turned to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase.Aren\u2019t the Chinese manipulating their currency? Mr. Trump asked, according to two people who were there.\u201cNo, Mr. President, they\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Dimon replied. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to be responsible.\u201dOthers at the meeting, including the former Boeing chief W. James McNerney, agreed. Their advice echoed arguments by members of Mr. Trump\u2019s staff and cabinet that he should abandon his campaign pledge to punish China over its currency.Mr. Trump was listening. Two months later, facing a strengthened United States dollar and the need for Chinese support against a pugilistic North Korea, he reversed his position.The meeting with Mr. Dimon and other corporate executives was just one of dozens of sessions Mr. Trump has convened with top businesspeople since becoming president. Nearly 300 executives have visited the White House this year, according to a New York Times tabulation, an open-door policy that is a sharp break with the Obama administration and puts corporate chieftains on par with senior lawmakers in the pecking order of who has influence in Washington.Frank and occasionally confrontational, the conversations have become a defining feature of Mr. Trump\u2019s young presidency, inspiring policy debates and in some instances 180-degree shifts by the president, according to White House officials and executives who have participated in the discussions.And while some Democrats and other critics complain business leaders are being granted unfettered access to Mr. Trump \u2014 who ran as a businessman planning to apply executive principles to Washington\u2019s problems \u2014 the White House is unapologetic. The relationship-building is acting as a welcome substitute for a lack of legislative accomplishments, and presidential aides suggest the rapport positions Mr. Trump for future success.\u201cThe whole idea is, do something with all of this communication and feedback,\u201d said Chris Liddell, the president\u2019s assistant for strategic initiatives and a former chief financial officer at Microsoft and General Motors. \u201cAnd some of that happened in the first hundred days, but we\u2019re really setting ourselves up for the next thousand days.\u201dMany executives said that they were rarely given face time with President Barack Obama, and that even when they were, they sensed he wasn\u2019t fully engaged. \u201cThe feedback from the Obama White House was, \u2018We\u2019ll listen to what you have to say, but we know what we\u2019re doing,\u2019\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group.The parade of chief executives has included familiar Republican faces, like Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone and Jack Welch, the former chairman and chief executive of General Electric.But it has also included Democrats. Larry Fink, the chief of BlackRock, was a potential Treasury secretary had Hillary Clinton won the presidency; on Friday, he blasted the administration\u2019s approach to immigration and cast doubt on the economic models underpinning its proposed tax cuts, saying, \u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty due to the new administration.\u201dEric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, was a Clinton supporter who predicted in January that Mr. Trump would do \u201cevil things\u201d as president. And Charles Phillips, chief executive of the software company Infor, sat on Mr. Obama\u2019s Economic Recovery Advisory Board.\u201cAs he\u2019s shaping his view, he is kind of learning a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Phillips said of Mr. Trump. \u201cSo this is a good time, in this first six months, to go in there.\u201dAlcoa\u2019s chief executive, Roy Harvey, experienced that firsthand on Thursday, as he watched Mr. Trump sign a memorandum directing the Commerce Department to investigate the effects of aluminum imports on national security.\u201cWe appreciate the support of the administration to try to make a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Harvey said.Mr. Trump\u2019s dialogue with business leaders has at times been freewheeling, and at times focused on topics that were first dissected in small sessions with staff or cabinet members. At the gatherings, some executives, who have been cowed by the president\u2019s itchy Twitter finger and tendency to take quick offense to perceived slights, have found Mr. Trump open to disagreement.At the meeting when the Chinese currency was discussed, Elon Musk, the South African-born chief of Tesla and SpaceX, attacked a newly signed executive order banning travel and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Not only did Mr. Trump welcome the criticism, said the people who were present, he calmly defended his position, noting that public-opinion polls supported his viewpoint before sharing the floor with John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary.Some business leaders have parlayed their White House access into support for specific causes. In a TED talk on Friday, Mr. Musk said, \u201cI\u2019ve used the meetings I\u2019ve had to argue in favor of immigration and climate change,\u201d according to a Twitter post published by the organization. Mr. Schwarzman of Blackstone encouraged Mr. Trump to soften his hard-line stance on deporting so-called Dreamers \u2014 the young, undocumented foreigners living in the United States.\u201cBecause of these conversations, it really became a significant focus of the administration,\u201d said Reed Cordish, assistant to the president for intergovernmental and technology initiatives.Executives are hoping the White House will support putting federal education grants toward skills-training programs rather than just traditional college. So far, however, the administration hasn\u2019t taken a public stance on the legislative efforts to do so.Mr. Trump\u2019s unofficial business cabinet was handpicked, in many cases, by influential companies and trade associations. On the president\u2019s first full weekday in office, he welcomed a dozen industrial executives who had been convened by Andrew Liveris, head of the Dow Chemical Company. A senior staff member at the Retail Industry Leaders Association put together a panel of executives drawn from her group\u2019s ranks.Mr. Schwarzman recruited a range of business leaders, economists and policy experts for the president\u2019s strategic and policy forum, which regularly meets at the White House and has emerged as the most elite outside counsel.To be invited to the policy forum, there were a few criteria, according to someone who was briefed on the selection process: Be an expert in your field who is respected by Mr. Schwarzman, be a United States citizen and don\u2019t be vetoed by Mr. Trump.The task of dealing day to day with the chief executives falls largely to Mr. Liddell, a New Zealander by birth, and Mr. Cordish, a Baltimore real estate scion, who share a cramped office in the West Wing. It is decorated with a laminated United States map and a full-page ad, ripped from The Wall Street Journal, that thanks Mr. Trump for agreeing to reconsider fuel-economy standards. It was purchased by auto trade groups.During a recent interview, Mr. Liddell and Mr. Cordish were upbeat. Since the White House \u201clistening groups\u201d began, Mr. Cordish said, they\u2019ve been barraged with ideas from executives and trade groups for deregulation, job creation and the streamlining of services.In a meeting in early April, a group of 50 or so chief executives involved with the Partnership for New York City proposed adding public housing to Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure initiative. The idea was recirculated at another trade group meeting about a week later, suggesting that the White House was seriously considering it.Some of the infrastructure changes under consideration would improve the government\u2019s own inner workings, including at the White House itself. \u201cA lot of technology here is 20 years out of date,\u201d Mr. Liddell said.But even with all the access, some chief executives are frustrated with what they describe as well-intentioned but so far fruitless talk \u2014 and a public environment that can be leery of any cooperation with the Trump administration.Robert Hoopes, a consultant who advises nonprofit groups and large companies and has done work for prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said executives were making a careful calculation when they traveled to Pennsylvania Avenue. If the topic for discussion is core to your business, Mr. Hoopes said, \u201cyou want to be a part of that conversation.\u201d But if the session is peripheral or unrelated to your business, he said, the \u201crisk calibration\u201d is very different.Two dozen trade-group officials and chief executives, some of them suggested as potential interview subjects by the White House, either refused to speak for this article or didn\u2019t respond to messages. Others declined to be quoted on the record, citing the toxic environment and the potential fallout among the public and their own employees for being regarded as an ally of Mr. Trump.\u201cUsually, when a campaign is over, things settle down and people feel they can work with the president without having a backlash,\u201d Ms. Wylde of the Partnership for New York City said. \u201cIn this case, there continue to be divisive forces that don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d C.E.O.s, she said, \u201cfeel pressure from all sides.\u201dLandon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting from Chicago.

But legal scholars question whether the change will be effective.\u201cAssuming a successful suit, Waymo could get damages for the period AL was involved,\u201d Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said in an email, referring to Mr. Levandowski. \u201cIf the purloined documents are still accessible to, and can be implemented by, the rest of the team, his recusal makes no difference.\u201dWith the change in role, Eric Meyhofer, a principal at Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Group in Pittsburgh, will lead the driverless car division and report directly to Uber\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick.

He sold that start-up to Uber in August for $680 million.At stake is what many technologists consider to be the intersection of the next wave of computing, artificial intelligence and an entirely new category of transportation. Mr. Kalanick has said the race for self-driving technology is \u201cexistential\u201d to Uber\u2019s future, looking ahead to a day when smart driverless vehicles can move millions of people around as quickly and efficiently as possible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dyson Is the Apple of Appliances (and Just as Secretive)", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "Supported by8 PhotosMALMESBURY, England \u2014 When Michael Aldred joined the British home electronics maker Dyson two decades ago, he had a simple goal: to quickly build a robotic vacuum cleaner.But Mr. Aldred and his team kept running into roadblocks.\u201cAt times, I really asked myself what I had signed up for,\u201d Mr. Aldred said in an interview at Dyson\u2019s rural headquarters near the border with Wales. \u201cBut James Dyson always told us to focus on the product. Everything else would follow.\u201dNot many consumer electronics brands would spend almost two decades \u2014 and tens of millions of dollars \u2014 building a vacuum cleaner that retails for more than a top-of-the-line laptop.\u201cIt is extremely difficult to make money if you\u2019re not in the premium segment of the market,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a tech consulting firm. \u201cThat\u2019s what Apple and Dyson have done well \u2014 being best in breed for technology and industrial design.\u201dDyson said its pretax profits rose 41 percent last year to 631 million pounds, or $785 million, while revenue rose 45 percent to \u00a32.5 billion, or $3.1 billion, partly because of the weakened British pound. Mr. Dyson, 69, who founded the company in 1992, is worth about \u00a35 billion, or $6.2 billion.The company, with 8,500 employees split mostly between Britain and a factory in Malaysia, is growing rapidly in China, where the country\u2019s emerging middle class remains eager to spend on designer goods, including expensive vacuum cleaners.\u201cAsia is a huge growth area for us,\u201d said Max Conze, Dyson\u2019s chief executive, who joined from Procter & Gamble in 2010. \u201cFive years ago, 85 percent of what we sold was corded vacuum cleaners. Now, more than 80 percent comes from new products.\u201dDyson is indeed moving beyond vacuum cleaners, hair dryers and air purifiers. The company said it would spend more than $2 billion on battery technology, machine learning and other high-tech wizardry to create new products, many of which remain under wraps behind tight security at its headquarters.\u201cWe\u2019re still heading into new areas where companies are well established,\u201d said Jake Dyson, 44, the founder\u2019s elder son, who rejoined the company in 2015 and is the most likely successor to his father. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to try and beat them.\u201dAs with any company synonymous with James Dyson, it\u2019s often hard to separate Dyson the man from Dyson the brand.Tall, bookish and with a penchant for designer glasses, Mr. Dyson trained as an industrial engineer and dabbled in building things like boats and wheelbarrows before settling on vacuum cleaners by the late 1970s.Frustrated with how his existing machine worked, Mr. Dyson reused technology that mirrored how a cyclone forcefully sucked wind from its surroundings, eventually spending 15 years \u2014 and building more than 5,000 prototypes \u2014 before releasing his first vacuum cleaner in 1993. He initially licensed the designs to companies in the United States and Japan, but eventually decided to build the machines himself.\u201cWhen we launched it, we were slightly terrified,\u201d said Mr. Dyson, who had mortgaged his home and used his life savings to fund the project. \u201cI\u2019m not a businessman. I didn\u2019t start a business, I started with an idea.\u201dHis professorial look, complete with cut-glass English accent, belies Mr. Dyson\u2019s ruthlessness. When competitors like Hoover and Samsung copied his ideas after his vacuum cleaner hit the market, the entrepreneur fought, and won, costly patent lawsuits, and instilled an \u201cus versus them\u201d attitude that still permeates the company.At Dyson\u2019s headquarters \u2014 chosen for its proximity to Mr. Dyson\u2019s original workshop \u2014 employees remain tight-lipped, even among themselves, about their projects. During a tour of the company\u2019s facilities, prototypes were covered in tarps while large areas of the open-plan offices were off limits. Photographs of engineers\u2019 computer screens were prohibited, and machinery in some of the research labs was obscured with black trash bags.\u201cIt\u2019s a little like a brainwashing atmosphere,\u201d said Mario Cosci, an electronic engineer who joined Dyson six years ago. \u201cWhen you work every day with people who are driven, you can\u2019t swim against it.\u201dNot everything Dyson has tried has turned to gold.At many publicly listed companies, such a failure might have cost people their jobs. But at Dyson, where 14.5 percent of annual revenue is earmarked for research and development, engineers took the mistake in stride and began diversifying into other products.For Steve Courtney, head of Dyson\u2019s new products unit, that included moving into cordless vacuum cleaners in 2005, even though analysts said the machines would hurt sales of the company\u2019s corded products. It also meant releasing bladeless fans four years later that borrowed heavily from Dyson\u2019s existing vacuum technology \u2014 the product range was later extended to internet-connected air purifiers.And when the company began selling $400 hair dryers last year, its mostly male engineering team not only learned to professionally blow-dry hair to understand how rival products worked, but also again copied the battery, motor and fan technology from Dyson\u2019s existing products.\u201cWe may go through a lot of pain and it may take a lot of time, but then we can transfer what we develop into something completely new,\u201d Mr. Courtney said. \u201cWe need big new areas, new markets.\u201d\u201cThe community was surprised by the investment,\u201d said Eric Wachsman, director of the energy research center at the University of Maryland, who is developing a rival project. \u201cNo one knows if their technology will work or not.\u201dMark Taylor, Dyson\u2019s research director, said the company was committed to making the battery technology work.\u201cWe\u2019re looking really far out,\u201d Mr. Davison said. \u201cMost of the work that we do is years away from being in an actual product.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The permit authorizes six people to take control of the vehicles if necessary.In October, Timothy D.

{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Rise on a Wave of Shareholder Optimism", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTesla\u2019s shareholders have driven off into La-La Land.For all his success, though, Mr. Musk has also routinely missed production targets in recent years. Even so, Tesla now trades at some 28 times estimated earnings in 2020. By then Mr. Musk expects to be producing one million cars a year, up from around 100,000 in 2017.That will require a huge ramp-up in production, which is no easy feat. Also, that valuation multiple suggests Tesla will either keep growing quickly or else generate pretax margins around the 30 percent that Silicon Valley stalwarts Apple and Google achieve rather than the 10 percent that counts as decent in the auto industry \u2014 or maybe both.It\u2019s hard to see that happening, at least without major setbacks along the way.Long-term guesstimates from Morgan Stanley\u2019s auto analysts show a standard-looking car company \u2014 and they have been among Tesla\u2019s most bullish followers. They don\u2019t see output reaching one million cars until around 2027. By 2030, they reckon the company\u2019s pretax margin could be about 14 percent, with some $11 billion of profit.Another way to assess these numbers is to discount the projected 2030 earnings back to this year at a rule-of-thumb 10 percent annual rate. Tesla\u2019s current valuation is about 18 times that discounted profit figure.It\u2019s a somewhat arbitrary analysis, but it may hint at what some investors are hoping for. Take Apple in 2004. Back then, the future iPhone maker was trading at just 65 percent of expected earnings this year, discounted back. In other words, Steve Jobs unleashed growth that blew projections away.If Mr. Musk is riding another wave of consumer change \u2014 a shift toward electric cars \u2014 it could be less drastic than the smartphone revolution and still pay off for Tesla\u2019s investors.That\u2019s possible. By 2030, a quarter of the miles driven in the United States could be in self-driving electric cars, according to the Boston Consulting Group. Mr. Musk faces plenty of competition, though. His backers seem to be assuming he will always have the run of the road.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justin Rose and Sergio Garc\u00eda Top Leaderboard at Masters", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported byAUGUSTA, Ga. \u2014 The 81st Masters tournament is being played in the memory of Arnold Palmer, but it could be dedicated to spine specialists.From the four-time champion Tiger Woods, whose chronic back injury prevented him from playing here, to top-ranked Dustin Johnson, who was also lost for the week in a freak fall that aggravated his lower back, that part of the body has been the back story of the tournament.So it is perhaps fitting that the 54-hole leaders are Justin Rose, who was sidelined for two months at the end of last year with a bad back, and Sergio Garc\u00eda, a veteran from Spain whose backbone, on occasion, has appeared brittle.Rose, the 2013 United States Open champion, played Augusta National Golf Club\u2019s back nine in five-under 31 on his way to a five-under 67. He is tied at six under with Garc\u00eda, who carded his third consecutive subpar round, a 70, to inch ever closer to an elusive major title. Rickie Fowler, who is also seeking his first major championship, is one shot back.\u201cIt was there for the taking,\u201d Rose said, referring to the picturesque conditions. \u201cIf you played great, you got rewarded.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf I had been two or three shots behind, I still would have felt I was in great position.\u201dFunny that Rose should say that, because the leaderboard is as clogged as the traffic outside the course on Washington Road, with Bugattis and Ferraris and Teslas backed up behind the front-runners. Their 14 nearest challengers include four former Masters champions (Jordan Spieth, Adam Scott, Charl Schwartzel and Fred Couples), as well as Rory McIlroy, who could complete a career Grand Slam with a victory here.Spieth, 23, posted a four-under 68 while grouped with Phil Mickelson, 46, in a pairing that drew the largest gallery. Mickelson, a three-time Masters champion, birdied the first two holes but played the next seven in five over. He equaled Spieth\u2019s one under on the back nine, but the damage was done: Mickelson\u2019s 74 left him outside the top 20 at two over.\u201cI plan to play aggressive because, at this point, it\u2019s win or go home,\u201d Spieth said.Sunday would have been the 60th birthday of Seve Ballesteros, the two-time Masters champion who died of brain cancer in 2011. Will Garc\u00eda celebrate his idol\u2019s birthday by winning his first major title in his 74th attempt? In his 73 previous starts, Garc\u00eda has been a runner-up four times, with 22 top-10 finishes. On Saturday, he cleared a significant mental hurdle that has clipped his progress time and again. Before this year, his career average here in the third round was 74.92 strokes.\u201cI\u2019m glad I took the scoring average down a bit,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.He added that his relationship with Augusta National, which, in 2009, he disparaged as \u201ctoo tricky,\u201d had improved.\u201cI think it\u2019s the kind of place that if you are trying to fight against it, it\u2019s going to beat you down,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019ve just got to roll with it.\u201dGarc\u00eda\u2019s nerve was tested early. On the front nine, he sank a 38-footer for birdie on the par-4 fifth, but he also faced four par putts between seven and nine feet, a distance from which he is in the bottom half of the 53-man field that remains. He made the first three but two-putted from seven feet for a bogey on the ninth to drop out of the lead. He also drained a nervy five-footer for bogey on No. 7.Walking off the tee on the par-5 eighth hole, Garc\u00eda and Charley Hoffman had a laughter-filled exchange. It is probably not a coincidence that Garc\u00eda went on to put the bogey behind him with a two-putt birdie from inside 50 feet.In a 2007 interview with Golf.com, Garc\u00eda said that his game was affected by his grouping \u2014 he plays better with people whose company and conversation he enjoys, explaining, \u201cThose good vibes and bad vibes affect my game.\u201dA golfer would have to be wound tighter than the inside threads of a golf ball not to have a good time playing with Hoffman, who was so loose during his first-round 65 that he noticed a friend in his gallery and acknowledged him by bringing his middle finger up to his nose.If only McIlroy could see Augusta National like the 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzles that he and his family work on back at their rental house \u2014 as a challenge meant to be fun. McIlroy said after his second-round 73 that he was confident he could vault up the leaderboard with a score in the 60s.It turned out to be wishful thinking. McIlroy, a four-time major winner, birdied two of the first three holes but could not mount a concerted challenge. His 71 left him six strokes back.\u201cMy best score here is 65,\u201d McIlroy said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to need something like that, if not lower, to have a chance.\u201dThe first player out Saturday was third-ranked Jason Day, whose stated goal was to finish ahead of his marker, Jeff Knox, an Augusta National member who plays with the last-place golfer when there is an odd number left in the field. Knox accompanied, and beat, McIlroy in 2014, when McIlroy was No. 1.\u201cHe said he was nervous on the first tee, and I\u2019m like in my head thinking, \u2018I\u2019m kind of nervous because I don\u2019t want my marker to beat me,\u2019\u201d said Day, who also wanted to atone for his second-round 76.He posted the number for the other 52 players to shoot for, a 69 that included a near ace on the sixth and four consecutive birdies starting at No. 12.\u201cI feel like I can actually play golf again,\u201d said Day, who, at three over, did not consider his cause lost. \u201cAnything can happen on Sunday at Augusta,\u201d he said.With everything that already has happened \u2014 tornado watches and quadruple bogeys; the world No. 1, Johnson, not making it to Thursday; and the 2016 champion, Danny Willett, not making it to Saturday \u2014 the script this year seems to have foreshadowed a frenzied finish.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hand of U.S. Leaves North Korea\u2019s Missile Program Shaken", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When a North Korean missile test went awry on Sunday, blowing up seconds after liftoff, there were immediate suspicions that a United States program to sabotage the test flights had struck again. The odds seem highly likely: Eighty-eight percent of the launches of the North\u2019s most threatening missiles have self-destructed since the covert American program was accelerated three years ago.But even inside the United States Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, where the operation is centered, it is nearly impossible to tell if any individual launch is the victim of a new, innovative approach to foil North Korean missiles with cyber and electronic strikes.Bad welding, bad parts, bad engineering and bad luck can all play a role in such failures \u2014 as it did in the United States\u2019 own missile program, particularly in its early days. And it would require a near impossible degree of forensic investigation to figure out an exact cause, given that the failed North Korean missiles tend to explode, disintegrate in midair and plunge in fragments into faraway seas.But this much is clear, experts say: The existence of the American program, and whatever it has contributed to North Korea\u2019s remarkable string of troubles, appears to have shaken Pyongyang and led to an internal spyhunt as well as innovative ways to defeat a wide array of enemy cyberstrikes.By all accounts, the program that President Barack Obama stepped up in 2014 has been adopted with enthusiasm by the Trump administration. President Trump\u2019s national security aides are eagerly hoping that the Chinese, among others, will get North Korea to freeze or reverse its program. Yet they have no compunctions about using this new class of weapon against missile tests that the United Nations has already prohibited.Speaking in Moscow last week, Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, was put on the defensive by a Russian reporter who challenged American complaints of interference in the American election, despite Washington\u2019s cyber attacks against Iran\u2019s nuclear program and North Korea\u2019s missile program. \u201cCybertools to disrupt weapons programs \u2014 that\u2019s another use of the tools, and I make a distinction between those two,\u201d Mr. Tillerson argued back, without specifically confirming their use against Pyongyang.Perhaps taken by surprise at the question, Mr. Tillerson never took the next step to voice the argument that some of his Trump administration colleagues make in private: that since the United Nations Security Council has banned North Korean missile tests, any effort to interfere with them would have some basis in international law.\u201cWhen you look at what is emanating out of North Korea,\u201d Michael Chertoff, a former secretary of homeland security who now runs a cyberconsulting group in Washington, said Tuesday at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \u201cI have sympathy for the argument that anything we can do to stop an unpredictable person from using nuclear weapons is worth trying.\u201dBut the question for the United States\u2019 intelligence agencies is whether this new tool is as effective as many have hoped. While billions of dollars have been poured into new offensive cyberweapons, touting a success in thwarting North Korea \u2014 whether it is real or imagined \u2014 can be turned into an argument for more.It is a particularly difficult question in light of Sunday\u2019s botched test, because it is still unclear exactly what missile was launched. By nature, missiles teeter on the brink of failure, and new designs are often accident prone. At their best, missiles are dense welters of pipes, engines, valves, pumps, volatile fuels, relays, explosive bolts, wires, sensors and circuit boards that suddenly emit blistering flames and roar skyward with such shattering violence that they often quickly hit the breaking point. Things can easily go wrong, and frequently do.But even by those measures, the North Koreans are having a rough time, and it has gotten a lot rougher since the United States accelerated its sabotage program.In the annals of rocketry, experts say, roughly 5 to 10 percent of developmental test flights go awry. That holds even for such high practitioners of the art as the billionaires Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, who are now racing to redefine the future of spaceflight. (By contrast, American commercial airline flights have a success rate of more than 99.9999 percent. And when crashes do occur, it can take investigators weeks, months or even years to identify the cause.)But the sheer frequency of North Korean missile mishaps suggests that sabotage lies behind at least some of the recent failures.So does the timing. Typically, countries encounter high failure rates when they start their rocket programs. As the programs mature, and engineers gain experience, spectacular failures decline and success tends to become a habit. In North Korea, the situation has been the exact reverse.By and large, the North was a reliable maker of missiles in the 1980s, \u201990s and into the 2000s. The government sold its missiles to Pakistan and Iran, among others.Then came the effort to launch the Musudan, an intermediate-range missile that Pyongyang first displayed in a military parade in late 2010. It was 5 feet wide and 40 feet long \u2014 remarkably small compared with the North\u2019s big rockets. But it represented an enormous threat. Carried on a truck, it could be hauled on country roads through forested regions or kept in tunnels, making it easy to hide and, as a target, difficult to find and destroy.To date, the proven reach of the Musudan makes it the most threatening potential weapon in the North\u2019s emerging arsenal of missiles that might loft nuclear warheads. It is seen as able to hit targets up to 2,200 miles away \u2014 far enough to strike the sprawling American base at Guam.Last year, the North conducted eight flight tests. Only one succeeded, giving the missile an overall failure rate of 88 percent. It was after the last failure that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, was reported to have ordered an investigation into whether the United States was sabotaging his country\u2019s test flights, searching for spies in his system.Experts say that the best way to slow a program is to send a country scrambling for the causes of failures. \u201cDisrupting their tests,\u201d William J. Perry, defense secretary in the Clinton administration, said at a meeting this year in Washington, would be \u201ca pretty effective way of stopping their ICBM program.\u201dBut more recently, the effectiveness of the United States\u2019 sabotage has grown increasingly uncertain. Some new North Korean missile designs, using solid fuels, have had a higher success rate. Moreover, the North Koreans, as sophisticated cyberoperators, have grown better at defense.John Schilling, a technical expert on North Korea\u2019s missile program, expressed skepticism on Tuesday about the efficacy of the foreign cyberattacks against Pyongyang\u2019s missiles.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything yet pointing to cyber specifically,\u201d Dr. Schilling said on a conference call organized by 38 North, a think tank specializing in North Korea at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.An easier target of sabotage, Dr. Schilling added, would be the parts and supplies that North Korea imports to feed its factories that make the missiles.Longtime North Korea watcher Martyn Williams, who runs a California-based blog called North Korea Tech, recently reported that the North\u2019s scientists have developed a quantum encryption device that could completely secure communications systems from hackers, eavesdroppers and saboteurs.Advertisement"}

Tesla, the electric-vehicle upstart, continues to surge.On Monday, Tesla surpassed Ford Motor in market value for the first time and moved within striking distance of General Motors, starkly illustrating the growing gap in investors\u2019 optimism over its future versus the prospects for the traditional carmakers from Detroit.While G.M. and Ford may have strong profits and healthy balance sheets, Tesla offers something Wall Street loves much more: the potential for dramatic growth.\u201cInvestors want something that is going to go up in orders of magnitude in six months to six years, and Tesla is that story,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cNobody thinks Ford or G.M. is going to do that.\u201dTesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has shattered the conventional wisdom that automakers should be viewed as a stable, reliable investment. Instead, he promotes his California-based company as a dynamic vehicle for growth, despite the risks and challenges ahead of it.In his vision, Tesla is going to change the world, and is primed to cash in on the two transformative trends in the industry: the shift to electric vehicles as part of a broader societal move to cleaner energy, and the advent of automated driving.\u201cTesla is very vocal in talking about how they are positioned as we move from humans driving cars powered by gasoline to computers driving cars powered by batteries,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.At the end of Monday\u2019s trading, Tesla reached a market capitalization of $48.7 billion compared with Ford\u2019s $45.6 billion, according to Bloomberg. General Motors was at $51.2 billion.That sent stocks in the Detroit automakers down for the day \u2014 G.M. was off 3.4 percent and Ford 1.7 percent \u2014 while Tesla\u2019s stock soared by more than 7 percent.Despite the recent boom years for the American motor industry, in which G.M. and Ford have been the biggest beneficiaries, executives are working overtime just to convince Wall Street that their business model can produce incremental improvements.Mr. Brauer said that reception was unfortunate for G.M. and Ford because \u201cthe reality is, they\u2019re as financially healthy as they\u2019ve ever been, and they\u2019re in very good position for the future.\u201dBoth companies have rebounded steadily since the recession, although G.M. needed a bankruptcy filing and $49 billion government bailout to recover. And both have taken advantage of the pent-up consumer demand for new vehicles in recent years, especially for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.But neither automaker has convinced Wall Street that it has shed its boom-or-bust reputation tied to broader economic cycles, or is at the forefront of new technology being developed for self-driving vehicles and electric cars.The Detroit automakers are hardly sitting still in their efforts to improve current results and future prospects. G.M. made the momentous decision recently to sell its money-losing European division, and Ford is adding jobs to accelerate its shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles. Both automakers have bought technology companies to bolster their in-house engineering expertise, and their executives have embraced the chance to work with the Trump administration on scaling back government regulations.All the same, both companies are ranked near the bottom in price-to-earnings ratios for the companies that make up the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.Last week, one of G.M.\u2019s large investors, the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, proposed the creation of two classes of stock \u2014 one that strictly pays dividends, and a second tied directly to earnings and future growth in areas like self-driving cars and ride-hailing services.G.M. directors flatly rejected the idea as too risky, and the chief executive, Mary Barra, said there was no need to deviate from \u201cexecuting a plan that is delivering record financial and operation results.\u201d Yet while industry analysts generally supported the decision, G.M.\u2019s share price barely budged on the news that it was staying the course.And Monday\u2019s data, showing total industry sales off 1.6 percent, underscored that overall demand for new vehicles is slipping despite a bevy of discounts and incentives. G.M. showed a slight gain from the prior March, while Ford sales fell sharply. Several other automakers, such as Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai, also reported declines.Of course, based on the number of cars actually being made, they are in a different league from Tesla. G.M. sold 256,000 vehicles in the United States last month, and Ford 234,000. Tesla\u2019s sales for the same period: 4,000.But it was the growth and the outlook, not the raw numbers, that moved the markets. Investors tend to look at Tesla as a technology start-up rather than an automaker.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like Tesla is positioned in people\u2019s minds as an energy storage company that happens to put most of its batteries on wheels,\u201d said Andrew Stewart, chief investment officer at Exchange Capital Management, an investment firm in Ann Arbor, Mich.Tesla is also prone to more volatile stock movements because Mr. Musk and other board members and top executives own a large chunk of shares, leaving a relative few that change hands frequently, he said.\u201cWhenever there\u2019s interesting news, the people trying to buy are buying from a limited number of people who are willing to sell,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cWhile you have Ford and G.M., and they\u2019re these decades-old, more-institutional industrial companies.\u201dBecause of Tesla\u2019s acclaim and the limited number of shares being traded, the company draws more individual investors, and its share price tends to spike whenever Tesla or Mr. Musk makes news.This week\u2019s jump in its stock price was set off by a brief news release on Sunday that said Tesla had delivered more than 25,000 cars in the first quarter, exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates.While Tesla may enjoy the favor of investors, it still faces some daunting hurdles to reach its goals. This summer, the company is supposed to start making the Model 3, a compact electric model that Tesla plans to sell for $35,000 and produce in significantly higher volumes. It currently offers two vehicles, the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X S.U.V., both of which sell for $90,000 or more when options are added in. (People who buy its cars benefit from a $7,500 federal tax credit on environmentally friendly cars, a selling point with an uncertain future.)Once Tesla begins producing the Model 3, Mr. Musk expects production to ramp up quickly, with a goal of making 500,000 cars a year by 2018. Achieving that target will not be easy, Mr. Brauer said. \u201cThat\u2019s five times growth in volume,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any car company that\u2019s ever done that in a two-year period.\u201dBill Vlasic reported from Detroit, and Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "16 Noteworthy Watches From Baselworld 2017", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byOn TimeSo it was surprising that watchmakers across the pricing spectrum stressed value at this year\u2019s fair.Value, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. But in a year of global uncertainty for the watch industry \u2014 heck, for everybody \u2014 companies continued to churn out head-turning pieces across the price spectrum. Some may not even require a second mortgage.Classic Autavias from the 1960s often fetch five-figure sums on the vintage market. So imagine the delight when TAG Heuer updated the coveted 1962 racing chronograph, featuring a reverse panda dial and brawny black bezel. The new version has been modernized, with a larger 42-millimeter case and a date window. But it still channels the spirit of Mario Andretti, Jochen Rindt and other racing legends.At first glance, a\u00a0light-powered watch that can be used 1,000 meters underwater may not make much sense. It\u2019s dark in those inky depths. But the lack of a battery means the hardened \u201cSuper Titanium\u201d case never needs to be opened, making it virtually leakproof. Functionally speaking, it is a bathyscaph for the wrist.This whimsical piece, designed by celebrated watchmaker Jean-Marc Wiederrecht, does more than tell the time. An horological homage to a famous Georges Clemenceau line \u2014 roughly, \u201cthe best moment in love is right before it arrives\u201d \u2014 it has a 12-hour countdown that gives the wearer a sense of anticipation, culminating in a delicate chime from deep inside the watch\u2019s rose gold case.As the Tesla S is to the Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, so is the\u00a0Eclipse\u00a0Tourbillon\u00a0to the bejeweled confections for which Graff Diamonds is known. Weighing in at only\u00a045\u00a0grams despite a manly 43-millimeter case, this handsome black-on-black-on-black timepiece is rendered in go-anywhere DLC-coated titanium. And like a Tesla, this discreet and\u00a0sexy\u00a0Graff is stealth wealth at its finest.Millennials can tell time only on their smartphones, right? That\u2019s a clich\u00e9, of course, but Nomos Glash\u00fctte, a lauded German maker, released the chic,budget-friendly Club Campus line for those still paying off their student loans. As a bonus, each one comes with a largely blank case back: just the thing for an inscription celebrating a college graduation or a first job. Rolex\u2019s lower-priced sister brand continues to deliver bang for the buck. With its fixed stainless-steel tachymeter, the new Chrono feels both sporty and vintage. The big news for watch geeks is the new MT5813 movement in collaboration with \u2014 brace yourself \u2014 Breitling. Cooperation, even with rivals, is very Swiss, they say. Maybe that\u2019s how they stay neutral. Two years ago, the dawn of the smartwatch era was the talk of Baselworld. Now the smartwatch simply is. Movado is closing the gap between a stylish watch and a wrist computer with this sleek model, featuring Google\u2019s Android Wear 2.0 platform and five customizable versions of its minimalist Museum dial. At roughly the price of a new Porsche 911, Patek\u2019s latest showstopper is hardly cheap. Then again, it\u2019s Patek. The brand\u2019s well-heeled obsessives are toasting the retro-inflected cream-color dial of this perpetual calendar (which tracks the date for perpetuity, including leap years and months with 28 or 30 days) on a design that recalls Patek classics from the 1940s and 1950s. Hey, at least it\u2019s not priced like a Bentley. Celebrating the 60th anniversary of one of the most famous watches ever (a watch that astronauts would eventually take to the moon), Omega introduced this lovely and letter-perfect homage to the original Speedy, designed from a digital scan of the \u201950s original. It can be purchased individually or as part of the Trilogy collector\u2019s set, along with remakes of the 1957 Seamaster and Railmaster.Unlike more discreet watchmakers, Hublot is not the kind of brand that is going to install a tourbillon \u2014 the grandest of complications \u2014 and keep it hidden under the dial. With this limited-edition statement piece, the rock star of watch brands has included a tourbillon rotating on two axes inside its own display window, for maximum visibility. If you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it. An earlier version of this article misstated the price of the Longines Heritage 1945 watch. It is $1,800, not $1,700.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Hardware Renaissance Grows in Brooklyn \u2014 and Elsewhere", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byStrongArm Technologies, a start-up company in Brooklyn, makes \u201cergo-skeletons\u201d that look a bit like futuristic versions of the back support belts that warehouse workers often wear.Sensors embedded in the devices monitor a worker\u2019s movements, and artificial intelligence software uses that information to suggest rest, stretching or posture changes \u2014 an automated safety coach for preventing back injuries.StrongArm, a fledgling outfit with just 20 employees, is one of a new wave of start-ups making all sorts of devices that offer a glimpse of the future for the manufacturing of high-tech hardware in America\u2019s cities.The company\u2019s home in Brooklyn is a vast, renovated industrial building, where World War II battleships were once made. Now it is dedicated to commercializing digital-age hardware start-ups.On Thursday, New Lab announced that 14 of its companies, including StrongArm, are joining an urban technology initiative with the New York City Economic Development Corporation. The goal is to generate technology for urban challenges ranging from traffic congestion to local food cultivation.That you don\u2019t have to be a giant company to have a good hardware idea has been evident for years at Maker Faire events, where inventors showcase their homemade engineering projects. Last year, more than one million people attended Maker Faire events worldwide.Enthusiastic amateurs can matter a lot in technology. Hobbyists led the personal computer revolution, before it morphed into a huge industry.But progress in hardware \u2014 the messy physical world \u2014 tends to take longer than in the digital-only realm of software. For a decade now, cloud computing and open-source software have drastically lowered the cost of starting a software company. So the number of software start-ups has surged.Now, it seems, is the time for hardware, where a similar phenomenon is getting underway. It is helped by the software trend, but it is really driven by new hardware tools like 3-D printing and laser cutters as well as low-cost, open-source hardware that allows for rapid prototyping that accelerates the pace of development.This nascent hardware resurgence is difficult to measure precisely. The start-ups are working in many industries, from manufacturing to health care, and research analysts typically classify them as entrants in those industries rather than hardware companies.But there are signs of a groundswell of high-tech hardware start-ups, beyond breakout companies like the electric carmaker Tesla and Nest Labs, the digital thermostat company, which Google bought for $3.2 billion and is now a subsidiary of the parent company, Alphabet.Funding is becoming more plentiful from traditional venture capitalists, the venture arms of major corporations and venture funds that are dedicated to hardware start-ups, like Bolt and Lemnos Labs. The companies in New Lab, for example, have raised more than $250 million.For most companies in New Lab, the Brooklyn center is headquarters, and where their design and development are done. As the hardware start-ups grow, how much manufacturing will be done in the city is an open question.New Lab offers hardware makers free or low-cost access to 3-D printers, laser cutters and other manufacturing equipment. That has been a lure for companies like StrongArm.\u201cWhat we do requires a ton of equipment, and that\u2019s what got us in the door,\u201d said Sean Petterson, the company\u2019s 26-year-old co-founder and chief executive.A handful of corporate partners, including General Electric, Intel, JetBlue, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Autodesk, have signed up to work with the New Lab start-ups in various ways.The cities of Copenhagen and Barcelona, Spain, also plan joint innovation programs with the Brooklyn hardware center. And New Lab says it is setting up a fund, New Lab Ventures, to invest in its companies, with a goal of raising $50 million.\u201cWe need to be constantly learning, connecting with new companies coming up, and seeing new business models earlier,\u201d Ms. Comstock said.New Lab itself began as a test-and-learn start-up. In 2013, it created a \u201cbeta\u201d space nearby in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in a building with 8,000 square feet. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t obvious that companies would want to come here,\u201d said David Belt, chief executive of New Lab.But come they did. New Lab has fielded more than 400 applications to select its 80 companies. An idea and enthusiasm are not enough to make the grade. Companies, Mr. Belt explained, must have a product and usually a seed round of funding.Mr. Belt and his partner at New Lab, Scott Cohen, also recruited companies they thought could contribute a lot to their hardware community and mentor younger outfits.Nanotronics Imaging was one of them. The company, founded in 2010, grew out of the research of Matthew Putman, then a scientist at Columbia University. Its automated microscopes employ artificial intelligence and robotics to analyze and detect flaws in high-tech manufacturing for semiconductor, aerospace and other industries.In addition to the 3-D printers and other prototyping equipment at New Lab, Justin Stanwix, chief revenue officer at Nanotronics, said a vital asset of the Brooklyn work space was the connections and idea-swapping to improve manufacturing, tap investors and manage intellectual property.\u201cThat really helps mitigate the risks for these start-up companies,\u201d Mr. Stanwix said.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

Their father remains very involved, but his sons seem determined to rid the company of its roguish, old-guard internal culture and tilt operations toward the digital future. They are working to make the family empire their own, not the one the elder Murdoch created to suit his sensibilities.\u201cThey are both young enough to see and understand that the company has to change,\u201d said Doug Creutz, a media analyst at Cowen and Company. \u201cAt some media companies, there is a feeling that people are being dragged kicking and screaming into the digital future. I don\u2019t get that sense with the brothers at all.\u201dFox executives either did not return calls or declined to comment for this article. But a picture of a new Murdoch era emerged in interviews with more than a dozen people who work at the company or are friendly with James and Lachlan, most of whom spoke anonymously for fear of reprisals.Over his storied career, Rupert Murdoch repeatedly showed that he was willing to trade workplace culture for profits \u2014 ride people hard, overlook putrid behavior as long as the results are there, reward infighting. When his sons took over two years ago, however, they immediately set about creating a warmer and fuzzier workplace, at least in parts of the company, and moving away from an anti-politically correct environment that, at least in the case of Fox News, seemed to enable the kind of behavior of which Mr. Ailes and Mr. O\u2019Reilly have been accused. Both men deny the allegations.Employees at the Fox broadcast network said they were pleasantly surprised, for instance, to be summoned to a town-hall meeting \u2014 something that had rarely if ever been done under the archly conservative Rupert Murdoch \u2014 where the brothers espoused transparency, workplace diversity and greater cooperation between divisions. In the fall, James and Lachlan introduced additional benefits, including more paid vacation, vastly enhanced reproductive coverage for women and \u201cexpanded coverage for our transgender colleagues.\u201dThe brothers concluded the memo on a jaunty note: \u201cEnjoy!\u201dThe brothers have even shaken up 21st Century Fox\u2019s profile in Washington, replacing their father\u2019s Republican lobbying chief with a Democratic one. One Hollywood friend equated their mind-set to moving into an outdated house and looking for wood rot.Still, some of the most dramatic changes at 21st Century Fox over the last two years, including the ouster of Mr. O\u2019Reilly, have been forced on them.As James and Lachlan move to modernize their company, several questions have emerged. The biggest: Can you truly change the culture without losing what made it so successful? It was Rupert\u2019s band-of-pirates mentality that willed the Fox broadcast network into existence, and turned Fox News into a source of astounding profit and political muscle.The brothers eventually rose back to the top. Yet they have not entirely convinced Wall Street analysts that their pairing is workable in the long term. Some people do not see James and Lachlan as equals.\u201cJames has a lot of experience in senior management, and he is capable of running a business,\u201d said Mr. Creutz, the analyst. \u201cLachlan? I don\u2019t know. People don\u2019t know him as well. He is looked at a bit more skeptically by investors.\u201dAnthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, challenged that notion. \u201cAs a manager, Lachlan has grown and developed quite a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the brothers get along well, and that Lachlan\u2019s views are falling into line with James\u2019s.\u201dThe brothers are radically different in style. James is a speed-talking, tightly wound technophile \u2014 cool and calculating, to the degree that he can come across as slick, several associates said. Fashion forward, James socializes with young technology kingpins like Elon Musk, a founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.Lachlan, with his tattooed forearm, avoids the spotlight, rarely popping up in Hollywood watering holes like Tower Bar, where James has a signature table. Lachlan comes across as a more grounded guy\u2019s guy. On his first day as executive chairman, he rolled onto the Fox lot in Los Angeles in a pickup truck.James, the youngest of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s four adult children, has always been seen as bright and willful. He was an earring-wearing rebel in his younger days, dropping out of Harvard in 1995 to found a hip-hop record label, Rawkus Records.But once in the corporate fold \u2014 Rupert bought the rap company \u2014 James made a rapid ascent. At 24, he was put in charge of digital publishing in the United States. At 27, he was sent to Hong Kong to run a television service, Star, which was ailing at the time. (He turned it around, in part by expanding into India.) Three years later, James was installed as chief executive of another family business, British Sky Broadcasting. (Subscriptions soared.)It was at Sky that James pushed through an initiative to make his part of the Murdoch empire carbon neutral. \u201cA lot of people are worried about climate change but are waiting for someone else to do something about it,\u201d he said in a 2006 news release. \u201cWe are showing that you can take action.\u201d He framed it as good business \u2014 to make employees feel good and to win customers by showing that the company\u2019s values were in tune with the times.Kathryn Murdoch has been seen as driving his interest in environmentalism. She worked for the Clinton Climate Initiative and is a trustee of the Environmental Defense Fund.But then came the British phone-hacking scandal, which shut down the family\u2019s News of the World tabloid in 2011. James was never found to have had direct knowledge of the hacking by members of the paper\u2019s staff. But a parliamentary committee investigating the scandal accused him of \u201cwillful ignorance\u201d after he acknowledged that he had failed to read emails that referred to settlement payments made to hacking victims.Lachlan was raised in the United States, graduating from Princeton in 1994. He then spent six years working at his father\u2019s Australian businesses, doing so well that Rupert anointed him \u201cfirst among equals,\u201d which was interpreted as meaning that Lachlan led the succession brigade. (At the time, Rupert also spoke lovingly of Lachlan\u2019s interest in the family news businesses, noting that his son, even as a teenager, would tinker with greasy printing presses.)Lachlan rose to become his father\u2019s deputy chief operating officer and publisher of The New York Post. But he resigned abruptly in July 2005. Lachlan said publicly that he wanted to spend more time in Australia, but most Murdochologists chalked up his departure to friction with his father. Rupert, a workaholic, sided with Mr. Ailes in a turf war and was also annoyed that his eldest son enjoyed lengthy sailing and mountain climbing vacations.Working together will be crucial if 21st Century Fox is going to navigate the shoals ahead.At the moment, 21st Century Fox\u2019s portfolio is relatively healthy. Fox News has continued to dominate in the ratings. The FX cable channel has found a steady stream of hits, including \u201cAtlanta\u201d and \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson.\u201d The Fox broadcast network has struggled to find new must-see shows, but the company\u2019s overseas channels and sports networks are thriving. In its most recent quarter, 21st Century Fox reported income of $856 million, a 27 percent increase from the same period a year earlier.Speaking of those results during a call with analysts in February, Lachlan noted moves the company had made to strengthen its business.\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying this for a while,\u201d he said, \u201cbut actions and outcomes speak louder than words.\u201dElisa Cho contributed research.Advertisement"}

He also wrote on Twitter that stock prices represent \u201crisk-adjusted future cash flows\u201d \u2014 and Tesla is about nothing if not a utopian future of safe, reliable, powerful, self-driving electric vehicles powered by solar-fed batteries that are easy on the environment.In that regard, Tesla has ascended into a rarefied realm of so-called story stocks \u2014 companies that have so bewitched investors that their stock prices are impervious to any traditional valuation measures because their stories are simply too good not to be true.And to the dismay of short-sellers, who believe they have ample rational reasons to bet against such stocks, their share prices can stay in the stratosphere for years, even decades.These story stocks \u2014 the term was coined by James Montier, a value investor and a member of the asset allocation team at the investment management firm GMO \u2014 are relatively rare, but hardly new. Amazon\u2019s stock surged for decades even without any meaningful profits. A more recent example is Snapchat\u2019s parent, Snap, which is racking up large losses while its stock trades at an astronomical price-to-sales ratio of nearly 50, far higher than Tesla\u2019s 7. (Ford\u2019s, by comparison, is 0.3.)Amazon and Snap both have stories that are compelling for many investors: Amazon has transformed retailing and is destined to dominate it. Snap is reinventing communication, at least for millennials and those even younger.Early investors in Uber and Airbnb, though they remain private companies, have valued them at stratospheric multiples based largely on the notion that Uber will transform and dominate local transportation and Airbnb will revolutionize the hotel industry.For story stocks, any development that lends credence to the story can cause a surge in already high valuations. This week Tesla reported quarterly sales that were modestly above expectations, and the stock surged 7 percent in a day. Tesla shares are up nearly 40 percent this year, even though many investors considered them overvalued in January.Ron Baron, the billionaire investor and founder of Baron Capital, disclosed last year that he owned about 1.6 million Tesla shares. He predicted on CNBC in February that Tesla shares would quadruple by 2020 and triple again by 2025. By then he expects Tesla to become the largest company in the world as measured by market capitalization.For all the excitement and promise surrounding such companies, there are many cautionary tales.\u201cStories are great before bed, but are disastrous as a stock-selection technique,\u201d Mr. Montier wrote in his 2009 book \u201cValue Investing: Tools and Techniques for Intelligent Investment.\u201d If something is expensive based on traditional valuation metrics, he said, \u201cyou had better believe its story, as that is all you have.\u201d(A Tesla spokeswoman said Mr. Musk could not be reached for comment.)Various studies have shown that stocks with high price-to-sales ratios, on average, significantly underperform market averages. For every Tesla or Uber, there\u2019s a Valeant Pharmaceuticals or Theranos \u2014 two story stocks that seduced an astounding array of prominent investors and supporters based on stories that did turn out to be too good to be true.And while many investors\u2019 memories tend to be short, the so-called dot-com bubble in the late 1990s spawned scores of story stocks, nearly all of them now worthless and forgotten.Still, Mr. Montier acknowledged, \u201cStories are compelling.\u201d They appeal to intuition rather than reason. \u201cBut perhaps investors would be well advised to follow Odysseus\u2019s example of putting beeswax in his crew\u2019s ears and tying himself to the mast in order to avoid the disastrous, but oh so desirable, call of the Siren song.\u201dWill Tesla be one of the rare exceptions and, as Mr. Baron has predicted, emerge as the world\u2019s most valuable company?The company has won over many skeptics with its near-flawless execution, so far, and the high quality of its vehicles and high levels of consumer satisfaction. It is no longer a start-up: It delivered 25,000 vehicles in the last quarter. It is on track to achieve economies of scale, and the company says the gross margin on each vehicle is above 20 percent, far higher than the industry average. That could drive enormous future profits.But that\u2019s not the Tesla story \u2014 or stories \u2014 investors are betting on.Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley automotive analyst who is hardly a starry-eyed optimist about the industry, upgraded Tesla shares to overweight in January. He singles out the company\u2019s new autonomous driving technology as a compelling safety feature that will significantly reduce occupant and pedestrian injuries and fatalities. This week he said he expected \u201cvehicle safety to be the primary differentiator in Tesla\u2019s upcoming product offensive,\u201d referring to the eagerly anticipated introduction of Tesla\u2019s new, lower-price Model 3, which will be equipped with the new technology.That Tesla is an all-electric, environmentally friendly, nonfossil-fuel vehicle \u2014 the story that once excited investors \u2014 is barely mentioned anymore.Even more futuristic is the idea that Tesla cars will be entirely self-driving, able to cruise streets nearly full time (except when they are being charged at Tesla\u2019s high-speed battery-charging stations). In this vision, Tesla owners will share their vehicles with Tesla when not using them, and during that time they will ferry other passengers, serving as Tesla\u2019s version of Uber. Thus Tesla will disrupt Uber\u2019s nascent market dominance.And Tesla is no longer seen just as a vehicle manufacturer. With its solar and battery technologies, it is in a position to dominate two other enormous industry segments. Tesla \u201cis reinventing the electric grid,\u201d as Mr. Baron said on CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s a bigger opportunity than cars.\u201dEven if all that comes to pass, it may not be enough to justify Tesla\u2019s valuation unless it can sustain a competitive advantage over time, as Mr. Greenwald, the value investing expert, put it. Tesla is spending heavily on research and development, and perhaps its technology will be difficult or impossible for others to replicate. The established automakers have had years to catch up to or overtake Tesla\u2019s Model S, with a conspicuous lack of success.But for committed value investors, the writing is on the wall: \u201cIs Tesla going to dominate its industry? That\u2019s the key question,\u201d Mr. Greenwald said. \u201cWhen it comes to the global auto industry, no one ever has, and in all likelihood, no one ever will.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brands Tackle an Online Foe: The Meme", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingMemes \u2014 those playful, satirical photographs with clever, sometimes biting captions under them \u2014 have long been used on the internet to ridicule the latest celebrity gaffe or highlight a political misstep. However, a surging number of disgruntled consumers are now using memes to target companies to complain about broken products, poor customer service and other negative experiences.That has big brands scrambling for cover. After all, the viral nature of a meme can have a faster and farther-reaching impact than a single news article.\u201cThe brand becomes a temporary punching bag for many, many people,\u201d said Jay Baer, the founder and president of Convince & Convert, a digital marketing advisory firm. \u201cPeople will pile on even if they haven\u2019t actually been aggrieved.\u201dWhen a Tesla Model S electric car erupted in flames in 2013, memes immediately popped up. One showed a young couple holding each other outside a burning Tesla car, with the caption \u201cKeep warm on a cold night.\u201dTesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, quickly confronted the issue on the company\u2019s blog. He explained that the car had driven over a large metal object from a tractor-trailer, and he rattled off statistics that showed people were five times as likely to experience a fire in a gas-powered car as in a Tesla. The memes soon stopped.It was the perfect response, said David Pachter, a co-founder of JumpCrew, a social marketing firm in Nashville. \u201cBut not every company has an Elon Musk,\u201d he said.There wasn\u2019t much the company could do to stop the memes as phones continued to catch fire over many months, and the company ultimately pulled the device altogether.\u201cWhat are you going to say? \u2018Yep, they catch on fire. Almost all of them do. Sorry,\u2019\u201d Mr. Baer said. \u201cThere\u2019s just no good way to put that.\u201dLast month, Samsung pushed the reset button when it unveiled its new Samsung Galaxy S8 phone and virtual reality headset \u2014 and simultaneously released a #DoWhatYouCant video, which became a hit online. The video features an ostrich that dreams of flying, thanks to the Samsung VR headset and phone. The bird stumbles, before ultimately soaring in the sky. The video had more than 1.3 million views on YouTube in its first 24 hours.\u201cThey\u2019ve packaged a brilliant ad with an inspirational message,\u201d said Monica G. Sakala, the founder of SOMA Strategies, a digital agency based in Washington. \u201cThey\u2019re successfully changing the story away from the fire memes and disaster of the last phone.\u201dIn general, experts recommend that companies try to address disgruntled customers directly \u2014 and the sooner, the better. They suggest that companies use \u201csocial listening\u201d software to monitor mentions of their brands \u2014 not just on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, but also on message boards, like Reddit and Tumblr, and other internet forums. If a meme shows up on a forum, it\u2019s easy to contact the person directly before it goes viral.\u201cWhen you reach out on a one-to-one level, it\u2019s amazing how frequently you can resolve that situation positively,\u201d Mr. Pachter said. \u201cBut if you let it go, it just breeds like a virus.\u201dIf a meme does go viral, sometimes countering with another meme works.When a Chevrolet executive nervously stepped up to the microphone after the decisive World Series game in 2014 to present a new Chevy Colorado to the most valuable player of the Series, he breathed heavily, fumbled with his notes and then went off script: \u201cIt combines class-winning and leading, ummm, you know, technology and stuff.\u201d\u201cTwitter just went crazy,\u201d said Melissa Schreiber, a senior vice president of social strategy at FleishmanHillard, whose team worked with Chevrolet. She and her team opted to embrace the trend by adding its own meme to the mix that night: \u201cTruck yeah the 2015 #ChevyColorado has awesome #TechnologyAndStuff! You know you want a truck.\u201dThere was a surge in traffic to Chevy\u2019s website and more than $5 million in earned media exposure, Ms. Schreiber said.\u201cWe didn\u2019t try to stop the conversation from happening,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just chose the direction that we wanted to shift the conversation.\u201dAnd each time they did it, there was a Dos Equis bottle front and center.Some companies are creating their own memes to market products. In March, Gucci rolled out a collection of quirky memes to promote its new collection of watches. Some applauded the effort while others questioned why Gucci would be making memes to appeal to millennials, who most likely couldn\u2019t afford an $850 watch.Even if millennials can\u2019t afford the watches today, the campaign is all about leaving a lasting impression, said Amanda Ford, a senior art director at Ready Set Rocket, a New York digital agency. \u201cEven if it\u2019s years before they can buy something from Gucci, they may remember, \u2018Hey, this brand gets me.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
