{"Headline": "Meet the Foreign Tech Workers Left in Limbo by Trump", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "They are app makers, they are podcasters, and they are also H-1B visa holders \u2014 possibly putting them at risk from the president\u2019s immigration policies.Supported byAt dawn in California\u2019s Bay Area, the river of commuters begins to flow. It is filled with the people who help make our smartphones, our favorite games, the apps we download.But many have also come to make something else, perhaps \u2014 a new life in America.Often, they hope to call the United States home.\u201cWhat I have loved about the U.S. is that it didn\u2019t matter where you came from,\u201d Mr Gopal said. \u201cYour past, your color or religion didn\u2019t matter. If you did good work, there was a place for you here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always on guard because there is a chance that suddenly I\u2019ll get the news that I\u2019m no longer welcome,\u201d said Mr. Gopal, 32, who first came to the United States in 2012.Like many of Silicon Valley\u2019s workers who are here as part of the H-1B visa program, which is aimed at highly skilled workers, Mr. Gopal was born in India, attended university in the United States and got a job at a tech company. He said the Bay Area attracts the smartest engineers from all over the world because it is known as \u201ca magnet for technical skill.\u201dWhile growing up in India, Mr. Gopal was a fan of American television shows and cartoons. After he graduated from Carnegie Mellon University, he was excited to take his parents to Disneyland.H-1B visa holders account for about 15 percent of the American work forces at Facebook and Qualcomm, according to the most recent documents the companies have filed with the Labor Department. Silicon Valley start-ups, which often drive tech innovation, employ many engineers on student and work visas, as do tech giants like Google and Apple.Some visa holders, like Sujay Jaladi, have been in America for so long that they cannot imagine living elsewhere. Mr. Jaladi, 35, has lived here for 15 years, first on a student visa and then on a series of H-1B visas. He applied for a green card in 2012 and is waiting for the application to be approved. His wife, Priya, also holds an H-1B visa and works at a tech company.\u201cMy family lives in India and I love that country,\u201d said Mr. Jaladi, \u201cbut I have spent my adult life in the United States and it definitely feels like more of a home to me.\u201dMr. Jaladi commutes an hour each day to work as the head of information security at Gusto, a company that provides human resources services to small businesses. He enjoys meals at home and weekend shopping trips to Costco. He and his wife love to cook.But visas are always on his mind, along with the possibility that he may have to return to India.\u201cOur ability to stay in the U.S., with good standing, depends on the visa process,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking hard is just one factor. If the financial markets are hit and your job lays people off, H-1B visa holders have a limited time to find another job and get into good standing before we have to leave the country. If the market is down and jobs numbers are low, there will be more H-1Bs in the market looking for jobs.\u201dMr. Jaladi isn\u2019t the only one who has found himself in immigration limbo at Gusto. Shub Jain, a 26-year-old software engineer there, graduated from the University of California, San Diego, in 2014, worked at Microsoft and last fall moved to San Francisco for a job at the H.R. start-up. He has been working on an extended student visa and has lost out on the H-1B visa lottery three times. This is the last year he will be eligible to apply. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave the country.\u201dMr. Jain\u2019s life is like that of many 20-something professionals. He loves cars and driving around California, as well as exploring new restaurants with friends. But the feeling of welcome he has always experienced in the United States has shifted as politicians have changed their views on immigration.\u201cMy conversations with friends have changed,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to look at the news every morning, but now I don\u2019t because I don\u2019t want it to impact my work. I look at night. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll read.\u201dLike many tech employees, Mr. Jain took a gamble on a smaller start-up. But his decision came with extra risk. At Microsoft, he could deal with visa issues by relocating to one of the company\u2019s many global offices. He does not have that option at Gusto.Mr. Jain talks about his anxieties with teammates like Nicholas Gervasi, 32, a Canadian who is working at Gusto on an H-1B visa. Thanks to provisions under the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Gervasi has had an easier time living and working in the United States than his colleagues from India, and he expects his green card application to be approved soon.Mr. Jain\u2019s sister attended the University of Illinois, worked on a trading floor in Chicago and left the country after she was unable to get an H1-B visa. She has since started her own company and talks to Mr. Jain almost every day as he prepares himself for the possibility that he will have to leave.Because of his uncertain situation, Mr. Jain\u2019s best friend from college recently visited for a month to play video games, go on drives and spend as much time together as they could.Some critics of the H-1B visa program say there are more than enough Americans with technology degrees to fill all the technical jobs in the United States. Others say that Silicon Valley companies do not cast a wide enough net for American job candidates. But tech executives have long said that there are not enough Americans with the advanced math and science skills necessary to succeed at their companies.Mr. Gervasi said that companies \u201cshould be empowered to hire the best people.\u201d Joshua Reeves, the chief executive and founder of Gusto, agreed, noting that 8 percent of his work force is on a visa or green card. Gusto\u2019s hiring policy has never taken a candidate\u2019s citizenship into account, and Mr. Reeves said the company was \u201ccommitted to sticking to that mind-set.\u201dThat commitment could be tested over the next few years, given that the White House is continuously looking for ways to curb immigration as it seeks to enact America-first policies.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like living under this \u2014 maybe not fear \u2014 but a worry about what\u2019s next and what will happen,\u201d Mr. Jain said. \u201cThis feeling of being unwelcome in the country. I hadn\u2019t really felt that before.\u201dVindu Goel contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

I still love SEXY AND I KNOW IT ... yes, I\u2019m totally a dork for getting excited about a trashy song from 2011, but it brings back so many memories for me!

{"Headline": "A McDonald\u2019s Ad That Never Mentions the Name McDonald\u2019s", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byThe latest television commercials for McDonald\u2019s, featuring the actress Mindy Kaling, do not appear on the company\u2019s YouTube channel, Facebook page or Twitter account. In fact, they don\u2019t mention McDonald\u2019s at all \u2014 though they do mention Coca-Cola and Google.The ads, which started running last week, are meant to play on how teens and twentysomethings use their phones while watching TV, while also acknowledging \u201chow they\u2019re discovering information\u201d they trust, said Deborah Wahl, chief marketing officer of McDonald\u2019s for the United States. \u201cThey are very influenced by word of mouth and what their peers say,\u201d she said.Ms. Kaling posted to Twitter on Friday that she recently \u201cpartnered with a brand without being able to say the name of the brand,\u201d and jokingly asked to be paid in fries.\u201cGoogle didn\u2019t give us any tricks on search or anything,\u201d Ms. Wahl said, adding that gaming the system would have gone against the whole idea of the campaign. \u201cWhat they\u2019re helping us do is understand if people are really searching as a result of this, and offering close feedback and collaboration in terms of what\u2019s happening with this with real behavior.\u201dMs. Wahl said the company is prepared for people to try to interfere with the results, which is by now a hallmark of ad campaigns that involve social media. But, she said, it was anticipating a positive reaction given the conversations about Coke and McDonald\u2019s that were already out there. (Burger King, which relied on the Wikipedia entry for one of its burgers as part of its stunt, saw several mischievous revisions of that page last week.)Selecting Ms. Kaling as a pitchwoman for this campaign was also a deliberate choice, Ms. Wahl said, noting that she has been a vocal fan of the brand for years. Indeed, Ms. Kaling wrote in her 2015 book \u201cWhy Not Me?\u201d that McDonald\u2019s once sent her a stack of $10 gift cards on her birthday.\u201cIf you follow me on any kind of social media you will see that I\u2019m constantly eating McDonald\u2019s, and not in a campy, skinny-actress way where I go when I\u2019m on my period and \u2018being bad!\u2019\u201d she wrote in the book. \u201cI go regularly enough that the woman at the Crescent Heights & Sunset McDonald\u2019s gives me ranch and buffalo sauce packets for my McNuggets without me having to ask.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What I Wish I\u2019d Known Before Moving in Together", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byWhen my boyfriend, Mike DiPasquale, asked me to move in with him after two years of dating, I was thrilled. Even though I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what I was signing up for.Just the prospect of no longer needing to keep two bottles of contact lens solution, two toothbrushes and two sticks of deodorant in two separate homes was enough to have me jumping for joy. Visions of plush rugs, soft lighting and cuddling in front of a fireplace filled my head.Friends and family didn\u2019t give me much practical advice before I moved into Mike\u2019s condo, a third-floor studio inside a former South Philadelphia Catholic elementary school. His mother attended school here in the early 1960s; we boil pasta, play video games and take showers in what was once her seventh-grade classroom.My mother gave us a $100 gift certificate to Crate and Barrel, but she didn\u2019t tell me what to anticipate.I Googled \u201cMoving in with your boyfriend,\u201d but the search results landed with a thud. The advice was dry and didn\u2019t speak to my concerns: How do I know if I\u2019m picking a compatible person to move in with? What if he\u2019s annoyed by my hourlong phone calls with my sister, the sweatpants I wear around the house, or the insane amount of hair I shed on every available surface?It\u2019s clear why couples find cohabitation so appealing. Aside from the convenience it affords, the prospect of splitting rent and utility bills is too seductive to pass up. Add in a desire to shed roommates and a reluctance to renew a pricey lease, and you can see why plenty of couples choose cohabitation, even if they aren\u2019t exactly sure what comes next.I was so focused on the elation of moving in with Mike that I didn\u2019t even consider what would happen if our relationship went down in flames. We had never discussed who would stay in the condo, who would take possession of the Passat we leased together, or which one of us would get to keep our three-legged cat, Eleanor.Turns out we\u2019re not alone. Most couples don\u2019t take the time to walk through the financial and legal implications of cohabitation beforehand. According to leading legal and financial experts, that\u2019s a major mistake and a missed opportunity.If you are renting or own a home, figure out who will stay in the event of a breakup. Nail down who will pay any pesky fees or taxes. Come up with a plan.In light of this practical advice, I pushed Mike to discuss what would happen if we should break up.Initially, he was reluctant to discuss the possibility. He said he\u2019d be so devastated that he would start a new life from scratch. While I appreciated the drama of his response, we still needed to develop a road map.Since Mike had owned his condo before we started dating, we agreed he should continue to live in it. I volunteered to move in with my parents until I found a more permanent place. I\u2019d keep the Passat and pay the remaining payments on the lease. And Eleanor would stay with me. (I was thrilled I could keep the cat, but I didn\u2019t want to cheer too loudly.)After we settled on the details of our dissolution, we gave each other a long hug.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to think five steps ahead,\u201d Ms. Friedman said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no fun at first. Then it becomes a project you can work on together.\u201dApart from thorny financial and legal concerns, cohabitation creates a new set of emotional constraints for couples as well.\u201cWhen you live together,\u201d Dr. Rhoades explained, \u201cyou face all the issues dating couples face \u2014 time together, managing friends, jealousy, ex-partners \u2014 but you also face all the issues married couples face, like household contributions, managing money together and planning for future expenditures.\u201dIt can be an especially risky undertaking if the couple immediately goes from a long-distance relationship to cohabitation. Katie Leggett and Allen Hotchkiss did just that. The couple dated for over a year while Ms. Leggett lived in the West Village and Mr. Hotchkiss lived in Chicago. Then they moved into an apartment together in Park Slope, Brooklyn.\u201cWe knew we could get more bang for our buck if we just took the plunge and moved in together when my lease was up, versus getting separate studios, or dealing with roommates for another year in our late 20s,\u201d Ms. Leggett said. \u201cIt was definitely an adjustment.\u201d\u201cThere were very few surprises upon moving in with each other,\u201d Mr. Hotchkiss recalled. \u201cTalking about all of the possible \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios is the only way to make sure living together is the right move.\u201dA self-confessed Type A germophobe, Ms. Leggett follows a strict set of rules: No shoes in the house and no clothes that have been worn on the subways on the bed. She showers twice a day.Mr. Hotchkiss is more laid back. \u201cFor me, it was about picking the right battles and respecting Katie\u2019s key points of contention, like taking my shoes off at the door or not wearing my \u2018subway clothes\u2019 on the bed,\u201d Mr. Hotchkiss said. This willingness to meet in the middle eased the transition considerably.Mike and I slid into certain habits when it came to chores. I\u2019m happiest food shopping, cooking meals and emptying the dishwasher. Mike prefers washing the dishes, doing the laundry, making the bed and taking out the trash.We were happy to assign chores based on whoever expressed more enthusiasm. However it quickly became evident that our cleanliness standards are wildly different.Mike can spot a sesame seed five yards away, and he folds his T-shirts into precise, flat squares. I leave a trail of crumbs in my wake, and my clothes are not so much folded as herded into a vague rectangle. We had to adjust our standards. I\u2019m learning to sweep up my errant crumbs, and he\u2019s learning to live with a little chaos.And I knew Mike detested clutter, but we didn\u2019t have any discussions about how we would adjust his 874-square-foot space to fit both our physical needs. Apparently, this lack of conversation around design is also very common.After a year of dating, Armando Morales and Annie Simeone decided it was silly for them both to be paying New York City rents, especially since hers was twice what he paid. Last June they figured they could make it work in Mr. Morales\u2019s apartment in Ridgewood, Queens, pending a drastic reworking of the space.Fortunately, Ms. Simeone works as a production designer for film and television. She created a rendering of the apartment and its furniture layout using a three-dimensional modeling program, which allowed her to envision various floor plans. Mr. Morales crafted custom shelving so they could save even more space.\u201cWe have a classic New York railroad, with a kitchen on one end and the bedroom on the other. In between is an office and a living room,\u201d Mr. Morales said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for a couple in that you can be together but also have separate space when you need it.\u201dAnother reason couples choose to cohabitate is to spend more time together. It\u2019s been interesting to see how Mike and I use that time.Like most modern couples, we are never far away from our cellphones. We\u2019re quick to browse social media at the slightest lull in conversation. I prefer to scroll through Facebook while he\u2019s more of a Twitter guy. Over time, I sensed that our willingness to plug in (and ignore each other) was affecting the quality of our interactions.If you\u2019re doing something mindless with your partner, like watching TV, just focus on that. Don\u2019t also check your work email, play Candy Crush or do anything else to draw your attention away from each other.\u201cYour partner can be a source of deep and lasting joy, connection, meaning, fulfillment,\u201d Dr. Carter said. \u201cYour phone cannot.\u201dIn the end, some of my initial concerns proved silly. Mike doesn\u2019t mind that I shed like Mr. Snuffleupagus in August. When I conduct marathon phone calls with my sister, he catches up on his social media apps. He\u2019s happy to scrub the toilet, as long as I clean the shower.We are stronger for taking this step and navigating our sandwich phase \u2014 this premarriage, postdating bubble \u2014 with clear eyes.Having those difficult talks about our finances and being more mindful of the space we share, the chores we perform and the habits we cultivate, we\u2019re well on our way to creating a happy home.After living together for two years \u2014 and after countless loads of laundry and a dizzying number of dishwasher cycles \u2014 Mike and I tied the knot on April 21, 2017. Eleanor is thrilled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Growth in Pizza, Paint and Credit-Card Companies", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byGrowth stocks \u2014 those whose earnings are expected to grow faster than average \u2014 surged in the first quarter. They carried with them the managers of several of the quarter\u2019s top-performing stock funds.Those managers grabbed onto that growth in expected sorts of companies, like Alphabet and Facebook, and in more surprising and mature ones like MasterCard, Domino\u2019s and Sherwin-Williams.The funds are also unified by a philosophy, Mr. Lynch said.\u201cWhat we do is try to buy good growth companies and own them for many years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look very different from any benchmark. We have differentiated holdings, and we take concentrated positions. And with that, comes some volatility.\u201d Shares of Amazon and Facebook, for example, each accounted for about 9 percent of the Growth fund\u2019s assets at the end of February.Morningstar\u2019s numbers bear out Mr. Lynch\u2019s points. The three funds\u2019 turnover ratios, indicating the percentage of holdings sold annually, are below average, while their risk ratings are above. Put differently, the funds tend to trade less than average, but their returns tend to roller-coaster more than the indexes they\u2019re benchmarked against.A characteristic shared by many of the funds\u2019 holdings is that they can be tough to pigeonhole in a conventional investment sector, like technology or health care, Mr. Lynch said. \u201cIf there\u2019s not an easy category or comparison, then the company is more likely unique,\u201d he said.Take Alphabet, the holding company for Google. Many people call it a tech company, but it makes its money from advertising, which would traditionally point to media. \u201cThey used the internet to create a large audience and then disrupted the advertising world,\u201d he said.The largest and, in the most recent quarter, best performing of the three Morgan Stanley funds was the Growth fund. The fund, whose A shares carry an expense ratio of 0.96 percent, returned 16.25 percent for the quarter, compared with 5.5 percent for the S.&P. 500-stock index.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to identify two to three dozen high-growth companies whose stocks have little to do with one another,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then let that growth germinate. We\u2019re trying to invest in companies for three or four years.\u201dAnother point of emphasis is ensuring the returns of the fund\u2019s investments are not correlated with one another. The managers do that by using both statistical screens and fundamental analyses of how businesses may interact in unexpected ways, Mr. Galvin said. It is also one of the reasons they limit the portfolio\u2019s size. After about 35 stocks, he said, correlations in stock prices start to rise. \u201cEither the companies are competing with each other, or they\u2019re impacted by the same macroeconomic trends,\u201d he said.One of the qualities that drew Mr. Galvin and his colleagues to Domino\u2019s, the pizza delivery chain, was that its size and strong financials have enabled it to invest heavily in technology. And that has differentiated it from independent pizza peddlers, he said.\u201cThe digital divide is finally separating them from the mom-and-pop operators,\u201d he said. \u201cWith digital, you tap the app and have a pizza delivered, along with other menu items. Local operators don\u2019t have the financial wherewithal to invest in that kind of technology.\u201dMr. Galvin and his team divide their holdings into two groups: established companies, like Domino\u2019s, and emerging ones, like biotechnology outfits. The former \u201cprovide ballast to the portfolio,\u201d and the latter, opportunities for outsized returns, he said.\u201cWhen you have about half the portfolio in each of those, it blends out at an 18 to 22 percent level\u201d of average earnings growth, he said.The Columbia fund, whose A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.08 percent, returned 15.6 percent in the first quarter.\u201cI was just trading too much, and I didn\u2019t think I was that good at trading,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m doing good work, I should recognize mistakes, but I should also let the ideas develop.\u201d That means selling when he\u2019s sure an investment has gone bad but also hanging on through down periods if he is confident in a company\u2019s plans and prospects.Like any growth manager, Mr. Weiner hunts for strong, sustainable earnings growth. That has led him to put more than a third of the portfolio in technology stocks, like Facebook and Amazon. But it can also lead him into less obvious plays like the paint company Sherwin-Williams.\u201cThe paint-store business is huge and consistent and grows nicely year in and year out,\u201d he said. Sherwin-Williams caters to professional painters, and they\u2019re loyal in return. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go to Home Depot,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want 30-day terms.\u201d That is, they want to finance purchases for a month, rather than paying upfront.The business has pricing power, too, he said. The actual paint is a small enough portion of the cost of most paint jobs that the final consumer is not that sensitive to changes in price. \u201cPeople hire a painter and get a quote and have no idea what the cost of paint is in the quote,\u201d Mr. Weiner said.The Growth Discovery Fund, with an expense ratio of 0.78 percent, returned 12.15 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}

Netflix has a little over 250 horror movies, many of them classics \u2014 \u201cThe Legend of Hell House,\u201d from 1973, loomed large in my early-teen years, because it\u2019s really scary, and also because it touched off my lifelong crush on the actress Pamela Franklin. But some of them aren\u2019t horror movies at all: \u201cScary Movie 2,\u201d from 2001, is a parody of horror movies; last year\u2019s \u201cYoga Hosers\u201d is just an actual horror.Screambox is very full-throttle and fan-oriented, with not just horror fare but also documentaries celebrating the likes of the \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d franchise. The grind-house nostalgist in me was delighted to find two 1981 obscurities: the Italian filmmaker Lucio Fulci\u2019s mortifying gorefest \u201cThe Beyond\u201d and \u201cThe Nesting,\u201d an interesting novelty in which the New York sexploitation filmmaker Armand Weston tried to go mainstream, with mixed results. (It also happens to be the American \u201940s and \u201950s screen siren Gloria Grahame\u2019s final film, and one you are unlikely to see on TCM.) Screambox and Shudder are not exactly replete with transcendent masterpieces, and honestly, neither are Acorn and UMC. But even the most refined viewer knows that masterpieces are not always the point. Digging for something is half the fun.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Built on Steel, Pittsburgh Now Thrives on Culture", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byFrugal TravelerOf all the things to love about Pittsburgh, its bridges are perhaps the most visible. There are over 440 bridges, an astounding number for a city of 300,000 people \u2014 hence its nickname City of Bridges. I was standing on the Roberto Clemente Bridge, named after the great Pirates outfielder, looking up the Allegheny River at two other huge, majestic steel bridges: the Andy Warhol and the Rachel Carson. The three pale-mustard-color suspension bridges, known as the Three Sisters, are part of a system without which Pittsburgh, which meets at the convergence of the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio Rivers, would be a fractured collection of neighborhoods.\u201cIf there were a hundred within a hundred miles, there\u2019s maybe half a dozen left,\u201d said Robert Dubrosky, an Uber driver and a former worker at Akers National Roll in Avonmore, Pa., about 35 miles outside Pittsburgh. \u201cWe made the rolls that rolled out the steel.\u201d When I asked Mr. Dubrosky if he liked Pittsburgh today, he said that he liked it well enough. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot cleaner than it used to be, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d he said.The musicianship of the group was solid, and the crowd, which mingled in the basement-rec-room atmosphere, was an interesting mix of generations.

{"Headline": "How Uber Uses Psychological Tricks to Push Its Drivers\u2019 Buttons", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "The secretive ride-hailing giant Uber rarely discusses internal matters in public. But in March, facing crises on multiple fronts, top officials convened a call for reporters to insist that Uber was changing its culture and would no longer tolerate \u201cbrilliant jerks.\u201dNotably, the company also announced that it would fix its troubled relationship with drivers, who have complained for years about falling pay and arbitrary treatment.And yet even as Uber talks up its determination to treat drivers more humanely, it is engaged in an extraordinary behind-the-scenes experiment in behavioral science to manipulate them in the service of its corporate growth \u2014 an effort whose dimensions became evident in interviews with several dozen current and former Uber officials, drivers and social scientists, as well as a review of behavioral research.Uber\u2019s innovations reflect the changing ways companies are managing workers amid the rise of the freelance-based \u201cgig economy.\u201d Its drivers are officially independent business owners rather than traditional employees with set schedules. This allows Uber to minimize labor costs, but means it cannot compel drivers to show up at a specific place and time. And this lack of control can wreak havoc on a service whose goal is to seamlessly transport passengers whenever and wherever they want.Uber helps solve this fundamental problem by using psychological inducements and other techniques unearthed by social science to influence when, where and how long drivers work. It\u2019s a quest for a perfectly efficient system: a balance between rider demand and driver supply at the lowest cost to passengers and the company.Employing hundreds of social scientists and data scientists, Uber has experimented with video game techniques, graphics and noncash rewards of little value that can prod drivers into working longer and harder \u2014 and sometimes at hours and locations that are less lucrative for them.To keep drivers on the road, the company has exploited some people\u2019s tendency to set earnings goals \u2014 alerting them that they are ever so close to hitting a precious target when they try to log off. It has even concocted an algorithm similar to a Netflix feature that automatically loads the next program, which many experts believe encourages binge-watching. In Uber\u2019s case, this means sending drivers their next fare opportunity before their current ride is even over.And most of this happens without giving off a whiff of coercion.\u201cWe show drivers areas of high demand or incentivize them to drive more,\u201d said Michael Amodeo, an Uber spokesman. \u201cBut any driver can stop work literally at the tap of a button \u2014 the decision whether or not to drive is 100 percent theirs.\u201dBut an examination by The New York Times found that Uber is continuing apace in its struggle to wield the upper hand with drivers. And as so-called platform-mediated work like driving for Uber increasingly becomes the way people make a living, the company\u2019s example illustrates that pulling psychological levers may eventually become the reigning approach to managing the American worker.Of course, many companies try to nudge consumers into buying their products and services using psychological tricks. But extending these efforts to the work force is potentially transformative.Uber exists in a kind of legal and ethical purgatory, however. Because its drivers are independent contractors, they lack most of the protections associated with employment. By mastering their workers\u2019 mental circuitry, Uber and the like may be taking the economy back toward a pre-New Deal era when businesses had enormous power over workers and few checks on their ability to exploit it.In early 2016, a group of roughly 100 Uber employees responsible for signing up drivers and getting them to drive more voted to change its name \u2014 from \u201csupply growth\u201d to \u201cdriver growth.\u201dThe vote was not unprompted. For much of the previous year, Uber executives had agonized over how to lower the rate at which drivers were deserting the platform.Alongside Uber\u2019s already daunting targets for expanding its pool of drivers to meet mounting demand, the high turnover threatened to cap the company\u2019s growth and throw it into crisis.Uber conducted interviews and focus groups while executives peppered employees with questions like, \u201cWhat are we doing to have more empathy for the driver side of the equation?\u201dThis is particularly true of shortages so pronounced as to create a \u201csurge\u201d \u2014 that is, a higher fare than normal. While surges do mitigate shortages, they do so in part by repelling passengers, something directly at odds with Uber\u2019s long-term goal of dominating the industry. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s better not to surge,\u201d said Daniel Graf, Uber\u2019s vice president of product. \u201cIf we don\u2019t surge, we can produce more rides.\u201dAs a result, much of Uber\u2019s communication with drivers over the years has aimed at combating shortages by advising drivers to move to areas where they exist, or where they might arise. Uber encouraged its local managers to experiment with ways of achieving this.\u201cIt was all day long, every day \u2014 texts, emails, pop-ups: \u2018Hey, the morning rush has started. Get to this area, that\u2019s where demand is biggest,\u2019\u201d said Ed Frantzen, a veteran Uber driver in the Chicago area. \u201cIt was always, constantly, trying to get you into a certain direction.\u201dSome local managers who were men went so far as to adopt a female persona for texting drivers, having found that the uptake was higher when they did.\u201c\u2018Laura\u2019 would tell drivers: \u2018Hey, the concert\u2019s about to let out. You should head over there,\u2019\u201d said John P. Parker, a manager in Uber\u2019s Dallas office in 2014 and 2015, referring to one of the personas. \u201cWe have an overwhelmingly male driver population.\u201dUber acknowledged that it had experimented with female personas to increase engagement with drivers.The friction over meeting demand was compounded by complaints about arrangements like aggressive car leases that required many drivers to work upward of 50 or 60 hours each week to eke out a profit. Uber officials began to worry that a driver backlash was putting them at a strategic disadvantage in their competition with Lyft, which had cultivated a reputation for being more driver-friendly.Now Uber began a process of, in effect, becoming a little less like Mr. Kalanick, and a little more like Lyft.It rethought a lease program, softened the hectoring tone of its messages and limited their volume. At times it became positively cheery.During roughly the same period, Uber was increasingly concerned that many new drivers were leaving the platform before completing the 25 rides that would earn them a signing bonus. To stem that tide, Uber officials in some cities began experimenting with simple encouragement: You\u2019re almost halfway there, congratulations!While the experiment seemed warm and innocuous, it had in fact been exquisitely calibrated. The company\u2019s data scientists had previously discovered that once drivers reached the 25-ride threshold, their rate of attrition fell sharply.And psychologists and video game designers have long known that encouragement toward a concrete goal can motivate people to complete a task.\u201cIt\u2019s getting you to internalize the company\u2019s goals,\u201d said Chelsea Howe, a prominent video game designer who has spoken out against coercive psychological techniques deployed in games. \u201cInternalized motivation is the most powerful kind.\u201dMr. Amodeo, the Uber spokesman, defended the practice. \u201cWe try to make the early experience as good as possible, but also as realistic as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to decide for themselves if driving is right for them.\u201dThat making drivers feel good could be compatible with treating them as lab subjects was no surprise. None other than Lyft itself had shown as much several years earlier.In 2013, the company hired a consulting firm to figure out how to encourage more driving during the platform\u2019s busiest hours.At the time, Lyft drivers could voluntarily sign up in advance for shifts. The consultants devised an experiment in which the company showed one group of inexperienced drivers how much more they would make by moving from a slow period like Tuesday morning to a busy time like Friday night \u2014 about $15 more per hour.For another group, Lyft reversed the calculation, displaying how much drivers were losing by sticking with Tuesdays.The latter had a more significant effect on increasing the hours drivers scheduled during busy periods.Still, Ms. Berman disclosed in an interview, Lyft eventually decided against using the loss-aversion approach, suggesting that the company has drawn brighter lines when it comes to potential manipulation.As he tried to log off at 7:13 a.m. on New Year\u2019s Day last year, Josh Streeter, then an Uber driver in the Tampa, Fla., area, received a message on the company\u2019s driver app with the headline \u201cMake it to $330.\u201d The text then explained: \u201cYou\u2019re $10 away from making $330 in net earnings. Are you sure you want to go offline?\u201d Below were two prompts: \u201cGo offline\u201d and \u201cKeep driving.\u201d The latter was already highlighted.\u201cI\u2019ve got screen shots with dozens of these messages,\u201d said Mr. Streeter, who began driving full time for Lyft and then Uber in 2014 but quit last year to invest in real estate.Mr. Streeter was not alone. For months, when drivers tried to log out, the app would frequently tell them they were only a certain amount away from making a seemingly arbitrary sum for the day, or from matching their earnings from that point one week earlier.The messages were intended to exploit another relatively widespread behavioral tic \u2014 people\u2019s preoccupation with goals \u2014 to nudge them into driving longer.Uber, for its part, appears to be aware of the ludic loop. In its messages to drivers, it included a graphic of an engine gauge with a needle that came tantalizingly close to, but was still short of, a dollar sign.And the ludic loop is far from the only video game feature that Uber has adapted as a way of keeping drivers on the road.At any moment, the app shows drivers how many trips they have taken in the current week, how much money they have made, how much time they have spent logged on and what their overall rating from passengers is. All of these metrics can stimulate the competitive juices that drive compulsive game-playing.\u201cThe whole thing is like a video game,\u201d said Eli Solomon, a veteran Uber and Lyft driver in the Chicago area, who said he sometimes had to fight the urge to work more after glancing at his data.Sometimes the so-called gamification is quite literal. Like players on video game platforms such as Xbox, PlayStation and Pogo, Uber drivers can earn badges for achievements like Above and Beyond (denoted on the app by a cartoon of a rocket blasting off), Excellent Service (marked by a picture of a sparkling diamond) and Entertaining Drive (a pair of Groucho Marx glasses with nose and eyebrows).Of course, managers have been borrowing from the logic of games for generations, as when they set up contests and competition among workers. More overt forms of gamification have proliferated during the past decade. For example, Microsoft has used the approach to entice workers to perform the otherwise sleep-inducing task of software debugging.But Uber can go much further. Because it mediates its drivers\u2019 entire work experience through an app, there are few limits to the elements it can gamify. Uber collects staggering amounts of data that allow it to discard game features that do not work and refine those that do. And because its workers are contractors, the gamification strategies are not hemmed in by employment law.Kevin Werbach, a business professor who has written extensively on the subject, said that while gamification could be a force for good in the gig economy \u2014 for example, by creating bonds among workers who do not share a physical space \u2014 there was a danger of abuse. \u201cIf what you\u2019re doing is basically saying, \u2018We\u2019ve found a cheap way to get you to do work without paying you for it, we\u2019ll pay you in badges that don\u2019t cost anything,\u2019 that\u2019s a manipulative way to go about it,\u201d he said.For some drivers, that is precisely the effect. Scott Weber said he drove full time most weeks last year, picking up passengers in the Tampa area for both Uber and Lyft, yet made less than $20,000 before expenses like gas and maintenance. \u201cI was a business that had a loss,\u201d said Mr. Weber, who is looking for another job. \u201cI\u2019m using payday loans.\u201dStill, when asked about the badges he earns while driving for Uber, Mr. Weber practically gushed. \u201cI\u2019ve got currently 12 excellent-service and nine great-conversation badges,\u201d he said in an interview in early March. \u201cIt tells me where I\u2019m at.\u201dWhen asked whether Uber\u2019s product managers and data scientists were akin to developers at a social gaming company like Zynga, Jonathan Hall, Uber\u2019s head of economic and policy research, accepted the analogy but rejected the implication.\u201cI think there\u2019s something to that, but ultimately Zynga should worry mostly about how fun its games are rather than trying to get you to play a little bit more by some trick,\u201d he said. He argued that exploiting people\u2019s psychological tics was unlikely to have more than a marginal effect on how long they played Zynga\u2019s games or drove for Uber. It is \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d he said.Mr. Hall is clearly right about the effects of certain techniques, like those pitched at drivers\u2019 tendency to set income targets or to focus more on losses than gains. On the other hand, even features that produce relatively small changes in driving patterns can become quite important to a company like Uber.According to Mr. Parker, the former Uber manager in Dallas, increasing the number of drivers on the road by 20 percent at certain hours of the day, or in a busy part of town, can rein in a large fare surge.More important, some of the psychological levers that Uber pulls to increase the supply of drivers have quite powerful effects.Consider an algorithm called forward dispatch \u2014 Lyft has a similar one \u2014 that dispatches a new ride to a driver before the current one ends. Forward dispatch shortens waiting times for passengers, who may no longer have to wait for a driver 10 minutes away when a second driver is dropping off a passenger two minutes away.Perhaps no less important, forward dispatch causes drivers to stay on the road substantially longer during busy periods \u2014 a key goal for both companies.Uber and Lyft explain this in essentially the same way. \u201cDrivers keep telling us the worst thing is when they\u2019re idle for a long time,\u201d said Kevin Fan, the director of product at Lyft. \u201cIf it\u2019s slow, they\u2019re going to go sign off. We want to make sure they\u2019re constantly busy.\u201dWhile this is unquestionably true, there is another way to think of the logic of forward dispatch: It overrides self-control.As with viewers and binge-watching, many drivers appear to enjoy the forward-dispatch feature, which can increase earnings by keeping them busier. But it can also work against their interests by increasing the number of drivers on the road and defusing fare surges. And whether they enjoy it is separate from the question of agency \u2014 whether they have it, or whether the company does.Uber officials say the feature initially produced so many rides at times that drivers began to experience a chronic Netflix ailment \u2014 the inability to stop for a bathroom break. Amid the uproar, Uber introduced a pause button.\u201cDrivers were saying: \u2018I can never go offline. I\u2019m on just continuous trips. This is a problem.\u2019 So we redesigned it,\u201d said Maya Choksi, a senior Uber official in charge of building products that help drivers. \u201cIn the middle of the trip, you can say, \u2018Stop giving me requests.\u2019 So you can have more control over when you want to stop driving.\u201dSometimes all that is necessary is the mere setting of a so-called default. Because humans tend to be governed by inertia, automatically enrolling them in retirement savings plans and then allowing them to opt out results in far higher participation than letting them opt in. Making Post-Play the default can have the same effect.\u201cIf done right, these things can be socially beneficial,\u201d Mr. Laibson said. \u201cBut you can think of all sorts of choice architecture that are quite contrary to human well-being.\u201dEven Mr. Hall, the Uber research director who downplayed the importance of behavioral economics to the company, did make at least one concession. \u201cThe optimal default we set is that we want you to do as much work as there is to do,\u201d he said of the company\u2019s app. \u201cYou\u2019re not required to by any means. But that\u2019s the default.\u201dThere are aspects of the platforms that genuinely do increase drivers\u2019 control over their work lives, as Uber frequently points out. Unlike most workers, an Uber driver can put in a few hours each day between dropping children off at school and picking them up in the afternoon.Uber is even in the process of developing a feature that allows drivers to tell the app in advance that they need to arrive at a given location at a given time. \u201cIf you need to pick up your kids at soccer practice at 6 p.m.,\u201d said Nundu Janakiram, the Uber official in charge of products that improve drivers\u2019 experiences, \u201cit will start to give you trips to take you in the general direction to get to a specific place in time.\u201dThere is also the possibility that as the online gig economy matures, companies like Uber may adopt a set of norms that limit their ability to manipulate workers through cleverly designed apps.Kelly Peters, chief executive of BEworks, a management consulting firm specializing in behavioral science, argued that the same data that makes it easier for Uber to nudge drivers into working an additional 30 or 60 minutes also makes it hard to escape the obligation to look after them.That moment of maturity does not appear to have arrived yet, however. Consider a prompt that Uber rolled out this year, inviting drivers to press a large box if they want the app to navigate them to an area where they have a \u201chigher chance\u201d of finding passengers. The accompanying graphic resembles the one that indicates that an area\u2019s fares are \u201csurging,\u201d except in this case fares are not necessarily higher.Some drivers believe that the intent is to trick them into driving where Uber wants them to go, rather than where driving would be most profitable, by implying that they will find a surge there. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to move people where they want them,\u201d said Mr. Weber, the Tampa-area driver. \u201cBut you get there and it\u2019s nothing. It happens all the time.\u201d Mr. Weber noted that the design of the graphic makes the prompt much easier to accept than decline, which requires pressing a small rectangle in the top left corner.Uber said that the feature was an experiment intended primarily to help new drivers who frequently say they do not know where to find passengers, and that it could be changed if drivers were dissatisfied.Individual features aside, the broader question of how much Uber seeks to influence drivers through behavioral science may come down to how much its business model requires it.While the company has made no secret of its investment in self-driving cars, it could be a decade or more before they completely replace human drivers. In the meantime, as long as Uber continues to set growth and passenger volume as critical goals, it will have an incentive to make wringing more hours out of drivers a higher priority than the drivers\u2019 bottom line whenever it faces a close call between the two.Moreover, the contractor model itself provides a strong impetus for companies like Uber to grow. Many companies in the gig economy simply do not have enough workers, or rich enough data about their workers\u2019 behavior, to navigate busy periods using nudges and the like. To avoid chronic understaffing, they have switched to an employee model that allows them to compel workers to log in when the companies most need them.Once companies achieve a certain scale, on the other hand, they enter a virtuous cycle: The risk of understaffing drops with a big enough pool of workers, and the cost savings of using contractors begins to outweigh the inefficiencies. This in turn frees up money to enter new markets and acquire new customers, which makes the contractor model still more efficient, and throws off still more savings.It is, as a result, not too hard to imagine a future in which massive digital platforms like Uber have an appetite for tens of millions of workers \u2014 not only for ferrying people, but also for delivering food and retail goods. Nor is it hard to imagine workers\u2019 obliging them, perhaps because their skills do not match the needs of more traditional employers, or because they need to supplement their wages.In such an economy, experts say, using big data and algorithms to manage workers will not simply be a niche phenomenon. It may become one of the most common ways of managing the American labor force.\u201cYou have all these players entering into this space, and the assumption is they\u2019ll do it through vast armies of underemployed people looking for extra hours, and we can control every nuance about what they do but not have to pay them,\u201d said David Weil, the top wage-and-hour official under President Barack Obama.When you stop to consider the enormous cost advantages, Mr. Weil said, \u201cit says to me this is an area that will grow fast.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Sues the Government to Block the Unmasking of an Account Critical of Trump", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twitter sued the federal government on Thursday to block the unmasking of an anonymous account that has posted messages critical of the Trump administration and has claimed to have ties to a government agency.The suit sets up a potential confrontation between the Trump administration and Twitter over digital privacy, a thorny issue that has driven a wedge between the technology industry and government in the past.Twitter said in its filing that it could not be compelled to disclose the identity or identities of whoever is behind the account. The company argued that the government\u2019s directive and reasoning were unlawful, and that complying would have \u201ca grave chilling effect\u201d on the speech of alt-accounts that voice resistance to government policies.\u201cA time-honored tradition of pseudonymous free speech on matters of public moment runs deep in the political life of America,\u201d Twitter said in its filing. \u201cThese First Amendment interests are at their zenith when, as here, the speech at issue touches on matters of public political life.\u201dJenny Burke, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security Department, which, with Customs and Border Protection had issued the summons, declined to comment.Even before this episode, previous presidential administrations have sought access the valuable digital information held by Facebook, Google, Twitter and other internet companies, in what some of the companies have said is an overreach of government power. Federal officials have typically said in such cases that they need the data at issue for national security or other reasons.Last year, for example, Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company, squared off against the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a contentious case involving issues of privacy and national security.The new case involving Twitter is more straightforward than Apple\u2019s standoff with the F.B.I., which required the creation of new technology to circumvent the iPhone\u2019s encryption. The Twitter case is centered instead on the protection of free speech, which is critical to the social media company\u2019s platform.The company is seeking to block the Trump administration from forcing it to reveal the identity of a user who has been critical of the Homeland Security Department.On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union said it planned to represent the anonymous user or users behind @ALT_USCIS.\u201cTo unmask an anonymous speaker online, the government must have a strong justification,\u201d said Nathan Freed Wessler, an A.C.L.U. attorney involved in the case. \u201cBut in this case the government has given no reason at all, leading to concerns that it is simply trying to stifle dissent.\u201dThe case stems from a wave of alternative government agency accounts that sprouted on Twitter after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Upon being sworn into office, the president began to silence federal agencies from speaking out on the social media platform after the National Park Service\u2019s official Twitter account posted side-by-side images comparing the size of the crowds at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration \u201cto the apparently larger crowd size at President Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration,\u201d according to Twitter\u2019s court filing.In response, alternative accounts began to pop up, with many professing to be written by current or former employees of federal agencies. Accounts with handles like @Alt_Labor, @BadlandsNPS and @RogueEPAstaff had attracted tens of thousands of followers less than a week after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.The @ALT_USCIS account, which was created in January, has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies, among other topics. Messages posted by the account have referred to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order restricting travel to the United States by people from several mostly Muslim countries as the \u201c#MuslimBan.\u201dThe account has also described itself as \u201cofficial inside resistance\u201d and has said several times that the person or people using it to post messages is a current federal employee of Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Homeland Security Department. Twitter said in its court filing that about 19,000 employees and contractors work for Citizenship and Immigration Services.In March, Customs and Border Protection sent Twitter a summons that ordered the company to hand over information about the @ALT_USCIS account, including the names, phone numbers, mailing addresses and internet protocol addresses of the account holder or holders.The summons cited 19 U.S. Code 1509, a federal law that authorizes Customs and Border Protection to \u201cobtain documents only for investigations and inquiries relating to the importation of merchandise.\u201dTwitter said the law was not relevant to the agency\u2019s request and also that the summons violated the Stored Communications Act, which protects individuals\u2019 privacy and proprietary interests.As for @ALT_USCIS, the account was particularly active on Thursday, posting more than a dozen messages after Twitter\u2019s suit against the government became public. The account, which added 32,000 followers within two months of being started, had ballooned to more than 77,000 followers by early in the evening.Highlighted at the top of the account: a message featuring a screenshot of the Constitution and the First Amendment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cloud Produces Sunny Earnings at Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 The moneymaking machines at the core of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, are notably different. But the respective kings of online retailing, software and internet search should all credit a relatively new line of business for lifting their financial results.In their quarterly earnings reports on Thursday, the three said cloud computing \u2014 through which they rent computing services and online access to software hosted in their data centers \u2014 was growing faster than their larger, older businesses.For the first quarter, which ended March 31, Amazon said its total net income rose to $724 million, or $1.48 a share, from $513 million, or $1.07 a share, a year ago. The company said the $890 million in operating income from its cloud business, called Amazon Web Services or A.W.S., accounted for most of its overall profits.The worry, however, is that this cannot last forever, not with Microsoft and Google making big investments in their own cloud businesses while trying to undercut Amazon with lower prices.That has not happened \u2014 at least not yet. While A.W.S. revenue grew at a slower pace than in the past, it still rose a healthy 43 percent to $3.66 billion. The company\u2019s shares rose 1 percent in after-hours trading.\u201cThere\u2019s always this moment when people think, \u2018Is the magic going to run out?\u2019\u201d said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t panned out.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s Azure cloud hosting business grew by 93 percent from the year-earlier quarter. And the cloud version of its productivity software Office 365, sold to companies as an online service, grew by 45 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing continued strong demand for our commercial cloud-based services,\u201d Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview.Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts that the Google cloud platform was one of the company\u2019s \u201cfastest-growing businesses,\u201d though she offered no details.Still, nearly all of Alphabet\u2019s business comes from advertising on the Google sites and services, which is still expanding despite tough competition from Facebook.First-quarter earnings increased to $7.73 a share while revenue jumped 22 percent to $24.75 billion. Average estimates from Thomson Reuters had been for $7.39 a share in earnings with revenue of $24.19 billion.The stock rose 4 percent in after-hours trading on the news.Alphabet\u2019s speculative ventures, including its home electronics division, Nest, and its autonomous car division, Waymo, are listed as \u201cother bets.\u201d In the first quarter, the other-bets revenue rose 48 percent to $244 million. But losses increased 10 percent to $855 million.Google\u2019s total digital ad revenue has doubled since 2012. But for all the success that demonstrates, so much of advertising is becoming digital that Google\u2019s share of the online portion is actually slipping, according eMarketer. Five years ago, Google had a 35.9 percent share of global digital ad revenue, the data firm said. In 2016, it was 32.8 percent.The pots of money Alphabet is making could provide some consolation after major brands, including AT&T and Verizon, recently learned that their ads were appearing alongside inflammatory YouTube videos that promoted hate speech. Some advertisers vowed to drop YouTube, a Google property, until the problem was fixed.For its part, Microsoft\u2019s overall revenue rose 8 percent in the quarter, to $22.09 billion. That was enhanced by $975 million in revenue from LinkedIn, the professional networking site that Microsoft bought for $26 billion in a deal that closed in December.Microsoft\u2019s total operating revenue, which includes the deferred accounting for sales of its Windows 10 personal computer operating system, was higher, at $23.56 billion. That figure is the focus of Wall Street analysts, and the result was slightly below their consensus estimate of $23.62 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.The modest shortfall was attributable to weaker-than-expected sales of Microsoft\u2019s Surface tablet computers during the quarter, which were down 26 percent. The company\u2019s share price fell about 1 percent in after-hours trading.Microsoft\u2019s net income rose 28 percent to $4.80 billion. Its operating earnings per share, which excludes one-time gains, increased 16 percent to 73 cents a share, ahead of the average analyst estimate of 70 cents a share.The company\u2019s results also added to evidence that the personal computer industry is stabilizing and even growing, at least among corporate customers.Sales of Windows operating systems to PC makers rose 5 percent in the quarter. The market research firm IDC recently reported that PC shipments grew slightly during the first quarter of 2017, the first gain in five years.Microsoft\u2019s Windows sales to PC makers are advancing by more than the rate of PC shipments, because of a shift to higher-priced versions as corporate customers upgrade to Windows 10.Overall revenue at Amazon rose 23 percent to $35.71 billion from $29.13 billion in the same period a year ago. The company\u2019s results were well ahead of the $1.12-a-share average earnings estimate and $35.3 billion revenue estimate of analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters.In a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company was still heavily investing in the creation of new devices, video content and fulfillment centers to bring orders to customers more quickly.\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to look for things customers love, can grow to be large and provide strong financial returns in the long run and can last for decades,\u201d he said.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, David Streitfeld from San Francisco and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sci-Fi Writer William Gibson Reimagines the World After the 2016 Election", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byWilliam Gibson\u2019s science fiction is so eerily prophetic that sometimes it seems as if he\u2019s creating the future, not just imagining it.But last fall, Mr. Gibson\u2019s predictive abilities failed him. Like so many others, he never imagined that Donald J. Trump would prevail in the 2016 election. On Nov. 9, he woke up feeling as if he were living in an alternate reality. \u201cIt was a really weird and powerful sensation,\u201d he said.Most people who were stunned by the outcome managed to shake off the surreal feeling. But being a science fiction writer, Mr. Gibson, 69, decided to explore it.The result is \u201cAgency,\u201d Mr. Gibson\u2019s next novel, which Berkley will publish in January. The story unfolds in two timelines: San Francisco in 2017, in an alternate time track where Hillary Clinton won the election and Mr. Trump\u2019s political ambitions were thwarted, and London in the 22nd century, after decades of cataclysmic events have killed 80 percent of humanity. In the present-day San Francisco setting, a shadowy start-up hires a young woman named Verity to test a new product: a \u201ccross-platform personal avatar\u201d that was developed by the military as a form of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, characters in the distant future are interfering with the events unfolding in 2017, through technological time travel that allows them to send digital communications to the past.For the most part, people living under President Clinton carry on as if nothing unusual has occurred. \u201cThe characters in the book are scarcely aware of the broader political landscape,\u201d Mr. Gibson said. \u201cNo one ever says, \u2018Thank God we\u2019re not in that other time track.\u2019\u201dMr. Gibson never set out to write a sequel, but the plots of \u201cAgency\u201d and \u201cThe Peripheral\u201d converged unexpectedly last fall. He had spent about a year writing \u201cAgency\u201d when the 2016 election rendered the fictional world he had created obsolete. \u201cI assumed that if Trump won, I\u2019d be able to shift a few things and continue to tell my story,\u201d he said. But when he tried tinkering with the draft, he realized that the world had changed too drastically for him to plausibly salvage the story. \u201cIt was immediately obvious to me that there had been some fundamental shift and I would have to rebuild the whole thing,\u201d he said.He changed the framework by resurrecting the time-travel mechanism he created in \u201cThe Peripheral\u201d and making the world in which Mrs. Clinton won the presidency a stub, an alternate branch of reality created by a meddling time traveler.Perhaps not surprisingly, given his grim vision of the future, Mr. Gibson tries to shrug off the prophet label. He\u2019d rather not be called a prescient visionary.\u201cEvery imaginary future ever written is about the time it was written in,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople talk about science fiction\u2019s predictive possibilities, but that\u2019s a byproduct. It\u2019s all really about now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Buys a Lot of Ads, and He\u2019s Frustrated With Digital", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingLOS ANGELES \u2014 Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble, has become the face of marketers\u2019 frustrations with digital advertising this year. His message to the industry: Grow up.The New York Times talked with Mr. Pritchard during the conference in Los Angeles about the challenges in today\u2019s advertising marketplace. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.What is the biggest problem here?The entire murky, nontransparent and in some cases fraudulent supply chain is the problem. It\u2019s a bigger problem than just any one thing. There\u2019s too much we don\u2019t know and we don\u2019t have validated.Ads showing up on objectionable sites, that\u2019s bad. Ads showing up to bots, through searching, that\u2019s bad. Ads that you place that don\u2019t really get measured by a third party that validates what\u2019s right \u2014 that\u2019s not so good, either. There\u2019s a number of things in the digital media supply chain \u2014 even ads that aren\u2019t viewable or close to viewable.What will cleaning this up do for you?What that will enable us all to do is make logical, data-based, reasonable decisions and, most importantly, spend time on what\u2019s really important, which is great creativity to drive growth.At the basis of this whole point is we\u2019re not growing enough as an industry and the markets aren\u2019t growing enough, so we need to spend time on products and packaging and shopping experiences and advertising to drive growth, and yet we have all this time spent in this opaque media environment. That\u2019s the basis for why we, at least, are poking at this so hard.How have technology companies, in particular, responded? There are a lot of people that have come up to us and said thanks for calling this stuff out because we\u2019ve been feeling the same way. It\u2019s a lot of players out there saying we really need to make sure that we know what we\u2019re getting, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s a business. All we\u2019re really asking for is here\u2019s what we\u2019re paying for, validate that we\u2019re getting it, so we can then evaluate whether it\u2019s a good deal. And if it\u2019s two seconds, and it costs X, and lifts the business, we\u2019ll do that. We just need to know that it really was two seconds, and how much it cost and then we can do that.How does the recent controversy around brands\u2019 ads showing up next to offensive content on YouTube fit into this?Right now, obviously, a big thing is if it\u2019s showing up in content we want to be associated with. That\u2019s one piece of it, but the other piece of it is, is it showing up in a place where people are actually viewing it? So, is it a bot or is it a person? Is it showing up in a place where there\u2019s enough traffic for it to be worth it?Those are really the kinds of questions everybody\u2019s asking, because what you\u2019re really trying to figure out is, where do you want to focus your money to be able to get the most awareness, the most effectiveness, and with the greatest level of efficiency.The issues around brands running on offensive websites and YouTube videos seems like a big departure from the days of P & G funding soap operas and family-oriented shows.The interesting thing about the TV model was that it was free programming paid for by advertisers. I mean, that was it, and radio was the same way. So you get this service for free, but the only price you have to pay is advertising, and that funded it, and that\u2019s essentially what has happened in the digital world.The digital advertising world brought with it user-generated content, and that\u2019s really the big shift, because before, the programs were created by content producers, and then they were bought by media companies who then put programming together, and then advertisers bought advertising on those programs.Are marketers looking for metrics beyond impressions to measure online ads? (Impressions are generally counted each time an ad is shown.)If you think about reach, frequency, impressions \u2014 those are proxies for what the real outcome is that you\u2019d like, which is sales. Where we can get a more direct link to sales, that\u2019s actually preferable if we can possibly do that. There are some ways you can do it with data, but the other ways are if you link up with e-commerce, because then you can get much more of a direct outcome. That\u2019s been around for a while but that\u2019s clearly an area I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see growing.Do the issues around brand safety online make television more appealing to you?We\u2019ll certainly tell our brands to look at all alternatives, and it remains to be seen then whether TV will provide the right value, the right measurement, the right proof and evidence that it\u2019s a good buy, it\u2019s a good value.It\u2019ll all be based on consumer behavior. On TV, people are accustomed to having a commercial interruption. The better networks find ways to make it less interruptive so it\u2019s a better viewing experience. We\u2019re certainly looking for sites where you may have an ad, but it\u2019s not annoying, because you\u2019ve seen this, on some of the ads, pop-ups come, load time takes forever \u2014 it\u2019s all that kind of stuff. We\u2019d rather have a better viewing experience and look for those that can do that.But then there\u2019s some, like the Hulus and Netflix, where they don\u2019t have advertising but we\u2019re still working with them to figure out how we can get at least our brand impressions there. So I think there will be innovations in how advertising is done.Even if you think about the news feed that occurs with Facebook and even a lot of the YouTube videos, you\u2019re talking two or three seconds. So that has created innovation in how we do advertising \u2026 There\u2019s just clever ways where you can do things and get your brand top of mind in a few seconds.I\u2019m not ready to go there yet.Advertisement"}

On your way to finding whatever it was you\u2019re looking for, you will be diverted by a lot else besides, all of it enlightening.\u201cIt\u2019s a living, breathing representation of a whole year at The New York Times,\u201d Beth Ann Boswell, the editor and director of the Times Index, said this week. \u201cIt\u2019s not archaic. It\u2019s a beautiful piece of work.\u201dO.K. So what\u2019s the bad news?The staff of 12 is down to five. All the indexers have left the building. Copy editors are working on the October and November monthly supplements, the October-to-December quarterly and the 1,900-page annual. At the close of business on Friday, The New York Times Index will close after 104 years.The 2016 annual, to be published later this year, will be the last.Armed with the Index and some microfilm rolls, however, you could jump back in time and just about always land in the right spot. (The Times reprinted or retrospectively compiled indexes covering the years 1851 to 1912, so that there would be an unbroken \u2014 if uneven \u2014 record of every single issue.)At the end, Ms. Boswell said, there were only about 280 subscribers. Apart from the general upending of traditional research methods, the Times Index suffered from a chronic shortage of staff. That led to a backlog that stretched to three years at one low point \u2014 not the kind of delay that wins over new users.Index editors had been trying to stave off the day of reckoning for decades. \u201cFor a long time, it was devalued by many top executives,\u201d said Harvey L. Holmes Jr., the editor from 1978 to 2010. \u201cThey were, quite frankly, trying to get rid of it because of the costs.\u201dWith abstracts like that, who needed primary sources?\u201cThe No. 1 quality was that you had to be a pretty good writer,\u201d Mr. Holmes recalled. \u201cYou were required to do 40 abstracts a day, sometimes 60, up to 100, under pressure.\u201dCopy editors polished the writing, ensured continuity among the abstracts and reviewed the all-important tags that eventually were translated into subject headings and cross references. To avoid repetition under multiple terms, decisions had to be made about where each abstract fit best.In other cases, however, subject terms can tell you all you need to know. The three current cross-references for the subject \u201cBribery and Kickbacks\u201d are the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA); Sheldon Silver, the former speaker of the New York State Assembly; and Dean G. Skelos, the former majority leader of the New York State Senate.\u201cQuestions and disagreements readily come to light,\u201d a 2004 indexing guide said, \u201cand are resolved by asking your neighbor on the one side for an opinion, then asking your neighbor on the other side for a second opinion, and finally carrying the article to Harvey for the final word, which you then report back to your neighbors.\u201dIndexers and copy editors had to be clairvoyant. \u201cThey must keep in mind,\u201d Dr. Rothman wrote, \u201cthat they are serving not only the users of today but future generations (who, to complicate things still further, are bound to have a different perspective and only too likely to have a different vocabulary).\u201dTake the inaugural Index of January-March 1913. Subject headings included Abyssinia; Bathtub Trust; Jones (\u201cMother\u201d); Kinetophone; Mental Telegraphy; Nicholas, Czar of Russia; Oleomargarine; Pujo Committee of House of Representatives; Social Evil; and White Slave Traffic.Many entries now pose more questions than they answer. \u201cSullivan Gun Law: \u2014 Violations: \u2014 Barlow, Hazel, discharges pistol in muff, is arrested, Jan. 6, 6:2; incriminates Kampf, Mar. 3, 16:1.\u201dBut the overarching idea of the Index was sound.And here is Ms. Boswell, more than a century later. \u201cIn terms of content management,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are speaking of a world in delicate balance between lots of good information and an overabundance of information that is not organized.\u201dTo underscore the big contribution her small department made in imposing some organization, Ms. Boswell created a six-foot tall book sculpture honoring the last cohort of indexers and copy editors: Jennifer M. Buckley, Eileen M. Guzmich, A. C. Lee, George D. MacDonald, Tina Morales, Nathalie E. Nieves, Jane Rose, Ariana Souzis, Sho Spaeth, Susan Tarbet and Christopher Theokas.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Facebook Keeps Beating Every Rival: It\u2019s the Network, of Course", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThe tech world just witnessed a robbery. The heist was so brazen you kind of had to admire it, even if it was pulled off with all the grace of a gas station stickup.His speech had a lot of corny jokes, but that was just Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s way of hiding the shiv. In reality it was a performance that made plain Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ruthlessness as a businessman. It also shows that he understands Facebook\u2019s most important assets. Mr. Zuckerberg realized early on that the most important thing in his business was not necessarily creating the best new features. It doesn\u2019t matter who invents digital mustaches. What matters is owning the biggest and most engaged network. And because he has the network, he always wins.For years now, the world has been doubting Mr. Zuckerberg. Facebook, they said, would never beat Myspace. Then Facebook was going to get a run for its money from every other social network \u2014 Twitter, Pinterest and more. Hey, could it survive Google\u2019s onslaught? Could it survive its own initial public offering? How would Facebook adjust to mobile? What about live video? And then there was Snapchat. By turning the smartphone camera into a communications platform, Snapchat created a novel and compelling social experience. Teenagers couldn\u2019t get enough of it. And teenagers are the future. If Facebook lost teenagers, game over.Hahaha. In the big picture none of these things really made a dent in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s expanding kingdom.Five years ago, after more or less cementing Facebook\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest social network, he began to buy up and build future networks. He bought Instagram, which now has 600 million users. Then he bought WhatsApp, which has more than a billion users. Then he turned Facebook\u2019s baked-in chat feature into its own chat app, Messenger, and now that, too, has a billion users.He offered Evan Spiegel, Snapchat\u2019s co-founder, $3 billion to buy that app. Mr. Spiegel refused \u2014 but perhaps he should have taken a closer look at the networks Mr. Zuckerberg was assembling.Do you know what happens when you control four of the biggest social networks in the world? You get to stop worrying about competitors beating you on features.Mr. Zuckerberg didn\u2019t win all of this stuff; sometimes the features turned out to be less important than initially thought, but that didn\u2019t matter. At the very least he would neutralize his enemy\u2019s growth, cutting it off before it became an existential threat to Facebook.And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve just seen with Snapchat. There is a debate in the tech press about whether Facebook\u2019s shrewd copying has killed Snap, Snapchat\u2019s parent company, or simply wounded it. After all, last week Instagram said that 200 million people a day were using its Stories feature, which is more users than all of Snapchat (160 million at last count).What\u2019s important is that Facebook has forced this coexistence. Facebook\u2019s billions of users will now be introduced to Snapchat\u2019s best features on Facebook\u2019s own platform, eliminating, for a lot of them, any reason to switch. There is essentially no chance now that Snapchat will eclipse Facebook anytime soon, if ever. In other words, Mr. Zuckerberg has done it again; he has neutralized yet another rival.But there is another aspect to the power of large networks: They make other people\u2019s features better.\u201cEven if we were slow to add cameras to all our apps, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re going to be the ones who push this technology forward,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Let\u2019s end with a note on the ethics of all this. Some of you may find it upsetting that a big company can just lift an innovation from a small company and run with it. If it\u2019s not illegal, isn\u2019t it at least something we should discourage?To which I say: Meh. There are lots of different kinds of innovation in the tech industry. Coming up with something first is not the only kind.There is a rich history in this industry of taking someone else\u2019s idea and adding your own spin on it to improve tech for everyone. Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs and the team behind the original Mac were inspired by a bunch of ideas floating around tech research circles, including at Xerox PARC. Then Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, saw the Mac\u2019s success and \u2014 by creating a new business model for the PC industry \u2014 he ushered in an even bigger deal: graphical computers that could get cheap enough for most people to own.Or look at the smartphone. Apple created the iPhone, but if the tech industry had stopped there, smartphones wouldn\u2019t have swept the world very quickly. Instead, Google more or less copied Apple\u2019s software ideas in early versions of Android, and Samsung essentially copied Apple\u2019s hardware. Economics kicked in, smartphones got really cheap, and they flooded the globe. And everyone did better: In time, Samsung hit on its own big idea \u2014 huge phones \u2014 that Apple copied, and Apple then made a bundle.So let\u2019s not get too hung up on copying. All\u2019s fair in love and rainbow vomit.Advertisement"}

The cost to the parent company, 21st Century Fox, is low for now. A toxic culture, however, can damage long-run efforts to broaden consumer appeal.The list of O\u2019Reilly refuseniks may grow. The controversy arises just as advertisers are raising concerns about their brands appearing with inappropriate material on Google and its video site YouTube \u2014 and withdrawing their ad dollars. It would take a major boycott to eat into Fox\u2019s top line, though. Fox News typically dominates evening programming. In February, for example, nearly three million people tuned in, compared with 1.2 million at CNN and 1.5 million for MSNBC.It could become a bigger problem, however. Cable news has been enjoying a renaissance since President Trump entered the political realm a couple years ago. To keep the momentum going, however, the networks will have to find younger viewers. The median age of a prime-time Fox News viewer in 2015 was 68, according to Nielsen, older than at both its main rivals.James and Lachlan Murdoch, the mid-40s children of Fox\u2019s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, have been given the job of making the company live up to the 21st-century moniker. They were involved with the departure of Mr. Ailes, their father\u2019s longtime lieutenant. Fox News also has urged employees to come forward with concerns about unseemly behavior and has retained a law firm, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, to conduct a review.The situations involving Mr. O\u2019Reilly and Mr. Ailes make the job harder for the younger Murdochs. Like Uber, Travis Kalanick\u2019s ride-hailing company, which is confronting a backlash because of its frat-house culture, Fox may be endangered by similar threats. Audiences and advertisers may be changing faster than Fox can keep up.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Canada Tries to Turn Its A.I. Ideas Into Dollars", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byTORONTO \u2014 Long before Google started working on cars that drive themselves and Amazon was creating home appliances that talk, a handful of researchers in Canada \u2014 backed by the Canadian government and universities \u2014 were laying the groundwork for today\u2019s boom in artificial intelligence.But the center of the commercial gold rush has been a long way away, in Silicon Valley. In recent years, many of Canada\u2019s young A.I. scientists, lured by lucrative paydays from Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies, have departed. Canada is producing a growing number of A.I start-ups, but they often head to California, where venture capital, business skills and optimism are abundant.Now bringing A.I. home is a priority for the Canadian government, companies, universities and technologists. The goal, they say, is to build a business environment around the country\u2019s expertise and to keep the experts its universities create in the country.There are encouraging signs, including new government funding, big company investments, programs to nurture start-ups, and the changing habits of homegrown entrepreneurs and American venture capitalists.Mr. Hinton, who was hired by Google in 2013 but remains a professor at the University of Toronto, will serve as its chief scientific adviser. The new institute will be in the Mars Discovery District, a cluster of buildings in downtown Toronto, run by a public-private partnership, that is home to many tech start-ups including A.I. companies..Major technology companies, like Google, Microsoft and IBM, are adding to their A.I. research teams in Canada. So are companies in other industries.Last year, General Motors said it was going to locate one of its research and engineering hubs for self-driving cars in the Toronto suburb of Markham. And Thomson Reuters announced it would open a center for \u201ccognitive computing\u201d in Toronto for research into new ways professionals will use information and technologies to assist decision making.Building businesses that use A.I. is an economic imperative for Canada. The Canadian tech industry has stalled in recent years. Nortel, Canada\u2019s big telecommunications equipment maker, declared bankruptcy in 2009, and was wound down over the next several years. And BlackBerry, once a leader, has faded in the smartphone market.The experience of two start-ups applying A.I. technology to drug discovery illustrate the challenges \u2014 and the opportunities \u2014 facing Canadian start-ups.When Mr. Heifets sought funding, he recalled, one potential Canadian investor said people had tried the same thing 20 years ago. \u201cWhat could possibly be new?\u201d Mr. Heifets said the investor had asked, and turned him down.Later, Mr. Heifets went to the Bay Area and met with Timothy Draper, founder of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Mr. Draper observed that he had invested in a couple of companies trying a similar approach 20 years ago. That didn\u2019t deter him from trying again.\u201cThat\u2019s a cultural issue, a different appetite for risk and willingness to accept failure,\u201d Mr. Heifets said.Atomwise moved to San Francisco to be close to its investors and the region\u2019s enormous talent pool.Brendan Frey, the chief executive, studied under Mr. Hinton at the University of Toronto, and he has spent years on research that combines deep-learning A.I. and cell biology. When he hires software engineers, he asks them to make multiyear commitments.\u201cThere are a lot of distractions in the Bay Area,\u201d said Mr. Frey, who is also a professor at the University of Toronto and a co-founder of the new Vector institute. \u201cThe hype is a little too hot down there. Besides, we have some of the best talent in the world here.\u201dIn 2015, the program tilted toward A.I. start-ups, with 25 companies admitted. Last year, 50 A.I. start-ups were admitted, and this year will likely have 75, Mr. Agrawal said.The program lasts nine months, with fall and spring terms, much like a school year. The participants gather every eight weeks in Toronto for two days to make presentations, listen to advice and set goals for the next eight weeks.At every gathering, at least one and sometimes several companies are voted out. The voters are a growing group of tech entrepreneurs and investors whom Mr. Agrawal has recruited.One of the X factors in Canada\u2019s drive to develop an A.I. industry is the Trump administration. Canadian A.I. scientists say they have received a stream of inquiries from researchers in the United States, concerned about the new administration\u2019s stance on immigration and other policies.Should there be a northward migration it wouldn\u2019t the first time. Mr. Hinton settled in Canada in 1987 in part because of America\u2019s clandestine support for the Contra guerrillas who sought to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.Mr. Hinton, who is from Britain, was at Carnegie Mellon University at the time, and he realized that continuing his research in America would have meant accepting funding from the Reagan administration. \u201cI preferred Canada,\u201d Mr. Hinton recalled.Mr. Sutton left the United States to become a professor at the University of Alberta in 2003, after American troops landed in Baghdad. \u201cGeorge Bush was invading Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good time to leave.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Movers: Trump Bump, Time Inc. and Exxon", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byWe\u2019re following major developments in the markets throughout the day. Check below for the latest updates.In his first 100 days as president, Donald J. Trump may have found much of his agenda stymied, from a health care overhaul to a hotly contested immigration order.Many American consumers may not have heard of Synchrony Financial, but there is a good chance they have one of the company\u2019s credit cards.Synchrony issues credit cards in partnership with giant retailers like Walmart and JCPenny, which consumer use to purchase goods typically in return for discounts or other rewards.And on Friday, Synchrony\u2019s share price was getting hammered \u2014 down more than 14 percent in midmorning training.Synchrony, which was spun out of GE Capital in 2014, reported a smaller profit \u2014 61 cents a share \u2014 compared with the 74 cents that many Wall Street analysts had expected.The miss was driven partly by the company\u2019s need to reserve more money to deal with potential defaults from consumers.Investors took that as a worrisome sign that the credit quality of Synchrony\u2019s cards \u2014 which total about $70 billion \u2014 is declining faster than predicted.General Motors said on Friday that strong sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles drove a 34 percent increase in first-quarter earnings and positioned the company for a solid year ahead.The company\u2019s core North American market set a record for pretax profit, $3.4 billion, as buyers continued to flock to G.M.\u2019s truck and S.U.V. lineup.Exxon Mobil posted strong first-quarter earnings on Friday, as expected, with oil prices up by more than 50 percent from this time last year.With cash flow up and capital and exploration spending down, net income jumped to $4.01 billion from $1.81 billion in the year-ago quarter. Exxon Mobil shares, which have slumped so far this year, climbed 1 percent in morning trading.\u2022 The economy barely grew, expanding at an annual rate of only 0.7 percent.\u2022 The growth was a sharp decline from the 2.1 percent annual rate recorded in the final quarter of last year. It was the weakest quarterly showing in three years.\u2022 Consumption, the component reflecting individual spending, rose by only 0.3 percent, well below the 3.5 percent rate in the previous quarter.The economy\u2019s weakness reflected new caution among consumers. Other sectors like housing and business investment turned in a stronger showing, but not enough to offset factors like weaker retail sales.James E. Staley, the Barclays chief executive, offered another apology to investors on Friday about a \u201cmistake\u201d that led to an inquiry by British regulators into his treatment of a whistle-blower.Directors at Barclays have said they will formally reprimand Mr. Staley and make a \u201cvery significant compensation adjustment\u201d to his bonus after the inquiry.\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Mr. Staley said on a conference call with journalists on Friday. \u201cI was trying to protect a vulnerable colleague, but I should have left the organization to handle it. I\u2019ve accepted the judgment of the board. We are cooperating fully with the regulatory investigation.\u201dOn Thursday, Institutional Shareholder Services, a prominent proxy adviser, said that, because of concerns over the inquiry, investors should refrain from voting or abstain when Mr. Staley comes up for re-election to the bank\u2019s board at the annual meeting next month.The generally positive momentum for lenders in Europe in the first quarter continued on Friday as the Swiss bank UBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland reported their results.The quarterly profit was the lender\u2019s first since the third quarter of 2015. The bank has reported annual losses for the past nine years, but says it expects to be profitable in 2018.A consortium of investors led by the private equity firms Hillhouse Capital and CDH Investments have offered to buy China\u2019s Belle International in a transaction that would value the shoe retailer at $6.8 billion.That represents a premium of nearly 20 percent to the company\u2019s share price before trading was halted at the company\u2019s request on April 18.Belle has suffered as China\u2019s vast and fast-growing consumer culture changes the way it shops. Increasingly, Chinese people shop online, leading to booming business for American-traded online Chinese e-commerce firms like Alibaba Group and JD.com. But like in the United States, that shift has resulted in slower traffic at brick-and-mortar stores.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why You Should Wait Before Buying Samsung\u2019s New Galaxy S8", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byTech FixWhen a splashy new smartphone hits the market, consumers often weigh whether to place an order right away or to wait and see how others react to the device.Samsung declined to provide an early review unit of the Galaxy S8 to The New York Times, but several consumer electronics experts who tried the device ahead of its release this Friday were cautiously optimistic about the product. Even so, they said the phone had some radical design changes that might make people uncomfortable, a few key features were unfinished and Samsung\u2019s recent safety record remained a concern.For those who may not recall, Samsung killed the Galaxy Note 7 last year after some of the phones overheated and several of them caught fire. The South Korean company issued two recalls for the big-screen smartphone and blamed battery manufacturing problems and design flaws for the issues.\u201cWhat happened to the Galaxy Note raised questions about Samsung phones in general,\u201d said Mark Spoonauer, the editor in chief of the product reviews site Tom\u2019s Guide, who had early access to the Galaxy S8. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any harm in waiting to make sure that everything is safe with this phone.\u201dBroadly speaking, a wait-and-see approach is the most practical route that consumers can take with any brand-new product. Waiting a few months or even years gives tech companies time to improve existing features and to fix bugs. The only reason to rush to buy a gadget is if you are extremely enthusiastic about it and think it might be sold out for a while.Here are some of the reasons consumer electronics experts said you should wait for the Galaxy S8.When introducing the Galaxy S8 last month, Samsung highlighted its larger 5.8-inch screen, up from 5.1 inches on the previous model. To make more room for the screen without adding bulk to the body, the company reduced the size of the bezel \u2014 or the forehead and the chin \u2014 on the face of the device. Samsung also made the home button into a virtual button and shoved it under the display. And the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone is now on the back of the device a few millimeters to the right of the camera lens.Several product reviewers took issue with the location of the fingerprint sensor, saying it made it easy to bump into the camera lens when trying to unlock the phone.\u201cThey should just give you a cloth with the phone to wipe it,\u201d said Mike Gikas, a phone reviewer for Consumer Reports who had tried the Galaxy S8. He added that the placement of the fingerprint sensor might make it difficult for left-handed people to unlock the phone.Jessica Dolcourt, a product reviewer for CNET who used the Galaxy S8 at a media event last month, agreed that it felt awkward to use the fingerprint reader because of its location on the back. Mr. Spoonauer of Tom\u2019s Guide also said the placement of the fingerprint sensor was not ideal, though not a deal breaker.The Galaxy S8 includes some other unlocking methods, like facial recognition. Raise the phone to your face as if you were taking a selfie to unlock the Galaxy S8.Samsung highlighted Bixby, its voice-controlled virtual assistant that will rival Apple\u2019s Siri, Google\u2019s Assistant and Amazon\u2019s Alexa, when it initially unveiled the S8. What makes Samsung\u2019s assistant unique is that you will be able to ask it to accomplish tasks like sending your most recently taken photo to your spouse, or streaming a specific video to a Samsung television, which other assistants don\u2019t do.Yet last week, Samsung said that while some portions of Bixby would be available on Day 1, Bixby\u2019s voice features would not be released in the United States until later this spring. To Mr. Spoonauer, this incompleteness was a problem.\u201cI think the other more disappointing thing is the fact that one of the most exciting features is not going to be fully baked at launch,\u201d he said. \u201cFor that reason people might want to wait and see.\u201dMs. Dolcourt was less concerned about Bixby because the Galaxy S8 will also include access to Google\u2019s virtual assistant. She said consumers might take greater issue with the lack of a dual-lens camera similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus or the new LG G6 smartphone. With a dual-lens camera, the two cameras work together to show the photo\u2019s main subject clearly while gently blurring the background, among other effects.While the Galaxy S8 includes some neat filters and effects for taking photos, it has only a single-lens camera, Ms. Dolcourt noted.\u201cIf somebody has their heart set on two cameras, this device doesn\u2019t have it,\u201d she said.All the reviewers agreed that it was highly unlikely for the Galaxy S8 to face similar problems, largely because the device is crucial to Samsung\u2019s profit. Ms. Dolcourt of CNET said she would personally wait three months to see if the phones were safe to buy.\u201cThe proof is in the pudding if the phones survive without incident for three months,\u201d she said.Kyle Wiens, the owner of iFixit, a company that sells hardware components, noted that among the roughly two million Note 7 devices that were recalled, only a few dozen were defective. In other words, consumers will need a large sample of devices to be in the wild before concluding that Samsung\u2019s new safety tests worked.\u201cSomebody\u2019s got to be the guinea pig,\u201d he said, before asking, \u201cDo you want to be the guinea pig?\u201dA headline and a picture caption with the Tech Fix column on Thursday, about Samsung\u2019s new smartphone, misstated the name of the device in some copies. It is the S8, not the G8.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Your Next Wi-Fi Setup Should Be a Mesh Network", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byTech FixThe next time you upgrade your Wi-Fi equipment, take a bold step: Throw out your stand-alone router and instead consider investing in a so-called mesh system.Unlike stand-alone routers that lose signal the farther you move away from them, mesh stations piggyback on one another to create a continuous wireless link throughout your home, minimizing the possibility of dead zones. The network technology is quickly becoming popular: After the start-up Eero released a mesh system last year, bigger brands like Google and D-Link followed with similar products.Obviously, large houses with many rooms would benefit from multiple Wi-Fi hubs. But based on my tests with several mesh systems over the last year, I would go a step further and recommend a mesh network for most people, including those with modestly sized homes, for a variety of reasons.For one, mesh Wi-Fi systems like Eero and Google Wifi include intuitive smartphone apps that make managing your network easier to understand. For another, some mesh systems are aesthetically pleasing \u2014 unlike traditional routers, which are bulky contraptions of hideous antennas that look as if they were made on the Death Star.Most important, mesh networks better accommodate a shift in how people use technology today. We carry mobiles devices like smartphones, smart watches, laptops and tablets from room to room. Internet-connected gadgets like smart speakers, bathroom scales and smart televisions are also increasingly scattered throughout the home. With mesh networks, your Wi-Fi coverage has less chance of being interrupted.\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see the router vendors doing something that is properly useful for once,\u201d said Dave Fraser, the chief executive of Devicescape, a tech company that helps make public Wi-Fi networks more reliable for mobile phone service. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019ve finally realized it\u2019s human beings buying these products rather than I.T. staff.\u201dFirst, a primer on how a mesh system works. You connect a primary base station to your broadband modem. From there, you connect satellite stations in rooms where you might get weak coverage.Let\u2019s say your primary base station is in the downstairs living room, and you have a satellite station in the upstairs office. When you are in the office and loading a webpage on a laptop, the primary base station retrieves the webpage data and bounces it to the satellite station, which then beams it to your computer in the office in what\u2019s known as a hop.\u201cIt\u2019s like taking a flight where you can\u2019t fly direct, but you can fly indirectly through a hub,\u201d Mr. Fraser said. \u201cIf you go into the back room, there\u2019s no signal. The only way you can get there is through two shorter flights.\u201dIn addition to expanding your Wi-Fi range, a mesh system helps your device automatically connect to the strongest station as you move about the house. When you\u2019re in the living room, your smartphone will automatically pull a signal from the station there; when you move to the bedroom, your smartphone will seamlessly switch to the station there.That\u2019s better than what we could do with older router setups. With a traditional Wi-Fi router, your signal would degrade the farther you move from the base station. You could boost a Wi-Fi router\u2019s connection with an extender station. But in that situation, you would have to manually connect your device to the extender\u2019s Wi-Fi network, and when you moved away from the extender, you would have to manually switch back to the main router\u2019s Wi-Fi network. That\u2019s a pain.Finally, mesh systems like Eero, which looks like a sleek white hub with rounded corners, and Google Wifi, which is a white cylindrically shaped device, aren\u2019t eyesores. So you need not be shy about putting the Wi-Fi hubs out in the open, like on a side table, for a clear line of sight with your gadgets.The main downside of a mesh network is that you lose some speed with every so-called hop.Let\u2019s say that your primary Wi-Fi station is in the living room, you have a satellite hub in the basement, and in between those two rooms there is another satellite hub in the garage. In the basement, your speeds will be slower, because the primary router makes a copy of the data as it hops to the satellite in the garage, and then the satellite in the garage produces another copy that reaches the satellite in the basement. As a result, it will take more time for that data to travel to your device via the basement hub.Despite the sluggishness, that is still better than getting a crummy signal or no connection at all in the basement if you had just one router.Netgear\u2019s Orbi works differently than traditional mesh systems. It has a dedicated Wi-Fi band, or connection, in which only the router and satellites can talk to each other; no other devices can interfere with their connection. Hence Orbi\u2019s hubs can transfer data more quickly to one another than systems like Eero and Google Wifi can.Google says the rule of thumb for choosing a package is that each access point covers about 1,500 square feet of space. But configurations will vary depending on the layout of your home and the materials inside your walls. In my roughly 1,100-square-foot apartment, I needed two access points because my main rooms are separated by a long hallway.Yet speed isn\u2019t everything. Eero\u2019s app was the easiest to understand, which made setting up and checking on the status of the Wi-Fi system extremely smooth. Google Wifi\u2019s app was also intuitive, though less polished than Eero\u2019s. Netgear\u2019s Orbi had the clunkiest setup, requiring an arcane web browser interface to get started, and the configuration language would probably be intimidating for those who are not information technology professionals.In addition, the Orbi, which looks like a water purifier pitcher, is the bulkiest and ugliest of the three, so you may feel tempted to hide it behind a pile of books, which would weaken its signal.Consumers would probably be happy with any of these systems compared to a traditional router. If speed is your top priority, consider the Orbi. If price is a concern, go with a Google Wifi package. Or if your goal is to make Wi-Fi less of a headache for you or a loved one, buy an Eero system.If you live in a tiny space, like a studio apartment, a mesh network is probably overkill. But you may still want to consider buying a single Eero or Google Wifi hub to take advantage of their intuitive apps for managing your Wi-Fi.The complexity of Wi-Fi is what inspired Eero\u2019s chief executive, Nick Weaver, to create a mesh product. Years ago, he grew frustrated with getting phone calls from his parents begging for help whenever their internet connections failed.\u201cIf something broke, there were no logs to understand how to improve it,\u201d Mr. Weaver said. \u201cThis kept driving me crazier and crazier.\u201dHe ended up plugging his parents\u2019 networking gear into a surge protector and labeling the power button \u201cinternet kill switch\u201d for them to easily reset their internet connection whenever it went down.Now his parents use Eero\u2019s mesh system \u2014 and love it, Mr. Weaver said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spotify May Go Public Without Raising Capital", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsSpotify could be marching to the beat of its own drummer.The $8.5 billion music-streaming service is considering listing its shares directly without raising any new capital, Mergermarket and The Wall Street Journal have reported. It would be a departure from convention that does not occur often, for a reason.Going public by any route is uncommon. Sums raised by new issues in the United States tumbled by half last year to the lowest in more than a decade, according to Thomson Reuters. Ample private funding and new rules under the Jobs Act enable companies like Airbnb and Uber to steer clear of the market\u2019s bright lights for longer.Though Spotify is losing money \u2014 173 million euros in 2015, the latest figures disclosed by its Luxembourg holding company \u2014 its cash needs may be getting less urgent. It just struck a new licensing deal with Universal Music which would lower Spotify\u2019s onerous revenue share if it can attract enough new customers. Paying subscribers have nearly doubled since 2015 to exceed 50 million.Its coffers should be relatively full. Spotify has raised more than $1.5 billion over the last two years. Investors may be getting itchy, though. Terms of the convertible debt 11-year-old Spotify issued last year also put pressure on it to go public soon.By simply taking shares to market without seeking new capital, Spotify would provide its backers an easier way to sell while avoiding some of the traditional rigmarole of an initial public offering, including banking fees that can be as much as 7 percent of funds raised. The company, led by Daniel Ek, easily meets the New York Stock Exchange criteria, too.Spotify\u2019s recognizable brand may be enough to overcome the lack of analyst coverage and liquidity. This route to market, however, does not provide the broad institutional shareholder base achieved by an initial public offering and offers no proper valuation.Freddie Mac listed directly in the 1980s to help its financial industry backers get out, and a handful of nontraded real estate investment trusts have done so, too. Google\u2019s unconventional Dutch auction in 2004 left a lot of money on the table, and is a big reason no major tech outfit has followed the same blueprint.It seems a little pointless to take the I, P and O out of Spotify.Advertisement"}

Internet Policy Research Initiative, who was a technology policy official in the Obama administration.Broadband companies, privacy experts said, occupy a different position than internet companies. Google and Facebook, they noted, are corporate giants with plenty of market clout. But they are not a fundamental pathway to the internet the way the broadband providers are. And, privacy experts said, there is little or no competition for broadband service in many markets.\u201cYou can live without Google or Facebook,\u201d said Dallas Harris, a legal and policy fellow at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit consumer group. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty difficult to walk away from internet service altogether.\u201dThe privacy practices of internet companies are overseen by the Federal Trade Commission, while broadband providers fall under the F.C.C. Since the 1990s, the trade commission has policed the privacy practices of internet companies under its mandate to protect consumers from \u201cunfair and deceptive practices.\u201dThe F.T.C. requires internet companies to have privacy policies that the agency finds acceptable, and it conducts investigations into violations. Privacy advocates have criticized the trade commission for giving the companies too much freedom.\u201cIt is lightweight regulation, but there is a real enforcement backstop as well,\u201d Mr. Weitzner said.Broadband carriers all have privacy policies. They can be sued by private plaintiffs and investigated by Congress, as they were about a decade ago, when an intrusive surveillance technique of personal data trails, known as deep packet inspection, came to light.Yet Google and Facebook account for two-thirds of online ad revenue, and their share of the market is growing. \u201cThe challenge is that Google and Facebook dominate this market,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen & Company.The broadband suppliers have \u201cvaluable, anonymized profiles of users,\u201d Mr. Gallant said, adding, \u201cBut it\u2019s not clear what the size of the market for the raw data is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Training Ad Placement Computers to Be Offended", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 Over the years, Google trained computer systems to keep copyrighted content and pornography off its YouTube service. But after seeing ads from Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart appear next to racist, anti-Semitic or terrorist videos, its engineers realized their computer models had a blind spot: They did not understand context.Now teaching computers to understand what humans can readily grasp may be the key to calming fears among big-spending advertisers that their ads have been appearing alongside videos from extremist groups and other offensive messages.Google engineers, product managers and policy wonks are trying to train computers to grasp the nuances of what makes certain videos objectionable. Advertisers may tolerate use of a racial epithet in a hip-hop video, for example, but may be horrified to see it used in a video from a racist skinhead group.Consumers watch more than a billion hours on YouTube every day, making it the dominant video platform on the internet and an obvious beneficiary as advertising money moves online from television. But the recent problems opened Google to criticism that it was not doing enough to look out for advertisers. It is a significant problem for a multibillion-dollar company that still gets most of its revenue through advertising.\u201cWe take this as seriously as we\u2019ve ever taken a problem,\u201d Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, said in an interview last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in emergency mode.\u201dOver the last two weeks, Google has changed what types of videos can carry advertising, barring ads from appearing with hate speech or discriminatory content.In addition, Google is simplifying how advertisers can exclude specific sites, channels and videos across YouTube and Google\u2019s display network. It is allowing brands to fine-tune the types of content they want to avoid, such as \u201csexually suggestive\u201d or \u201csensational/bizarre\u201d videos.It is also putting in more stringent safety standards by default, so an advertiser must choose to place ads next to more provocative content. Google created an expedited way to alert it when ads appear next to offensive content.The Silicon Valley giant is trying to reassure companies like Unilever, the world\u2019s second-largest advertiser, with a portfolio of consumer brands like Dove and Ben & Jerry\u2019s. As other brands started fleeing YouTube, Unilever discovered three instances in which its brands appeared on objectionable YouTube channels.But Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever, decided not to withdraw its ads because the number of ads appearing with objectionable content was proportionally small. The average $100,000 YouTube campaign runs across more than 7,000 channels, according to the video analytics firm OpenSlate, and Unilever spends hundreds of millions of dollars on YouTube. Also, Google discovered that the ads in question appeared because of a human error in setting safety levels.Mr. Weed said it was in Unilever\u2019s best interest to win concessions from Google instead of cutting ties. As part of its new measures, Google agreed to work with outside companies to provide third-party verification about where ads appeared on YouTube.When he broached the idea of independent verification in the past, Mr. Weed said, Google executives acted as though he had suggested the company was not trustworthy. He said the issue was not about trust, but about companies being able to \u201cmark their own homework.\u201d He said he thought that Google would have agreed eventually, but that \u201cthe current situation accelerated their plans.\u201dGoogle\u2019s efforts are being noticed. Johnson & Johnson, for example, said it had resumed YouTube advertising in a number of countries. Google said other companies were starting to return.For the most part, Google failed to address the issue adequately before because it did not have to; the instances in which ads appeared next to objectionable content happened infrequently and out of view from the broader public. Google said that for many of its top advertisers, the objectionable videos accounted for fewer than one one-thousandth of a percent of their total ad impressions.To train the computers, Google is applying machine-learning techniques \u2014 the underlying technology for many of its biggest breakthroughs, like the self-driving car. It has also brought in large human teams (it declined to say how big) to review the appropriateness of videos that computers flagged as questionable.Essentially, they are training computers to recognize footage of a woman in a sports bra and leggings doing yoga poses in an exercise video safe for advertising and not sexually suggestive content. Similarly, they will mark video of a Hollywood action star waving a gun as acceptable to some advertisers, while flagging a similar image involving an Islamic State gunman as inappropriate.Google used a similar approach in the past to create an automated rating system for videos, similar to movie ratings, based on appropriateness of content for specific audiences. But Google is now trying to solve a different problem.\u201cComputers have a much harder time understanding context, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re actually using all of our latest and greatest machine learning abilities now to get a better feel for this,\u201d Mr. Schindler said.Armed with human-verified examples of what is safe and what is not, Google\u2019s computer systems break down the images of a YouTube video frame by frame, analyzing every image. They also digest what is being said, the video\u2019s description from the creator and other signals to detect patterns and identify subtle cues for what makes a video inappropriate.The idea is for machines to eventually make the tough calls. In the instances when brands feel that Google failed to flag an inappropriate video, that example is fed back into the system so it improves over time. Google said it had already flagged five times as many videos as inappropriate for advertising, although it declined to provide absolute numbers on how many videos that entailed.With more than a billion videos on YouTube, 400 hours of new content being uploaded every minute and three million ad-supported channels on the platform, Mr. Schindler said it was impossible to guarantee that Google could eradicate the problem completely. He made a comparison to how a car company could not promise that even a new tire would never fail in the first 10,000 miles.\u201cNo system can be 100 percent perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re working as hard as we can to make it as safe as possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With New Funding, Didi Chuxing, an Uber Rival, Looks Beyond China", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byWhen Uber pulled out of China last summer, it appeared to be the end of two years of frenzied competition with the local rival Didi Chuxing.Yet with a new funding round that has brought in $5.5 billion, it seems the Chinese firm wants to take the rivalry global.The investment, which Didi Chuxing announced in a statement on Friday, values the company at about $50 billion, according to someone who was familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak publicly about the details. That valuation makes it the second most valuable start-up in the world, behind Uber.The new financing could bring Didi Chuxing back into competition with Uber: Analysts expect the Chinese company to use the funds to push into new markets and to develop autonomous driving technologies.The fund-raising efforts indicate just how valuable it can be to dominate China, an internet-savvy market with the world\u2019s largest smartphone-using population, which is nevertheless largely closed to foreign competition. Despite having done little outside China, Didi Chuxing has been able to raise almost as much money as Uber.With the infusion, Didi Chuxing\u2019s expansion will be watched closely as a signal of the ability of Chinese start-ups to expand beyond their home market.While Chinese internet companies have innovated at home, becoming some of the largest businesses in the world, they have a mixed track record in expanding abroad.Didi Chuxing was also expected to use part of the new funds to develop next-generation technologies. There, too, it faces stiff competition. Google, Uber and the Chinese search engine Baidu all have a lead in development of autonomous driving. In March, Didi Chuxing said it was creating an artificial-intelligence lab in Silicon Valley to help it create driverless car and security technologies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Everything You Need to Know About the Met Gala 2017", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayUnofficially, the night\u2019s festivities have been called many things, including \u201cthe party of the year,\u201d \u201cthe Oscars of the East Coast\u201d (mostly because of the star quotient and the elaborate red carpet, in which guests pose on the grand entrance stairs to the museum) and, somewhat pointedly, \u201can A.T.M. for the Met,\u201d the last by the publicist Paul Wilmot.85 PhotosWhy is it called the party of the year?Ms. Wintour, the editor of American Vogue and the artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast, took over as chairwoman of the gala in 1999. Since then, she has been instrumental in transforming a local philanthropic event into the ultimate global celebrity/power cocktail: Take a jigger of famous names from fashion, add film, politics and business, and mix. It\u2019s such a heady combo that President Trump proposed to his wife, Melania, during the gala in 2004. (In case you are wondering: No, they are not expected this year.) It is among the hardest party tickets of the year to get \u2014 and thus, intensely coveted.What\u2019s so important about Rei Kawakubo? Who is she?Besides, know this: She also runs a multimillion-dollar international business full of lots of wearable stuff, and collaborates regularly with Nike and Speedo. If you ever see someone in a blue and white striped T-shirt with a google-eyed heart logo on the breast, that is one of hers. So are all the Dover Street Markets around the world.25 PhotosHow much does the gala cost?Tickets this year are $30,000 apiece, and tables are about $275,000. The party and exhibition are sponsored, so all of the money from ticket sales goes to the Costume Institute. Last year, approximately $13.5 million was raised. In past years, there was one main corporate underwriter per show, alongside Ms. Wintour\u2019s employer, Cond\u00e9 Nast. Last year it was Apple, but this year the burden is being divided among Apple, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Farfetch, H & M and Maison Valentino.Of course, not everyone pays for a ticket. Brands often invite celebrities to sit at their table, and Ms. Wintour also often invites up-and-coming designers who may not be able to afford a ticket and scatters them around the event.How many people attend?Last year, about 600. This year, a spokeswoman for the museum said it wanted to keep it more \u201cintimate\u201d and \u201cprivate,\u201d so the number will be slightly lower.So if I can afford a ticket, can I go?Dream on. Unlike other cultural fund-raisers, like the New York City Ballet gala or the Frick Collection Young Fellows Ball, the Met gala is invitation-only, and there is a waiting list to get on the list. Qualifications for inclusion have to do with buzz and achievement (and beauty) more than money. Ms. Wintour has final say over every invitation and attendee, which means that even if a company buys a table, it cannot choose everyone who sits at its table: It must clear the guest with her and Vogue.43 PhotosO.K., you\u2019re saying I can\u2019t go. So why should I care?Speaking of outfits, do attendees have to dress in theme?All of that may pale, however, compared with what we will see this year. Why? Because, in honor of Ms. Kawakubo\u2019s own desire to push boundaries \u2014 this has resulted in dresses that sprouted lumps and bumps on odd parts off the body, dresses that turned women into flat-packed paper dolls and dresses that turned wedding dresses into cages \u2014 guests are being encouraged to think \u201cavant-garde.\u201d Just ruminate on that for a moment.Generally, it is advisable to play it safe and get really, really dressed up. Ms. Kawakubo herself almost always wears a long pleated skirt, white shirt and leather motorcycle jacket. It\u2019s unclear if even this black-tie event will be any different.What about celebrities?Ms. Kawakubo is famous for not playing the celebrity game, but Lady Gaga and Ms. Perry have both worn her clothes in the past. This year, you can also expect a fair amount of Valentino, given that the company is an underwriter. For the last few years, Beyonc\u00e9 has made the final entrance, but since she is about to have twins, she may well be sitting this one out. Which means the race to take her place in that power position will be something to see.How long has this been going on?The publicist Eleanor Lambert started the gala in 1948 as a typical philanthropic endeavor for the great and good of New York society. Pat Buckley, the wife of the conservative pundit William F. Buckley Jr., took over as chairwoman in 1979, but it has morphed into its current form only since the turn of the millennium. Ms. Wintour now oversees every detail, down to timed entrances for guests.What happens when guests get inside?It\u2019s a secret! For the past two years, posting on social media has been banned after the red carpet. What I can tell you is this: There is a receiving line inside with the hosts, and guests have to file by and air-kiss them. Then they tour the exhibition on their way to the cocktail party, so they are at least theoretically forced to see the culture. After cocktails, they are called in to dinner, and there is always some form of entertainment. (Last year, it was the Weeknd.) This is good, because as the red carpet part of the evening has become a giant marketing event \u2014 live streamed on a variety of sites and shown on E!, just like the Oscars \u2014 the fact that the main part of the event is private allows guests to relax and have fun.Or so they tell me.This article is an update of a column that appeared in 2016.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Leader Seeks Tech Companies\u2019 Views on Net Neutrality", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, met with Facebook and other tech companies this week to seek feedback on his intention to unwind aspects of net neutrality, the rules that require broadband providers to make all internet content equally accessible for consumers.Mr. Pai said on Thursday that his visits with executives at Facebook, Cisco, Oracle and Intel were constructive and that he believed the companies wanted to find \u201ccommon ground.\u201d Web companies have supported net neutrality, saying the protections guard them from paying tolls to get their content in front of consumers. Mr. Pai said that he agreed with the broad principles of net neutrality but that the rules, created by the commission in 2015, went too far in restricting broadband providers.\u201cI think they were appreciative,\u201d Mr. Pai said of the tech companies. \u201cI have been soliciting thoughts on online protections.\u201dMr. Pai said on Thursday that he wanted to overturn the declaration of broadband as a utility-like service, which puts stricter rules on broadband providers, akin to what phone services face today.Facebook and Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Pai\u2019s remarks. The Internet Association, a trade group that represents Facebook, Google and Netflix, recently met with Mr. Pai and urged him to keep the rules intact.A Cisco spokeswoman said Mr. Pai had asked the company\u2019s chief executive, Chuck Robbins, to gather some Silicon Valley leaders to discuss the future of net neutrality. The informal discussion was held at Cisco\u2019s campus in San Jose, Calif., the spokeswoman said.In a statement, Oracle said its discussion with Mr. Pai this week was broad and did not address any specific policy proposals currently under consideration. Oracle has previously said it supports Mr. Pai\u2019s agenda, and its meetings with him have included one with the company\u2019s chief executive, Safra Catz, who was on Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team.The commission\u2019s direction under Mr. Pai has alarmed consumer groups. Michael Copps, a former Democratic commissioner, said companies like AT&T and Comcast that have heavily lobbied the commission to roll back rules would directly benefit from the recent actions.\u201cThis is the price we pay for the outrageous influence of money in politics,\u201d said Mr. Copps, a special adviser to the consumer group Common Cause. \u201cThe public interest suffers, and we are poorer \u2014 economically and civically \u2014 for it.\u201dIn votes split down party lines on Thursday, Mr. Pai pushed forward a plan that will ease standards to allow telecom carriers like AT&T and CenturyLink to raise fees for small businesses, wireless carriers, hospitals and libraries to connect to the main arteries of their broadband networks. AT&T and other telecom giants had heavily lobbied for the new rule.In a dramatic reversal from the Obama administration, which was pushing for caps on pricing, Mr. Pai said telecom companies should have more freedom to set their own rates. \u201cPrice regulation threatens competition and investment,\u201d he said.The commission also approved a separate proposal easing restrictions on broadcast television corporations seeking to buy more stations. Mignon Clyburn, the Democratic commissioner, voted against the proposal and warned that greater media consolidation would give fewer companies a bigger voice.\u201cThis is industry consolidation month\u201d at the F.C.C., she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T\u2019s Words on Time Warner Deal Say \u2018Underdog.\u2019 Its Actions Speak Otherwise.", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Supported byBut in several cities and states, AT&T\u2019s actions send a different message.In Nashville and Louisville, Ky., AT&T has sued to make it harder for rival broadband providers to use utility poles. In Missouri, Tennessee and North Carolina, the company has pushed for laws that block municipal broadband providers. In San Francisco, AT&T has fought efforts to open up apartment buildings to more internet service providers.In other words, AT&T has positioned itself as the incumbent telecommunications juggernaut that has acted to hamper competitors locally.With its giant deal with Time Warner under review at the Justice Department, AT&T\u2019s contrasting federal and local actions are glaring. While AT&T\u2019s two-sided messaging follows a strategy used by many big companies, any evidence that the telecom company thwarts local rivals could make the deal review tougher and invite costly conditions, telecom antitrust experts said \u2014 even though they still expect the acquisition to be approved.\u201cAntitrust officials may have a hard time buying AT&T\u2019s argument that it will expand broadband competition and not seek to harm competitors if they find the company is actively working to block new broadband players from entering the markets AT&T already dominates,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, the president of Public Knowledge, a consumer group, and a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, who opposes the merger.AT&T said it was not being hypocritical. It said its local activities were aimed at fighting misguided and potentially illegal regulations and that it was seeking to protect jobs and the quality of its service. Its rivals, including Google Fiber, have also lobbied to influence city and state leaders to break into new markets, AT&T said.\u201cAny suggestion that this is about impeding competition, rather than protecting our customers and our network, is flatly wrong,\u201d an AT&T spokesman said in a statement.AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner, announced in October, is the Trump administration\u2019s first big test on corporate mergers. During the election campaign last year, President Trump made a populist promise to block the megamerger. His disdain for CNN, the cable network owned by Time Warner, has also loomed over the transaction.AT&T said it expected the merger review to be complete by the end of the year.\u201cCable still enjoys key advantages in the marketplace,\u201d such as its dominance in cable television and broadband, Mr. Stephenson said at the hearing. \u201cOur Time Warner transaction will enable us to offset those advantages with better, more innovative video offerings.\u201dMembers of Congress and their staff said AT&T\u2019s lobbyists had argued in meetings that it would be difficult to compete with cable firms like Comcast without owning Time Warner\u2019s television and movie content, which it wants to stream to its mobile customers.Yet even as AT&T was spreading that message on Capitol Hill, the company was acting like a powerhouse in Nashville by fighting against new competitors on several fronts, city officials said. One of those rivals was Google Fiber, the broadband service provider begun in 2010 and owned by Alphabet.For about two years, Google Fiber has been trying to expand its business in Nashville but has been unable to quickly connect its broadband lines to utility poles. AT&T owns 20 percent of the city\u2019s poles, with the rest owned by the local electricity provider. Google has attached its lines to only about three dozen of the city\u2019s 10,000 utility poles.After hearing Google\u2019s complaints, a Nashville City Council member, Anthony Davis, proposed legislation that would accelerate the attachment process, which was approved in September. Weeks later, AT&T sued to knock it down. Comcast followed with its own lawsuit.AT&T, which had filed a lawsuit in Louisville against similar local legislation, argued that the new laws on pole attachment violated its property rights and could affect the quality of service.\u201cWe have opposed these efforts because we are concerned that such unilateral action could potentially result in service outages for our own customers,\u201d AT&T said in a statement.The company added that Google had exaggerated the delay times for pole attachments and that it supported the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s efforts to create pole attachment rules to take the place of a patchwork of local laws.Google declined to comment.AT&T\u2019s suits in Nashville and Louisville are pending. If Nashville\u2019s law is overturned, Mr. Davis said, residents would suffer. \u201cNow consumers are hurting because of AT&T\u2019s suit to protect their position,\u201d he said.AT&T has also fought for legislation in Tennessee, North Carolina and several other states to thwart municipal broadband providers. Last year, AT&T had the most lobbyists in Tennessee, with 14 full-time lobbyists and additional outside lobbyists hired to contest several bills in the state legislature that considered permissions for publicly run broadband networks.The proposals, AT&T argued, unfairly pit private broadband companies against city broadband providers that may have access to public funding and tax breaks. Most of the bills were defeated, with one currently under consideration by the legislature.While lobbying does not violate antitrust law, AT&T\u2019s actions have drawn criticism from some consumer interest groups and Democratic lawmakers who have pressured regulators to strongly scrutinize the Time Warner deal.\u201cAT&T consistently supports a legislative agenda that would eliminate consumer choice and deny competitors the ability to invest in broadband that could bring more choice,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, a director of Common Cause, a consumer group that supports municipal broadband networks.In San Francisco, AT&T\u2019s DirecTV belongs to a trade group that in February petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to overturn a city ordinance that prohibits exclusive deals for access to wiring inside buildings with multiple dwelling units. AT&T and other broadband providers would have benefited from exclusive rights to wiring within apartment buildings. They say the city is violating their property rights to wiring they own in the buildings.Mark Farrell, a member of San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors, said the rule was intended to open up competition to companies like Webpass, a subsidiary of Google Fiber, and SonicNet, which have struggled for access to the wiring of apartment buildings. Mr. Farrell has said residents have complained of few options for broadband in the city.So far, San Francisco has upheld the new rules.Advertisement"}

It is colored by emotions, shaped by biology and underscored by morality. The memories you carry aren\u2019t so much unvarnished facts as they are the truth you believe in. The fact that memory is so mutable isn\u2019t always a problem. But it becomes one for Maia on this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d as she learns quite painfully that her unreliable memory and lack of self-preservation are damning qualities.Structurally speaking, this is one of the show\u2019s strongest episodes to date, thanks to its sharp focus. It alternates between two story lines that on the surface seem to have little to do with each other. In the first, Boseman is contacted about a potential police brutality case involving a notably unlawful police officer, Andrew Thoreau (Scott Aiello). It\u2019s the kind of case Boseman has been waiting for. But the victim isn\u2019t the black man he and Diane initially assume he\u2019ll be before they go to the jail to visit their potential client. Rather, it\u2019s a white billionaire with a prickly reputation (to put it mildly), whom Diane has a history with: Colin Sweeney (Dylan Baker). Elsewhere, Maia is questioned by quirky F.B.I. agent named Madeline Starkey (Jane Lynch). Under the conditions of her proffer, as long as Maia is truthful she won\u2019t be prosecuted. But that proves difficult as her memories are warped by the guilt she has over her parents\u2019 mistakes.The episode mines the police brutality case for its humor, with Sweeney acting as his own worst enemy. He makes frustrating outbursts in court. He refuses to have Richard Hess (Paul Niebanck) questioned because they were both heading to the same lurid party in Arlington Heights; doing so would ruin Sweeney\u2019s chances of becoming an ambassador. Sweeney often makes crude commentary in regard to race, comparing himself to Rodney King and claiming victimization. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the black people who get brutalized,\u201d he tells Diane with a straight face. \u201cIt\u2019s people like me \u2026 the misunderstood.\u201dBoseman and Diane make a compelling team. Each lawyer\u2019s energy plays well off the other\u2019s, even as the case grows more complicated. That Sweeney escapes jail time and Thoreau loses his job is almost beside the point. Early on, Sweeney\u2019s sole purpose in the story seems to be to lighten up an episode that deals with Maia\u2019s familial and legal problems. Their story lines have little in common at first glance. But as the episode digs deeper into Maia\u2019s memories, it becomes clear she shares at least one defining characteristic with Sweeney: privilege.This second major story line of the season\u2019s penultimate episode wisely fleshes out Maia, who in the past has felt like a cipher. Her memories, which include a pivotal 18th birthday party, are deftly explored, giving a vantage point into her emotional state. But instead of making Maia a more interesting character, this tactic only reveals her to be an infuriating one. Maia is so easily undone by Madeline it\u2019s hard to imagine she could ever make a good lawyer.Madeline smartly weaponizes a folksy demeanor that lulls Maia into a sense of safety. Madeline\u2019s office is crammed with knickknacks and paper work, suggesting that she may be a bit scatterbrained. But it\u2019s all a ruse. Madeline cleverly presents evidence that causes false memories to bubble up in Maia\u2019s mind about doctor visits with her mother and fights that never happened. \u201cShe\u2019s not your friend,\u201d warns Lucca, who is representing Maia. But Maia doesn\u2019t have the strength not to fall victim to Madeline\u2019s clever machinations. Madeline gets at the heart of Maia\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 by asking how Maia could have possibly had no idea about Lenore\u2019s affair or her father\u2019s Ponzi scheme. Maia\u2019s privilege at once blinded her from reality and coddled her from the downfall of her parents\u2019 decisions.This should be a showcase for Maia as a character, but instead it\u2019s Lucca who shines. Her guarded expression when Madeline offers them chocolates and spins an anecdote about her husband reveals that Lucca is not easily won over by Madeline\u2019s charms. \u201cI Googled you over lunch,\u201d Lucca says. \u201cYou\u2019re not married.\u201d She\u2019s wonderful. Maia, though, is as flat as ever. She is too easily swayed by the people around her. It\u2019s why she has been able to ignore the obvious faults of her parents. It\u2019s why she got involved with a terrible boyfriend and joined the board of a charity whose finances she knew nothing about. And it\u2019s why she breaks the law when Henry needs her to in the wake of his possible suicide attempt.When \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d began, it seemed as though Maia would the be the closest thing the show had to an analogue for Alicia Florrick: a woman forced to take charge of her own life after great tragedy and after having spent a life on the sidelines. But Maia has no guiding principles of her own. Her undying loyalty to parents who have proven to be dangerous isn\u2019t a byproduct of kindness. It\u2019s evidence of a person who can\u2019t stand on her own. It isn\u2019t surprising, then, that despite Lucca\u2019s advice, Maia ends the episode looking at the possibility of a prosecution. Whether Madeline is right about Maia\u2019s guilt or Lucca is right to suppose that Maia\u2019s memories are being warped by present circumstances doesn\u2019t matter. Maia is facing the fight of her life with this impending prosecution, and she has no one to blame but herself.Other Gossip:\u2022 Diane looked resplendent in the turquoise dress she wore at Maia\u2019s 18th birthday party. A lot of the costuming in this episode was wisely chosen. What Maia and Lucca wear to the last meeting with Madeline has a dour, funereal quality that telegraphs the outcome.\u2022 I loved that Jay\u2019s skill as an investigator was developed in a way that didn\u2019t involve Marissa\u2019s getting in the way. (She was blessedly absent.) Although his appearance is brief, it\u2019s interesting to see him navigate the rarefied air of rich, privileged and dangerous white men who aren\u2019t used to being held accountable for their misdeeds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spreading Plan C to End Pregnancy", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byFixesAfter lunch on a Saturday in late January at her home in Los Angeles, Francine Coeytaux, 63, an abortion rights activist, retrieved a Priority Mail envelope from her office and announced to her guests, a group of young women she had recruited to her cause, the results of a recent experiment. \u201cA couple weeks ago, we Googled \u2018abortion pills\u2019 and tried ordering from a few of the sites that came up,\u201d she said.The pills, misoprostol and mifepristone, are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use by a licensed provider to end a pregnancy within the first 10 weeks, or what is known as \u201cmedical abortion.\u201d Mifepristone works by blocking the effects of progesterone, a hormone without which the lining of the uterus begins to break down, while misoprostol, to be taken 24 to 48 hours later, induces contractions of the uterus that expel its contents.\u201cAnd guess what?\u201d Ms. Coeytaux said, then paused, eyebrows arching. \u201cIt worked.\u201d Within two weeks, she said, the pills had arrived on her doorstep. The cost, including shipping, came to just over $200, but the question remained: Was this the real thing? Ms. Coeytaux passed the envelope around the table. Inside was a blister pack bearing the names of the medicines. The pack is marketed as the Mifegest Kit, but Ms. Coeytaux and colleagues call it Plan C.\u201cIt\u2019s the convenience and the privacy,\u201d said a Safe2Choose executive who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay hundreds of dollars.\u201d Though the groups do not mail pills to the United States \u2014 neither organization is willing to risk a legal backlash that could harm operations elsewhere \u2014 the Safe2Choose website receives tens of thousands of monthly visitors from the United States alone, the executive said. \u201cFirst they watch the video, then they read the testimonials. They seem to want to understand how it works and to assess whether we\u2019re reliable.\u201d\u201cThe fact is, women in the U.S. are already doing this, and the reproductive health community needs to catch up,\u201d Ms. Wells said. \u201cWe started Plan C because we believe it\u2019s time for bold action. We have to make sure women have the information they need, that they know their rights\u201d \u2014 for example, that they are not obligated to report to the police or providers that they have taken abortion pills; that the drugs can\u2019t be detected in their blood; and that knowing that a woman has used the pills has no bearing on follow-up care, which is the same as for a natural miscarriage.The risks of self-induced abortion today are primarily legal. \u201cWe\u2019ve discovered 40 different kinds of laws that are potentially implicated when someone ends their own pregnancy,\u201d said Jill E. Adams, chief strategist of the Self-Induced Abortion Legal Team, a nonprofit consortium formed in 2015 to support advocates who legally share information on self-induced abortion and to halt its criminalization. So far, she said, the S.I.A. team has identified 18 arrests related to self-induced abortion around the country, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s just what made the news. I suspect the true number is significantly higher.\u201dIn describing their own experiences, both said the sites offering pills did look sketchy. \u201cI was looking around one and then went out for a jog,\u201d Ms. Coeytaux said. \u201cBy the time I got back, the site was gone. But then a couple days later it was back up.\u201d Some sites accepted credit cards; others required a bank transfer. Ms. Wells posed as a teenager and tried to imagine how frightening it would be if she were 17. When it appeared that a package was stuck in customs in New York, Ms. Wells emailed the vendor.\u201cAnd they replied every time,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, the other day, I checked that inbox, and he had sent me a message: \u2018How are you? How is your health?\u2019 \u201d Still, when the pills come, she said, there are no instructions or labeling \u2014 \u201cjust the blister pack in an envelope.\u201dMs. Coeytaux and Ms. Wells hope that by sharing their experiences on the Plan C site, they can help women navigate the unknown. They acknowledge that there will always be women who prefer to see a provider and say that all women should have access to one. But in drawing attention to an option that isn\u2019t strictly legal, they have touched on tensions at the heart of an abortion rights movement increasingly rived by what some say are competing aims.\u201cFor so long, the whole objective was to make abortion a legitimate health care service, to bring it out of the shadows and remove the stigma,\u201d said Joanna Erdman, assistant professor at Dalhousie University\u2019s Schulich School of Law in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who is working on a book about the abortion clinic. \u201cSo this effort to remedy a crisis of access by making the \u2018back street\u2019 safer \u2014 it\u2019s very counterintuitive for a lot of older figures in the movement. They get very nervous about the idea of leaving women to their own devices.\u201dAs Ms. Erdman sees it, Plan C is not just health advocacy; it\u2019s a form of political resistance, part of a larger struggle for the right of access to \u201cinformation instrumental to women\u2019s self-determination.\u201d Underlying it, she said, is the same feminist ideology of \u201cself-help\u201d that guided the many safe-abortion initiatives before it, including, most notably, the Abortion Counseling Service of Women\u2019s Liberation, or Jane.Decades later, the tools have changed. But the sentiment remains the same.An earlier version of this article misstated the duration of pregnancy during which use of the misoprostol-mifepristone regimen is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It is within the first 10 weeks, not nine. Patrick Adams is a freelance journalist based in Atlanta, and an occasional contributor to Fixes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Soon, Your Car May Be Able to Read Your Expressions", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byWheelsWhen you shop for cat food online, Amazon knows who you are. When you look for the best airfares for summer vacation, Google knows who you are. Soon, when you get behind the wheel, your car may recognize you, too.Using cameras with facial recognition software and other biometric indicators, automakers are looking to personalize the driving experience with cars that stare back at you, quietly adjusting seats and driving modes. They may even anticipate your wants and desires by playing your favorite music based on your mood. And it\u2019s not only about convenience, but also about the possibility of improving safety and security.Continental has already demonstrated in-car systems that allow drivers to register their faces using something as simple as a driver\u2019s license picture. An interior infrared camera is used to overcome potential obstacles like sunglasses, which would stymie a conventional video camera. Putting the camera in the center instrument cluster also helps to pinpoint the driver\u2019s eyes, even if she\u2019s wearing a hat. The biggest technical challenge \u2014 glare caused by sunlight \u2014 can be filtered out using machine learning, Mr. Bolton said.Once the car knows who you are, systems in vehicles like the Chrysler Portal concept car would automatically adjust the seat for maximum comfort, select a driving mode (for example, one driver likes to let the car do most of the work; another likes taking control in sport mode) and suggest a destination based on the owner\u2019s past behavior.Watching a driver\u2019s face can also give a car important clues about that person\u2019s state of mind. For several years, carmakers like Ford and tech companies like Intel have been interested in determining whether a driver is happy or sad. Depending on your mood, a car could change its tune, playing a bouncy Beach Boys song and changing the interior lighting to improve your attitude.There are practical reasons as well, designers say, for detecting a driver\u2019s emotional state: A calm driver is a safer driver. So cars that recognize when you are becoming angry and thus prone to road rage could potentially quell annoying bells and chimes in the car and play some mellow jazz to soothe you.In this digital age, our faces are everywhere: in online company profiles, on Twitter accounts, even tagged in friends\u2019 Facebook accounts. Finding an image to print out and foil a car\u2019s facial recognition system would not be very difficult.Fortunately, engineers have devised high-tech countermeasures. Stereoscopic video cameras, for example, can tell the difference between a flat image and a three-dimensional object. Continental\u2019s cameras measure the distance of reflected light off various parts of a person\u2019s face, ensuring that it is a real object rather than a high-resolution shot of the owner\u2019s visage.\u201cSome systems have added blink detection and aliveness detection,\u201d said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer for security at Intel. But he acknowledged that it was still possible to thwart such technology. \u201cWe had 3-D masks printed that we ordered and were able to trick some systems,\u201d he said. But he said most thieves would be unlikely to go to such extreme lengths to steal a car.On the other hand, high-tech personalization could be used not only to create amenities for single owners, but also to instantly adapt a vehicle to suit a variety of drivers. Valets, for example, could be automatically prevented from accessing personal information in a navigation system or driving faster than, say, 30 miles per hour. In a ride-sharing situation, such systems could also be used to quickly tailor a car\u2019s interior to the physical characteristics of different drivers and passengers.Rental cars would be easier to operate and safer, Mr. Bolton of Continental said. \u201cIf I know where your head is and where your eyes are,\u201d he said, \u201cI can adjust the position of the steering wheel and the mirrors so you don\u2019t have to fumble looking for the right buttons.\u201dEven airbags could be fine-tuned, reducing the intensity of their deployment depending on the size and position of a driver or young passenger.Such convenience may come with some trade-offs on privacy.Using traffic-tracking programs like Waze, some consumers have already signaled their preference for convenience in return for giving up some information like their location. Programmers also point out that such services are optional: You don\u2019t have to let the company track you \u2014 but then you may get stuck in traffic for 45 minutes.And it could be fun. Consider the entertainment and social media repercussions in the vein of James Corden\u2019s \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d segments. A built-in camera could record and broadcast your singalong on Facebook or Twitter \u2014 assuming the car was in autonomous driving mode. Of course, drivers could grab quick selfies on the road, too.\u201cIt\u2019s a novel ideal,\u201d Mr. Bolton said, \u201cbut remember that an infrared camera makes your face look a little like a skeleton, so it\u2019s not that flattering.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Internet Privacy, VPNs Are an Imperfect Shield", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byTech FixA VPN was a natural service to consider in response. That\u2019s because the technology creates a virtual tunnel that shields your browsing information from your internet service provider. So Mr. Wilmot researched VPNs in hopes of protecting his own browsing data.\u201cI don\u2019t really want anybody to have any sort of access to what I\u2019m looking at,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone is going to profit off my privacy, I\u2019d prefer it to be me.\u201dBut while VPNs are worth considering, they are an incomplete and flawed solution. For one thing, they often slow down internet speeds significantly. Some apps and services may also stop working properly when you are connected to a virtual network.Still, VPNs are among several tools for better protecting your digital privacy. Here\u2019s an overview of the pros and cons, based on tests of VPN services and interviews with security experts.When you browse the web, a broadband provider helps route your device\u2019s internet traffic to each destination website. Each device you use has an identifier consisting of a string of numbers, also known as an IP address. When you are on the internet, a service provider can see which devices you use and which sites you visit.VPNs help cloak your browsing information from your internet provider. When you use VPN software, your device connects to a VPN provider\u2019s servers. That way, all your web traffic passes through the VPN provider\u2019s internet connection. So if your internet provider was trying to listen in on your web traffic, all it would see is the VPN server\u2019s IP address connected to the VPN service.\u201cWe provide you an encrypted tunnel from you to us,\u201d said Sean Sullivan, a security adviser for F-Secure, a Finland-based company that offers a VPN called Freedome.VPNs are especially handy when you are connecting to a public Wi-Fi network with which you aren\u2019t familiar. For example, when you use public Wi-Fi at a cafe, airport or hotel, it\u2019s often unclear who the service provider is and what its data collection policies entail. In this scenario, a VPN is highly recommended.VPNs also have the ability to make it appear as though your device is connecting from a different location. So if you are in Europe, traveling to Spain from France, and want to stream content that is only viewable in France, you could connect to a VPN server whose IP address is in France.VPN services have their downsides, and the biggest one is speed degradation. Because your internet traffic passes through a VPN provider\u2019s connection, you will likely see a dip in broadband performance.Speeds will vary depending on the VPN provider\u2019s infrastructure. In my tests with a Mac, download speeds dropped about 85 percent after connecting to F-Secure\u2019s Freedome VPN service, and by 50 percent when connected to another VPN service called Private Internet Access. In other words, if you are downloading large files over a VPN, it will take much longer to accomplish those tasks.Another drawback is that VPN services cost money. F-Secure charges $4.17 a month to use its service for a year on three devices, and Private Internet Access charges $6.95 per month or $40 a year on five devices. That\u2019s not a lot of money, but broadband service is generally expensive, and tacking on a few extra dollars a month to use the internet more privately can be annoying.In addition, some services may not work properly on a VPN. Netflix often blocks them to keep people from streaming content that is not licensed for their regions. In tests with Freedome and Private Internet Access, I tried connecting to a server in Mexico to stream the catalog of Netflix movies available there. With both VPN services, Netflix detected I was using a VPN and prevented movies from playing.For VPN providers, this is a known issue. F-Secure\u2019s Mr. Sullivan said that when services like Netflix block VPNs, they are probably \u201cputting up a fight for Hollywood.\u201dThere are hundreds of VPNs on the market, and vetting them can be overwhelming.Runa Sandvik, a director of information security for The New York Times, said that consumers should be scrupulous about reading privacy policies and selecting a VPN they can trust. That\u2019s because a VPN service is also tied to an internet service provider, meaning a VPN provider could share your information with the service provider if it wanted to do so.Based on those recommendations, I tried Private Internet Access and Freedome for my tests. Both products were easy to use: Just install an app on your smartphone, computer or tablet and hit a button to connect to a server. In the end, I preferred Private Internet Access because of its faster speeds.All things considered, VPN is only a partial solution for keeping your browsing data private.\u201cThe real problem is ads are dangerous,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company. \u201cThey\u2019re fully functioning programs and they carry malware.\u201dWith VPNs, most people would probably be better off using them when it seems necessary \u2014 and turning them off when they are not needed. The slowdown in speed is the biggest negative and makes constant use impractical.Many people would probably benefit from using a VPN in certain situations, like when they are connected to a public Wi-Fi network or are browsing sensitive websites. But for watching Netflix or sending emails with large attachments? Turn the VPN off.For Mr. Wilmot, the Los Angeles musician, the slow speeds of internet downloading spurred by VPNs were a dealbreaker. In the end, he opted against getting one at all.\u201cIf I don\u2019t have lightning-fast internet 24 hours a day, it inhibits my workflow and affects deadlines,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019m accidentally relaxing into that kind of \u2018What can you do?\u2019 mentality. There\u2019s no good option.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I Own Players\u2019: How West Ham\u2019s Transfer Scandal Upended English Soccer", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byRichard Scudamore, the Premier League\u2019s chief executive, was in a hurry as he took a cab to West Ham\u2019s Upton Park stadium in a scruffy part of East London in the first week of September 2006. The club had its heyday in the 1960s, when it produced a string of talented young players. It was in the era before the transfer market took off, when commercialism had yet to take hold in the game. In 1964, the club\u2019s manager, Ron Greenwood, had wrapped the F.A. Cup trophy in cloth and taken it home on a London Tube train after the Hammers had beaten Preston North End in the final. Two years later, three members of his team \u2014 Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters \u2014 helped England win the World Cup, snapping the dominance of Pel\u00e9 and Brazil.However, West Ham had dropped out of the Premier League in 2003, the same year that Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea and \u2014 although it returned two years later and continued to produce talented players \u2014 it did not have the financial clout to compete with the biggest English clubs. Its latest generation of talented players \u2014 such as Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard and Joe Cole \u2014 had one by one left for bigger-spending clubs. The club\u2019s song, \u201cI\u2019m Forever Blowing Bubbles,\u201d featuring the line \u201cfortune\u2019s always hiding,\u201d was now more apt than ever.Scudamore\u2019s car made its way down Green Street, where pie-and-mash restaurants stand next to shops selling Indian saris and samosas. Scudamore darted out of the car and strode into the club\u2019s offices to be welcomed by the team\u2019s managing director, Paul Aldridge, who apologized for the absence of the owner, Terry Brown. Scudamore wasted no time, getting straight to the point of his visit. \u201cThese players, what\u2019s the story? How have they got here?\u201d he snapped.A few days earlier, in late August 2006, the Argentine stars Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano had themselves arrived at West Ham. Flanking Alan Pardew, the team\u2019s manager, Tevez and Mascherano held up claret-and-blue shirts and smiled for the news media. How on earth had this struggling Premier League team managed to sign two of the world\u2019s most sought-after players? The story has its roots in South America, but was also tied to the riches that accompanied the breakup of the Soviet Union and to an Israeli dealmaker called Pini Zahavi, who was never far away from soccer\u2019s biggest transfers.Scudamore was already aware of wealthy individuals buying the transfer rights of players as early as 2000, a year after he took the job at the Premier League. Zahavi had told him all about it.Zahavi was suave and smooth-talking, and had parlayed a career as a soccer journalist in Israel into being a transfer broker. His first deal, while still working as a reporter, had been to take Avi Cohen to Liverpool from Maccabi Tel Aviv in 1979. After 20 years as an agent, he had turned his attention to acting as a dealmaker to help a small group of wealthy individuals, some of them from the former Soviet Union, to invest in the transfer market. He called the business Soccer Investments & Representations.Zahavi\u2019s office was on a tree-lined boulevard near the Mediterranean Sea in Tel Aviv, but he spent much of his working life in five-star hotels across the globe or in his apartment in London\u2019s Marble Arch. He had learned how this South American business model worked from his partners in Argentina: Fernando Hidalgo and Gustavo Arribas. Together they had founded the HAZ agency, which took its name from the first letters of their surnames and used a series of companies domiciled in Gibraltar, Luxembourg and Malta to buy and sell transfer rights. The business was so successful that the three men set up their own motor-racing team in 2006, and even considered entering the Nascar series before one of their drivers died in a 120 m.p.h. crash at the Aut\u00f3dromo Juan Manuel Fangio on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. The sudden and shocking death had ended their appetite to pursue the racing adventure.Zahavi was well known in the Premier League\u2019s offices in London. At Christmas he would send a box of oranges to Scudamore from back home. Over a cup of tea one day, Zahavi told Scudamore that he was moving into owning transfer rights. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not an agent anymore. I own players. I actually own them,\u2019\u201d Scudamore recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s the future.\u201dIn 2001, Zahavi had helped Gustavo Mascardi, the first registered FIFA agent in Argentina, earn as much as half of the $12 million transfer fee Aston Villa paid River Plate for the Colombian striker Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel. Mascardi owned 50 percent of \u00c1ngel\u2019s transfer rights through a company called Siglo XXI (21st Century). Aston Villa almost pulled out of the deal at the last minute after hearing of the unorthodox arrangement, but in the end the signing went ahead.In the spring of 2003, Zahavi was introduced by another soccer agent, Jonathan Barnett, to Chelsea\u2019s chief executive, Trevor Birch, at Les Ambassadeurs, a private club in London\u2019s Mayfair, in a move that would help Zahavi \u2014 with his contacts in the former Soviet Union \u2014 become a broker in the takeover of the then struggling club.While Zahavi and Barnett loved the high life, fine clothes and trappings of success \u2014 like Les Ambassadeurs, which served French Champagne, Belgian chocolates and Cuban cigars \u2014 Birch was a more low-key character. He had a first-class degree in accounting from Liverpool Polytechnic and specialized in corporate restructuring. He was an employee of Ken Bates, a gruff Londoner who had bought Chelsea for 1 pound in 1982.Birch had briefed Zahavi on Chelsea\u2019s financial woes, how it could barely pay the players\u2019 salaries and how Bates wanted to sell up. Zahavi relayed the information to Abramovich. A few weeks later the Russian billionaire, dressed in jeans and accompanied by a Citibank banker and a lawyer from Skadden Arps, came to meet Birch in one of the executive boxes overlooking the pitch at Stamford Bridge stadium. The rendezvous lasted less than an hour and ended with an outline for a deal, which was agreed on a handshake.Chelsea\u2019s executives were stunned by how fast the Russian was moving. They did a Google search on his name but little came up. Still, he seemed to be bona fide and his advisers clearly worked for serious organizations. Three weeks later, on July 1, 2003, contracts were signed and Abramovich became the first Russian owner of a Premier League club.Three years later, two more oligarchs who had been close to Abramovich became involved in the Premier League via a different route. Boris Berezovsky and Arkady Patarkatsishvili took control of the transfer rights of Tevez and Mascherano through a series of offshore companies, and their aides arranged for the Argentines to join West Ham.According to The Observer newspaper, which secured a rare interview with Zahavi that year, he acted as an adviser to West Ham in the deal just as he had done for Abramovich in his acquisition of Chelsea.Berezovsky, a mathematician, had built his fortune after the fall of the Soviet Union by investing in Lada cars and Aeroflot planes. After surviving a car bomb that decapitated his driver, he masterminded Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s rise to the presidency in 2000. But once Putin was in power, he vowed to get rid of the oligarchs for meddling in politics, forcing Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili to flee to Britain with their fortunes.Initially, the exiled oligarchs\u2019 link to the two Argentine players was not known. West Ham did not disclose the terms of the agreement, instead employing the clich\u00e9d patter of English soccer. The Hammers said that Tevez and Mascherano had \u201cput pen to paper\u201d on permanent contracts and that all other details would remain confidential.However, there was more going on behind the scenes. A couple of days earlier, West Ham\u2019s legal and commercial director, Scott Duxbury, had called the Premier League\u2019s secretary, Jane Purdon, to make an inquiry about the possibility of signing two players whose transfer rights were owned by offshore companies. The companies, Duxbury said, wanted the players to join West Ham free of charge should the club agree to allow them freedom to move them on. Purdon said the arrangement would breach league rules that forbade any third party having influence over the buying or selling of players. She advised Duxbury against the transaction.The next day, Purdon spoke to him again and asked if there were any third parties involved in the signings. Duxbury ducked that question, according to Purdon\u2019s comments in the minutes of a Premier League hearing. \u201cHe did not say yes, he did not say no,\u201d Purdon recalled. \u201cHe merely replied that all documents required for registration had been provided. In doing so, he was in the belief that no rule had been broken.\u201dWhen Scudamore personally went to West Ham to hear the club\u2019s version of events, Aldridge sought to calm him. He said there was nothing untoward. Investors were going to buy the club and therefore they were just placing these players there in anticipation of the sale.Scudamore, whose organization had no power to raid the club\u2019s files, went back to the Premier League\u2019s office and fumed. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve worked with these people for so long, when you\u2019ve looked them in the eye and asked them a direct question, you get a direct answer,\u201d Scudamore said. \u201cThere\u2019s really not a lot more you can do.\u201dIf the oligarchs had been passive investors in the two players, West Ham would have complied with the rules, but it would become clear that they had complete control over the next transfer of the Argentines. According to Premier League rules, that was not allowed. Third parties could not acquire the right to \u201cinfluence\u201d the policies or performance of teams.The companies in the British Virgin Islands that controlled where the Argentines played next were owned by Patarkatsishvili, although Berezovsky said they were a joint venture with him under a series of gentlemen\u2019s agreements they had embarked on together. They had previously held stakes in a Russian car dealership, the oil company Sibneft and the Kommersant newspaper.The two men now lived in exile in mansions a 20-minute drive from each other in the Surrey commuter belt west of London. Berezovsky lived in Ascot, in an ivy-clad home with its own lake and manicured lawn. Patarkatsishvili, who had a distinctive white handlebar mustache, resided in an even grander pile with chandeliers, gold fittings and ornate sculptures.Under the deal that the two oligarchs had financed, West Ham would be a temporary home for Tevez. The club, which was founded by workers from a shipyard at the end of the 19th century, would get \u00a32 million, about $4 million at the time, should he be transferred in the January transfer window. After that, the compensation would fall to \u00a3100,000. West Ham would get \u00a3150,000 on the transfer of Mascherano.Patarkatsishvili had appointed Kia Joorabchian, a young businessman to head up their soccer operation. Joorabchian was raised in Britain and had helped his Iranian father run car dealerships in Essex and Kent. In what Time magazine called a \u201csurreal\u201d sale, the businessman in his early 30s was part of an offshore group that battled with Berezovsky for control of Kommersant. According to Joorabchian\u2019s version of events, he sued the oligarch over the sale before they agreed to settle out of court. \u201cThat\u2019s how I met Boris Berezovsky,\u201d he said.Joorabchian then moved to S\u00e3o Paulo to manage Corinthians, one of Brazil\u2019s biggest soccer clubs, on behalf of the oligarchs. Patarkatsishvili\u2019s London-based Media Sports Investments had agreed to pay $35 million to take control of the team for 10 years in return for a share of the team\u2019s profits from marketing and buying and selling players. As part of the deal, Media Sports Investments would get 51 percent of the net profit from television revenue, sponsorships and ticket sales, and 80 percent of transfer fees. Joorabchian hired Tevez from Boca Juniors and Mascherano from River Plate.Tevez\u2019s arrival thrilled Corinthians fans, who were surprised that such a big-name player had arrived on their doorstep. At $16 million he was the most expensive player ever signed by a Brazilian club. He delighted them with a never-say-die attitude that yielded 46 goals in 78 games. Tevez would celebrate each goal enthusiastically, at one point pulling a pacifier from his sock and sucking on it to mark the birth of his child.Using the wealth of the oligarchs, Corinthians went shopping in European soccer and added other prominent players to its squad, including Nilmar from Lyon, Gustavo Nery from Werder Bremen and Carlos Alberto Gomes de J\u00e9sus from Porto. The team swept to the Brazilian league title.With Tevez\u2019s form pushing up his market price and triggering interest from clubs abroad, Joorabchian\u2019s job was to extract the highest possible fee for the investment fund\u2019s biggest asset. He announced that the striker would leave Corinthians only if another team paid the release clause in his contract of between \u00a369 million and \u00a383 million. Even the lowest amount would have been a world record transfer fee. There was no suitor willing to hand over such an enormous sum, and so he ended up at West Ham.The memory of the Tevez and Mascherano affair remains painful for Scudamore a decade later. \u201cI can give you dates, I can give you times,\u201d Scudamore said, sitting at a table in his glass office that looks out at the Premier League\u2019s headquarters in a smart townhouse in London\u2019s West End. The office, with a small plaque next to the black front door, could pass for that of a law firm or accounting practice.In Scudamore\u2019s opinion, West Ham executives broke the rules because they were blinded by the possibility of deep-pocketed owners buying the club. \u201cWhat was more tantalizing was the acquisition of the club\u201d as opposed to the Argentine stars, Scudamore said. West Ham officials were probably \u201cjust so wrapped up in the idea of new owners, and becoming key in the new ownership structure.\u201dIn the end, neither Patarkatsishvili nor Berezovsky bought West Ham. A few weeks later, Brown, the club\u2019s owner, sold his majority stake to a group from Iceland. Mascherano was traded to Liverpool, earning the oligarchs \u00a318 million. A Premier League panel then issued West Ham with a record fine of \u00a35.5 million, though it stopped short of handing down a points deduction.To Scudamore\u2019s horror, the fallout continued. As the season reached its climax, Tevez found his form to boost West Ham\u2019s battle to avoid relegation. He scored seven goals in the last 10 games of the season, including the only one in a 1-0 win on the last day of the season at Manchester United, which kept West Ham in the top division. Tevez\u2019s goal meant that Sheffield United was relegated instead, and its coach, Neil Warnock, raged that Scudamore should be fired.That single goal by Tevez made the affair \u201cseismic rather than containable,\u201d Scudamore said. Sheffield United immediately challenged the Premier League\u2019s decision not to dock points from West Ham.As the scandal was unfurling, Berezovsky was wrestling with dark thoughts at his home in London\u2019s commuter belt. He was feeling glum about how he had to flee Russia and how he had fallen out with Abramovich, who he felt had forced him into selling Sibneft, his oil company, below the market price. While the Chelsea owner had left Russia on a high, the former mathematician was pushed out of his country against his will. Now Abramovich, a high school dropout, was the 15th wealthiest person in the world \u2014 worth $24 billion according to Forbes magazine \u2014 and had just led Chelsea to its first English league title in half a century, endearing himself to fans. Berezovsky was at 897th on the rich list, with $1.3 billion.Berezovsky could console himself that he was on course to make more money from soccer. Abramovich\u2019s Chelsea had not posted a profit in each of the five years since he took charge. The London club was hemorrhaging money in the race to win trophies: In the year ending June 2007 alone, Abramovich had to soak up its loss of \u00a375 million.Berezovzky\u2019s bet with Patarkatsishvili to buy Brazil\u2019s Corinthians was much cheaper and, despite the Premier League hullabaloo with the Tevez affair, they were now on course to turn a handsome profit by trading him for many times the $16 million they paid for him.Advertisement"}

Trump boasts on tape of forcing himself on women, and women flood the internet with raw memories of when they were groped or assaulted.Six months ago, the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape with Mr. Trump\u2019s comments prompted widespread revulsion and equally widespread predictions that it would doom his candidacy. But women who voted for him either shrugged it off as how men talk among themselves or decided that his promises to create jobs and tighten borders mattered more. And Mr. Trump\u2019s swagger was a dog whistle for those men who felt women\u2019s gains were their losses.The lesson Mr. Trump apparently drew is that powerful men are not going to be held accountable. That wider sense of impunity is one reason women often decide not to report sexual harassment, even as Mr. O\u2019Reilly has denied the accusations and cites the lack of such calls to hotlines in his defense.Fox is a case in point. Multiple lawsuits, accounts of women who worked there and even an internal investigation that resulted in the departure of the chief executive of Fox News, Roger Ailes, all suggested a \u201cMad Men\u201d-style workplace, where women were often harassed.Female employees reported being pressed to trade sexual favors for advancement, explicit sex talk, groping and more. On-air, disdain and contempt for feminism were openly expressed. Feminists were dismissed as unattractive, shrill harridans or ridiculed as politically correct scolds. In Fox\u2019s world, women do not encounter systemic oppression. Some of its most prominent female anchors publicly rejected the label of feminist.So what would it take to make sexual harassers stop?But the staying power of such movements is unclear, although the passion is real. A resistance movement has sprung up largely powered by women repelled at what the election wrought. They confront a White House dominated by white men making policies that threaten women\u2019s health care and propose to slash money for social programs that have benefited poor and working-class women.An earlier version of this article stated that Bill O\u2019Reilly, of Fox News, settled five lawsuits alleging sexual harassment.

Yet nobody has done much to fix it.That may finally change, if the people in charge of Silicon Valley \u2014 venture capitalists, who control the money \u2014 start to realize that the real problem with tech bros is not just that they\u2019re boorish jerks. It\u2019s that they\u2019re boorish jerks who don\u2019t know how to run companies.What is bro culture? Basically, a world that favors young men at the expense of everyone else. A \u201cbro co.\u201d has a \u201cbro\u201d C.E.O., or C.E.-Bro, usually a young man who has little work experience but is good-looking, cocky and slightly amoral \u2014 a hustler. Instead of being forced by investors to surround himself with seasoned executives, he is left to make decisions on his own.Bro cos. become corporate frat houses, where employees are chosen like pledges, based on \u201cculture fit.\u201d Women get hired, but they rarely get promoted and sometimes complain of being harassed. Minorities and older workers are excluded.Bro culture also values speedy growth over sustainable profits, and encourages cutting corners, ignoring regulations and doing whatever it takes to win.Sometimes it works. But often the whole thing just flames out. The bros blow through the money and find they have no viable business. For example: Quirky, founded in 2009 by the 20-something Ben Kaufman. It raised $185 million to build a \u201csocial product development platform\u201d that sold kooky gadgets, but filed for bankruptcy basically because the \u201cbrash\u201d and \u201cunorthodox\u201d chief executive had no business being a chief executive. One indication that Mr. Kaufman is a bro? Well, the first reference he lists on his LinkedIn page is: \u201cHe\u2019s a dick \u2026 but hilarious.\u201dHoping to right the ship, Uber appointed one of its board members, Arianna Huffington, to join former attorney general Eric Holder and others to investigate the sexual harassment claims. Mr. Kalanick has apologized and vowed to \u201cgrow up.\u201d (He\u2019s 40.) Most important, Uber has announced that it is planning to hire a chief operating officer, ideally a steady hand like Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook. It\u2019s a great idea, but it should have happened years ago. Now it may be too late.Bro C.E.O.s are better at raising money than making money. So why do venture capitalists keep investing in them? It may be because many of the venture capitalists are bros as well.Uber\u2019s collapse should not come as a surprise but it does offer a lesson: Toxic workplace culture and rotten financial performance go hand-in-hand. It\u2019s possible for a boorish jerk to run a successful company, but jerks do best when surrounded by non-jerks, and bros do best when they hire seasoned executives to help them. Without \u201cadult supervision\u201d and institutional restraints, the C.E.-Bro\u2019s vices end up infecting the culture of the workplaces they control.This poisonous state of affairs will get fixed only when investors start getting hurt. A crash at Uber, the most high profile tech start-up in the world, could provide the jolt that finally brings the tech industry back to its senses.An Opinion article about tech company culture last Sunday misstated which tech companies are run by only men.

{"Headline": "Slack, an Upstart in Messaging, Now Faces Giant Tech Rivals", "Date": "2017-04-16", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Slack is the classic Silicon Valley accidental success. Born three years ago, with roots in a failed video game, the messaging software is now used by five million people.The company behind it, Slack Technologies, found success by combining something that Silicon Valley fetishizes \u2014 rich data on how people use a product \u2014 with something it often overlooks: How do people actually feel while using it?This combination produced an unlikely hit that, when it became available in 2014, grew mostly by word of mouth, which is unusual for corporate software. Last year, the privately held company was valued at nearly $4 billion.Now Slack faces a significant new challenge. It has become big enough to draw a competitive response from giants like Microsoft, but not big enough to have the roster of large corporate clients it needs to compete with the giants.As a result, Slack, which built up momentum as a lovable underdog, must fend off some of technology\u2019s largest and fiercest competitors if it wants to be more than a niche tool for small businesses and teams.Microsoft, for instance, already offers ways for employees to collaborate. And while its offerings have not been viral hits, they have offered boring but important features that big companies demand, like strong data security and regulatory compliance controls.There is no illusion within Slack that success is certain. But Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive, said small tech companies with new ideas had long defeated larger rivals that tried to copy them. Think of Apple\u2019s beating IBM in personal computing, Google\u2019s beating Microsoft in search and Facebook\u2019s crushing Google in social networks.One advantage Slack does have is focus, Mr. Butterfield maintains. Microsoft, for example, has numerous Slack-like products including Yammer, SharePoint, Skype for Business and now Teams. The executives who run those businesses within Microsoft must \u201ccompete for budget and mind share and attention,\u201d he said, providing an opening for Slack to gain users while Microsoft managers wage internal wars.Microsoft said users would embrace Teams because it had strong encryption and global support and worked seamlessly with software they already used, like Excel. \u201cWe think customers value coherence,\u201d said Bryan Goode, the general manager of Office 365 at Microsoft.Slack is the product of Mr. Butterfield\u2019s second failed attempt to make a video game. His first, called Game Neverending, had a photo-sharing feature that became more popular than the game. It became Flickr, which was sold to Yahoo for $25 million in 2005.In 2011, he introduced another game, Glitch, in which people cooperated to build a shared world. (Misbehaving players got a timeout.) At its height, the game was costing the company $500,000 a month and bringing in $30,000, so Mr. Butterfield shuttered it in late 2012. A few employees stayed on to build out the messaging platform that Glitch engineers had used to talk among themselves. That project became Slack.Slack was officially introduced in February 2014 and today has five million daily users, up from four million in October. Most users are on a free version, but about 1.5 million pay Slack $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search. The 800-person company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable.Initially popular with small teams of software engineers who wanted to work remotely without cumbersome videoconferences or email, Slack was not designed for big companies. Users chat in \u201cchannels,\u201d typically organized around a few well-defined tasks.\u201cThe overhead of working among different offices becomes less of an issue\u201d with Slack, said Nick Coronges, chief technology officer at R/GA, a 2,000-person design and marketing agency with offices in several cities.But Slack has focused on making a product that people love, a strategy that is more common among consumer companies like Apple, Snap and Spotify.Slack modeled itself after consumer messaging apps that let users communicate with GIFs, stickers and emojis. One Slack emoji is a cartoon raccoon with its palms pressed in respectful greeting. Called \u201craccooning,\u201d it signifies, \u201cPlease take this conversation someplace else. You are getting off topic.\u201dIn Slack\u2019s office in Vancouver, British Columbia, designers think about things like color choice, layout and Slack\u2019s sign-in greeting, and how they might affect a customer\u2019s peace of mind. Back at San Francisco headquarters, data jockeys pore over the kinds of signals that tech companies normally study, like time spent with the product and whether moving a button elicits a change in behavior.Unlike some Silicon Valley companies, Slack believes humans are as important as robots. All executives, including Mr. Butterfield, have fielded the 6,000 customer support calls and 2,800 Twitter messages that come in each week. The average turnaround time for a help request is under an hour.\u201cI get worried if I see customer satisfaction scores dip below 97 percent,\u201d said Ali Rayl, Slack\u2019s head of customer experience.If Slack can dovetail seamlessly with how people behave, feel like second nature to use and strongly appeal to employees, taking it away could become \u201clike taking off your astronaut helmet in space,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said.When it began, Slack had fewer features than its rivals had, but that wasn\u2019t seen as a problem at first. Tens of thousands of small teams were creating accounts, some even paying for them, without much prompting. Smaller customers still account for more than 50 percent of Slack\u2019s revenue.But Slack knew it would always be a niche product without basic features like \u201cthreading,\u201d a standard email and chat room feature that groups together replies to a message, and an easier sign-in process. Originally each team required its own sign-in, even if an employee worked on many teams in the same organization.As competition heated up, Slack started to elicit feedback from companies like Capital One. The bank\u2019s teams wanted to log in at one place and get access to all of their Slack rooms. They wanted each channel to allow more people, and they wanted to customize features, like file sharing, to comply with regulations.Slack made those changes, and employees \u201clatched on,\u201d said Jennifer Manry, vice president for work force technology at Capital One, \u201can indication that it was filling a critical need.\u201dAt the end of January, Mr. Butterfield unveiled Enterprise Grid. Aimed at companies and governments, it can manage the conversations of up to 500,000 employees at once. IBM, Jet.com, NASA and Home Depot have all used the product.But Slack has not taken over. Capital One still uses collaboration tools from Microsoft and Atlassian. Facebook and smaller companies like Asana share customers with Slack, too. Microsoft Teams is available in 181 markets around the world in 19 languages. Slack is available only in English, wherever the app is available for download.The battle between Slack and its competitors is essentially a fight over who will make the next piece of workplace software that no one can live without. Many businesses, large and small, depend on Excel from Microsoft, Photoshop from Adobe and Gmail from Google.Slack wants to be in that pantheon \u2014 as the place where people collaborate and hang out online, the world\u2019s virtual conference room and water cooler.Slack\u2019s name \u2014 an acronym for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge \u2014 underscores its big ambition. But to become a Microsoft-size success it needs workers to choose Slack over its competitors.\u201cCompanies want their employees to collaborate more, because better collaboration reduces the need to jump ship,\u201d said Sean Ryan, the head of partnerships at Facebook\u2019s Workplace. \u201cThe No. 1 reason people leave their jobs is they feel isolated.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build empathy at scale,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said. Slack\u2019s office walls are covered with customer feedback, and soothing French pop music is piped into the restrooms. Company engineers say being a good designer is like being a good host, and they use shorthand like \u201cset out the towels\u201d as they create new user features.\u201cI\u2019ve been building software for 15 years, and I\u2019ve become more attuned to how the average person will interact with and experience software in the last 18 months here than in the prior 13 years,\u201d said April Underwood, who joined Slack as vice president of product in 2015.Whether this approach translates into profits for Slack depends largely on how fast the company can expand into more countries and whether employees at big companies push their information technology departments to pay for it. That would necessitate an unusual level of devotion to a piece of workplace software, which is why Slack says it is so devoted to its users\u2019 well-being.\u201cThere are people who will die, get divorced, have children with cancer,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said. \u201cYou really have to put yourself in their frames of mind. If we preoccupy these people for a minute longer than we have to, we\u2019ll lose them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article contained several errors. Users pay Slack $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search, not $8 to $12.50. The company has 800 employees, not 750. And Slack is available in English wherever it can be downloaded, not only in the United States and Britain.An article last Monday about Slack Technologies and the competition it faces from larger companies misstated the number of employees at R/GA, whose chief technology officer commented on the use of Slack\u2019s software. It is 2,000, not 1,000.Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Tools Needed to Track Technology\u2019s Impact on Jobs, Panel Says", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byAmerica needs new tools for the timely measurement and monitoring of technology, jobs and skills to cope with the advance of artificial intelligence and automation, an expert panel composed mainly of economists and computer scientists said in a new report.The panel\u2019s recommendations include the development of an A.I. index, analogous to the Consumer Price Index, to track the pace and spread of artificial intelligence technology. That technical assessment, they said, could then be combined with detailed data on skills and tasks involved in various occupations to guide education and job-training programs.A public-private collaboration, they added, is necessary to create such tools because information from many sources will be the essential ingredient. Those information sources range from traditional government statistics to the vast pools of new data from online services like LinkedIn and Udacity that can be tapped to gain insights on skills, job openings and the effectiveness of training programs.Both the report and commentary were spurred by the advances in A.I. in recent years, including document-reading software and self-driving cars, which promise to make inroads into work done by humans. That prospect has created angst for many American workers about the difficulties of adapting to technological change and the failure of institutions to help them.Yet technologists and academics still differ sharply on how fast the next wave of automation will proceed and how many occupations will be affected. That prompted the panelists to suggest the new data-monitoring tools and the pulling together of government and online data sources to sort through the consequences.Those moves could eventually give a worker in a declining occupation useful information about a more promising occupation, with some similar skills but also requiring some new ones, Mr. Mitchell said. Then the software tool might also pull information on job placement rates for courses that teach those new skills.That style of data-driven decision-making is a hallmark of internet companies like Amazon and Google, and it has been increasingly embraced across corporate America. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason government can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Brynjolfsson said.\u201cBut our surveys are not really designed to track technology or its impact,\u201d said Professor Haltiwanger, who was a member of the expert panel. \u201cThe best shot at that is the private sector data.\u201dA broad national initiative, perhaps with the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis setting rules for private sector data sharing and privacy protections, might not be possible, Mr. Brynjolfsson conceded. But he and Mr. Mitchell wrote in Nature, \u201cPerfection here is not a prerequisite for utility \u2014 anything is better than flying blind.\u201dOne program that embodies the panel\u2019s recommendations is Skillful, a collaboration of the Markle Foundation, LinkedIn, Arizona State University and edX, a nonprofit provider of online courses. The partners are working with employers, educators and local governments in Colorado and the Phoenix metropolitan area to link jobs, skills and training more tightly.Past times of economic turmoil have led to new kinds of economic data collection and analysis.At the outset of the Depression in 1929, for example, there was no measure of national economic activity or reliable information on unemployment. In June 1930, based on scattered reports of improvement, President Herbert Hoover prematurely declared, \u201cThe Depression is over.\u201dTo address the information gap of its day, the government hired economists and statisticians to come up with a scientific method for measuring the national economy. In 1934, a team led by Simon Kuznets published its report on how to calculate national income. The field of econometrics took a big step forward, and policy makers were less in the dark.The time has now come, the expert panel suggested, for a similar effort to adapt to the modern digital economy.Advertisement"}

This film, directed by James Ponsoldt, is an adaptation of Dave Eggers\u2019s 2013 novel, and the two collaborated on the screenplay. Mr. Eggers\u2019s book is both a satire and a cautionary tale, grafting surveillance-state mechanisms to a faux-progressive vision with pronounced cult leanings \u2014 a lot of its \u201cjoin us\u201d vibe feels passed down from Philip Kaufman\u2019s 1978 version of \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d a tale set, like the one here, in the San Francisco Bay Area.Mr. Ponsoldt\u2019s movie begins with its heroine, Mae (Emma Watson), trapped in a stale cubicle doing meaningless dunning labor for a meaningless company; in due time, she\u2019s doing much more high-tech \u201ccustomer experience\u201d work at the Circle, an internet service that seems to meld all the most annoying features of Google, Facebook, Twitter, you name it. Adding to the forced-extroversion fun is a new invention, a multipurpose webcam that\u2019s the relative size and shape of an eyeball. \u201cKnowing is good but knowing everything is better,\u201d crows one of the company\u2019s principals, a Steve Jobs-like visionary named Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks).That maxim also appears in the novel, and it sticks in the craw, not least because any first-year graduate student in philosophy could demolish it. At what point did the Circle put a hiring freeze on anyone conversant with epistemology? Lampooning the simple-mindedness of utopian web clich\u00e9s was arguably part of Mr. Eggers\u2019s point, but much of that point is often muddled in the book. And it\u2019s simply incoherent in the movie. The novel is at its most trenchantly funny when depicting the exhausting nature of virtual social life, and it\u2019s in this area, too, that the movie gets its very few knowing laughs. But it\u2019s plain, not much more than 15 minutes in, that without the story\u2019s paranoid aspects you\u2019re left with a conceptual framework that\u2019s been lapped three times over by the likes of, say, the Joshua Cohen novel \u201cBook of Numbers,\u201d or the HBO comedy series \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201dYou\u2019re also left with oodles and oodles of bad acting and bad dialogue. Ms. Watson has to spend way too much time looking concerned while staring at various screens. Ellar Coltrane, who was so unaffectedly appealing as he grew up onscreen in Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cBoyhood,\u201d can\u2019t find any footing in the role of Mae\u2019s Mr. Integrity ex-boyfriend. It doesn\u2019t help that he has to mouth lines like \u201cWe used to go on adventures and have fun and see things, and you were brave and exciting.\u201dMr. Hanks evokes an idea of avuncular visionary charm, and doesn\u2019t have much to do beyond that. And John Boyega \u2014 playing a character who was vital in the book but whose role has been reconfigured so that his function in the movie makes no sense \u2014 mostly stands around at the rear of auditoriums, backlit, and when called upon to speak does a very creditable Denzel Washington impersonation.A film review on Friday about \u201cThe Circle,\u201d an adaptation of the Dave Eggers novel, misstated the year the book was released.

{"Headline": "Trump Signs Order That Could Lead to Curbs on Foreign Workers", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byAfter recent policy reversals that have angered his populist base, Mr. Trump described the visa program as an initiative gone awry that has driven down wages for Americans. The order was a means to end the \u201ctheft of American prosperity,\u201d which he said had been brought on by low-wage immigrant labor.Yet the order calls for a series of relatively modest steps, like a multiagency report on changes needed for the H-1B program, under which the government admits 85,000 foreign workers annually, many of them in the high-tech, industrial, medical and science fields. Collectively, the efforts outlined in the order could take years to carry out.The H1-B program has become a focus in the debate over the impact of foreign workers. Mr. Trump has criticized employers for abusing the program and using it to avoid hiring higher-paid American counterparts. He vowed to revamp its lottery-based selection process.The order, signed at the sprawling Snap-on tool factory here, represents a small win for bigger tech companies, which have been in pitched battles for those visas. Companies like Google and Microsoft, which rely heavily on high-skilled foreign workers, had worried that President Trump would make drastic curbs to worker programs that could cripple them.\u201cI think people are cautiously optimistic that this will be O.K., and maybe even better,\u201d said Tom Alberg, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle firm that invests in high-tech start-ups.But the order would likely hurt the biggest users of the visa program, technology outsourcing firms that bring foreign workers to the United States to perform technical jobs, typically from India.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump stoked outrage from his supporters with accounts of companies like Walt Disney forcing laid-off technical workers to train their overseas replacements.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump spoke in terms of an apple-pie populism that helped him pull off upset victories in November in Midwestern states like Wisconsin.H-1B visas \u201cshould include only the most skilled and highest-paid applicants and should never, ever be used to replace American workers,\u201d Mr. Trump told a gathering of about 500 workers and local luminaries, including the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who hails from Kenosha.On this point, many executives at American technology companies agree with Mr. Trump. They argue that they mostly apply for H-1Bs for workers when they can\u2019t find qualified American workers, usually those with advanced degrees like a masters or Ph.D.In recent years, there has been so much demand for H-1B visas that the whole fiscal year\u2019s allocation has run out in a few days in April, when applications are accepted. The visas are then awarded by lottery to qualified applicants. Some 600,000 to 900,000 immigrants are currently in the United States on H-1B visas, researchers estimate.Outsourcing firms \u2014 the top 13 of which accounted for a third of all granted visas in 2014, the last year for which information is publicly available \u2014 typically flood the system with visa applications. The top recipients were Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro, all from India.India\u2019s leading tech trade group, the National Association of Software and Services Companies, said Indian companies were being treated unfairly. \u201cWe believe that the current campaign to discredit our sector is driven by persistent myths, such as the ideas that H-1B visa holders are \u2018cheap labor\u2019 and \u2018train their replacements,\u2019 neither of which is accurate,\u201d the group said in a statement.Companies like Microsoft, Intel and Amazon are also big recipients. At least 15 percent of the American workforces of Facebook and the chip maker Qualcomm hold H-1Bs, according to the most recent documents the companies have filed with the Labor Department.\u201cThis does nothing,\u201d said Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cLike all the other executive orders, it\u2019s just words \u2014 he\u2019s calling for new studies. It\u2019s not going to fix the problem. It\u2019s not going to create a single job.\u201dRepresentative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat whose district includes Silicon Valley, said the issue of foreign workers was real, but dismissed the president\u2019s order as poorly targeted and unlikely to achieve its desired result.\u201cHalf of the start-ups in Silicon Valley were created by highly skilled people from other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president and his staff fully appreciates that fact.\u201dIn a briefing with reporters on Monday, White House officials said the \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d order would also overhaul federal procurement practices to increase the selection of products from American companies, especially in the domestic steel industry, which has faced stiff competition from China.One reform advocated by the Trump administration, which has drawn bipartisan support from Congress, would change the lottery system for awarding H-1B visas, giving extra preference to the highest-paying jobs \u2014 a proposal favored by many in the American technology industry.Representatives from Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google either declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Blake Irving, the chief executive of domain name and web hosting firm GoDaddy, said he supported the idea of changing the system for issuing H-1Bs to give priority to higher-skilled workers. He said GoDaddy typically receives only about 20 percent of the H-1B visas it applies for.\u201cIf anything, it moves the policy towards something that\u2019s preferential to the expert work force,\u201d said Mr. Irving. \u201cAnything that gets us closer to that is goodness.\u201dBut some smaller technology companies said they were concerned about the changes proposed by the Trump administration.Punit Soni, the chief executive of Learning Motors, a six-person company in Silicon Valley that is trying to apply artificial intelligence to health care, said the visa changes proposed by the Trump administration would hurt start-ups.Small companies cannot afford to pay high salaries and are already struggling to attract talent in a tight market, he said. A visa system that favors the highest-paid workers will steer immigrants only to already successful big companies like Google, his former employer.\u201cWe\u2019re a small start-up. Everyone is getting way below-market average salary,\u201d he said.Glen Thrush reported from Kenosha, Nick Wingfield from Seattle and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Meet the People Who Train the Robots (to Do Their Own Jobs)", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Before the machines become smart enough to replace humans, as some people fear, they need to be taught.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 What if part of your job became teaching a computer everything you know about doing someone\u2019s job \u2014 perhaps your own?We spoke with five people \u2014 a travel agent, a robotics expert, an engineer, a customer-service representative and a scriptwriter, of sorts \u2014 who have been put in this remarkable position. More than most, they understand the strengths (and weaknesses) of artificial intelligence and how the technology is changing the nature of work.Here are their stories.Rachel Neasham, travel agentAt an employee meeting late last year, the agents debated what it meant to be human, and what a human travel agent could do that a machine couldn\u2019t. While Harrison could comb through dozens of hotel options in a blink, it couldn\u2019t match the expertise of, for example, a human agent with years of experience booking family vacations to Disney World. The human can be more nimble \u2014 knowing, for instance, to advise a family that hopes to score an unobstructed photo with the children in front of the Cinderella Castle that they should book a breakfast reservation inside the park, before the gates open.Ms. Neasham, 30, saw it as a race: Can human agents find new ways to be valuable as quickly as the A.I. improves at handling parts of their job? \u201cIt made me feel competitive, that I need to keep up and stay ahead of the A.I.,\u201d Ms. Neasham said. On the other hand, she said, using Harrison to do some things \u201cfrees me up to do something creative.\u201dMs. Neasham is no ordinary travel agent. When she left the Army after serving as a captain in Iraq and Afghanistan, she wanted to work at a start-up. She joined Lola as one of its first travel agents. Knowing that part of her job was to be a role model, basically, for Harrison, she felt a responsibility for Harrison to become a useful tool.Lola was set up so that agents like Ms. Neasham didn\u2019t interact with the A.I. much, but it was watching and learning from every customer interaction. Over time, Lola discovered that Harrison wasn\u2019t quite ready to take over communication with customers, but it had a knack for making lightning-fast hotel recommendations.At first, Harrison would recommend hotels based on obvious customer preferences, like brands associated with loyalty programs. But then it started to find preferences that even the customers didn\u2019t realize they had. Some people, for example, preferred a hotel on the corner of a street versus midblock.And in a coming software change, Lola will ask lifestyle questions like \u201cDo you use Snapchat?\u201d to glean clues about hotel preferences. Snapchat users tend to be younger and may prefer modern but inexpensive hotels over more established brands like the Ritz-Carlton.While Harrison may make the reservations, the human agents support customers during the trip. Once the room is booked, the humans, for example, can call the hotel to try to get room upgrades or recommend how to get the most out of a vacation.\u201cThat\u2019s something A.I. can\u2019t do,\u201d Ms. Neasham said.Diane Kim, interaction designerMs. Kim is adamant: Her assistant doesn\u2019t use slang or emoji.Her assistant, Andrew Ingram, also avoids small talk and doesn\u2019t waste time on topics beside scheduling her meetings, she said.Ms. Kim isn\u2019t being tyrannical. She just knows her assistant better than most bosses, because she programmed him.It\u2019s Ms. Kim\u2019s job to craft responses for the company\u2019s assistants, who are named Andrew and Amy Ingram, or A.I. for short, that feel natural enough that swapping emails with these computer systems feels no different than emailing with a human assistant.Even in the narrow parameters of scheduling meetings, it takes a lot of machine learning to break down emails for a computer. For example, setting a meeting for \u201cWednesday\u201d is different than setting a meeting for \u201ca Wednesday,\u201d as in any Wednesday. X.ai breaks down emails to their component parts to understand intent.The automated response is where Ms. Kim takes over. Her job is to imagine how a human assistant would arrange a meeting for the boss. For a specific task, she devises different situations \u2014 for example, what if the meeting had five attendees versus two \u2014 and then she creates a flow chart of how the email exchange would go.The goal is to schedule a meeting in as few emails as possible. With that in mind, x.ai settled on a set of personality traits for its assistants: polite, professional, friendly and clear.Sometimes, it\u2019s hard to predict what will rub people the wrong way. Early on, the A.I. assistant sent emails to potential attendees saying that the assistant would be happy to put something on the boss\u2019s \u201ccalendar,\u201d but some people found that wording to be cold, and not always appropriately deferential to the other attendees.X.ai changed the wording so that the A.I. assistant says it would be happy to \u201cfind a time\u201d that works for all attendees.Some people try to test the A.I. assistants with unusual requests. For example, people are curious what else the assistants can do and ask for help in booking hotels, flights or conference rooms (things they can\u2019t do). Others ask Amy\u2019s age, or Andrew\u2019s birthday. \u201cHow do we elegantly recover when Amy or Andrew don\u2019t know what to do?\u201d Ms. Kim said.X.ai doesn\u2019t pretend the assistants are human. But Ms. Kim still gets satisfaction when people don\u2019t realize that the assistants are robots. People ask them out on dates. They receive thank-you emails from happy customers even though, as robots, they don\u2019t need gratitude.\u201cThey\u2019re shocked and surprised that they were talking to an A.I.,\u201d she said.Dan Rubins, chief executiveMr. Rubins has a lot of grievances with lawyers.Having reviewed nearly a million legal documents, Legal Robot also flags anomalies (strange wording or clauses) in contracts. \u201cLawyers have had 400 years to innovate and change the profession, and they haven\u2019t done it,\u201d said Mr. Rubins, who is not a lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s time for some outside help.\u201dHe said legal documents are well suited to machine learning because they are highly structured and repetitive. Legal Robot tapped a vast trove of contracts prepared by human lawyers in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 \u201ca cesspool of legal language,\u201d Mr. Rubins said \u2014 as well as past documents from law firms who wanted to help train Legal Robot\u2019s systems.After going through a large set of documents, the company\u2019s machine learning systems start to recognize patterns indicating the words that tend to go together and those that do not. However, Mr. Rubins becomes worried when the A.I. is too confident about its results. That\u2019s often a byproduct of training the computer on too narrow a set of contracts.For example, Legal Robot trained its A.I. on thousands of employment contracts from a state that allows noncompete clauses, which restrict employees from switching to a rival company. That meant when the A.I. saw contracts from states where noncompetes aren\u2019t enforceable, it nevertheless piped up to say the clause was missing. In other words, the A.I. was missing important context.Mr. Rubins, 33, said the A.I. is good at identifying potentially vague word choices. He recently received a two-page nondisclosure agreement \u2014 it was reviewed by human lawyers \u2014 from another company containing the word \u201cshall\u201d 30 times. The A.I. pointed out that \u201cshall\u201d can be vague and advised that \u201cwill\u201d or \u201cmay\u201d are more clear, depending on the context.Mr. Rubins doesn\u2019t think A.I. will put lawyers out of business, but it may change how they work and make money. The less time they need to spend reviewing contracts, the more time they can spend on, say, advisory work or litigation.\u201cI really don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get rid of lawyers,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, we still need them.\u201dSarah Seiwert, customer representativeIt took two weeks for Ms. Seiwert to notice that her company\u2019s A.I. computer system was starting to pick up on her work patterns.There are thousands of different responses. Finding the right answer isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds.When Magoosh implemented an A.I. system in February to help its customer service team work more efficiently, Ms. Seiwert noticed that it was reading the questions and suggesting responses.If the suggestions were good, she would add a few niceties and send back a quick reply. But within two weeks, she noticed that even when she wasn\u2019t responding directly to an email, but following up to one that she had sent earlier, the software was suggesting the proper response.\u201cThat was a \u2018wow\u2019 moment for me,\u201d said Ms. Seiwert, who works from a home office in Mankato, Minn. \u201cIt\u2019s been studying and learning my patterns.\u201dWhen an email comes into Magoosh, the system reads the email, categorizes it and routes it to the appropriate employee. After a few months, some DigitalGenius customers start to automate responses for some common questions. Basically, this happens when the A.I. has seen enough examples of how human agents handled the request that it gains confidence that its answer will be correct.Magoosh isn\u2019t there yet. But Ms. Seiwert said the software has reduced Magoosh\u2019s queue of customer requests by half, and it has made her team\u2019s goal of responding to every customer within 24 hours more manageable.Even though the A.I. is learning from the human agents, Ms. Seiwert said she doesn\u2019t foresee a future where she\u2019s out of a job. Too many questions still require a level of human intuition to know the appropriate answer. There are also times when rules need to be broken, like when customers ask for an extension on their account because of some circumstance beyond their control.\u201cI am not convinced that artificial intelligence is going to replace us,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t program intuition, a gut instinct. So the A.I. might get very intelligent, but I hope as a human I continue to get intelligent and not stand at a standstill.\u201dAleksandra Faust, software engineerWaymo\u2019s cars have driven two million miles in the real world and billions more in computer simulations. But it\u2019s impossible to program for every event.\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be some cases that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d Ms. Faust said. \u201cBased on the situations it\u2019s seen, the A.I. helps the car react in situations it hasn\u2019t seen.\u201dSafety is a concern, said Ms. Faust, 43, but so is comfort. Take the process of braking at a red light. When human drivers see a red light, they tend to slow down gradually before coming to a full stop. Waymo\u2019s driverless car was hitting the brake too abruptly in a way that human drivers would do if they weren\u2019t paying attention.However, a sudden stop is dangerous because other drivers may not be paying attention. And it is jarring for the passengers.Using real-world examples of how human drivers slow to a stop from different speeds, Ms. Faust\u2019s team creates different models for the most natural way a car should brake depending on how fast it is going. \u201cOne thing we\u2019ve learned about human driving is that it\u2019s very, very complex,\u201d said Ms. Faust, who joined Waymo two years ago when it was still part of Google\u2019s research lab, X.Advertisement"}

And as we saw this week, Levandowski\u2019s opting not to provide some evidence might actually hurt Uber (though Uber\u2019s lawyers say they can prove Uber is innocent even without Levandowski\u2019s help).Anyway, the whole thing is a complete mess. But it\u2019s fascinating to watch Uber and Levandowski slowly disentangle themselves from each other in public view.I\u2019m not sure what that means for self-driving initiatives at Uber. But if they are served with an injunction to stop working on driverless cars until the case is seen through, there\u2019s going to be about 1,000 Uber engineers with a whole lot of nothing to do.O.K., that\u2019s enough out of me. I hope you get some better sleep this weekend!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kelsey Plum Is a Lot Like James Harden. But Is It a Left-Handed Compliment?", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byAs Kelsey Plum neared the N.C.A.A. women\u2019s basketball career scoring record during her senior season at the University of Washington, her game became equated with that of another prolific left-handed shooter.Type Plum\u2019s name into Google, and the first result under \u201cPeople also search for\u201d will be James Harden, the Houston Rockets guard.Plum, who was picked first over all in the W.N.B.A. draft by the San Antonio Stars on Thursday, has appreciated the analogy. But she also wondered whether it suggests that female players can be validated only through association with their male counterparts.Last year\u2019s No. 1 pick, Breanna Stewart of Connecticut, had one of college basketball\u2019s most storied careers. As a star who could play any position on the floor and seemingly take over at a moment\u2019s notice, Stewart was often discussed as the female equivalent of Kevin Durant, a member of the Golden State Warriors who was the N.B.A. most valuable player in 2014 for Oklahoma City.Stewart said that she was flattered but that she preferred to be discussed in relation to the titans of women\u2019s basketball.Andrei Markovits, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan who has written books on women in sports, said female basketball players are often compared to N.B.A. players as a point of reference for a broader audience.But Richard Lapchick, the director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida, said such analogies had become tiresome.\u201cKelsey is slotted to be the No. 1 pick in the W.N.B.A. draft because she is such a great player,\u201d Lapchick said on Wednesday. \u201cIf we need to compare her to another player, don\u2019t slight her amazing achievements by comparing her to a male player, no matter how good he may be.\u201dFormer players and analysts of women\u2019s basketball said that they understood how comparisons across gender lines could be seen as a slight but that they also thought of those analogies as signs of growth for the sport.The ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo, a former UConn player who will be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame this summer, said there was no real point of reference for Plum in the W.N.B.A.\u201cWhen have we seen a player with this skill set, with this efficiency, with that body type?\u201d Lobo said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of one. So I think that\u2019s why sometimes you go to comparing them to the men\u2019s players.\u201dLaChina Robinson, a basketball analyst for ESPN, agreed that it was a positive development for the women\u2019s game when fans and the news media noticed resemblances between the athleticism in the N.B.A. and the talents of players like Plum and Stewart.\u201cYou want to whenever possible try to compare W.N.B.A. players to other W.N.B.A. players,\u201d Robinson said, \u201cbut I think we\u2019re just seeing a generation that\u2019s doing things we haven\u2019t seen before in terms of the talent level, the skill, the athleticism, and so we find ourselves making a different comparison at this point.\u201dPlum said she understood the Harden comparison and gave those who made it \u201cthe benefit of the doubt.\u201d She also agreed that her game might not line up exactly with many left-handed W.N.B.A. guards of the past, whereas Harden is her contemporary. \u201cThat\u2019s a person they can think of that\u2019s left-handed, draws contact and things like that,\u201d she said.But, Plum said, \u201cI do think if I do have a comparison, maybe Becky Hammon.\u201dLike Hammon, who became the N.B.A.\u2019s first full-time female assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs, Plum has sought to redefine perceptions of women in sports.By any measure, Harden or otherwise, Plum had a transcendent college career \u2014 starting even before she played her first game at Washington.The coach, Mike Neighbors, in his first season with the Huskies, was looking for a captain and created a list of 27 qualities that would be valuable in that position. As the preseason wound down, he realized that Plum, a freshman, had 24 of the 27 traits; the next closest player had about nine.But could he really bestow the honor on a newcomer?Plum felt similar trepidation. Concerned about resentment from her elders, she called the opportunity \u201csocial suicide.\u201d But she accepted.\u201cBy midseason, everyone understood what we did,\u201d said Neighbors, who recently left Washington to coach at Arkansas.Plum averaged 20.9 points as a freshman. By her junior year, she led the Huskies to an unexpected Final Four appearance. In February, she became the N.C.A.A. women\u2019s basketball career scoring leader, eventually finishing with 3,527 points.For the future, Plum said she has found motivation in two players she idolized growing up \u2014 Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi \u2014 whom she met through Morgan Valley, an assistant coach at Washington who played at Connecticut.She said that regularly consulting with Bird and Taurasi \u2014 two players who have been among the league\u2019s most prominent faces over the last decade \u2014 had given her confidence that she might one day influence both girls and boys to want to play like Kelsey Plum.\u201cI think my message is a lot of different things, but I try to inspire people to feel you can do whatever you want and not allow people to put limits on you, box you in or say you\u2019re good for a girl,\u201d Plum said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I tell people I play basketball; I don\u2019t play women\u2019s basketball.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s Pick for Top Antitrust Cop May Shape Competition", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byAs a young Senate staff member years later, Mr. Delrahim found those early experiences had laid the foundation for his conservative views.In the interview with The New York Times, Mr. Delrahim declined to address AT&T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner, which is now undergoing regulatory review, or other large deals, saying he would \u201cexamine any matter according to evidence and economic analysis.\u201d But he gave other hints of how he might act as the department\u2019s top antitrust official.Specifically, Mr. Delrahim, a former lobbyist, said he would not go after a company just because it was big, and would do so only if there were violations of antitrust law. \u201cJust like any other industry, if there is wrongdoing, we would investigate,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said. But \u201cfederal laws should not be used as a fishing expedition by government.\u201dHe also intimated that he was skeptical of antitrust action against intellectual property rights holders, referring to some earlier comments on the matter. In a 2007 statement, for example, he had warned that cases that blended intellectual property rights with antitrust enforcement could hamper innovation.Legal experts have extrapolated that Mr. Delrahim is also likely to credit mergers with helping competition \u2014 not only reducing it \u2014 and to point out how big deals can promote the United States economy. That \u201cwould be a major change from his most recent predecessors,\u201d the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell recently said in a memo to clients.Mr. Delrahim\u2019s views contrast subtly with those of the Obama administration, which took a more aggressive approach in antitrust toward protecting innovation, especially in the technology industry.Mr. Delrahim would take over antitrust duties at a moment of profound economic transformation, with tech companies like Google and Amazon dominating search and commerce while extending their reach in transportation, media and other industries. Telecom companies are trying to morph into media powerhouses that control the distribution and creation of television and online content.With a wave of corporate mergers in other areas \u2014 chemicals, agricultural products and health insurance \u2014 some Democratic lawmakers have warned that industries have become too concentrated, putting consumers in danger of higher prices and giving them fewer options in vital services.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who will be at the Wednesday hearing, said in a statement, \u201cI plan to ask if Mr. Delrahim will enforce the laws to protect American consumers and if he will commit to being independent, focusing on the merits of each case, not on interference from the White House.\u201dMr. Delrahim has had years of experience in antitrust matters. He graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1991 with a degree in kinesiology and obtained a law degree at George Washington University in 1995. He then joined the law firm Patton Boggs before leaving to be a counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1998. There, he cut his teeth on antitrust working for Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. Mr. Hatch had pushed for an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s practice of tying its web browser, Internet Explorer, to its ubiquitous Windows operating system.In 2005, Mr. Delrahim left Washington and joined the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck in Los Angeles. Over the years, he was the lawyer or federal lobbyist for clients including Ultimate Fighting Championship, Comcast, Google, Johnson & Johnson, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield.Mr. Delrahim endorsed Mr. Trump relatively early in last year\u2019s presidential campaign. In an op-ed in The New York Post in March 2016, he called on conservatives to back Mr. Trump, even if he was not their \u2014 or his \u2014 top choice.Former Democratic and Republican colleagues at the Justice Department describe Mr. Delrahim as fiercely loyal to the Republican Party, though he has a reputation for forging bipartisan relationships. His wife was a Democrat when they met and has voted for Democrats; Mr. Delrahim said he still did not know how she voted in the 2016 election.Democrats recall when Mr. Delrahim became a crucial ally in 2000 to help pass amendments to an antitrust law. House Republicans were unwilling to sign on, but Mr. Delrahim worked to allay their concerns and brokered compromises between them and Senate Democrats, said Jonathan Leibowitz, a partner at Davis Polk who was then working on the bill for Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat. Mr. Leibowitz later was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cHe\u2019s a conservative but his instincts tend toward pragmatism and not ideology,\u201d Mr. Leibowitz said of Mr. Delrahim.\u201cI\u2019m seeing more complaints about enforcement motivated by protectionism, so that will be an important area of inquiry for antitrust enforcement and cooperation,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said.He emphasized that antitrust is intended to support free markets and that the government should intervene only when necessary. A monopoly is perfectly legal until it abuses its monopoly power, he said.Advertisement"}

But many are infuriated and unnerved by what they see as a wave of racist violence under President Trump, souring America\u2019s allure.The reaction is not just anger and anxiety. Now, young Indians who have aspired to study, live and work in the United States are looking elsewhere.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what might happen to us while walking on the street there,\u201d said Kanika Arora, a 20-year-old student in Mumbai who is reconsidering her plan to study in the United States. \u201cThey might just think that we\u2019re terrorists.\u201dRecent attacks on people of Indian descent in the United States are explosive news in India. A country once viewed as the promised land now seems for many to be dangerously inhospitable.\u201cAmerica was the land of great opportunity,\u201d Sanket Bafna, 21, said as he emerged one afternoon last week from an exam at K. C. College, where he is studying financial management. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same land.\u201dThe number of applications for H-1B visas also fell to 199,000, a nearly 20 percent decline, according to data kept by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.Like many others, Indians were offended by Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to block the Mexico border with a wall and bar people from six predominantly Muslim countries. Some took solace that India was not targeted.But they soon saw that anti-immigrant rage in America did not discriminate.Most hold green cards and H-1B visas, and are far more affluent and educated than the average American.Indian-Americans play an outsize role in Silicon Valley, where some, including Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, have founded or run some of the most successful companies.But success stories like Mr. Pichai\u2019s no longer inspire the jealousy they once did in India.Ms. Arora, leaving H. R. College of Commerce and Economics, where she had finished an exam, said her parents had reservations about sending her brother to the United States, where he had been planning to enroll in college this year.Ms. Arora said she, like her brother, \u201cdid aspire to work and study in America, but I\u2019m reconsidering.\u201dThe biggest reason, she said, was the violence directed against Indians.\u201cEvery day, there\u2019s a new headline about an Indian or Asian getting killed,\u201d she said.Now, Ms. Arora said, she and others in India are looking more favorably on Europe for study and work, despite the upheaval over Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union. \u201cComparatively, it\u2019s considered safer,\u201d she said.In the end, Mr. Trump\u2019s policies may benefit their home country by cutting off the brain drain, Ms. Arora and other Indians said. \u201cAll the intelligent people are coming back and can work here,\u201d she added.As students of Mumbai\u2019s colleges reviewed dog-eared question papers with friends on the sidewalk after finishing their exams, they returned again and again to astonishment that someone like Mr. Trump could be elected.\u201cI was like, \u2018Wow, how did you elect somebody like him?\u2019\u201d said Shantanu Sivan, 20, who studies mass media at Wilson College. \u201cI think I lost hope in the people of America.\u201dAnanya Gupta, 21, who studies financial management at K. C. College, laced his disappointment with contempt.\u201cThat just shows where they stand intellectually, electing a person of Trump\u2019s nature as a president,\u201d he said.When asked if he had an opinion on America under Mr. Trump, Mr. Gupta, standing across the street from his college, among other students at a beverage stand, replied, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d\u201cOf course as a child, I used to dream about going to America, the land of opportunity.\u201d But today, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go there.\u201dNot everyone is so negative about America under Mr. Trump. Devanshu Jain, 21, said he still planned to study and work there.\u201cThere\u2019s racism in India, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to work for Goldman Sachs in New York City, right?\u201dBut he said some friends were \u201cso shaken up about what\u2019s happening\u201d that they have transferred from American universities to Canadian institutions in recent months.At Mumbai\u2019s Todi Mills, an old mill area converted in recent years into restaurants, bars and office space for young entrepreneurs, Mr. Trump\u2019s America is also viewed with trepidation.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to take him seriously because the perception is so nonserious about him, that he\u2019s not fit for the role he\u2019s got,\u201d Ms. Mittal said. \u201cIt\u2019s affected how people think about America. What made people vote for him? What sort of people have voted for him?\u201dAround the corner, Abhishek Singh, 23, sat with a friend at a patio table of a pub, worrying about the effect of Mr. Trump on the world.\u201cThe U.S. has been such a good country with such good policies,\u201d said Mr. Singh, a brewer. \u201cAnd this guy comes to power, and you don\u2019t know what he might actually do.\u201dMr. Singh, who dreams about owning a pub some day, said he was scared by Mr. Trump\u2019s recent bombings in Syria and Afghanistan.\u201cHe might start World War III,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cHe might kill us all.\u201dStill, some Indians seem willing to overlook what they find offensive about Mr. Trump if he is tough on Pakistan.India has fought three wars with Pakistan, and many Indians think it is behind terrorist attacks in the country. Mr. Trump\u2019s tough talk on terrorism has given these Indians hope.\u201cOn one side, he\u2019s absolutely a mad guy,\u201d said Abhay Bhalerao, 50, the founder and managing director of a software company that provides price comparison data.\u201cBut on other side, he seems to understand that Pakistan is the bad guy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of Google\u2019s chief executive.

It helps that Nerdstrong\u2019s spirit is collaborative. Among the workouts that belly-flopped was a \u201cStar Wars\u201d one in which the Rebels ended up helping the Imperials because neither side could bear the thought of being responsible for the other having to do 30 extra push-ups for losing.Since joining Nerdstrong, which costs $20 per class or $150 per month, Derek Housman, 33, has lost more than 65 pounds and can do over 100 strict push-ups in a workout.Mr. Housman walked into the gym depressed and weighing 315 pounds, having been dragged there by a friend he had met while making short films for the internet. Now Mr. Housman attends classes five or six days a week, sometimes twice a day, and recently went with another friend to get matching tattoos of Nerdstrong\u2019s logo: a silhouette of a caped hero triumphantly lifting a barbell overhead.\u201cI didn\u2019t ever think I\u2019d get a tattoo,\u201d said Mr. Housman, who is Jewish and grew up believing that his religion forbade such marks. \u201cThis is a permanent change I\u2019m doing to my body, but so is Nerdstrong and so is having a community of people who won\u2019t give up on me.\u201dThere are no elaborate sets for workouts; few who attend this gym have trouble summoning the images to mind. Props are used only for athletic benefit. Space Invaders painted on the wall, for example, are set at eight feet and 10 feet high. They are designed as targets at which to throw weighted balls, for an exercise that may be used as a way to gain entry to the Death Star, or as bull\u2019s-eyes for the boulder supposedly crushing class members in an Indiana Jones workout.\u201cSome of these younger kids have not seen \u2018Indiana Jones,\u2019 and it just drives me batty,\u201d Mr. Deutsch said.Mostly high-intensity interval training, the \u201cgamified\u201d workouts also attract lifelong exercisers who have never felt at home at any other gym.Lili Wyckoff, a lawyer and onetime college fencer, called Nerdstrong \u201cmy version of Disneyland \u2014 you\u2019re surrounded by people who are excited by the same things as you.\u201dMs. Wyckoff, 29, whose workout gear on a recent Saturday included black yoga pants topped with a bright blue, red and yellow Captain Marvel jacket, said she struggled to motivate to exercise on her own and found the role-playing aspect made her look forward to sweating.\u201cYou end up doing more because it\u2019s not, \u2018I have to run five more meters,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018Oh, I have to save this villager.\u2019\u201dLike many of his disciples, Mr. Deutsch is a recent convert to fitness. At 38, he got tired of being out of breath climbing two flights of stairs at work, and began doing CrossFit. He liked some elements \u2014 \u201cbarbells are really cool,\u201d he said \u2014 but after three years became increasingly disillusioned with both coming in last in competitions and what he saw as the program\u2019s one-size-fits-all approach to motivation.\u201cThe onus was kind of on me to enjoy it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just running through a system.\u201dHe took to exercising in his garage. Soon after, his Dungeons & Dragons master, whom he had been trying to persuade to exercise, was going through a divorce and came to stay. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do this,\u201d the friend said, looking at Mr. Deutsch\u2019s equipment.So Mr. Deutsch, a graphic designer, coaxed him with a dungeon workout, sketching it out on a whiteboard. (\u201cYou bust down the door, you fight the monster, you get two minutes to fight the monster, it\u2019s so many reps, and if you don\u2019t win you stay and fight again. If you do, you go into the next room.\u201d) The friend began posting accounts of the workouts on Twitter, and people started showing up at Mr. Deutsch\u2019s, wanting in.\u201cI was like, \u2018I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re at my house when you could be at some of the greatest gyms in the world, but O.K.,\u2019\u201d Mr. Deutsch said.In spring 2013, he cashed in his 401(k) and with the $40,000 founded Nerdstrong. It is one of several fitness options thriving in this somewhat improbable niche; Nerd Fitness, the online self-described \u201ccommunity of underdogs, misfits and mutants,\u201d says it has more than 40,000 paying members.During nerd workouts, there is no talk of feeling the burn \u2014 only powering up, defeating the enemy or, in the case of the yoga class the gym offers, \u201cfilling your mana stores.\u201d Trying to make sure everyone had enough space for a recent workout, Mr. Deutsch told the class: \u201cIt\u2019s like physical Tetris.\u201dLet other gyms claim Olympians or movie stars as clients; Nerdstrong\u2019s members handbook insists that Dr. Richard Feynman, the theoretical physicist, \u201cwould certainly have been a Nerdstronger and you cannot convince us otherwise.\u201d This may be the only gym on the planet that closes for Comic-Con, and where a workout was paused for the announcement of the newest actor to play the doctor on \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d\u201cPeople do get really creative, but we\u2019re here to work out and to work out hard, so you don\u2019t want to wear anything that would compromise your workout,\u201d said Ms. Letamendi, a psychologist who hosts a podcast during which she analyzes Batman. \u201cThe dressing up is more like a nice punctuation.\u201dAfter workouts, members often go out to eat together and discuss their common interests.Stephanie Bayer, 37, finished a recent class talking about her pursuit of \u201cChun-Li ripped thighs.\u201d (Chun-Li is the first female fighter in the Street Fighter series.) Ms. Bayer, who has tattoos of R2-D2, the devil girl from the video game BioShock Infinite Devil\u2019s Kiss and Mrs. White from the game Clue, indicated the sweat on her \u201cStar Wars\u201d shirt.\u201cNow I can go home and play video games and not feel guilty,\u201d she said.slide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Want My Lesbian Bars Back", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byOpinionCHICAGO \u2014 \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201dIt was a late Saturday night in August 2010. I had just moved to Chicago, and the second my girlfriend and I unloaded the U-Haul (yes! clich\u00e9s are fun), I sat down on a box in our new apartment and Googled \u201clesbian bar Chicago.\u201dTwo hours later, we stood outside the first search result, hesitating. Nervous sweat trickled down my sides in the unrelenting humidity that I didn\u2019t yet recognize as a defining characteristic of Chicago summers. We were about to meet our new community, a whole sea of queers who had never had any dealings with me or my exes!Music thudded from inside the bar. It seemed promising, so we walked in.No one was there.Well, there was a bartender, who smiled at us as we froze in embarrassed horror in the doorway. My girlfriend went to order us drinks. I scurried over to stand at a table and watch music videos by Madonna and Rihanna. She came back with our drinks, and I inhaled mine, eyes wide in a silent scream.Aside from having their basic human and civil rights taken away, nothing makes homos more nervous than an empty dance floor at a gay bar. It goes against the natural order of things, like RuPaul without big hair or Sean Spicer giving a calm and informed news conference.\u201cDo you think it\u2019s always like this?\u201d I whispered.\u201cIt can\u2019t be,\u201d my girlfriend murmured. \u201cHow could they stay in business?\u201dMost lesbian bars don\u2019t.It\u2019s been almost seven years since that night in Chicago. I\u2019m even more nervous now.I love hanging out with my people, but these days, I hardly ever go to lesbian bars. That\u2019s because they don\u2019t exist anymore. There are queer and lesbian dance nights, sure, but in most cities, \u201cqueer\u201d bars cater almost exclusively to gay men.That worries me. We always tell young gaybies that getting out of their rural town and moving to the big city is the answer to finding their queer family. But as queer people become normalized, have these tight-knit families and communities once found in lesbian and gay bars just melted away into a puddle of casual societal acceptance?I think that\u2019s what is going on. Dedicated queer bars, especially spaces for lesbians, female-identified queers and trans and genderqueer people, are vanishing. It makes me feel out of place, like a really gay goose who just wants to flap her wings to some Robyn and Missy Elliott but finds herself in a pub in Wrigleyville on a Cubs game day. Where are the queer hangouts to set my inner homing device to?This has been happening for a while, but I think we\u2019ve reached a tipping point where few folks blink if you mention you\u2019re gay. That\u2019s because being queer has become so normal now that Ellen DeGeneres can beam nonthreatening gayness into America\u2019s living room every day and no one, not even my card-carrying Tea Partyer relative, says anything except, \u201cOoh, I love it when Ellen dances.\u201dWe\u2019re mostly accepted. But I feel like I\u2019m losing something small but precious.I want my lesbian bars back. I want clear, dedicated spaces where queers hang out, places that sneering teenagers can drive past with their friends and secretly wonder about. Our bars are closing or gone. How do we find community now? (Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s pregnant with twins; she\u2019s too busy, gays!)I do think being inclusive is important. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s becoming O.K. to be queer, that millions of straight people are so loving and welcoming and open that they want to come to the pride parade, to dance in the few bars we have left and to watch us mock the ill-dressed on national TV.Gay marriage? Legal. Laverne Cox has an Emmy nomination. Queen Latifah and Janelle Monae are openly queer and, gasp!, they still have careers. \u201cModern Family\u201d exists. Kristen Stewart and her girlfriend sulk their way across Los Angeles. Kids are coming out as queer and trans earlier and earlier, softening people\u2019s hearts, one at a time.But there is a still need for queers to have a community with spaces of their own. There is value in knowing there\u2019s somewhere you can go to be near others who understand what it\u2019s like to be a \u2019mo every single day.

{"Headline": "Apple Faces Inquiry in China Over App Store Content", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese authorities plan to question Apple about video streaming services available over its app store within the country, in their latest move to intensify pressure on the American technology giant over the content it provides in the vast and crucial market.The inquiry appears to focus on third-party apps available on the company\u2019s app store in China. The report said the authorities had told three Chinese websites to tighten their oversight of online information, livestreaming services and online performance. Some broadcasters, it said, offered live content forbidden by Chinese law, including pornography.The authorities had already met with Apple representatives about livestreaming apps available on its app store in China, Xinhua said, without disclosing details.An Apple spokesman in China declined to comment.The report comes as Chinese authorities put pressure on Apple over the apps and other content it offers its users in China, which in the fiscal quarter that ended Dec. 31 accounted for about one-fifth of its revenue.The moves are part of a broader Chinese effort to regulate internet content. With services like Google, Facebook and Twitter long blocked in China, Apple is a rare foreign-owned company that provides a significant amount of apps and other content through platforms it controls.More recently, Chinese authorities have also ordered app stores in China to register with the government. Because Google\u2019s app store is among that company\u2019s services that are blocked in the country, a considerable number of locally owned third-party app stores have popped up to serve phones running Google\u2019s Android mobile-operating system. That has complicated China\u2019s efforts to control the country\u2019s fast-growing mobile internet business.The Xinhua report on Wednesday said that Apple had been approached by the Beijing offices of three Chinese agencies. They included the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top online regulator, as well as public security officials and a cultural law enforcement group.The report said three Chinese websites \u2014 toutiao.com, huoshanzhibo.com and huajiao.com \u2014 had violated regulations concerning internet information services. Some potential violations, it said, would be referred to the police.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Learning to Think Like a Computer", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byIn \u201cThe Beauty and Joy of Computing,\u201d the course he helped conceive for nonmajors at the University of California, Berkeley, Daniel Garcia explains an all-important concept in computer science \u2014 abstraction \u2014 in terms of milkshakes.\u201cThere is a reason when you go to the \u2018Joy of Cooking\u2019 and you want to make a strawberry milkshake, you don\u2019t look under \u2018strawberry milkshake,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. Rather, there is a recipe for milkshakes that instructs you to add ice cream, milk and fruit of your choice. While earlier cookbooks may have had separate recipes for strawberry milkshakes, raspberry milkshakes and boysenberry milkshakes, eventually, he imagines, someone said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we collapse that into one milkshake recipe?\u201d\u201cThe idea of abstraction,\u201d he said, \u201cis to hide the details.\u201d It requires recognizing patterns and distilling complexity into a precise, clear summary. It\u2019s like the countdown to a space launch that runs through a checklist \u2014 life support, fuel, payload \u2014 in which each check represents perhaps 100 checks that have been performed.Concealing layers of information makes it possible to get at the intersections of things, improving aspects of a complicated system without understanding and grappling with each part. Abstraction allows advances without redesigning from scratch.It is a cool and useful idea that, along with other cool and useful computer science ideas, has people itching to know more. It\u2019s obvious that computers have become indispensable problem-solving partners, not to mention personal companions. But it\u2019s suddenly not enough to be a fluent user of software interfaces. Understanding what lies behind the computer\u2019s seeming magic now seems crucial. In particular, \u201ccomputational thinking\u201d is captivating educators, from kindergarten teachers to college professors, offering a new language and orientation to tackle problems in other areas of life.In the fall, the College Board introduced a new Advanced Placement course, Computer Science Principles, focused not on learning to code but on using code to solve problems. And WGBH, the PBS station in Boston, is using National Science Foundation money to help develop a program for 3- to 5-year-olds in which four cartoon monkeys get into scrapes and then \u201cget out of the messes by applying computational thinking,\u201d said Marisa Wolsky, executive producer of children\u2019s media. \u201cWe see it as a groundbreaking curriculum that is not being done yet.\u201d\u201cThings were so bad that some universities were thinking of closing down computer science departments,\u201d she recalled. Some now consider her article a manifesto for embracing a computing mind-set.Like any big idea, there is disagreement about computational thinking \u2014 its broad usefulness as well as what fits in the circle. Skills typically include recognizing patterns and sequences, creating algorithms, devising tests for finding and fixing errors, reducing the general to the precise and expanding the precise to the general.It requires reframing research, said Shriram Krishnamurthi, a computer science professor at Brown, so that \u201cinstead of formulating a question to a human being, I formulate a question to a data set.\u201d For example, instead of asking if the media is biased toward liberals, pose the question as: Are liberals identified as liberal in major newspapers more often or less often than conservatives are identified as conservative?Dr. Krishnamurthi helped create \u201cIntroduction to Computation for the Humanities and Social Sciences\u201d more than a decade ago because he wanted students \u201cearly in their undergrad careers to learn a new mode of thinking that they could take back to their discipline.\u201d Capped at 20 students, the course now has a waitlist of more than 100.Just as Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution is drafted to explain politics and business, Dr. Wing argued for broad use of computer ideas. And not just for work. Applying computational thinking, \u201cwe can improve the efficiencies of our daily lives,\u201d she said in an interview, \u201cand make ourselves a little less stressed out.\u201dComputing practices like reformulating tough problems into ones we know how to solve, seeing trade-offs between time and space, and pipelining (allowing the next action in line to begin before the first completes the sequence) have many applications, she said.Consider the buffet line. \u201cWhen you go to a lunch buffet, you see the forks and knives are the first station,\u201d she said. \u201cI find that very annoying. They should be last. You shouldn\u2019t have to balance your plate while you have your fork and knife.\u201d Dr. Wing, who equates a child filling her backpack to caching (how computers retrieve and store information needed later), sees the buffet\u2019s inefficiency as a failure to apply logical thinking and sequencing.Computational thinking, she said, can aid a basic task like planning a trip \u2014 breaking it into booking flights, hotels, car rental \u2014 or be used \u201cfor something as complicated as health care or policy decision-making.\u201d Identifying subproblems and describing their relationship to the larger problem allows for targeted work. \u201cOnce you have well-defined interfaces,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can ignore the complexity of the rest of the problem.\u201dCan computational thinking make us better at work and life? Dr. Krishnamurthi is sometimes seduced. \u201cBefore I go grocery shopping, I sort my list by aisles in the store,\u201d he said. Sharing the list on the app Trello, his family can \u201cbucket sort\u201d items by aisle (pasta and oils, canned goods, then baking and spices), optimizing their path through Whole Foods. It limits backtracking and reduces spontaneous, \u201ci.e., junk,\u201d purchases, he said.Despite his chosen field, Dr. Krishnamurthi worries about the current cultural tendency to view computer science knowledge as supreme, better than that gained in other fields. Right now, he said, \u201cwe are just overly intoxicated with computer science.\u201dIt is certainly worth wondering if some applications of computational thinking are trivial, unnecessary or a Stepford Wife-like abdication of devilishly random judgment.Alexander Torres, a senior majoring in English at Stanford, has noted how the campus\u2019s proximity to Google has lured all but the rare student to computer science courses. He\u2019s a holdout. But \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as having skills missing,\u201d he said. In earning his degree he has practiced critical thinking, problem solving, analysis and making logical arguments. \u201cWhen you are analyzing a Dickinson or Whitman or Melville, you have to unpack that language and synthesize it back.\u201dThere is no reliable research showing that computing makes one more creative or more able to problem-solve. It won\u2019t make you better at something unless that something is explicitly taught, said Mark Guzdial, a professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech who studies computing in education. \u201cYou can\u2019t prove a negative,\u201d he said, but in decades of research no one has found that skills automatically transfer.Still, he added, for the same reasons people should understand biology, chemistry or physics, \u201cit makes a lot of sense to understand computing in our lives.\u201d Increasing numbers of people must program in their jobs, even if it\u2019s just Microsoft Excel. \u201cSolving problems with computers happens to all of us every day,\u201d he said. How to make the skills available broadly is \u201can interesting challenge.\u201d\u2022\u201cIt\u2019s like being a diplomat and learning Spanish; I feel like it\u2019s essential,\u201d said Greer Brigham, a Brown freshman who plans to major in political science. He\u2019s taking the course designed by Dr. Krishnamurthi, which this term is being taught by a graduate student in robotics named Stephen Brawner.On a March morning at the Brown computer science center, Mr. Brawner projected a student\u2019s homework assignment on the screen. Did anyone notice a problem? Nary a humanities hand was raised. Finally, a young woman suggested \u201ccentimeters\u201d and \u201ckilograms\u201d could be abbreviated. Fine, but not enough.Mr. Brawner broke the silence and pointed out long lines of code reaching the far side of the screen. With a practiced flurry, he inserted backslashes and hit \u201creturn\u201d repeatedly, which drew the symbols into a neat block. It may all be directions to a machine, but computer scientists care a great deal about visual elegance. As Mr. Brawner cut out repeated instructions, he shared that \u201cwhenever we define a constant, we want that at the top of our code.\u201d He then explained the new assignment: write a program to play \u201crock, paper, scissors\u201d against a computer.Mili Mitra, a junior majoring in public policy and economics who sat with a MacBook on her lap, would not have considered this class a year ago. But seeing group research projects always being handed off to someone with computing knowledge, she decided that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to keep passing them along.\u201d She has learned to write basic code and fetch data sets through the internet to analyze things she\u2019s interested in, such as how geographic proximity shapes voting patterns in the United Nations General Assembly.Despite finding interactions with a computer much like \u201cexplaining things to a toddler,\u201d Ms. Mitra credits the class for instilling the habit of \u201cgoing step by step and building a solution.\u201d She admits to being an impatient learner: \u201cI jump ahead. In C.S. you don\u2019t have a choice. If you miss a step, you mess up everything.\u201dNot a computer whiz? Not a problem. Try these practice exam questions from Computer Science Principles.Just as children are drilled on the scientific method \u2014 turn observations into a hypothesis, design a control group, do an experiment to test your theory \u2014 the basics of working with computers is being cast as a teachable blueprint. One thing making this possible is that communicating with computers has become easier.\u201cBlock\u201d programming languages like Scratch, released by the M.I.T. Media Lab a decade ago, hide text strings that look like computer keys run amok. That makes coding look less scary. Instead of keyboard letters and symbols, you might select from a menu and drag a color-coded block that says \u201csay ( ) for ( ) secs\u201d or \u201cplay note ( ) for ( ) beats.\u201d The colors and shapes correspond to categories like \u201csound\u201d or \u201cmotion\u201d; the blocks can be fit together like stacked puzzle pieces to order instructions. Students use this to, say, design a game.One need not be a digital Dr. Doolittle, fluent in hard-core programming languages like Java or Python, to code. Block languages cut out the need to memorize commands, which vary depending on the computer language, because the block \u201cis read just the way you think about it,\u201d Dr. Garcia said. Students in his Berkeley course use the block language Snap! for assignments \u2014 he doesn\u2019t teach Python until the last two weeks, and then just so they can take higher-level courses. \u201cWe tell them, \u2018You already know how to program,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said, because the steps are the same.Computer Science A, which teaches Java, is the fastest-growing Advanced Placement course. (The number of students taking the exam in 2016 rose 18 percent over 2015 and nearly tripled in a decade.) But professors complained that \u201cJava was not the right way\u201d to attract a diverse group of students, said Trevor Packer, head of the A.P. program, so a new course was developed.The course, Computer Science Principles, is modeled on college versions for nonmajors. It lets teachers pick any coding language and has a gentler vibe. There is an exam, but students also submit projects \u201cmore similar to a studio art portfolio,\u201d Mr. Packer said. The course covers working with data and understanding the internet and cyber security, and it teaches \u201ctransferable skills,\u201d he said, like formulating precise questions. That\u2019s a departure from what the College Board found in many high schools: \u201cThey were learning how to keyboard, how to use Microsoft applications.\u201d The goal is that the new course will be offered in every high school in the country.\u2022In an airy kindergarten classroom at Eliot-Pearson Children\u2019s School, in the Tufts University Department of Child Study and Human Development, children program with actual blocks. Marina Umaschi Bers, a child development and computer science professor, created wooden blocks that bear bar codes with instructions such as \u201cforward,\u201d \u201cspin\u201d and \u201cshake\u201d that are used to program robots \u2014 small, wheeled carts with built-in scanners \u2014 by sequencing the blocks, then scanning them. Each \u201cprogram\u201d starts with a green \u201cbegin\u201d block and finishes with a red \u201cend.\u201dCoding for the youngest students has become the trendy pedagogy, with plentiful toys and apps like Dr. Bers\u2019s blocks. Dr. Bers, who with M.I.T. collaborators developed the block language ScratchJr, is evangelical about coding. Learning the language of machines, she said, is as basic as writing is to being proficient in a foreign language. \u201cYou are able to write a love poem, you are able to write a birthday card, you are able to use language in many expressive ways,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are not just reading; you are producing.\u201dPeer-reviewed studies by Dr. Bers show that after programming the robots, youngsters are better at sequencing picture stories. Anecdotally, she said, when they ask children to list steps for brushing teeth, they get just a few, \u201cbut after being exposed to this work, they\u2019ll have 15 or 20 steps.\u201dDr. Bers embeds computing in activities familiar to young children like inventing stories, doing dances and making art. At the Tufts school on a recent morning, children puzzled over a question: How does a robot celebrate spring?\u201cHe\u2019s going to dance, and then he will pretend that he is wet,\u201d offered Hallel Cohen-Goldberg, a kindergartner with a mane of curls.Solina Gonzalez, coloring a brown, blue and red circle with markers, peered soberly through pink-framed glasses: \u201cHe just does a lollipop dance.\u201d Solina\u2019s partner, Oisin Stephens, fretted about the root beer lollipop drawing she had taped to a block. \u201cThe robot won\u2019t be able to read this,\u201d he said. (It\u2019s an invalid input.)As they lurched around the carpet on their knees, the children executed computer science concepts like breaking instructions into sequenced commands, testing and debugging. One team used \u201crepeat\u201d and \u201cstop repeat\u201d blocks, forming a programming \u201cloop,\u201d a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.It may be a leap to think of talking to machines as child\u2019s play. But when Dr. Bers chats with students as they sequence blocks, they hardly notice they are coding. \u201cThey say, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not programming,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said.Consciously or not, this next generation may be effortlessly absorbing the computational thinking skills so many covet, and in the process refining what we mean by digital native.Laura Pappano is author of \u201cInside School Turnarounds: Urgent Hopes, Unfolding Stories.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Help Tackle Inequality, Remember the Advantages You\u2019ve Had", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewBut there is far less agreement on how to achieve that goal. Do we need to level the playing field so that people born to modest circumstances have a better chance? Should we be trying to instill a stronger work ethic in the United States, and build a more robust culture of hard work? Counterproductive and, at times, bitter arguments bog down the search for solutions.One metaphor is well represented, both in our imaginations and in our iconography, while the other is neglected.This asymmetry reflects a deeper psychological bias: We tend to remember the obstacles we have overcome more vividly than the advantages we have been given.This bias is embedded in our day-to-day lives. Most of our time and energy goes toward overcoming the challenges immediately in front of us. Headwinds demand attention because they must be overcome. Tailwinds may evoke a momentary sense of well-being and gratitude; but primarily, they free us to focus elsewhere, on challenges that must be overcome.Mr. Davidai and Mr. Gilovich show some of the broader social and political consequences of this psychological asymmetry. They find, for example, that both Democrats and Republicans believe that electoral maps are not apportioned to their advantage. The scholars also find that, within families, people tend to think their parents were tougher on them than their siblings recognize.Of course, we don\u2019t really know what is going on inside everyone\u2019s mind, but it does appear that many of us overrepresent the obstacles we face.In many autobiographies, for example, even fortunate people, born to rich, loving families, look back on life and remember all the things that stood in their way. Not only do we play the starring role in our own life stories, but those stories often revolve around struggle.I see this tendency in myself. When it comes to education, I have won not just one but several birth lotteries: Many children born next to me in rural India struggled to obtain anything beyond simple primary education and maybe a decent high school. Yet I had some of the best educational resources placed right in front of me all the way through my doctorate at Harvard.I would be foolish if I did not remind myself of these advantages every day. Yet it is telling that I do need to remind myself. My spontaneous thoughts are of the challenges I faced, not the advantages I had.This cognitive bias, I think, sheds light on persistent disagreements over inequality and opportunity that affect many of us in American society.When we see our own past in terms of the headwinds we managed to overcome, it is easy to attribute the failure of others to a lack of perseverance. When poor children drop out of high school, someone who complains that these children don\u2019t have an adequate work ethic may be remembering educational hurdles that she managed to surmount early in her own life.We often disagree over the source of our success: Those who emphasize the existence of birth lotteries point to the easy ride the well-off have had. Yet relatively privileged people may look at their own lives and feel, \u201cI\u2019ve struggled too.\u201dDuring these months, richer children benefit from summer programs and books around the house, and, more broadly, from the myriad advantages of having parents with the resources, knowledge and time to intellectually engage them. Even conversation around the dinner table can be a tailwind.From a public policy perspective, it may be easier to agree on creating tailwinds than on removing headwinds. Even people who take great pride in having gotten ahead through hard work can, if prompted and upon reflection, recognize the tailwinds that helped them. This recognition does not detract from their genuine effort. Instead, it can be a moment to be thankful, perhaps for a family member who believed in you, or an unexpected piece of good fortune at just the right time.By focusing on tailwinds, we can sidestep potential disagreements about the role of personal responsibility and initiative. Even with a tailwind, hard work is still needed; that work just yields more reward. A summer scholarship is not a substitute for serious effort.We could garner support for such programs by asking people to remember the tailwinds in their past: It is a small step from gratitude for one\u2019s blessings to the realization that everyone can use a little help, the poor most of all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marissa Mayer Will Make $186 Million on Yahoo\u2019s Sale to Verizon", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo shareholders will vote June 8 on whether to sell the company\u2019s internet businesses to Verizon Communications for $4.48 billion. A yes vote, which is widely expected, would end Marissa Mayer\u2019s largely unsuccessful five-year effort to restore the internet pioneer to greatness.But Ms. Mayer, the company\u2019s chief executive, will be well compensated for her failure. Her Yahoo stock, stock options and restricted stock units are worth a total of $186 million, based on Monday\u2019s stock price of $48.15, according to data filed on Monday in the documents sent to shareholders about the Verizon deal.That compensation, which will be fully vested at the time of the shareholder vote, does not include her salary and bonuses over the past five years, or the value of other stock that Ms. Mayer has already sold. All told, her time at Yahoo will have netted her well over $200 million, according to calculations based on company filings.Yahoo declined to comment on Ms. Mayer\u2019s compensation, apart from the information included in its legal filings.Most of Ms. Mayer\u2019s payout is based on the 208 percent increase in Yahoo\u2019s stock price since she left Google for Yahoo in 2012. Although Yahoo\u2019s core businesses of email, news and search continued to tread water under Ms. Mayer\u2019s leadership, long-held investments in Alibaba, China\u2019s leading e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, an affiliated company controlled by SoftBank, increased in value, driving up Yahoo\u2019s stock price.The sale to Verizon will leave those two investments, along with other assorted assets like a patent portfolio, in a new company called Altaba. The management of that company will seek to unlock the value of its $44 billion stake in Alibaba and its $9.5 billion stake in Yahoo Japan while minimizing a $15 billion tax bill that Yahoo estimates would be due on an outright sale.Yahoo said in its filing that Altaba is more likely to sell its Yahoo Japan stock than sell its Alibaba shares, but it gave no further details. Altaba will be led by Thomas McInerney, the Yahoo director who led the Verizon sale process.The filing also disclosed that Yahoo invested in Snap, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s hottest companies, buying 2.3 million shares in a March 2015 fund-raising round that priced the shares at $10.86. After a stock split that doubled the number of shares Yahoo owned, Snap went public in March. Snap shares are now trading at $21.20, valuing Yahoo\u2019s stake at $98 million.Yahoo also owns stakes in Hortonworks, an enterprise software company; Paperless, a digital event invitation service; and SeatGeek, a ticket reselling service. The company valued Excalibur, its portfolio of patents that are up for sale, at $740 million.The 2014 data breach prompted Yahoo and Verizon to renegotiate their original deal, which was struck in July. Eventually, they agreed to cut the price by $350 million.An article on Tuesday about money that Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, stands to receive if shareholders vote to sell the company\u2019s internet businesses to Verizon Communications misstated the amount of Snap stock owned by Yahoo. The company owns 4.6 million shares valued at $98 million, not 2.3 million shares valued at $49 million.Advertisement"}

The data is anonymized, meaning individuals\u2019 names are not attached to the information, and can be used as a proxy for the health of a rival.After the revelation, angry users demanded that Unroll.me explain why the company had gone into their inboxes and betrayed their trust. Late on Sunday, Jojo Hedaya, the chief executive of Unroll.me, apologized in response to the surprised reaction to a practice that he said the company had been open about in the past.What Unroll.me does is far from an anomaly \u2014 it is part of an expansive and largely unregulated world of selling personal data collected by online consumer services. As long as a service like Unroll.me has a privacy policy, adheres to it and does not sell personally identifiable information, like someone\u2019s name, it is fairly free to package and sell the data it collects.Yet privacy advocates said the modern technology of data analytics allowed such fine-grained measurement of a person\u2019s online behavior that the concept of personally identifiable information was all but obsolete.\u201cMany of the services or apps we use for \u2018free\u2019 are monetizing data about us,\u201d said Lee Tien, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization focused on digital rights.Companies like Unroll.me have long acted as intelligence services offering insights to businesses seeking to gain a competitive edge. Both Uber and Lyft pay for information from Slice as well as other data services, according to two people familiar with the companies\u2019 competitive intelligence programs, who asked to remain anonymous because the programs were confidential. Uber and Lyft declined to comment.In 2014, after concluding its investigation, the F.T.C. called on Congress to protect consumers against the unchecked collection and marketing of their digital data. The F.T.C. report detailed how some of the companies classify consumers in data-driven social and demographic groups for marketing purposes with labels like \u201cfinancially challenged,\u201d \u201cdiabetes interest\u201d and \u201csmoker in the household.\u201d The concern is that such classifications could be used to limit fair access to financial services or health insurance.The F.T.C. recommendation, which was endorsed in a separate report by the Obama administration, was not taken up in Congress.Unroll.me bills itself as offering an easy way to \u201cclean up your inbox.\u201d After someone grants the service access to his or her email account, Unroll.me serves up a list of all the subscriptions they are a part of, with the option to quickly opt out of the ones they no longer want to receive. The company also organizes subscription emails and delivers a newsletter-style digest of some subscriptions.Unroll.me discloses its freewheeling use of personal data in its privacy policy, which says that \u201cwe may collect, use, transfer, sell and disclose nonpersonal information for any purpose\u201d and that the data can be used \u201cto build anonymous market research products and services.\u201dYet few people read such policies closely, privacy advocates said. Katharina Kopp, director of policy at the Center for Digital Democracy, said of Unroll.me, \u201cUnder the disguise of being customer friendly and helping their customers to get rid of \u2018email junk,\u2019 they allow the profiling and targeting of their unwitting customers by third parties.\u201dMs. Kopp called the Unroll.me tactic a \u201cparticularly misleading practice,\u201d despite the disclosure in its privacy policy.In its blog post on Sunday, Unroll.me said it had underestimated how many people would be surprised at the methods it used to build its business. The company said it was working on making its business model more transparent to users, with clearer messaging on its website, on its app and in its frequently asked questions section.Some of those who were upset with the practices of Unroll.me chalked it up to a learning experience.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Blinks in Clash With Twitter; Drops Order to Unmask Anti-Trump Account", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byThe government\u2019s move defused a potential standoff pitting a presidential administration that has tried to clamp down on leaks against a technology company with a history of defending its users\u2019 First Amendment rights.\u201cBecause the summons is now withdrawn, Twitter voluntarily dismisses without prejudice all claims against Defendants in the above-captioned matter,\u201d Twitter said in a court filing on Friday in which it withdrew its lawsuit against the government.The company declined to comment beyond the filing. Jenny Burke, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, which, with Customs and Border Protection, had issued the summons, did not respond to a request for comment.Technology companies and federal officials have frequently clashed over digital privacy. Twitter, Google, Facebook, Apple and many other companies have collected reams of data about their users, which law enforcement and other authorities have sometimes been eager to obtain for national security and other reasons.In response, anonymous Twitter accounts emerged offering \u201calternative\u201d opinions at odds with the agencies\u2019 official silence. Accounts like @Alt_Labor, @BadlandsNPS and @RogueEPAstaff claimed to be operated by current or former employees of the agencies. @ALT_USCIS, created in January, is among the alt-accounts that has been active on Twitter in criticizing the administration\u2019s immigration policies and other actions.In Twitter\u2019s suit against the government, filed Thursday, the company said that the summons was unlawful and that it would not comply and set a precedent that could have a \u201cgrave chilling effect\u201d on others voicing resistance to White House policies.The @ALT_USCIS case was taken up almost immediately by free speech proponents, with the American Civil Liberties Union saying it would represent the anonymous holder or holders of the account after Twitter filed its suit. The civil liberties group said that in issuing the summons, the government appeared to simply be trying to clamp down on online dissent.The A.C.L.U. said on Friday that the withdrawal of the summons was a victory for free speech rights.\u201cThe speed with which the government buckled shows just how blatantly unconstitutional its demand was in the first place,\u201d said Esha Bhandari, one of the A.C.L.U. attorneys on the case. \u201cThe anonymity that the First Amendment guarantees is often most essential when people criticize the government, and this free speech right is as important today as ever.\u201dThe dispute only amplified the message of @ALT_USCIS. The account, which added 32,000 followers within its first two months of existence, had 155,000 followers by Friday afternoon.After news broke that the government had withdrawn the summons, the account posted a message thanking those who had supported the right to anonymous free speech.Several other alt-accounts also weighed in, sharing messages of support for @ALT_USCIS, Twitter and the A.C.L.U. The @RogueEPAstaff account posted several messages toasting the A.C.L.U. and @ALT_USCIS.Still, the attention may have overwhelmed whoever is behind @ALT_USCIS. After thanking supporters, the account posted a message saying it would be taking some time off.Advertisement"}

That includes particular attention to James Murdoch, one of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s sons, who is the chief executive of 21st Century Fox.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen because we don\u2019t have a great track record in cases like this,\u201d said Lorna Woods, a media law professor at the University of Essex. The \u201cfit and proper test isn\u2019t limited to Britain,\u201d she said. Regulators \u201chave the potential to look at a person\u2019s actions wherever they take place.\u201dOfcom, the British regulator that must rule by May 16, declined to comment on the specifics of the case, saying it would take into account any relevant misconduct.21st Century Fox denied that its proposed takeover would fail the fit and proper standards. It said James Murdoch had been the chairman of Sky since early 2016, and if British officials were concerned, they would have investigated the issue by now.\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if it materially affected the regulators\u2019 view,\u201d Martin Gilbert, Sky\u2019s deputy chairman, said in an interview, in reference to the potential impact of troubles at Fox News on the proposed takeover.Legal experts note that the fit and proper standards are ill-defined and that it is hard to establish a precedent from the few previous cases that are in any way similar to the proposed takeover of Sky.\u201cWe consider James Murdoch\u2019s conduct to be both difficult to comprehend and ill-judged,\u201d the regulator wrote in 2012. His conduct \u201cfell short of the exercise of responsibility to be expected of him as C.E.O. and chairman.\u201dWhile 21st Century Fox remains confident that it will finally take control of Sky, its critics are also calling on the British regulator to think hard about the potential dominance that the Murdochs may exert over the country\u2019s media if the deal is approved.The proposed takeover would also be subject to the approval of the British government after the regulator completes its review next month.The Murdoch family owns 39 percent stakes in both 21st Century Fox and News Corporation, the group that owns The Wall Street Journal, The Times of London and several other publications.Martin Moore, director of the Center for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King\u2019s College London, said 21st Century Fox\u2019s proposed acquisition of Sky and its large British news operations could further expand Rupert Murdoch\u2019s control of the British media industry.The company disputes this, saying digital platforms like of Google and Facebook offer new media competition that did not exist when it last tried to buy Sky in 2010.\u201cOf course we\u2019ve seen an expansion in how news can be distributed on these digital platforms,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cBut if Sky and News Corp. are effectively merged under the Murdoch umbrella, we can expect them to follow a similar editorial stance.

{"Headline": "California Today: Weighing a Response on Internet Privacy", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.That could soon change.Assemblyman Ed Chau, a Democrat who heads the Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee, said he was holding meetings on steps the Legislature could take to safeguard personal information.\u201cCalifornia has been at the leading edge of innovation in approaching privacy issues and consumer protection for years, and there is no reason for that to change,\u201d he said in a statement.Some lawmakers have argued that the privacy rules, drafted last October by the Federal Communications Commission, would have unfairly targeted telecom carriers, while sparing web companies like Google and Facebook that also provide access to user data.\u201cThey really created an unlevel playing field,\u201d said State Senator Joel Anderson, a Republican who has worked on digital privacy. He added, \u201cThey gave free rein to Google and to Facebook.\u201dPrivacy groups have noted that consumers can avoid a website with objectionable user terms. But to go online, you have to contract with a broadband provider.That doesn\u2019t mean letting the web services off the hook, said Richard Holober, executive director of the Consumer Federation of California, a nonprofit.\u201cWe\u2019d love them to go after Google,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you start with the folks who have unfettered control of watching everything you\u2019re doing.\u201dAny effort to reproduce the overturned federal rules in California is by no means a lock.Nicole Ozer, the technology and civil liberties policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of California, said lawmakers had introduced \u201cmany, many bills\u201d over the years intended to shore up digital privacy.\u201cUnfortunately, very few of them have been signed into law,\u201d she said.The latest privacy debate, however, differs in a crucial way: It threatens business interests in a state where tech companies enjoy tremendous influence.\u201cTechnology is a very large industry in California,\u201d Ms. Ozer said, \u201cso I think there are a lot of legislators who are very cognizant of those issues.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)If you didn\u2019t understand that, there\u2019s a new book that might be able to help.

{"Headline": "United and Pepsi Affairs Force Brands to Respect Social Media", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byWhen Jason Marker, the new chief executive of the company that owns Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s, met with several of his marketing executives this week, one of his first requests was for screens to be installed in the company\u2019s headquarters to display real-time social media conversations about its brands.It is the sort of setup that already exists at the advertising agencies representing Mr. Marker\u2019s company, CKE Restaurants, and that the company has built internally for events like the Super Bowl, said Brandon LaChance, the director of advertising and digital marketing for the chains, who was at the meeting. But now, he added, that information will be available daily to the whole company, which is based in Franklin, Tenn.\u201cIn most organizations, supply chain, H.R., legal or whatever it is \u2014 they\u2019re not exposed to the same kind of stuff as marketing because it\u2019s not traditionally in their area of responsibility,\u201d Mr. LaChance said, comparing the news flow on such screens to the humming activity of stock quotations, chyrons and headline tickers on CNBC. Now, he said, \u201canyone can take a look at that and see how what they do impacts the business.\u201dIn each instance, consumer outrage was amplified after initial responses from the companies were viewed as too slow and unapologetic.\u201cThe beautiful and the scary thing for marketers is that for the first time in history, they now have this open door for a two-way dialogue with consumers,\u201d Mr. LaChance said. \u201cBut when you do open that door to a dialogue, you better be ready to have it with them.\u201dCrises that play out on social media are increasingly being viewed as threats to a company\u2019s profits instead of short public relations episodes, said Leslie Gaines-Ross, chief reputation strategist at the public relations firm Weber Shandwick. \u201cOne tweet, just one dangerous tweet, can really impact your share price,\u201d Ms. Gaines-Ross said.Weber Shandwick uses a tool to simulate crises for executives, inventing a plausible firestorm then running a drill exposing them to a litany of \u201cchallenging media inquiries, news articles, social channel conversations and videos as you witness the immediate implications of your responses (or non-responses),\u201d according to a description online.Maryam Banikarim, Hyatt Hotels\u2019 chief marketing officer, said that while most executives outside the marketing department had long been aware of the impact that social media interactions can have on their companies, the presidential election drove the point solidly home.\u201cObama got a lot of points for engaging with social media and doing things on Saturday Night Live, and that seemed record-breaking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe today have a president that sometimes breaks news on Twitter before he does it anyplace else, and that\u2019s a marked difference from a year ago. If you didn\u2019t understand the power of social media before, how can you not understand it after this election cycle?\u201dThat has placed a renewed focus on how major brands approach their online accounts and handle potentially problematic situations before they reach a fever pitch, particularly when they\u2019re dealing with huge amounts of data from the likes of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google search and Instagram.Hyatt monitors its social networks and mentions of its brands around the clock, usually responding to people in less than 10 minutes, Ms. Banikarim said, adding that employees are trained to respond to everything and to be aware that all interactions are public.\u201cIt used to be that consumers interacted with you through call centers or they wrote you, so it was a one-on-one communication,\u201d Ms. Banikarim said. \u201cNow, you may be responding to one person\u2019s Twitter, but everyone is seeing it, so you have to be conscious you have a public audience.\u201d That includes private messages, she said, noting that screenshots can be taken and shared.Unilever, the consumer goods giant, relies heavily on deep analytics and powerful language processing tools to understand the \u201ctsunami\u201d of data it sees from social media, said Stan Sthanunathan, its executive vice president of consumer and market insights. He said that 25 percent of his team now worked with social media, compared with 5 percent two years ago.While the tools are more often used to listen to consumers online and identify trends that can lead to new products, like Unilever\u2019s recent introduction of Lipton\u2019s Matcha Green Tea, he said, they can also help the company determine when to respond to potential problems.\u201cSometimes silence is golden,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s very, very important to have analytics, because there are situations where somebody says something and you end up overreacting, and by responding to that very quickly, you may actually fuel the whole fire. With analytics, you may actually note it\u2019s tapering off and showing signs of decline.\u201dThe tools used to monitor social media have evolved vastly from their early days as \u201cvery blunt instruments of listening,\u201d when they simply measured the volume of mentions or general sentiment without context, Mr. LaChance of CKE Restaurants said.\u201cAs a brand, we were absolutely prepared for that, and we closely monitored it,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cbut we were able to understand what mentions were adjacent, if you will, versus people really talking about anything substantive of their feelings towards our brands.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Sees Augmented Reality Ecosystem in Facebook", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported bySAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has long rued the day that Apple and Google beat him to building smartphones, which now underpin many people\u2019s digital lives. Ever since, he has searched for the next frontier of modern computing and how to be a part of it from the start.Now, Mr. Zuckerberg is betting he has found it: the real world.On Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg introduced what he positioned as the first mainstream augmented reality platform, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras.But in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s telling, there are few boundaries for how this technology will evolve. He said he envisioned a world in which people could eventually point smartphone cameras at a bowl of cereal and have an app create tiny sharks swimming in the milk. Friends can leave virtual notes for one another on the walls outside their favorite restaurants, noting which menu item is the most delicious.\u201cThink about how many of the things around us don\u2019t actually need to be physical,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in an interview last week. \u201cInstead of a $500 TV sitting in front of us, what\u2019s to keep us from one day having it be a $1 app?\u201dFacebook does not expect to build all of these software experiences itself. At its annual developer conference on Tuesday, it called for computer programmers to help by building augmented-reality-based apps to work with what Facebook calls its Camera Effects Platform. Facebook announced new tools to aid developers and will begin the initiative with a small number of partners in a closed test.Still, Mr. Zuckerberg said he intended to create the next major app ecosystem that would work with Facebook\u2019s in-app camera. If successful, Facebook could be in a position similar to that of Apple, which relies on the hundreds of millions of apps in its store to keep users buying the company\u2019s smartphones and tablets every year. Facebook, in turn, wants developers to build experiences that entice people to visit its website and apps on a daily \u2014 if not hourly \u2014 basis.\u201cJust like Apple built the iPod and iTunes ecosystem before the iPhone, you want to make sure there\u2019s a set of content there, even if there\u2019s not everything,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Facebook has been building toward this goal for some time. Mr. Zuckerberg has spent the last 18 months reorganizing his company and its suite of consumer apps \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 around a new interface, focused almost entirely on the camera. Slowly, the company has played down the role of text inside its apps, instead encouraging people to take and send photos and videos to one another by using the in-app camera features.In time, Facebook hopes that companies like Electronic Arts, Nike and Warner Brothers \u2014 which are part of the initial set of partners \u2014 will be the ones to bring immersive augmented reality experiences to Facebook\u2019s platform.One early partner app is Giphy Thoughts, made by Giphy, a start-up that acts as a search engine for animated GIFs, which play as something like short-form videos. With Giphy Thoughts, for instance, people can place cartoon thought bubbles above the heads of others they view through their Facebook camera lens.\u201cIt goes back to creative expression,\u201d said David Rosenberg, director of business development at Giphy. \u201cFacebook Camera is just going to be this massive audience of people ready to make deeply personal content they can share with their friends.\u201dWhether Facebook can make it worth the time of more developers to create such apps remains a question.\u201cSoftware developers might ask, why would I create something for Facebook\u2019s platform that I am presumably giving away for free?\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst for Jackdaw Research, an industry analysis firm. \u201cAnd then when competitors introduce A.R. offerings, will I have to create it for Facebook and then a different lens for Snapchat? Or do I wait for Apple and Google to release their A.R. platforms?\u201dThen came Facebook\u2019s most aggressive move, the acquisition of Oculus in 2014. Facebook is investing hundreds of millions of dollars more in V.R. content and apps in the hopes that it will mature into a full-fledged ecosystem similar to Apple\u2019s App Store, but sales of the Oculus Rift goggles have been slow.\u201cThey are shaking things up there but haven\u2019t quite found their stride,\u201d said Stephanie Llamas, head of virtual reality and augmented reality strategy at SuperData Research, a game industry research firm.Mr. Zuckerberg has said the efforts with Oculus will take longer than he and his team initially believed, and probably billions of dollars more in investment. But in the interview last week, he said some of the technology acquired in the Oculus purchase had helped produce the seeds of the new augmented reality platform.Another dark horse is Magic Leap, the secretive augmented reality start-up that has an enormous investment from Google and Alibaba and is working on hardware to offer a similar experience. The company has yet to unveil an official product.For the near term, however, Mr. Zuckerberg sees the smartphone camera as the first step forward.\u201cWe want to get to this world in the future where you eventually have glasses or contact lenses where you can mix digital or physical objects in the digital world,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Longer still, she reckons, are the odds they\u2019re led back to her and to Ray Stussy (unrelated), who blackmailed LeFay into committing a crime and thus initiated the chain of events leading to all this chaos. And she\u2019s right, at least insofar as it applies to the unfathomable pinhead-ery she knows, which is that Maurice drove to the wrong Stussy house and killed its resident for indiscernible reasons. What she can\u2019t account for is the extent of the unfathomable pinhead-ery she doesn\u2019t know, which is likely to leave the authorities with a lot more evidence leading back to them, including a gas-station phone book with Ennis\u2019s page ripped out of it.The phrase also neatly encapsulates where we are in \u201cFargo\u201d so far. Unfathomable pinhead-ery has been a feature of \u201cFargo\u201d since Jerry Lundegaard hired a couple of lowlifes to kidnap his wife in the original Coen brothers movie, and we\u2019re already seeing the needless pileup of bodies that results from a petty criminal scheme gone amiss. What we\u2019re not seeing yet is the counterbalance of human decency and moral certitude that\u2019s also important to what could now, in the parlance of our times, be called the \u201cFargo\u201d brand. That typically arises from the Marge Gunderson character \u2014 in this case, Carrie Coon\u2019s Gloria Burgle \u2014 but she hasn\u2019t enjoyed enough meaningful screen time to establish that balance.As a plot machine, however, \u201cFargo\u201d remains top-notch, and the current cast may be the best the show has assembled. Ewan McGregor\u2019s dual role has been getting most of the attention so far, but Mary-Elizabeth Winstead\u2019s work as Nikki has been the bigger standout \u2014 in part because of Winstead\u2019s unwavering confidence as a femme fatale, but also because Nikki isn\u2019t quite as smart as her own measure. Compared with Ray, Maurice and the other losers in her orbit, Nikki is a criminal mastermind of Keyser Soze proportions, and we\u2019ve seen her react quickly and instinctually in threatening situations, like using her body in an attempt to figuratively and literally disarm Maurice or calculating the precise trajectory of a fatal air-conditioning unit.Yet Nikki is given to the same impulsive pinhead-ery that gets everyone in trouble in the \u201cFargo\u201d-verse. It\u2019s Nikki who convinces Ray to take a second shot at stealing his brother\u2019s two-cent stamp, without regard to the first attempt\u2019s possibly coming back to haunt them. And it\u2019s Nikki who, in a fit of anger over a perceived show of disrespect from Emmit, promptly pulls down her pants and leaves a saturated tampon in his desk drawer. The original plan to have Ray distract his brother while Nikki took the stamp is dumb enough \u2014 and the motive, to \u201cunblock\u201d his chi, even dumber \u2014 but there\u2019s no strategic purpose in this gesture, which will just leave the brothers further estranged. Perhaps there\u2019s a reason Nikki Swango wound up on parole in the first place.That leaves Gloria to restore some order to the universe, but she\u2019s seeking justice at about a tenth of the pace that injustices are being carried out. The Eden Valley Police Department is currently just an open table at the library, and her only jail cell is a storage room packed with unused computers. Her boss, Moe Dammick, wants to bring her under his watch in the county system, but there\u2019s no evidence he has much confidence in her. After all, she\u2019s still sending reports via Telex and wonders why nobody ever writes her back.That last detail is concerning: Eden Valley may be a mostly crime-free place where residents feel comfortable leaving their front doors unlocked, but Gloria does live in the 21st century. Her inability to crack the mystery of her unanswered Telex reports could, in uncharitable terms, be described as \u201cunfathomable pinhead-ery.\u201d3 Cent Stamps: \u2022 Ennis Stussy\u2019s former life as the sci-fi scribe Thaddeus Mobley opens up an intriguing new angle, but for now we can only gaze longingly at paperbacks with titles like \u201cToronto Cain: Psychic Ranger\u201d and \u201cThe Plague Monkey\u201d and wish they existed in the real world.\u2022 Frozen concentrated orange juice: Can you make meth from that?\u2022 Line of the night, from Nikki after Ray sadly notes that he\u2019s never killed anyone before: \u201cMe, neither. Life\u2019s a journey.\u201d Winstead\u2019s nonchalance sells it.\u2022 Three \u201cBig Lebowski\u201d references: 1. Gloria and her son meeting with the director of a funeral parlor over her stepfather\u2019s remains. The conversation leads to a discreet mention of choosing \u201cthe vessel\u201d of choice. 2. Ray\u2019s shoes don\u2019t match because errant parolee urine tests have ruined their pairs. His use of the word \u201cmicturated\u201d recalls the Big Lebowski\u2019s huffy response to the Dude\u2019s complaints about men peeing on his rug. 3. Sy smashing Ray\u2019s car repeatedly with the Hummer continues a running joke similar to the Dude\u2019s car\u2019s getting smashed to bits in \u201cThe Big Lebowski.\u201d Expect Ray\u2019s Corvette to live to fight another day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Art and Bacchanalia on the Met Roof", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported bySome people think of the roof garden at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, with its great views of Central Park, as but a backdrop for boozy summer date nights.Upon winning the coveted rooftop commission \u2014 open to the public starting April 14 and closing Oct. 29 \u2014 the artist embraced the sociability of the space, which attracted half a million visitors last year. In fact, he upped the ante by morphing treasures from the Met\u2019s own collection into a tableau of Bacchanalian mayhem.Last autumn, he began roaming the two-million-square-foot museum and was struck by \u201cthe way things are part of people\u2019s daily life and how museology, in its freezing operation, takes things out of that ordinary existence they shared with humans.\u201d The Met\u2019s collection of objects from around the world that were once functional \u2014 whether for eating, drinking, fighting or ceremonial rituals \u2014 now are preserved eternally behind \u201cglass, shelves, protection, security systems, fences, guardians, all kinds of devices,\u201d he lamented, which strips them of life, and of each object\u2019s natural trajectory of reuse, recycling, regeneration.\u201cIn some way or another, I wanted to play with the doodles of culture,\u201d Mr. Villar Rojas mused about his project, called \u201cThe Theater of Disappearance,\u201d adding that he hoped to rejuvenate the collection, and \u201cbring these objects back to life.\u201dRevelers in the rooftop garden this spring and summer will be in good company: 16 sculptures by Mr. Rojas that merge hundreds of replicas of valued objects that he cherry-picked from across 17 of the Met\u2019s curatorial departments, along with life-size models of human figures, with many of the artworks strewn across overladen banquet tables.The resulting mash-up is a whorl of jutting, twisting, cradling, writhing, hoisting movement. There is even kissing.Mr. Villar Rojas said he wanted to break through what he sees as falsely constructed categories within the museum. \u201cI worked under the ontological premise of imagining a museum without divisions, without geopolitics, totally horizontal,\u201d he said.(Finding the original treasures in the galleries beneath that roof would be a rewarding scavenger hunt.)The rejuvenation includes a complete redo of the roof garden \u2014 which celebrates 30 years this spring. \u201cEvery single angle and experience, he has considered \u2014 nothing has escaped him,\u201d said Beatrice Galilee, the Met curator who organized the project with her boss, Sheena Wagstaff, head of the museum\u2019s contemporary and modern art department. The artist worked with Met staff to redesign the pergola, landscaping and seating areas as well as the bar and its menu so his commission would cohere and foster the social and romantic life of the place.It\u2019s a delight to hear the artist, prolific and successful at 37, talk so much about life, because for a long time, a deep anxiety and a preoccupation with death has pervaded his practice, which he described as \u201ca little bit suicidal.\u201d (One example: a 2015 show at Marian Goodman Gallery where the floor was fossilized with the detritus of contemporary civilization: sneakers, glass, plastic bags, an iPod.)In conversations in person, by Skype and by email over the last 18 months, he revealed that destruction, deterioration and decomposition were \u201cimportant axes\u201d of his practice.He can look the part, too, with his gaunt and lanky frame. Sometimes \u2014 the way he pulls his hoodie up to cover his face or curls his long fingers around every cigarette as if it were his last and then sucks in the smoke almost audibly \u2014 you half expect him to be carrying around a scythe.But Mr. Villar Rojas also has a warm and fragile quality. He wears his dark hair in a long bob, or rubber-banded back into a ponytail. His Google icon is Thumper, the floppy-eared hop-along rabbit from the 1942 film \u201cBambi.\u201dHis explorations, from prehistory through post-apocalyptic ruin, resonate at many levels. \u201cAdri\u00e1n\u2019s work allows the visitor to wander through the history of humankind,\u201d said Rudolf Sagmeister, who is a curator of the artist\u2019s exhibition in Bregenz. \u201cFor me it creates a mixture of these unconscious images, feelings, objects and spaces that may exist already, and yet he always creates something new within and from them.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going for a close shave,\u201d their colleague Scott Geffert laughed. \u201cBut not too close.\u201dThe men crouched over a laptop to scrutinize the data from the laser. \u201cHow about his sleeve \u2014 are we good?\u201d\u201cHmm, I think there\u2019s a hole there.\u201d\u201cO.K., yeah, I got it.\u201dAll told, the project would necessitate billions of laser measurements and photographs.The artist\u2019s studio team and Met staff members also had found a special effects company in Dallas that could scan humans at a resolution high enough to generate, as Ms. Galilee put it, \u201cpeople-size people\u201d whose figures would animate Mr. Villar Rojas\u2019s sculptures.In mid-January, a colossal mobile photo studio that was kitted out with 130 cameras had traveled from Texas to New Jersey. A dozen people, mostly friends and family, served as models, even the artist. (On the rooftop, Mr. Villar Rojas\u2019s arms emerge outstretched from one sculpture, one hand making what various cultures call the sign of the horns or the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll sign).Over the course of many weeks, Mr. Villar Rojas manipulated and merged hundreds of 3-D images to allow the human figures to hold, wear, sit upon or engage realistically with the replicas of the Met objects. Once the artist had 3-D renderings for 16 cohesive sculptures, the smaller objects \u2014 horns, plates, coins \u2014 were reborn through 3-D printing.Larger elements \u2014 tombs, armor and human forms \u2014 were replicated via a computer-controlled milling process that chisels shapes from a block of rigid polyurethane foam.All the figures and objects were conjoined by \u201ca series of armatures, spines, pins and dowels made of steel or wood,\u201d Mr. Lash explained, made to look seamless before ultimately being covered with a customized paint dust, to suggest that Mr. Villar Rojas\u2019s brand-new artworks were relics of antiquity. (When you see the works in person, it\u2019s tempting to lick your finger and give them a little flick. Don\u2019t. It\u2019s still the Met.)Mr. Villar Rojas will likely find all this description of his art-making \u201cfetishistic,\u201d one of his favorite words. He is fond of saying that it does not matter what materials or techniques he uses: Days ago, he referred to his artwork in excretory terms. Plus, he likes to leave things unexplained.But a few days before the completion of his commission, with the trees of Central Park just below beginning to bud, he admitted that the dark anxiety that drove him several years ago, \u201cdoesn\u2019t play any role now.\u201dMaybe these days, for him, the end is not so near.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Persuasive Business Leaders Parade Through White House", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a meeting at the White House with business leaders two weeks into his presidency, Donald J. Trump turned to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase.Aren\u2019t the Chinese manipulating their currency? Mr. Trump asked, according to two people who were there.\u201cNo, Mr. President, they\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Dimon replied. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to be responsible.\u201dOthers at the meeting, including the former Boeing chief W. James McNerney, agreed. Their advice echoed arguments by members of Mr. Trump\u2019s staff and cabinet that he should abandon his campaign pledge to punish China over its currency.Mr. Trump was listening. Two months later, facing a strengthened United States dollar and the need for Chinese support against a pugilistic North Korea, he reversed his position.The meeting with Mr. Dimon and other corporate executives was just one of dozens of sessions Mr. Trump has convened with top businesspeople since becoming president. Nearly 300 executives have visited the White House this year, according to a New York Times tabulation, an open-door policy that is a sharp break with the Obama administration and puts corporate chieftains on par with senior lawmakers in the pecking order of who has influence in Washington.Frank and occasionally confrontational, the conversations have become a defining feature of Mr. Trump\u2019s young presidency, inspiring policy debates and in some instances 180-degree shifts by the president, according to White House officials and executives who have participated in the discussions.And while some Democrats and other critics complain business leaders are being granted unfettered access to Mr. Trump \u2014 who ran as a businessman planning to apply executive principles to Washington\u2019s problems \u2014 the White House is unapologetic. The relationship-building is acting as a welcome substitute for a lack of legislative accomplishments, and presidential aides suggest the rapport positions Mr. Trump for future success.\u201cThe whole idea is, do something with all of this communication and feedback,\u201d said Chris Liddell, the president\u2019s assistant for strategic initiatives and a former chief financial officer at Microsoft and General Motors. \u201cAnd some of that happened in the first hundred days, but we\u2019re really setting ourselves up for the next thousand days.\u201dMany executives said that they were rarely given face time with President Barack Obama, and that even when they were, they sensed he wasn\u2019t fully engaged. \u201cThe feedback from the Obama White House was, \u2018We\u2019ll listen to what you have to say, but we know what we\u2019re doing,\u2019\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group.The parade of chief executives has included familiar Republican faces, like Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone and Jack Welch, the former chairman and chief executive of General Electric.But it has also included Democrats. Larry Fink, the chief of BlackRock, was a potential Treasury secretary had Hillary Clinton won the presidency; on Friday, he blasted the administration\u2019s approach to immigration and cast doubt on the economic models underpinning its proposed tax cuts, saying, \u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty due to the new administration.\u201dEric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, was a Clinton supporter who predicted in January that Mr. Trump would do \u201cevil things\u201d as president. And Charles Phillips, chief executive of the software company Infor, sat on Mr. Obama\u2019s Economic Recovery Advisory Board.\u201cAs he\u2019s shaping his view, he is kind of learning a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Phillips said of Mr. Trump. \u201cSo this is a good time, in this first six months, to go in there.\u201dAlcoa\u2019s chief executive, Roy Harvey, experienced that firsthand on Thursday, as he watched Mr. Trump sign a memorandum directing the Commerce Department to investigate the effects of aluminum imports on national security.\u201cWe appreciate the support of the administration to try to make a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Harvey said.Mr. Trump\u2019s dialogue with business leaders has at times been freewheeling, and at times focused on topics that were first dissected in small sessions with staff or cabinet members. At the gatherings, some executives, who have been cowed by the president\u2019s itchy Twitter finger and tendency to take quick offense to perceived slights, have found Mr. Trump open to disagreement.At the meeting when the Chinese currency was discussed, Elon Musk, the South African-born chief of Tesla and SpaceX, attacked a newly signed executive order banning travel and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Not only did Mr. Trump welcome the criticism, said the people who were present, he calmly defended his position, noting that public-opinion polls supported his viewpoint before sharing the floor with John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary.Some business leaders have parlayed their White House access into support for specific causes. In a TED talk on Friday, Mr. Musk said, \u201cI\u2019ve used the meetings I\u2019ve had to argue in favor of immigration and climate change,\u201d according to a Twitter post published by the organization. Mr. Schwarzman of Blackstone encouraged Mr. Trump to soften his hard-line stance on deporting so-called Dreamers \u2014 the young, undocumented foreigners living in the United States.\u201cBecause of these conversations, it really became a significant focus of the administration,\u201d said Reed Cordish, assistant to the president for intergovernmental and technology initiatives.Executives are hoping the White House will support putting federal education grants toward skills-training programs rather than just traditional college. So far, however, the administration hasn\u2019t taken a public stance on the legislative efforts to do so.Mr. Trump\u2019s unofficial business cabinet was handpicked, in many cases, by influential companies and trade associations. On the president\u2019s first full weekday in office, he welcomed a dozen industrial executives who had been convened by Andrew Liveris, head of the Dow Chemical Company. A senior staff member at the Retail Industry Leaders Association put together a panel of executives drawn from her group\u2019s ranks.Mr. Schwarzman recruited a range of business leaders, economists and policy experts for the president\u2019s strategic and policy forum, which regularly meets at the White House and has emerged as the most elite outside counsel.To be invited to the policy forum, there were a few criteria, according to someone who was briefed on the selection process: Be an expert in your field who is respected by Mr. Schwarzman, be a United States citizen and don\u2019t be vetoed by Mr. Trump.The task of dealing day to day with the chief executives falls largely to Mr. Liddell, a New Zealander by birth, and Mr. Cordish, a Baltimore real estate scion, who share a cramped office in the West Wing. It is decorated with a laminated United States map and a full-page ad, ripped from The Wall Street Journal, that thanks Mr. Trump for agreeing to reconsider fuel-economy standards. It was purchased by auto trade groups.During a recent interview, Mr. Liddell and Mr. Cordish were upbeat. Since the White House \u201clistening groups\u201d began, Mr. Cordish said, they\u2019ve been barraged with ideas from executives and trade groups for deregulation, job creation and the streamlining of services.In a meeting in early April, a group of 50 or so chief executives involved with the Partnership for New York City proposed adding public housing to Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure initiative. The idea was recirculated at another trade group meeting about a week later, suggesting that the White House was seriously considering it.Some of the infrastructure changes under consideration would improve the government\u2019s own inner workings, including at the White House itself. \u201cA lot of technology here is 20 years out of date,\u201d Mr. Liddell said.But even with all the access, some chief executives are frustrated with what they describe as well-intentioned but so far fruitless talk \u2014 and a public environment that can be leery of any cooperation with the Trump administration.Robert Hoopes, a consultant who advises nonprofit groups and large companies and has done work for prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said executives were making a careful calculation when they traveled to Pennsylvania Avenue. If the topic for discussion is core to your business, Mr. Hoopes said, \u201cyou want to be a part of that conversation.\u201d But if the session is peripheral or unrelated to your business, he said, the \u201crisk calibration\u201d is very different.Two dozen trade-group officials and chief executives, some of them suggested as potential interview subjects by the White House, either refused to speak for this article or didn\u2019t respond to messages. Others declined to be quoted on the record, citing the toxic environment and the potential fallout among the public and their own employees for being regarded as an ally of Mr. Trump.\u201cUsually, when a campaign is over, things settle down and people feel they can work with the president without having a backlash,\u201d Ms. Wylde of the Partnership for New York City said. \u201cIn this case, there continue to be divisive forces that don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d C.E.O.s, she said, \u201cfeel pressure from all sides.\u201dLandon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting from Chicago.

{"Headline": "Trump Rides a Market Wave, but Business Looks for Results", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byThe investor enthusiasm that began with President Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in November has burst out anew on Wall Street, even as Washington remains gridlocked and evidence of any real pickup in the economy is scarce.Stocks have surged 5 percent since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. And that is on top of the 6 percent rally that followed his win in November.The cause for bullishness on Tuesday was Mr. Trump\u2019s new call to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent \u2014 deficits, perhaps, be damned.\u201cC.E.O.s are pragmatists,\u201d said Bill George, a Harvard Business School professor who formerly ran Medtronic, the giant medical-device maker. \u201cIf you cut my taxes and ease up on regulations, then I will like you. The bigger question is, can he get anything done?\u201dThe market impact of the Trump presidency is based so far on prospects \u2014 with details and congressional dynamics left to be sorted out \u2014 rather than accomplishments.But plenty of other factors are providing a tailwind for traders, including unexpectedly strong earnings reports from blue-chip companies like Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s and the receding chances that French voters will turn their backs on Europe.Technology giants like Apple, Facebook and Amazon have shown robust growth, lifting the Nasdaq index past 6,000 for the first time on Tuesday, a 26 percent gain from a year ago.Blair Effron, a founder of Centerview Partners, a prominent independent investment bank on Wall Street, said he believed that beyond any immediate policy shift in Washington, investors had taken their cue from signs of healthier growth globally.\u201cEurope and emerging markets are doing better,\u201d Mr. Effron said, \u201cand there is an underpinning of global stability and growth that are having much more of an impact than people think.\u201dNot all the signals domestically are coming in strong, however. The government\u2019s initial report on the economy\u2019s first-quarter performance is due Friday, and it is expected to be weak.And even if Mr. Trump manages to get Congress to pass a tax overhaul, and corporate profits then boom, that will not necessarily translate into better overall economic performance, warned Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago.\u201cWe have to distinguish between pro-profit and pro-growth policies,\u201d she said. \u201cA pro-profit approach increases the share of the pie going to corporate earnings and shareholders. Pro-growth policies increase the size of the pie.\u201dSo far, Ms. Swonk said, the Trump administration seems to favor the former. And while Wall Street will always reward rising corporate profits with higher share prices in the short term, the country\u2019s long-term prospects will be undermined if that trend is not accompanied by policies that lead to faster economic growth.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to cut taxes, but reform is harder,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about closing loopholes than reducing rates because if you just go to 15 percent, you\u2019re going to leave a large hole in the federal budget.\u201dWhile the prospects for a tax overhaul are murky on Capitol Hill, especially in light of the failure of House Republicans in March to agree on a replacement for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, executives say they are encouraged by the business-friendly stance of the White House.Bruce Van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, said he was initially concerned by Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements on trade and immigration when he took office in January.\u201cI feel better because in the first 100 days, the president\u2019s tone on those issues has moderated,\u201d Mr. Van Saun said.At the same time, executive actions, like requiring government agencies to roll back two existing regulations for every new one, have also played well with business leaders, especially in the financial services industry.\u201cThat\u2019s caused some of the regulatory apparatus to pause and appreciate there is a new sheriff in town and the rules of the game are changing,\u201d said Mr. Van Saun, who took over at Citizens, a regional banking chain based in Rhode Island, after more than two decades on Wall Street.What is more, Mr. Van Saun added, \u201cthe commitment to the positive elements of the platform \u2014 lower taxes, less regulation and pro-energy policies \u2014 continues to be there.\u201dEnergy industry executives are hoping that Mr. Trump will deliver on his promises to reduce regulation in their sector and open up new areas for drilling and development.\u201cIf you watch what he does as opposed to the noise around him, so far so good,\u201d said Charif Souki, chairman of Houston-based Tellurian and a leading industry spokesman for increasing natural gas exports from the United States.Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major oil and gas independent, echoed Mr. Souki\u2019s cautiously optimistic assessment of President Trump.\u201cI think generally he\u2019s doing well,\u201d Mr. Sheffield said. \u201cI think the Republicans have to get together and get something done.\u201dTo be sure, Mr. Trump has spent more time listening to business leaders in the first few months of his presidency than actually delivering on what they want.\u201cIn the first 100 days of his presidency, Trump has given more attention to C.E.O.s than Obama did in eight years,\u201d said Mr. George, who is not a supporter of Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat he does is a whole different story. But they do feel like he\u2019s listening, and there\u2019s a lot of ego gratification in having the president listen to you.\u201dIf the president cannot deliver, or the economy fails to pick up speed, investors may be setting themselves up for a fall, warned Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank.A look at the business backgrounds of Trump administration appointees and advisers.\u201cExpectations for the future are wild,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cThere is quite a disconnect between what the data suggests and where the stock market is trading.\u201dStill, even if it looks frothy, the euphoria is not approaching tech-bubble levels circa 2000.\u201cIn 2000, the price-to-earnings ratio for Nasdaq was 170; today it is trading at 26 times,\u201d Charlie Bilello, the director of research at the investment advisory firm Pension Partners, said, referring to a common gauge for measuring stock valuations. \u201cThat is not cheap, but it\u2019s not crazy. We are definitely not at the level where the average guy quits his job to trade stocks.\u201dThat may be true, but there is no doubt that the explosion in the market value of these companies has taken many investment professionals by surprise, even if most investors agree that their corporate fundamentals are solid.With the rollback of the health care law put off and big infrastructure spending plans still up in the air, bulls and bears alike on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms will be focused on the prospects for a tax overhaul in the coming months.But within the business community itself, there are sharp differences between industries that stand to gain and those that stand to lose as the tax code is redrawn.A low overall corporate tax rate would be great but would not be worth giving up provisions like the mortgage interest deduction or homeowners\u2019 ability to write off state and local taxes, said William E. Brown, the president of the National Association of Realtors.At the same time, smaller manufacturers and others worry that they might still be subject to a nearly 40 percent rate even if larger corporations use their political clout to guarantee a hefty cut.Suku V. Radia, the chief executive of Bankers Trust, Iowa\u2019s largest independently owned bank, said he was eager to learn more details, like the impact of a major tax cut on the budget deficit.\u201cIt is obviously a significant drop from where we are currently, and I\u2019d like to at least be able to better understand what do we do to make up for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the loss of revenues going to be, and how are we trying to fill the gap?\u201dWhatever details come out of the White House, getting a tax bill passed will be anything but easy.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is such a thing as \u2018tax simplification,\u2019\u201d Mr. Radia said. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently complicated.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But legal scholars question whether the change will be effective.\u201cAssuming a successful suit, Waymo could get damages for the period AL was involved,\u201d Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said in an email, referring to Mr. Levandowski. \u201cIf the purloined documents are still accessible to, and can be implemented by, the rest of the team, his recusal makes no difference.\u201dWith the change in role, Eric Meyhofer, a principal at Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Group in Pittsburgh, will lead the driverless car division and report directly to Uber\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick. Mr. Levandowski, who had reported to Mr. Kalanick, will report to Mr. Meyhofer. Mr. Levandowski remains in charge of handling testing and operations of Uber\u2019s self-driving vehicle group in cities.At the heart of Waymo\u2019s case is the technology involved in Uber\u2019s lidar. Mr. Levandowski, a pioneer in the field of self-driving research, worked for Google\u2019s autonomous vehicle wing for nearly a decade, but left to form his own start-up, Otto, at the beginning of 2016. He sold that start-up to Uber in August for $680 million.At stake is what many technologists consider to be the intersection of the next wave of computing, artificial intelligence and an entirely new category of transportation. Mr. Kalanick has said the race for self-driving technology is \u201cexistential\u201d to Uber\u2019s future, looking ahead to a day when smart driverless vehicles can move millions of people around as quickly and efficiently as possible.Advertisement"}

It seems difficult to shield people from fake facts if some desperately want to believe them, whether or not they\u2019re actually true.I\u2019m a bit biased here because I worked for Walt at AllThingsD and Recode, two tech-focused web publications that he co-founded after leaving a long career at The Wall Street Journal. He was a great boss and mentor, and very generous with his time, especially with young reporters.Eventually, the industry had to change to meet the future that he saw coming. Computers were indeed personal objects, as the cost came down and people brought more of them into their homes \u2014 desktops, laptops, set-top boxes and the like. Soon, computers would rest in the palm of our hands in the form of a phone, and now they\u2019re basically extensions of our bodies.Hey, since you\u2019re a columnist too, what has it been like for you to watch the evolution of personal technology over the years?To me the most amazing thing about Walt is how early he identified computers as a mainstream phenomenon. In the 1980s and 1990s lots of people were writing about tech, but Walt was among the first to understand that this strange new class of nerds would completely change the world, and that they would do so in a way that would affect ordinary people who did not consider themselves techies. In that way he was no less prescient than Steve Jobs and Bill Gates \u2014 who, of course, both came to recognize Walt\u2019s importance as a proponent of the industry\u2019s possibilities.So, my hat\u2019s off to Walt.

Last fall, he went on the hunt for an information technology job in New York \u2014 and an apartment, too.He had heard of a few neighborhoods, including Williamsburg in Brooklyn, which appealed because of the food scene. A friend who\u2019s a chef gushed about it.Mr. Buchanan, 26, had a budget of up to $3,000 a month. He needed little space \u2013 a one-bedroom or studio would do.When he followed up on listings, he was often met with silence. He estimated that just 40 percent of the agents he contacted got back to him.On several trips to the city, \u201cI did a lot of walking around Brooklyn,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea where I was.\u201d Technology notwithstanding, it was easy to get lost.\u201cThere are bugs in Google maps,\u201d he said. \u201cI would set a destination, and it would be the same building number but not the street I was looking for.\u201dBesides, Williamsburg was changing so rapidly that street pictures were quickly outdated.Mr. Machado, however, offered to line up some similar options.By now, Mr. Buchanan knew that a one-bedroom was unnecessary. In his Arlington apartment, which rented for $2,100, \u201cI was always in my bedroom,\u201d he said. \u201cI would never go out to my living room.\u201d He knew that New Yorkers managed in one-bedrooms with spouses and children. \u201cI see other people \u2014 all I need is a studio.\u201dSo he declined a $3,000 one-bedroom for rent in a small, boutique condominium with no amenities.So a J/M/Z commuter would not face a change in route, Mr. Machado said, except for a more crowded station.Mr. Buchanan picked a studio with a great city view. Having heard horror stories about renting, he came prepared. \u201cWhen I was asking about documentation, he started pulling things out of his backpack,\u201d Mr. Machado said. By the time Mr. Buchanan signed the lease, for $2,765 a month, he had landed a job in the Financial district.The building came with one-month-free rent on a 12-month lease and carried no broker fee.Mr. Buchanan finds the neighborhood somewhat remote, with an odd mixture of new buildings and abandoned ones.\u201cThe food scene is awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s tons of restaurants, but as far as needing to go out and get some groceries, that is still a challenge. There\u2019s always delivery service, but I am the kind of person who likes to go out and get his stuff. Sometimes bodegas don\u2019t have everything you need. At least, the ones near me don\u2019t.\u201dExcept for some new-building glitches like finicky heat, he is happy in his home. His solicitous building staff \u201cis unheard-of in D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the cherry on top.\u201dThe Hunt column last Sunday, about the search for a rental apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, by Kenneth Buchanan, an information technology specialist, misidentified the bridge that is near one of the rental buildings he looked at, the Ice Cream Factory.

On Tuesday, the company was to announce the next phase of testing: putting ordinary people inside its Chrysler minivans and Lexuses.Those accepted into the program, which has already begun quietly operating, will summon a car with an app and then go about their business. They will be encouraged to use the vehicles to go anywhere they would normally go at any hour \u2014 the office, the movies, the supermarket, even a late-night search for ice cream.Waymo is not charging those involved in the trial. It says it is casting a broad net for all types of people in an effort to accumulate reams of data about how driverless cars will be used in practice and not just in theory.\u201cWe\u2019ve given 10,000 rides internally, but if you\u2019re just providing experiences to folks inside the company, you\u2019re missing the broader range of diversity,\u201d John Krafcik, Waymo\u2019s chief executive, said.Only those who live in Chandler, Mesa, Tempe and Gilbert \u2014 roughly the southeastern Phoenix area \u2014 will be eligible for the program. And the cars, for that matter, will not take them anywhere else \u2014 no weekend jaunts to the Grand Canyon.Waymo, which has cautiously expanded the testing of its autonomous vehicles, did not give a specific number of people it hopes to enroll in the program beyond saying it would be in the hundreds. The company is adding 500 specially outfitted Chrysler minivans to its self-driving fleet, up from 100 now. Many of the minivans are destined for Phoenix.Self-driving cars have evolved rapidly, with plenty of accompanying drama, but there are many miles to go. All the Waymo cars will have a technician who can take control in an emergency.Waymo is also doing testing in the San Francisco Bay Area, near Seattle and in Austin. It has been working closely with Fiat Chrysler, leading to speculation they will jointly form a ride-hailing service that will compete directly with Uber. \u201cWe\u2019re not about building better cars; we\u2019re about building better drivers,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said.It is not clear if the arbitration was settled. Uber is arguing that the Waymo suit should also be decided in arbitration because the claims stem from Mr. Levandowski\u2019s time at Google and are covered by an arbitration clause in his employment contract.Advertisement"}

Since its premiere, \u201cAn Occupation of Loss\u201d has taken on an added resonance. As a means of getting the mourners \u2014 who hailed from countries like Cambodia, China and Ghana, among other places \u2014 into the States for the performance, Simon filed petitions with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services seeking P-3 visas (for people designated \u201cculturally unique\u201d) and meticulously documented the application process. (Selections of the forms were made available as viewers exited the installation.)There is still a question as to whether \u201cAn Occupation of Loss,\u201d which opened in New York last September, would have even been possible in the same setting just six months later, given the changing state of immigration in this country. \u201cIn making \u2018An Occupation of Loss,\u2019\u201d Simon wrote in an email, \u201cmultiple people worked for over a year to secure entry to the United States for the performers. In addition to a mountain of evidence and paperwork, each artist had a personal recommendation letter from a senator and house representative. Despite all that, we still had a number of groups that were denied entry. In those denials, the U.S. government took on an active role in curating the work. In looking back, I often think it was my last chance to realize this work, in that form, within American borders. Given all that\u2019s transpired since January it\u2019s possible the sculpture would have been empty today.\u201dMore than just a retroactive critique of policy, Simon\u2019s transparency in planning \u201cAn Occupation of Loss\u201d grounds its more unknowable precepts. The piece examines how different people cope with the transition from life to death, from having a home to being displaced, but casts these questions in a more everyday understanding by focusing on seemingly insignificant banalities like paperwork and bureaucracy. As states one of the \u201cexpert letters\u201d required for a Chinese mourner to obtain a visa to enter America: \u201cThe funeral ritual creates a bond between inside and outside, society and nature\u2026 Thus, people\u2019s lives cross the boundaries between inside and outside, and life continues an unbroken succession.\u201d The work is chiefly about loss, but its message is that life goes on. In T\u2019s second virtual-reality film, \u201cThe Creators: Taryn Simon,\u201d the artist walks the viewer through the New York installation. \u2014 M.H. MILLERAdvertisement"}

For some, it has even prompted something more drastic: a career change.In the last few months, professionals across the country have decided to leave conventional jobs and get involved in politics or activism.\u201cIt feels like we are in this existential crisis of democracy,\u201d said Matt Ewing, who abandoned a career at SolarCity to join Swing Left, a group hoping to get out the vote in competitive congressional districts in 2018. \u201cGoing back to work in my comfortable corporate job didn\u2019t make sense anymore.\u201dHere are a half-dozen Americans \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 describing how the election has changed the arc of their careers.Before the election, Ms. Butler said, the closest she got to politics was when she baked sweets for a\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0rally hosted by the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. But after the election, a creeping sense of dread set in.\u201cThere I was teaching people how to make gluten-free cookies,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it seemed so petty and meaningless when all of this was happening.\u201dMs. Butler found an outlet a few weeks later, when she saw a Facebook post from a friend, Bob Bland, a fashion entrepreneur. Ms. Bland was helping to organize the Women\u2019s March on Washington, and Ms. Butler volunteered to help.In the weeks that followed, Ms. Butler became an integral part of a team putting together the Women\u2019s March events, and is now winding down her baking business to continue working with Ms. Bland and the other organizers full time.\u201cI\u2019m making a transition from pastry chef to activist,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of history now.\u201dAs a successful entrepreneur, Mr. Abroms mostly stayed away from politics. He trained as a public accountant, then started a company that converted vehicles to run on natural gas.Mr. Abroms supported Senator Marco Rubio in the primaries and ultimately voted for Evan McMullin, an independent, in the election.He is financing his run with $250,000 of his own money and says he is committed to staying involved in politics, even if he doesn\u2019t win Mr. Price\u2019s old seat.\u201cI enjoy business,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this country is in such crisis that I couldn\u2019t just sit on the sidelines. I needed to participate.\u201dAs a student at Rutgers University, Mr. Hansen majored in American studies and volunteered for various community organizations. But after graduating, he was drawn to the tech scene and learned how to code.By last year, he worked for Shotput, a supply chain logistics start-up based in Oakland, Calif. Backed by the hit-making incubator Y Combinator, Shotput offered Mr. Hansen a good salary and access to the Silicon Valley elite.But\u00a0the election rekindled his latent passion for civic engagement. He quit Shotput and decided to devote himself to repairing the country\u2019s frayed social fabric.\u201cThis election was a reaction to people not being heard,\u201d Mr. Hansen said. \u201cA lot of that is the failure of state, local and federal governments to communicate with people.\u201dMr. Hansen, who walked away from a nearly six-figure job to develop Hey Mayor, has not yet figured out how to pay himself. \u201cMy programming friends are still making fun of me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think I\u2019m insane.\u201dHis parents, too, have their doubts. \u201cThey\u2019re constantly telling me to get a job at Johnson & Johnson,\u201d he said.Mr. Polisner worked at the software company Oracle for decades, moving up to manage cloud computing accounts, and eventually earning about $200,000 a year.He had always dabbled in liberal politics, organizing\u00a0fund-raisers\u00a0for local Democrats, but that was about it.\u201cI am not with President-elect Trump and I am not here to help him in any way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTherefore I must resign from this once-great company.\u201dInitially, Mr. Polisner didn\u2019t know what he was going to do next. He figured he would apply for a job at Google or Salesforce.\u201cPeople are getting frustrated with petitions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to provide the opportunity take lightweight actions to heavyweight actions.\u201dMr. Polisner\u2019s children are grown, and he and his wife have decided to curtail their expenses while he builds Civic Works.\u201cFormer paydays are now days of mourning at my house,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would rather do something of high value to society and earn less money than I would have my soul purchased every two weeks with a big check.\u201dAs an editor at The Wall Street Journal last year, Mr. Carney watched admiringly as upstart media outlets, including Breitbart, the conservative website previously controlled by Steve Bannon, a Trump adviser,\u00a0channeled\u00a0the energy behind Mr. Trump\u2019s political rise.\u201cBreitbart was one of the few places that seemed to understand the pulse of the nation and the direction we were going better than much larger news organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saw what was going to happen more clearly than everyone else.\u201dIn the aftermath of the election, Mr. Carney decided that he should do more than simply read Breitbart; he should work there. In January, he left The Journal and joined Breitbart to lead a new finance and economics section.Mr. Carney said he didn\u2019t believe Breitbart was an inherently pro-Trump publication. \u201cThey\u2019re standing by him so long as he stands by the center-right populism and nationalism that got him elected,\u201d he said.But Mr. Carney, a Republican, was solidly in Mr. Trump\u2019s camp through the election, voting for him during the primaries and in the general election. \u201cIt was the first time I voted in this century,\u201d he said.This isn\u2019t Mr. Carney\u2019s first foray into the political arena. He worked for\u00a0Pat Buchanan\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996, and saw echoes of Mr. Buchanan\u2019s populism in Mr. Trump.Mr. Carney\u2019s last day at The Journal was Jan. 20, the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated.After graduating from the University of Oxford, Mr. Torricke-Barton immigrated to the United States and secured a series of influential jobs.He wrote speeches for executives at Google, became Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s speechwriter at Facebook, then joined as head of communications SpaceX, the private rocket company founded by Elon Musk.Over the years, Mr. Torricke-Barton had never been very political. But last year, he watched in dismay as Britons voted to leave the European Union. His shock doubled after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.\u201cI couldn\u2019t see myself sitting on the sidelines with a straight face while this is going on,\u201d he said.Soon after, he helped organize a rally to protest the White House\u2019s first immigration ban, drawing thousands of people to San Francisco City Hall. Now he is turning Onwards into a nonprofit organization focused on rebuilding trust in government.\u201cWe need to get more citizens more engaged with these institutions,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Tech Investment Flying Under the Radar, Pentagon Warns", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byThere are few restrictions on investing in American start-ups that focus on artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robotics, the report contends, and China has taken advantage. Beijing, the report says, is encouraging its companies to invest for the purpose of pushing the country ahead in its strategic competition with the United States.In some instances, Chinese companies have made under-the-radar investments intended to dodge the oversight of a government agency, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as Cfius.\u201cIf we allow China access to these same technologies concurrently, then not only may we lose our technological superiority, but we may even be facilitating China\u2019s technological superiority,\u201d the report says.The report found that increasingly sophisticated commercial technology had blurred the lines between what was available to military consumers and civilian ones. Often start-ups and leading internet companies like Facebook and Google are working on products as sophisticated as anything the military has at its disposal.\u201cFor example, V.R. for gaming is at a similar level of sophistication as the V.R. used in simulators for our armed forces,\u201d the report said, referring to virtual reality. \u201cFacial recognition and image detection for social networking and online shopping has real application in tracking terrorists or other threats to national security,\u201d the report continued, which added that much of the autonomous vehicle and drone technology of today was developed using grants from the Pentagon.Last summer, the company received a $150 million joint investment from Ford and the Chinese internet giant Baidu. Baidu declined to comment on the investment.A Velodyne spokeswoman said the round represented its first outside investment.\u201cThe company obtained all necessary government clearances relating to the investment as part of the funding process,\u201d the spokeswoman wrote in an email. \u201cNotably, the investments were designed to make advanced LiDAR sensors more accessible to the broader industry, resulting in the development of safer, less expensive autonomous vehicles.\u201dAshton B. Carter, the former secretary of defense, commissioned the report as an urgent review of what senior Pentagon officials have considered China\u2019s alarming penetration of Silicon Valley, particularly in deals that finance nascent technology that has military applications.The report found that American private industry was mostly unaware of Beijing\u2019s efforts \u2014 many of the deals involve relatively small amounts of money \u2014 and that Washington did not have a strong understanding of the scale of the issue.\u201cThe U.S. government does not have a holistic view of how fast this technology transfer is occurring, the level of Chinese investment in U.S. technology, or what technologies we should be protecting,\u201d the report said.Michael A. Brown, the former chief executive of Symantec, led the study, called \u201cHow Chinese Investments in Emerging Technology Enable a Strategic Competitor to Access the Crown Jewels of U.S. Innovation.\u201d The New York Times reviewed a copy of the unclassified report.Mr. Carter declined to comment on the final document issued to cabinet officials last month.The report does not offer examples of American companies that have accepted Chinese investment and then found that their sensitive technologies were transferred to China.But it does take exception to tactics that it says Chinese funds have used to skirt government oversight. For example, it singles out Canyon Bridge, a venture capital firm that it says was formed to buy Lattice Semiconductor, an American microchip company. The firm has Chinese capital and American management expertise. The purpose of creating Canyon Bridge was to obscure the source of capital to \u201cenhance the possibility\u201d that the transaction would be approved by Cfius, the report said.Peter Kuo, a partner at Canyon Bridge, said that the there was never any intention to obscure the source of the fund\u2019s capital, as shown by meetings it had with Cfius before the deal was signed.Chinese investors plowed about $30 billion into early-stage technology through more than 1,000 funding deals between 2010 and 2016. During that time, participation from China rose to about 10 percent of total venture deals, with investment in crucial industries like artificial intelligence, robotics and augmented reality accelerating in 2016, according to the report.Among the investors identified in the report are well-known private firms and funds like Alibaba and Baidu. It also points to government-sponsored investors like Westlake Ventures, a fund in Redwood City, Calif., that is owned by the Hangzhou government, and ZGC Capital, an investor owned by 17 state-owned enterprises with an office in Santa Clara, Calif.The rising trend in venture capital investments has occurred alongside state-directed industrial espionage and online theft, which the American government has been unable to slow, the report says. In the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Silicon Valley field office, only 10 people are dedicated to counterespionage, and F.B.I. officials said in interviews for the report that it \u201chas very limited resources relative to the threat.\u201d\u201cThe scale of the espionage continues to increase,\u201d the authors say. \u201cDespite the rise in convictions, there is no way to know how big this problem really is.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how much money Chinese investors put into American early-stage technology between 2010 and 2016. It was $30 billion, not $620 billion.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "6 Things I Learned About Ulcers", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byHalfway through February, I could no longer sleep through the night. At 2 a.m., I\u2019d find myself chugging milk from the carton to extinguish a fire at the top of my rib cage. The gnawing feeling high in my stomach alternated with nausea so arresting I kept a bucket next to my laptop and considered taking a pregnancy test, even though I was 99 percent sure I wasn\u2019t expecting.The next day, my primary care doctor told me I probably had an ulcer, a raw spot or sore in the lining of the stomach or small intestine. Here are some of the things I learned about ulcers during the odyssey that followed.I got a blood test to see if I was infected with H. pylori; the test came back negative, so I didn\u2019t need antibiotics. Regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen or aspirin, can also lead to an ulcer, but I wasn\u2019t taking those medicines. My ulcer turned out to be \u201cidiopathic,\u201d which is a fancy way of saying that doctors have no idea why it happened.In the meantime, I needed to figure out how to get nourishment. But having an ulcer, I\u2019d learned, is like being a contestant on a twisted game show called \u201cWhat to Eat?\u201d. Choose poorly, and my stomach would burn like lava, leaving me listless. Choose wisely, and I\u2019d be rewarded with a momentary reprieve, until hunger struck again. Every few hours the \u201cgame\u201d would start over.Maddeningly, I wasn\u2019t sure which foods might be safe to eat until I tried them. For instance, why did a seemingly innocuous bag of salted peanuts lead to agony?The truth is gastroenterologists don\u2019t know why certain food causes indigestion and heartburn for patients with stomach ulcers. There are a few rules of the road: Avoid alcohol, or anything with caffeine or high in fat.Fatty foods \u201csit in the stomach for a long time and fester,\u201d said Lori Welstead, a registered dietitian who works at the digestive disease center at University of Chicago Medicine. Perhaps that was the trouble with peanuts?Dr. David Y. Graham, a past president of the American College of Gastroenterology, perhaps summed it up most succinctly, \u201cThere\u2019s a general rule: Don\u2019t eat what hurts you.\u201dUlcer patients must serve as their own guinea pigs, experimenting on their guts until they find sustenance that doesn\u2019t come with a side of discomfort for them. I didn\u2019t realize that until weeks after my diagnosis.\u201cYou\u2019re scared if you eat something what the consequences will be,\u201d she said, so she quit eating for two days. But the downside of hunger was nausea \u2014 and an empty stomach can be doubly painful.Without any food in there, the ulcer is bathed in stomach acid all the time, said Dr. David Greenwald, the director of clinical gastroenterology and endoscopy at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s a really common thing people report that when they have an ulcer, any food makes it transiently better.\u201d\u201cIf you want pain at nighttime, eat at bedtime,\u201d he said. That\u2019s because when you eat, your stomach makes a lot of acid to digest the food. But \u201conce the food is gone,\u201d he said, acid levels remain high. A result: You\u2019ll most likely be jolted awake by pain.This little rainbow chart became my bible. I cut out goat cheese, canned tuna, beef, pork and all nuts except almonds, which were rated as alkaline. My go-to meal became a whole avocado paired with a pound of strawberries.Sadly, it took a full week for this so-called health reporter to even ask whether my pH chart or any of the many other food charts online were backed by reputable research.Ms. Welstead, the Chicago-based dietitian, set me straight. \u201cThe pH of foods is not evidence-based for nutrition therapy or in the medical field,\u201d she said. \u201cStomach acid is so so acidic, the foods you\u2019re eating are not necessarily going to affect that stomach acid.\u201dThe bad news was I had fallen down a rabbit hole of misinformation. I felt a little better after talking to Laurie Keefer, a health psychologist who specializes in digestive diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who told me her patients with ulcers often feel \u201cout of control.\u201dDr. Keefer advised me not to amplify distress by \u201ctrying to control things that probably aren\u2019t going to move the needle on your symptoms.\u201d Like hokey pH charts.\u201cIf you have some discomfort from an ulcer, and on top of that you have anxiety and stress maybe over having the ulcer, your symptoms may actually be a little bit more pronounced,\u201d Dr. Greenwald said.In fact, \u201cthere is a growing adoption of behavioral health specialists in gastroenterology practices,\u201d Dr. Keefer said. \u201cWe actually call it psycho-gastroenterology.\u201dShe is embedded in the comprehensive gastrointestinal program at Mount Sinai, so after patients see a nutritionist for an ulcer or Crohn\u2019s disease or irritable bowel syndrome, they can stop in for a psychological consultation. \u201cIt\u2019s much less stigmatizing\u201d that way, she said.\u201cStress, anxiety and worry will only slow your recovery,\u201d Dr. Keefer said. \u201cStress is anything that requires the body to adapt. If you\u2019re spending resources on your stress, your body is not spending resources on recovery.\u201dIt took about five weeks for my ulcer to heal. So I suppose I could have a burrito loaded with hot sauce. But I\u2019m not fully over my fear. I still haven\u2019t forgiven a probiotic yogurt drink that set my stomach on fire in the first days after diagnosis. I\u2019m dead sure I never will.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Trump\u2019s Real-World Syria Lesson", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byWith each passing day our new president is discovering that every big problem he faces is like Obamacare \u2014 if there were a good, easy solution it would have been found already, and even the less good solutions are more than his own party is ready to pay for or the country is ready to tolerate.But on Tuesday, tragically, Trump got this lesson in foreign policy via a truly vile poison-gas attack on Syrian civilians, many of them children, reportedly perpetrated by the pro-Russian, pro-Iranian, murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad.President Trump came to office with the na\u00efve view that he could make fighting ISIS the centerpiece of his Middle East policy \u2014 and just drop more bombs and send more special forces than President Barack Obama did to prove his toughness. Trump also seemed to think that fighting ISIS would be a bridge to building a partnership with President Vladimir Putin of Russia.It was na\u00efve because ISIS does not exist in a vacuum \u2014 nor is it the only bad actor in the region. ISIS was produced as a Sunni Muslim reaction to massive overreach by Iran in Iraq, where Iranian-backed Shiite militias and the Iraqi government forces of Nouri al-Maliki tried to crush all vestiges of Sunni power in that country and make it a vassal of Iran. (If you think ISIS is sick, Google the phrase \u201cpower drills to the head and Shiite militias in Iraq\u201d and you will discover that ISIS did not invent depravity in that part of the world.)The Iranian/Shiite onslaught against Iraqi Sunnis ran parallel with Assad\u2019s Shiite-Alawite regime in Syria, turning what started out as a multisectarian democracy movement in Syria into a sectarian war between Sunnis and Shiites. Assad figured that if he just gunned down or poison-gassed enough Syrian Sunnis he could turn their democracy efforts into a sectarian struggle against his Shiite-Alawite regime \u2014 and presto, it worked.The opposition almost toppled him, but with the aid of Russia, Iran and Iran\u2019s Hezbollah militia, Assad was able to pummel the Syrian Sunnis into submission as well.ISIS was the deformed creature created by a pincers movement \u2014 Russia, Iran, Assad and Hezbollah in Syria on one flank and Iran and pro-Iranian militias in Iraq on the other. When Trump said he wanted to partner with Russia to crush ISIS, it was music to the ears of Assad, Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Like everyone else, they figured they could manipulate Trump\u2019s ignorance to their advantage.So, last week, someone named \u201cRex Tillerson\u201d (who, I am told, is the U.S. secretary of state) declared that the \u201clonger-term status of President Assad will be decided by the Syrian people\u201d \u2014 as if the Syrian people will be having an Iowa-like primary on that subject soon. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley made the same point even more cravenly, telling reporters that the United States\u2019 \u201cpriority is no longer to sit there and focus on getting Assad out.\u201dIs there any wonder that Assad felt no compunction about perpetrating what this paper described as \u201cone of the deadliest chemical weapons attacks in years in Syria,\u201d killing dozens of people in Idlib Province, the last major holdout for Syrian rebels.Mind you, Donald Trump did not cause this Syria problem, and he is right to complain that it was left in his lap by the Obama team, which had its own futile strategy for dealing with Syria \u2014 trying to negotiate with Russia and Iran, the key players there, without creating any leverage on the ground.But if you\u2019re looking for a culprit for why America has refused to intervene in Syria, you have to look both to your left and to your right.\u201cThe only obstacle to putting real U.S. military leverage into Syria is democracy in America,\u201d explained the foreign policy expert Michael Mandelbaum, author of \u201cMission Failure: America and the World in the Post-Cold War Era.\u201d \u201cThe American public simply does not want to spend the blood and treasure to produce what would probably be a less awful but still not good outcome in Syria.\u201d And that is a byproduct of the failed George W. Bush interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan.Alas, though, I now think doing nothing is a mistake. Just letting Assad keep trying to restore control over all of Syria will mean endless massacres. A negotiated power-sharing solution is impossible; there is no trust.The least bad solution is a partition of Syria and the creation of a primarily Sunni protected area \u2014 protected by an international force, including, if necessary, some U.S. troops. That should at least stop the killing \u2014 and the refugee flows that are fueling a populist-nationalist backlash all across the European Union.It won\u2019t be pretty or easy. But in the Cold War we put 400,000 troops in Europe to keep the sectarian peace there and to keep Europe on a democracy track. Having NATO and the Arab League establish a safe zone in Syria for the same purpose is worth a try. And then if Putin and Iran want to keep the butcher Assad in Damascus, they can have him.Advertisement"}

She pointed out their similarities.\u201cWe are both from prominent New York real estate families, we both attended private all-girls schools and went on to earn degrees from Ivy League colleges, and we both married smart Jewish men and now have young children,\u201d Ms. Rose wrote.Then, she issued a directive: \u201cIvanka, put yourself in my Jimmy Choos for a minute. What would you do if you were me? Because I know exactly what I would do if I were you: I would take my father aside and explain that failing to protect innocent children\u2019s rights to use the bathroom of their choice is wrong and unfair and un-American.\u201dAt gay and transgender benefits around town, Ms. Rose arrived in her Isabel Marant trousers and the Row blazers, and was greeted almost like a folk hero \u2014 a Jessica Chastain look-alike who had spoken truth to power and put her social position at risk on behalf of a cause that needs powerful allies.Darting around Lower Manhattan, Ms. Rose was amiable and self-deprecating about what she has been through. At a benefit for the Family Equality Council, one of the hosts began talking about how miraculous having children is. \u201cExcept when they\u2019re unbelievably annoying,\u201d Ms. Rose interjected.She noted that what is most remarkable about her family is how unremarkable they are; that change (or what she calls the \u201creversal of expectations\u201d) is simply the most reliable fact of life.\u201cI don\u2019t understand the tendency to catastrophize,\u201d she said. \u201cI see it and the only conclusion I draw is that it produces adrenaline. It makes people excited.\u201dFriends marvel at what they view to be her bravery, as she proudly and unapologetically offered her unconditional love and support to Sadie. The sight of that child, happy and free, is pretty good evidence Ms. Rose has done something right.Even for Ms. Rose \u2014 a person with wealth and privilege \u2014 there are relatives who have not always been comfortable with the choices she made. Not to mention people on the right, who are excoriating her for what they believe is the ultimate act of indulgence.Then, questions remain about how she will balance the public demands of being an activist with the private responsibilities of being a parent.How does she talk honestly about her child without opening her up to danger, and without making her into a representative she is not yet ready to be?Ms. Rose also has ambitions and desires of her own. Those can sometimes be hard to separate from the brand of activism she has chosen to pursue. She is, after all, a person who proudly calls herself \u201cthe second cousin twice removed of a drag queen\u201d \u2014 a woman who requires no orchestra to break into song. And that comes with attendant complications too.\u201cTechnicolor,\u201d she corrects.Of course, in real life, Ms. Rose did not grow up in Queens but on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.Her father, Elihu, is a real estate scion and retired professor of military history at New York University who serves as the chairman of the Park Avenue Armory.His family manages rental buildings all over Manhattan as well as in Queens, and much of their fortune has gone back to local cultural organizations such as the New York Public Library, Carnegie Hall, the Museum of Natural History and Lincoln Center, all of which have areas named after them.Even at Central Synagogue \u2014 the congregation frequented by prominent families like the Lauders and Tisches \u2014 they loomed large, from the checks they wrote, to their black-tie seders.As parents to Isabel, Mr. Rose and his wife, Susan, were determined to be completely supportive. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is with all of our children,\u201d Susan said in a phone interview this week. \u201cThere was never any other way.\u201dStill, there was no question, that Isabel \u2014 despite her diplomas from Yale (summa cum laude) and Bennington (master\u2019s degree in writing) \u2014 was an unusual family member.Roses, apparently, are quiet.\u201cWe don\u2019t like publicness,\u201d Susan said.In 1998, Ms. Rose married an investment banker at the Plaza, then split with him a year after their daughter, Lily Ezrow, was born.In a case of art imitating life, much of this struggle informed \u201cAnything but Love,\u201d in which the showgirl heroine leaves a flush financial type at the altar and runs off with her lowly accompanist.Guess who?In 2008, Ms. Rose connected with Jeffrey Fagen, a tattooed Penn graduate who spent years trying to be Robert Smith and now runs a clothing company called Panda Diplomacy.First came a chat on JDate, in which Mr. Fagen recalled spotting her years before at the Williamstown Theater Festival. After that were drinks at Art Bar in the West Village.On the fourth date, he asked her to marry him.She got pregnant and said yes, trading the Plaza for the Park in West Chelsea, where she and Mr. Fagen performed a rendition of the \u201cGrease\u201d anthem \u201cWe Go Together\u201d and were united in holy matrimony by Rabbi Angela Warnick Buchdahl of Central Synagogue, whom Mr. Fagen affectionately describes as the \u201conly Korean woman rabbi in the world.\u201dAfter the ceremony, Ms. Rose practically went into palpitations as a \u201csenior member\u201d of her clan said he was getting up to go to the bathroom, and she realized he was about to unzip at a urinal shaped like a male appendage.\u201cIt was just like, \u2018Nooooooooo,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Rose, reaching her arm out, like a movie character in slow motion.As fervent gay rights activists, Ms. Rose and Mr. Fagen joked to friends that evening that they were going to raise their baby gay but would \u201clove him all just the same\u201d if he turned out straight.\u201cWhat we weren\u2019t predicting was door No. 3,\u201d Mr. Fagen said.It wasn\u2019t just that their son, Samuel, wanted to play mermaids at age 2, which led Ms. Rose online to numerous articles that described this as a typical predictor of \u201cgender dysphoria,\u201d the mental state typically used to describe pre-transitioners.It was also Samuel\u2019s refusal to smile for photographs with Lily and the violent tantrums that transpired while getting suited up for a relative\u2019s bar mitzvah.\u201cI\u2019m a girl, Mommy,\u201d Ms. Rose recalled being told, over and over.Friends didn\u2019t really know at first what the exact nature of the problem was. They simply saw a child, according to Mr. Fagen\u2019s close friend Mitch Epner, who was \u201ctotally withdrawn.\u201dWhen Ms. Rose began to express the belief that Samuel might be transgender, friends doubted her. (More than a few also wondered privately: Why does the dramatic stuff always happen to her? \u201cIsn\u2019t that the question,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d)Even Mr. Fagen did a certain amount of blaming his wife, which she found surprising given that he was, as she described it, \u201ca rocker with a master\u2019s degree in poetry.\u201d\u201cAll I can tell you is that I went through all the permutations people go through,\u201d he said.So Ms. Rose took the good-cop role, becoming the confidante her husband wasn\u2019t ready to be.On vacation in Palm Beach, Fla., she took Samuel, then around 4, to the Lilly Pulitzer shop and watched with curiosity as pink poplin turned a depressed child turn into a happy nymph. Back in New York, they watched David Bowie videos and went to the set of Ms. Rose\u2019s video, where the first introductions to drag queens like Hedda Lettuce were made.Ms. Rose hoped to show her son there were many ways one could be a boy, from wearing metallic face paint to putting on green wigs and high heels.Unfortunately, this didn\u2019t really work with Samuel, who was alarmed by Ms. Rose\u2019s compatriots and utterly uninterested in Bowie. Nor did it assuage the concerns of friends and relatives who argued at the time that Ms. Rose was \u201cindulging\u201d her child and pushing ever closer to the great trans abyss.Throughout, Ms. Rose waded through confusing studies and heard troubling statistics about trans people attempting suicide. Attending another bar mitzvah, in Huntington, N.Y., in March 2014, the concern became more immediate.Before the reception, the family was in their hotel room and Ms. Rose went to take a nap. When she woke up, Samuel was in front of the mirror crying and Mr. Fagen was on his knee, asking what was wrong.The response: \u201cI want to burn my face off.\u201d\u201cUntil that moment, I never really understood the profound discomfort,\u201d Mr. Fagen said. \u201cHow does any child that young learn to hate themselves so much? After that it was, whatever it takes.\u201dThe first person they were going to have to come out to was Ms. Rose\u2019s eldest daughter, Lily, who was then 12 and had been somewhat in the dark about all of this.But thanks to an iPhone and the miracles of family sharing plans, she learned the extent of their dilemma without even being told.\u201cMy mom and I have the same photo stream,\u201d Lily, now 15, said one day after school a few weeks ago, while seated across from Ms. Rose in the den of the family\u2019s 5,000-square-foot sun-drenched apartment underneath a giant Marilyn Minter portrait of a high heel. \u201cI was going through the pictures and I saw some of my clothes, but it wasn\u2019t me. So I was a little confused.\u201dMaybe angry too.\u201cI was in middle school,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to be normal and fit in. So I had to take a step back and say, you know what, this is not about me.\u201dOne early concern for Ms. Rose and Mr. Fagen was how to embrace their child\u2019s transition and not have her become a Real Housewife in miniature.When the girl formerly known as Samuel suggested that the new name be Jasmine, a line was drawn.At this point, Mr. Fagen was arguing that if parents get to name their son at birth, they ought also to be able to pick the second one five years later when she emerges as their transgender daughter. Then his child approached with the name Sadie, and Ms. Rose was able to broker a peace offering.As Sadie\u2019s hair grew out, Ms. Rose felt it was time to clear things up quickly and definitively.First, she placed a photo on Facebook of Sadie attending her first ballet class and allowed people to talk among themselves. Then, she took her daughter to Central Synagogue, where Rabbi Buchdahl announced that the two were coming up to the bimah to sing.As Ms. Rose saw it, this was a good way to say: \u201cYes. Done.\u201d But it also was embraced by the synagogue\u2019s leadership, who thought standing behind the family sent a powerful message about what religious institutions can be.\u201cI don\u2019t want the religious right to be able to speak for God with a monolithic voice,\u201d Rabbi Buchdahl said. \u201cI understand that there will be interpretations of certain sacred texts that make this challenging for some people to accept, but I think it\u2019s important that we interpret the revelations with the moral compass of our day. And my understanding of our sacred texts is of a God who loves children, in all the ways they are made.\u201dSometimes, people ask whether Sadie\u2019s \u201ctransitioning\u201d means she has already begun surgery or taking hormones.Mr. Fagen patiently explains that those issues are years away, and that for now what has changed are \u201cwardrobe and pronouns.\u201dGiven the confidence Ms. Rose showed at temple and on Facebook, perhaps the letter she published on Medium shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise.But it did to Susan and Elihu Rose.\u201cWell, that was crazy,\u201d Susan said, chuckling. \u201cEli and I were down in D.C. We came home from the Smithsonian museum of African-American history, we were totally pooped, and I said: \u2018My God. Look at this amazing letter.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know Isabel was writing it. I didn\u2019t know anything about it. Then Eli said, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 and he mentioned that he knew someone who knew Ivanka and maybe they could pass it to her. The next morning I sent it out to friends, especially friends with marginalized children who might be gay or transgender. I think it\u2019s just an inspiration.\u201dLily had a more complicated reaction. She asked her mother if she realized she had outed Sadie.While the administration at Sadie\u2019s elementary school accepted her last year with the awareness that she is transgender, there hasn\u2019t been an explicit conversation with members of her class.Mr. Fagen, asked whether he worries about his wife\u2019s openness with the world, and all the publicity about their daughter, said: \u201cAbsolutely. Every day.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you sometimes have to tie my string to the chair,\u201d Ms. Rose said.Which was keenly self-aware, though it doesn\u2019t really answer the question of what might happen should Sadie decide as an adult that she wants her medical history to be private. How will she feel about what is for the world a mere Google search away?Alternatively, if she decides she does want to talk about it publicly, will she feel the power of her story has been blunted by all of the adults who saw fit to tell it before she could?But that\u2019s later.For now, Sadie is merely a second-grade girl who loves science, likes math, thinks English is O.K. and hates history. She wants her mother to come home earlier, she wants her dog to sit still and let her pull its tail, and she wants to appear in the family photo with everyone this afternoon.And that didn\u2019t used to be the case.Also, a cupcake would be nice. From Billy\u2019s.An article last Sunday about the New York real estate heiress Isabel Rose and her daughter\u2019s gender transition misidentified the university that Ms. Rose\u2019s husband, Jeffrey Fagen, attended. It is the University of Pennsylvania, not Dartmouth.Advertisement"}

The permit authorizes six people to take control of the vehicles if necessary.In October, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, told investors, \u201cWe are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it\u2019s clear that there are a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionize the car experience.\u201dThere are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.In those comments, the company said: \u201cApple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\u201dThe self-driving car segment is among the most bitterly contested areas in emerging technology, with Apple joining 29 other companies that have received test permits in California.Google, an early developer of the technology, considers self-driving cars to be a potential new market, while Uber hopes to eliminate the need for human drivers to shuttle its customers. And traditional automakers like General Motors and Ford Motor view the self-driving car as a natural extension of their existing businesses.\u201cEvery company will have to have some solution for transportation,\u201d Mr. Cybart said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Long Days, Google Docs and Anonymous Surveys: How the U.S. Soccer Team Forged a Deal", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byThe United States women\u2019s soccer team pressed its fight for equal pay not in one dramatic moment at the negotiating table, but in a thousand small ones away from it. In text messages and phone calls, in hotel rooms and on bus rides, and at their homes in far-flung cities, the players fine-tuned their needs and their arguments and their solidarity.Sometimes the suggestions arrived in an overnight email from forward Alex Morgan in France, or a late-night one from midfielder Megan Rapinoe on the West Coast. They sent out anonymous surveys to their teammates, to better gauge what people prioritized but might not want to say aloud, and weighed in on legal language and PowerPoint slides in a cache of shared Google Docs.As the talks intensified in recent weeks, players like Becky Sauerbrunn and Meghan Klingenberg conferred with teammates like Kelley O\u2019Hara and Christen Press to propose changes as small as a single word in page after page of precise contract language. Then they would rehearse what they would say at each negotiating session, and even decide who would say it.The result of all those long days and late nights is the team\u2019s new collective bargaining agreement with U.S. Soccer, which was announced on Wednesday morning. The agreement includes a sizable increase in base pay for the players \u2014 more than 30 percent, initially \u2014 and improved match bonuses that could double some of their incomes, to $200,000 to $300,000 in any given year, and even more in a year that includes a World Cup or Olympic campaign.\u201cWe tried to completely change the methodology for how to define our value, and we made progress in that regard, and it changes the equation for the future,\u201d said Becca Roux, the union\u2019s executive director.Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, portrayed the agreement as a shared victory, an \u201cequitable\u201d deal that he said recognized the team\u2019s achievements and kept U.S. Soccer at the forefront of the continuing fight for gender equity in soccer worldwide.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had the most highly compensated women\u2019s team in the world, and this puts them at even higher level,\u201d Gulati said. \u201cTheir performance over all over the last quarter-century has put them at the top of their game. Financially the agreement gives the players security in a way that they haven\u2019t had before and adds a number of other things that were very important to them.\u201cSo we\u2019re very pleased to continue being at the forefront of the women\u2019s game internationally.\u201dGulati noted that the deal\u2019s five-year term, through 2021, ensured that the next negotiation would not become an issue for the team in its next major competitions, the 2019 World Cup in France and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. He also revealed that U.S. Soccer had agreed to pay the players for two years\u2019 worth of unequal per-diem payments, the result of improvements in the men\u2019s C.B.A. that were not accounted for in the women\u2019s version.But while the deal was completed this week, it was forged over the past four months, during which the players took active control of their side of the negotiations with a team of U.S. Soccer negotiators \u2014 including Gulati \u2014 who had long been eager to do what they called an equitable deal but had bristled at the way the union went about it.Gulati, in a telephone interview on Wednesday morning, said the change in leadership, and in tone, had quickly opened the door to the discussions that produced a deal.In addition to seeking improved, but not necessarily equal, pay, the players began to press for changes that they saw as vital to the long-term growth of their game. Those changes, they argued in detailed slide presentations during increasingly frequent negotiating sessions, would improve the game outside the narrow ecosystem of the national team and also establish a structure to support both their careers and those of the next generation of American women.As a result, the new agreement includes commitments from U.S. Soccer for its continued support of the domestic professional league, the N.W.S.L., as well as requirements that the federation improve standards in the league and \u2014 through sizable increases in camp and roster bonuses for players not under contract with U.S. Soccer \u2014 transfer money to players who exist on the periphery of the more established national team pool.The agreement also reinforces the national team players\u2019 commitment to the N.W.S.L. through their league salaries, while at the same time establishing a mechanism for them to pursue opportunities abroad, as players like Carli Lloyd and Crystal Dunn (in England) and Morgan (in France) have done in recent months.The final breakthrough came last weekend in Dallas, when as many as 16 players \u2014 dressed in matching team gear in a row of chairs only feet from the negotiating table \u2014 took part in two days of marathon discussions with Gulati and U.S. Soccer representatives. Helpful timing \u2014 the players were together in camp ahead of two friendlies against Russia this week \u2014 and the looming start of the N.W.S.L. season provided another needed nudge.On Tuesday night, the players gathered in a drab conference room to hear the details of the agreement from their lawyers, including some benefits that had come to pass only in the final days. \u201cOh, we got that, too,\u201d one player remarked, according to Roux. Then the completed document was shared electronically with all 22 voting members for ratification, while U.S. Soccer\u2019s board met on a conference call to give its assent.\u201cI am incredibly proud of this team and the commitment we have shown through this entire process,\u201d Rapinoe, a player and a member of the union\u2019s C.B.A. committee, said in a statement provided by the union. \u201cWhile I think there is still much progress to be made for us and for women more broadly, I think the W.N.T.P.A. should be very proud of this deal and feel empowered moving forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Invokes Internet Freedom While Trying to Kill It", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byEditorialHere we go again. The Federal Communications Commission, now led by an anti-regulation ideologue appointed by President Trump, wants to gut the net neutrality rules that keep powerful broadband companies from calling the shots on the internet, at the expense of consumers.Under the cynical guise of \u201crestoring internet freedom,\u201d the new F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, wants to give big telecom companies carte blanche to treat the content of their subsidiaries and partners more favorably than information from other companies \u2014 a practice that AT&T, Comcast and Verizon are already starting to employ. They would also be able to demand fees from companies like Netflix and YouTube to deliver videos and other content to customers.If the commission, which has a 2-to-1 Republican majority, approves Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, there will be little stopping the broadband industry from squelching competition, limiting consumer choice and raising prices. The previous F.C.C. chairman, Tom Wheeler, helped put the rules Mr. Pai is attacking in place in 2015, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld them last year.Large telecommunications companies have been raking in profits in recent years. And they have been making multibillion-dollar acquisitions \u2014 not something you see from an industry that is withering from senseless regulations. Charter spent more than $65 billion last year to buy Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. AT&T bought DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015 and is trying to buy Time Warner, the media company, for $85 billion.Not only is Mr. Pai\u2019s lament for the broadband industry based on alternative facts, it misses the bigger point. Net neutrality is meant to benefit the internet and the economy broadly, not just the broadband industry. That means the commission ought to consider the impact the regulations have on consumers and businesses. In particular, the commission has a responsibility to protect people with few or no choices; most Americans have access to just one or two companies for residential service and just four big operators for wireless.Mr. Pai argues that if the Wheeler rules are revoked, some safeguards will remain. For example, he says, broadband companies would refrain from blocking or slowing the content of competitors. He has not said how he would ensure that. But the F.C.C. is considering using voluntary commitments from the industry.Under that approach, officials at the Federal Trade Commission would have the power to fine or sue companies that make pledges and then fail to uphold them. But it is hard to believe that voluntary standards would be strong enough. It also puts the onus on individuals and small businesses to complain to regulators and request investigations.Big internet businesses like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix will probably be fine under Mr. Pai\u2019s plans, because they are well established and have the money to cut special deals with broadband companies.Smaller firms and start-ups \u2014 some of which may never get started \u2014 will not be as lucky.Ultimately, though, the real losers will be all Americans, because there will be fewer choices and less innovation.Advertisement"}

Even so, Tesla now trades at some 28 times estimated earnings in 2020. By then Mr. Musk expects to be producing one million cars a year, up from around 100,000 in 2017.That will require a huge ramp-up in production, which is no easy feat. Also, that valuation multiple suggests Tesla will either keep growing quickly or else generate pretax margins around the 30 percent that Silicon Valley stalwarts Apple and Google achieve rather than the 10 percent that counts as decent in the auto industry \u2014 or maybe both.It\u2019s hard to see that happening, at least without major setbacks along the way.Long-term guesstimates from Morgan Stanley\u2019s auto analysts show a standard-looking car company \u2014 and they have been among Tesla\u2019s most bullish followers. They don\u2019t see output reaching one million cars until around 2027. By 2030, they reckon the company\u2019s pretax margin could be about 14 percent, with some $11 billion of profit.Another way to assess these numbers is to discount the projected 2030 earnings back to this year at a rule-of-thumb 10 percent annual rate. Tesla\u2019s current valuation is about 18 times that discounted profit figure.It\u2019s a somewhat arbitrary analysis, but it may hint at what some investors are hoping for. Take Apple in 2004. Back then, the future iPhone maker was trading at just 65 percent of expected earnings this year, discounted back. In other words, Steve Jobs unleashed growth that blew projections away.If Mr. Musk is riding another wave of consumer change \u2014 a shift toward electric cars \u2014 it could be less drastic than the smartphone revolution and still pay off for Tesla\u2019s investors.That\u2019s possible. By 2030, a quarter of the miles driven in the United States could be in self-driving electric cars, according to the Boston Consulting Group. Mr. Musk faces plenty of competition, though.

By the time his shy nephew, Myles Hass, finished high school two decades later, the little company, Erotic Image (\u201cgive the gift that unwraps itself\u201d), was a scorching success \u2014 so much so that Mr. Hass hatched a spinoff plan.Nude dudes.Mr. Hass spotted bachelorette parties as a growing market for male strippers. (Credit \u201cSex and the City.\u201d) And he started to fantasize: What about creating a full-fledged male revue? Competing with the bow-tie-wearing Chippendales or the globe-trotting Thunder From Down Under was too much to dream. But he could probably book Michigan clubs. Detroit. Grand Rapids. Maybe even Kalamazoo.\u201cSomething quality, with real showmanship,\u201d Mr. Hass told me over drinks at the W Hollywood hotel recently. \u201cNot a traveling group of man whores.\u201dHis publicist, seated beside him, shifted uncomfortably, but Mr. Hass, 28, has nothing to be embarrassed about. Last year, his touring revue, Magic Men Live, sold roughly $5 million worth of tickets at 148 shows in North America. Mr. Hass, who will introduce a new-and-improved Magic Men on Tuesday in Rapid City, S.D., thinks attendance could double in the coming years.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, either, to be honest with you,\u201d said Mr. Hass, who moved to Los Angeles from Detroit a few months ago. \u201cWhen we started out, we were literally driving our own cars, four guys to a vehicle, sleeping on each other in uncomfortable positions.\u201d He added: \u201cI started this company while living with my parents. From my childhood bedroom. Now women arrive by the thousands. It\u2019s like, \u2018Here we go, boys!\u2019\u201dThe Chippendales are not only still grinding away in Las Vegas (\u201ctrou-dropping goodness,\u201d the website promises). Their global tours also attract a growing audience; roughly two million people (again, mostly women) went to see a Chippendales show last year, according to Michael Caprio, a spokesman. Competitors include Thunder From Down Under and Hunk-O-Mania.You may think that the young upstart of Magic Men would be sweating Magic Mike\u2019s arrival. After all, Mr. Hass \u2014 even in his no-longer-shy, worked-out state \u2014 is just a guy from Detroit, while Mr. Tatum has all the resources of a major celebrity.But Mr. Hass does not seem worried.\u201cThey will do their thing, and we will do ours,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see us as competing. We tour. They stay in Vegas.\u201d His new Magic Men show, he added, \u201chas nothing to do with those movies except for us paying our respects to them.\u201d Mr. Hass declined to say how \u201cMagic Mike\u201d would be incorporated into his revamped show. \u201cHe wants to be able to surprise the fans,\u201d his publicist, Andy Keown, wrote in an email.Despite different packaging and a few unique niches \u2014 the Chippendales also sing, for instance \u2014 these shows are fairly interchangeable. A striptease is a striptease. Just switch out the abs, put on some dance music and add fake fog.Mr. Hass, who arrived for our interview wearing a leather jacket and a backward baseball hat, has a boyish charm and manscaped eyebrows. He performs in Magic Men as the M.C., warming up the crowd and introducing dancers who go by names like Cowboy Christian and Boy Toy Troy. He employs 25 people, including 10 dancers, and tours with two sleeper buses and an 18-wheeler to carry sound and lighting equipment.Part of his success appears to come from a savvy use of geography: Magic Men mostly visits smaller cities, bringing a style of entertainment not often seen in spots like Bismarck, N.D., and Owensboro, Ky. Troupe members regularly interact with fans on Snapchat and Instagram. Magic Men has 1.1 million followers on Facebook; Chippendales has about 803,300.\u201cOne of my friends was following them on Snapchat, and she kind of got me hooked,\u201d Johnelle Allen, 28, told me by phone from her home in Albuquerque. Ms. Allen, a single mother, has been to five Magic Men shows over the last year, posting about her experiences online and trading messages with the dancers on Snapchat.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think they would be down-to-earth, but they are,\u201d she said. \u201cThey make us feel like we\u2019re all friends.\u201dMs. Allen said she enjoyed the escape that Magic Men performances provided from her everyday life. Watching the men strip down to \u201cthe smallest boxer briefs you have ever seen in your life\u201d is less titillating than funny, she said. At one of the last performances she saw, a dancer started his routine wearing a furry, full-body Elmo costume. Putting a \u201cSesame Street\u201d character into a sexually charged setting, she said, made the audience really hoot and howl.\u201cThey have multiple stops in one area, so we also went to see them in Amarillo and El Paso,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a boy band.\u201dExcept without as many clothes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is It Time to Break Up Google?", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byOpinionIn just 10 years, the world\u2019s five largest companies by market capitalization have all changed, save for one: Microsoft. Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Citigroup and Shell Oil are out and Apple, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon and Facebook have taken their place.They\u2019re all tech companies, and each dominates its corner of the industry: Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising, Facebook (and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic and Amazon has a 74 percent share in the e-book market. In classic economic terms, all three are monopolies.We have been transported back to the early 20th century, when arguments about \u201cthe curse of bigness\u201d were advanced by President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s counselor, Louis Brandeis, before Wilson appointed him to the Supreme Court. Brandeis wanted to eliminate monopolies, because (in the words of his biographer Melvin Urofsky) \u201cin a democratic society the existence of large centers of private power is dangerous to the continuing vitality of a free people.\u201d We need look no further than the conduct of the largest banks in the 2008 financial crisis or the role that Facebook and Google play in the \u201cfake news\u201d business to know that Brandeis was right.While Brandeis generally opposed regulation \u2014 which, he worried, inevitably led to the corruption of the regulator \u2014 and instead advocated breaking up \u201cbigness,\u201d he made an exception for \u201cnatural\u201d monopolies, like telephone, water and power companies and railroads, where it made sense to have one or a few companies in control of an industry.Could it be that these companies \u2014 and Google in particular \u2014 have become natural monopolies by supplying an entire market\u2019s demand for a service, at a price lower than what would be offered by two competing firms? And if so, is it time to regulate them like public utilities?Consider a historical analogy: the early days of telecommunications.In 1895 a photograph of the business district of a large city might have shown 20 phone wires attached to most buildings. Each wire was owned by a different phone company, and none of them worked with the others. Without network effects, the networks themselves were almost useless.The solution was for a single company, American Telephone and Telegraph, to consolidate the industry by buying up all the small operators and creating a single network \u2014 a natural monopoly. The government permitted it, but then regulated this monopoly through the Federal Communications Commission.In a 1956 consent decree in which the Justice Department allowed AT&T to maintain its phone monopoly, the government extracted a huge concession: All past patents were licensed (to any American company) royalty-free, and all future patents were to be licensed for a small fee. These licenses led to the creation of Texas Instruments, Motorola, Fairchild Semiconductor and many other start-ups.True, the internet never had the same problems of interoperability. And Google\u2019s route to dominance is different from the Bell System\u2019s. Nevertheless it still has all of the characteristics of a public utility.We are going to have to decide fairly soon whether Google, Facebook and Amazon are the kinds of natural monopolies that need to be regulated, or whether we allow the status quo to continue, pretending that unfettered monoliths don\u2019t inflict damage on our privacy and democracy.It is impossible to deny that Facebook, Google and Amazon have stymied innovation on a broad scale. To begin with, the platforms of Google and Facebook are the point of access to all media for the majority of Americans. While profits at Google, Facebook and Amazon have soared, revenues in media businesses like newspaper publishing or the music business have, since 2001, fallen by 70 percent.There are a few obvious regulations to start with. Monopoly is made by acquisition \u2014 Google buying AdMob and DoubleClick, Facebook buying Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon buying, to name just a few, Audible, Twitch, Zappos and Alexa. At a minimum, these companies should not be allowed to acquire other major firms, like Spotify or Snapchat.The second alternative is to regulate a company like Google as a public utility, requiring it to license out patents, for a nominal fee, for its search algorithms, advertising exchanges and other key innovations.The third alternative is to remove the \u201csafe harbor\u201d clause in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which allows companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube to free ride on the content produced by others. The reason there are 40,000 Islamic State videos on YouTube, many with ads that yield revenue for those who posted them, is that YouTube does not have to take responsibility for the content on its network. Facebook, Google and Twitter claim that policing their networks would be too onerous. But that\u2019s preposterous: They already police their networks for pornography, and quite well.Removing the safe harbor provision would also force social networks to pay for the content posted on their sites. A simple example: One million downloads of a song on iTunes would yield the performer and his record label about $900,000. One million streams of that same song on YouTube would earn them about $900.I\u2019m under no delusion that, with libertarian tech moguls like Peter Thiel in President Trump\u2019s inner circle, antitrust regulation of the internet monopolies will be a priority. Ultimately we may have to wait four years, at which time the monopolies will be so dominant that the only remedy will be to break them up. Force Google to sell DoubleClick. Force Facebook to sell WhatsApp and Instagram.Woodrow Wilson was right when he said in 1913, \u201cIf monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of the government.\u201d We ignore his words at our peril.Jonathan Taplin is the director emeritus of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Google, Facebook and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could Legalized Gambling Save Us From the Insufferability of Fantasy Sports?", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byOn SportsIn the early 1990s, Bill Bradley, the New Jersey senator and former New York Knick, argued several times in front of Congress that legalizing sports betting would dehumanize athletes and lead to the rampant corruption of children. This was no cynical political crusade; Bradley was a true believer. He liked to declare that athletes were not \u201croulette chips\u201d and tell the story of a game he once played in Madison Square Garden. His Knicks were up by 5 at the end when the other team hit a meaningless basket to cut the final lead to 3. A confused Bradley heard cheers in the crowd, and when someone told him why \u2014 the opponent had just lost by fewer points and beat the spread predicted by oddsmakers \u2014 his eyes were opened to the sordid callousness of the gambling world. Bradley helped push through the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in 1992, all but banning sports betting outside Nevada and driving a growing industry that employed hundreds underground.As it turned out, the country\u2019s millions of sports gamblers didn\u2019t share Bradley\u2019s concern for the sanctity of athletes like Bill Bradley or the children who might grow up to be just like him. In practical terms, the Sports Protection Act has mostly failed, and gambling has effectively grown to be an inescapable part of big-time sports. Nobody knows how many Americans bet illegally on sports, but the American Gaming Association estimates that roughly $150 billion is wagered annually. (By contrast, $4.5 billion was bet in Nevada sports books last year.) A gambler with a hunch about, say, a Golden State Warriors playoff game this month can use a debit card on any one of dozens of offshore online betting sites. If the gut feeling runs a bit more toward whether a specific player can handle the big stage, he or she can pick him in a daily-fantasy lineup and enter a contest to win thousands.Sometime in the next four months, the Supreme Court is likely to decide whether to hear an appeal by Gov. Chris Christie and the State of New Jersey that would essentially let states determine whether to allow sports betting within their borders. What the court will do is not certain: The debate is largely being framed in the language of states\u2019 rights versus intrusive and economically harmful federal overreach, and the position the Justice Department will take in any opinion it files is unclear. But most in the gambling industry believe that some court case either now or in the near future \u2014 seven other states have recently expressed interest in the added tax, infrastructure and tourism revenue that would come from legalized gambling \u2014 will succeed in repealing or gutting the Sports Protection Act.Even the professional leagues, which for years mostly opposed legalization on the grounds that expanded gambling would corrupt their product, have started to prepare for changes. Adam Silver, the commissioner of the N.B.A., has publicly come out in favor of regulated sports betting. Last month, the N.F.L. announced that the Oakland Raiders would be moving to Las Vegas, putting an N.F.L. team in the heart of the gambling industry. \u201cThere\u2019s an irreversible momentum for sports gambling,\u201d Daniel Wallach, a gambling expert at the law firm Becker & Poliakoff, told me. The rise of daily-fantasy sports (whose legality is accepted by many states) and the placement of N.H.L. and N.F.L. franchises in Las Vegas have diluted the spirit of the law and spawned challenges in court. \u201cWe could be looking at legal sports betting in this country in three years,\u201d Wallach said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point of no return.\u201dThis, of course, is a dubious fear \u2014 those who gamble away their savings at the craps table are no different morally speaking from those who blow their money betting on the Cavaliers. And if it sometimes seems as if betting scandals are routine in Europe and Asia \u2014 allegations of match-fixing in the lower circuits of professional tennis have circulated for years, for example, as have claims of Asian gambling moguls fixing prominent European soccer matches \u2014 the legality of sports betting in a particular country hardly matters when the sharp behind an illicit operation lives in Malaysia and bets millions in a casino in Macau. Regulated sports gambling in New Jersey is unlikely to lead to a new generation of high-powered match fixers in the United States.The larger fantasy-sports industry, however, offers both a model and a cautionary tale for how sports betting could grow once it moves into the light of day. For both fantasy sports and gambling, a vast market has emerged for any bit of information that might provide an edge, and its reach has been evident for years, since N.F.L. broadcasts introduced fantasy stock tickers and pregame segments full of references to obscure metrics like \u201cyards after catch\u201d and \u201cdefense-adjusted value over average.\u201d Over the past 20 or so years, the world of fantasy sports has broadened its originally stultifying conversations \u2014 arguments over how many yards the running back Tiki Barber would gain against the Cowboys\u2019 defense \u2014 into inquiries about how games are actually won on the field, whether by examining the way a baseball catcher frames pitches or by establishing the most efficient spots to shoot from on a basketball court. Fantasy talk evolved into real insight.If gambling wants to shake off its bad associations, fueled in no small part by the scammers who offer their stone-cold lock of the week for a one-time payment of just $49.99, it will need to share all the data that goes into making an informed sports bet. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody in this country who knows more about predictive analytics than the guys working in sports betting,\u201d Brian Musburger, the founder of the new media venture Vegas Stats & Information Network, told me. For years, Brian\u2019s uncle, Brent, the longtime CBS sportscaster, always tried to wink at the gamblers watching his games. If a seemingly meaningless field goal covered the spread, Brent found a way to work in a reference to the people who had just sighed in great, full-bodied relief. Brent left ESPN and joined his nephew\u2019s start-up this year.The Vegas Stats network, which debuted in February, still does not have many viewers (if you type VSIN into Google, search results for \u201cvain\u201d still pop up), but if it succeeds, there may be an unexpected benefit to traditionalists like Bradley who want sports to be about wins and losses, free from financial concerns or selfish individual accomplishments. Fantasy might have inspired smarter ways to look at actual game play, but it has also tended to make the experience of watching sports, whether with friends or at a bar, downright unbearable.We\u2019ve long since normalized the horror of listening to someone telling you about the tragedy that befell a fantasy team, but if that talk were instead about whether the Cowboys were going to cover the spread, wouldn\u2019t that conversation come closer to the actual, idealized point of the game? There are hundreds of reasons that a team might win a football game by, say, 10 or more points. Each one requires you to consider offenses, defensive schemes or, at the very worst, minor details like the rumors about the quarterback\u2019s recent trip to Cabo San Lucas or what your equipment-manager cousin told you about the impact of last night\u2019s rain on turf conditions \u2014 and every such discussion beats talking about your fantasy squad. If Bradley wanted fans to root based on the play of their favorite team, he banned the wrong pastime.Jay Caspian Kang is a writer at large for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "That Fingerprint Sensor on Your Phone Is Not as Safe as You Think", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byWhile such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole.The researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones.\u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it\u2019s almost certainly pretty darn bad,\u201d said Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Canada, who studies biometric security systems. \u201cIf all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into 1 in 10 phones, that\u2019s not bad odds.\u201dFull human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google\u2019s Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger \u2014 say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand.Since a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches.\u201cIt\u2019s as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one,\u201d said Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at N.Y.U.\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, which was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. The other authors are Aditi Roy, a postdoctoral fellow at N.Y.U.\u2019s Tandon School, and Arun Ross, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State.Dr. Memon said their findings indicated that if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 to 50 percent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password, known as a personal identification number.Apple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone\u2019s fingerprint system was 1 in 50,000 with one fingerprint enrolled. Ryan James, a company spokesman, said Apple had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system, and also incorporated other security features to prevent false matches.Google declined to comment.The actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret, and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google\u2019s standard design in ways that reduce the level of security.Stephanie Schuckers, a professor at Clarkson University and director of the Center for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrint findings. She said the researchers used a midrange, commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings.\u201cTo really know what the impact would be on a cellphone, you\u2019d have to try it on the cellphone,\u201d she said. She noted that cellphone makers and others who use fingerprint security systems are studying anti-spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. A new fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm, for example, uses ultrasound.Phone makers have acknowledged that fingerprint sensors are not foolproof, but said that the ease of touching a finger to unlock a phone meant that more users actually turned on security features instead of leaving their phones unlocked \u2014 a common habit in the early days of smartphones.Dr. Ross acknowledged the limitations of the work. \u201cMost of the current smartphone vendors do not give us access to the fingerprint image,\u201d he said.For a thief or spy to turn master fingerprints into smartphone keys would require a lot of additional work. \u201cIn order to launch this attack, you still have to make fake fingers,\u201d Dr. Ross said.Still, the team\u2019s fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Chris Boehnen, the manager of the federal government\u2019s Odin program, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity.\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low,\u201d Dr. Boehnen said.Phone makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, \u201cbut the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it.\u201dAdding a larger fingerprint sensor would also decrease the risk, Dr. Boehnen said. And some newer biometric security options, such as the iris scanner in Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy S8, are harder to trick. (Face recognition, another security option available on some phones, is considered less secure than fingerprints.)Phone users can also protect themselves by turning off fingerprint authentication for their most sensitive apps, such as mobile payments, Dr. Boehnen said.Dr. Memon said that despite his research, he was still using fingerprint security on his iPhone.\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s still a very convenient way of unlocking a phone. But I\u2019d rather see Apple make me enter the PIN if it\u2019s idle for one hour.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was an open-seated, 220-pound contraption with room for one person, powered by eight battery-powered propellers that howled as loudly as a speedboat.More than a dozen start-ups backed by deep-pocketed industry figures like Larry Page, a Google founder \u2014 along with big aerospace firms like Airbus, the ride-hailing company Uber and even the government of Dubai \u2014 are taking on the dream of the flying car.The approaches by the different companies vary and the realization of their competing visions seems far in the future, but they have one thing in common: a belief that one day regular people should be able to fly their own vehicles around town.There are challenges, no doubt, with both the technology and government regulations. Perhaps the biggest hurdle will be convincing the public that the whole idea isn\u2019t crazy.\u201cI love the idea of being able to go out into my backyard and hop into my flying car,\u201d said Brad Templeton, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has served as a consultant on Google\u2019s self-driving project. \u201cI hate the idea of my next-door neighbor having one.\u201dKitty Hawk, the company backed by Mr. Page, is trying to be one of the first out of the gate and plans to start selling its vehicle by the end of the year.Mr. Page declined a request for an interview but said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ve all had dreams of flying effortlessly. I\u2019m excited that one day very soon I\u2019ll be able to climb onto my Kitty Hawk Flyer for a quick and easy personal flight.\u201dDuring his recent test flight, Cameron Robertson, the aerospace engineer, used two joysticklike controls to swing the vehicle back and forth above Clear Lake, sliding on the air as a Formula One car might shimmy through a racecourse. The flight, just 15 feet above the water, circled over the lake about 20 or 30 yards from shore, and after about five minutes Mr. Robertson steered back to a floating landing pad at the end of a dock.The Kitty Hawk Flyer is one of several prototypes the start-up, based in Mountain View, Calif., is designing. The company hopes to create an audience of enthusiasts and hobbyists, who can pay $100 to sign up for a $2,000 discount on the retail price of a Flyer to \u201cgain exclusive access to Kitty Hawk experiences and demonstrations where a select few will get the chance to ride the Flyer.\u201dIt is an unusual offer, since the company has yet to set a price for the vehicle, and Mr. Thrun\u2019s and Mr. Page\u2019s involvement can be taken as evidence that the company is aiming beyond hobbyists. Still, Kitty Hawk is clearly targeting a new kind of transportation \u2014 air flight that can be performed safely by most people and hopefully with government approval.\u201cWe have been in contact with the F.A.A. and we see the regulators as friends,\u201d Mr. Thrun said in an interview. He agreed that concerns about vehicles flying over our heads were legitimate. \u201cI believe that all of us have to work together to understand how new technologies will shape the future of society, \u201d he said.Two years ago, Mr. Thrun recruited two other pioneers, Mr. Robertson and Todd Reichert, aerospace engineers from AeroVelo, a University of Toronto spinoff company that won a coveted prize for a human-powered helicopter and set the land speed record for a bicycle last year.They are flying under a special Federal Aviation Administration category for ultralight aircraft that does not require a pilot\u2019s license and is intended for recreational flying in uncongested areas. To add an extra margin of safety, the Kitty Hawk engineers are sticking to flying over open water. The company said the final commercial product would look different and be far quieter than the test model.\u201cWe hope that this is more of an exciting concept than what most people have had in their minds about flying cars,\u201d Mr. Robertson said. \u201cThis is not yet that product in terms of what we will say and what it can do, but I think it demonstrates a vision of the future.\u201dKitty Hawk could face stiff competition, not just from about a half dozen start-ups, but from the giant Airbus, headquartered in Blagnac, France. The aerospace firm has announced two different vertical takeoff and landing, or VTOL, concepts and is reported to be planning an initial test flight before the end of the year.There is no shortage of skeptics happy to point out the roadblocks for these vehicles. There is already significant resistance to the idea of unmanned drones flying over urban areas, and flying cars could face substantial opposition, even if they can be quieted to automotive noise levels.For these personal air vehicles to become a reality in the United States, the country would need a new air traffic control system.Batteries are also an issue. While electric propeller-driven motors seem promising, today\u2019s battery technology cannot support flights of a reasonable distance, say a 30- or 50-mile commute.And don\u2019t forget that flying cars will not be able to pull to the side of the road in an emergency, said John Leonard, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\u201cSilicon Valley is full of very smart people, but they don\u2019t always get the laws of physics,\u201d he said. \u201cGravity is a formidable adversary.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about efforts to build flying cars referred incorrectly to the timing of an offer in which consumers pay $100 to sign up for a $2,000 discount on the retail price of one such vehicle, a Kitty Hawk Flyer. They can do so now; they do not have to wait until later this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Six Degrees Became a Forever Meme", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byWhile the idea that we\u2019re all connected may seem old hat in the age of the internet, fascination with it has yielded its own rich web of associations over the years. On the eve of the play\u2019s first Broadway revival, which opens on Tuesday, April 25, here\u2019s an unscientific look at a concept that links, among other things, the first issue of Psychology Today, the star of \u201cFootloose\u201d and a shirtless J. J. Abrams.Mr. Guare, in a recent interview, said he first encountered the six-degrees concept in 1967, in the inaugural issue of Psychology Today, which featured a cover story about the psychologist Stanley Milgram\u2019s \u201csmall world\u201d experiment. The experiment involved giving a letter to random people in Omaha and Wichita, Kan., with instructions to give it to someone who could give it to someone who would help it reach a designated individual in Boston.Evidently, Ouisa Kittredge, one half of the couple in Mr. Guare\u2019s play, saw the same article.The phrase is often seen as an inspiring, even mystical symbol. But the speech, Mr. Guare notes, was meant ironically, as a comment on racial exclusion and social stratification in America.\u201cThe nightmare of the play becomes finding the right six people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can find everyone in the world, but you can\u2019t find one black man whose name you don\u2019t know.\u201dMr. Guare said he was \u201ctickled\u201d when he started seeing the phrase \u201csix degrees of separation\u201d in different contexts: an ad for Air France, a newspaper article about the 1992 presidential election. And then came Kevin Bacon.The three friends performed their parlor trick on \u201cThe Jon Stewart Show\u201d on MTV a few months later. Next came a book (with an introduction by Mr. Bacon) and a board game.\u201cPeople would come up to me and touch me and say, \u2018I\u2019m one degree!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what was going on.\u201d\u201cI did it mainly for myself and my friends,\u201d Mr. Tjaden, now a professor at James Madison University, said in a phone interview. \u201cThey sent the link to their friends, who sent it to a couple of their friends, and before too long it was famous.\u201dThe Oracle of Bacon still has about 10,000 visitors on an average day, according to Patrick Reynolds, a software engineer in Florida who runs it.\u201cTo me, it says that a meme never really goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything lives forever until you pull the plug.\u201dThe article, which was later adapted for Mr. Gladwell\u2019s monster best seller \u201cThe Tipping Point,\u201d dug into research by Milgram, Mark Granovetter (who developed the concept of strong versus weak social ties) and others. But the big ideas, Mr. Gladwell said in a phone interview, came second.\u201cShe was kind of a hilarious person, and I wanted an excuse to hang out with her,\u201d he said. \u201cThe article was really a delivery vehicle for Lois Weisberg.\u201dThe article popularized the idea of \u201cconnectors\u201d: people who know unusually large numbers of people and are unusually given to making introductions, the rough equivalent of hubs in a computer network.\u201cNot all degrees are created equal,\u201d Mr. Gladwell wrote. The article\u2019s teaser summary put it even more dramatically: \u201cShe\u2019s a grandmother, she lives in a big house in Chicago, and you\u2019ve never heard of her. Does she run the world?\u201d\u201cI think I made her life a little difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t interested in celebrity of any kind.\u201dThe play, Mr. Guare said, is \u201can antique piece.\u201d Nowadays, a quick Google search \u2014 or text message to the Kittredges\u2019 children, whom Paul supposedly knows from Harvard \u2014 would have blown Paul\u2019s cover immediately.On the other hand, social media has made it possible to be \u201cfriends\u201d with people you don\u2019t actually know, while also providing vast data sets for calculating the number of links separating people scattered around the world.The six-degrees idea has a cosmic undertow that writers and directors have been happy to ride. The movies \u201cBabel\u201d and \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d as well as \u201cLost,\u201d the head-scratching television series cocreated by J. J. Abrams, featured characters unknowingly linked across huge swaths of space and time. The movies \u201cCrash\u201d and \u201cMagnolia\u201d (both set in Los Angeles) and the short-lived ABC series \u201cSix Degrees\u201d (another Abrams project, set in New York) offered more localized versions.But here\u2019s a real coincidence for you: Back in 1993, Mr. Abrams was an aspiring actor whose film credits included \u2026 a small part in the film adaptation of \u201cSix Degrees of Separation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "That Wasn\u2019t Mark Twain: How a Misquotation Is Born", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byHow fitting that the man often credited with saying \u201ca lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes\u201d most likely did not invent the phrase.\u201cWhen I started off, it was mysterious exactly where these misquotations were coming from, and it was interesting that sometimes you could find these clues that pointed to how they may have originated,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Toole, an alias for Gregory F. Sullivan, a former teacher and researcher in the Johns Hopkins computer science department who now spends his time writing.In the book, Mr. Sullivan offers 10 common \u201cmechanisms\u201d that he says lead to misquotation and incorrect attribution.Through one such process, which he labels \u201ctextual proximity,\u201d a famous person mistakenly gets credit for a quotation merely by having their name or likeness published close to the words. In another, \u201cventriloquy,\u201d a statement about an individual\u2019s work is perceived to be so apt that it is eventually confused for their own words.Both may explain how Anton Chekhov, the Russian writer, became associated with the saying: \u201cAny idiot can face a crisis, it\u2019s the day-to-day living that wears you out,\u201d as outlined on Mr. Sullivan\u2019s website and, now, in his book.In May 2013, Mr. Sullivan heard from a reader who, after a fruitless attempt to prove Chekhov\u2019s authorship of those words, wanted help uncovering the true history of the quotation.Mr. Sullivan accepted the challenge.A character in a Hollywood film of the 1950s casually drops this line: \u201cAny idiot can face a crisis; it\u2019s this day-to-day living that wears you out.\u201d The screenplay was by Clifford Odets, America\u2019s chief inheritor of the dramatic tradition of Anton Chekhov, and in that one line, he epitomized the lesson of his master.Though Mr. Sullivan was unable to confirm Mr. Odets\u2019s authorship of the sentence, he theorized that Mr. Odets wrote something similar, which was then misquoted in the 1971 textbook. The earliest citation Mr. Sullivan could find crediting the saying to Chekhov was from 1981.That final attribution could have been the result of: textual proximity, in which an oblivious reader saw Chekhov\u2019s name and blindly attributed the quotation to him; ventriloquy, in which a reader found the line so resonated with Chekhov\u2019s style that these words were mistaken for his; or some combination.Mr. Sullivan published his analysis in June 2013, but more than two years later, a reader came forward with a new lead, referring him to the 1954 movie \u201cThe Country Girl,\u201d based on a play by Mr. Odets.Mr. Sullivan watched the movie and discovered these words uttered by Bing Crosby:I faced a crisis up there in Boston, and I got away with it. Just about anybody can face a crisis. It\u2019s that everyday living that\u2019s rough.The other mechanisms Mr. Sullivan identified include:\u2022 Synthesis and streamlining, a process in which a quotation is simplified over time;\u2022 Proverbial wisdom, in which a quotation is elevated to the status of a proverb because its source is unknown;\u2022 Real-world proximity, when an individual wrongly gets credit for a quotation because they share a real-world connection to the true author;\u2022 Similar names, the mistaken attribution of a quotation to someone whose name resembles that of the true author;\u2022 Concoctions, which are pure fabrications, intentional or otherwise;\u2022 Historical fiction, when an individual gets credit for words uttered by a character portraying them in a movie, novel or other work of fiction;\u2022 Capture, when a famous person gets credit for echoing the words of someone less well-known;\u2022 Host, in which an individual, simply by being famous, attracts credit for quotations they never delivered, with Mr. Twain and Albert Einstein being popular examples.Advertisement"}

But law enforcement officials argue that the companies, as service providers, have no standing in court to argue against the warrants.

{"Headline": "At F.C.C., Obama-Era Rules on Chopping Block", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byThe next target is net neutrality, which is the guarantee that all internet content is equally accessible. That could be followed by cuts in broadband subsidies for low-income households and a relaxation in rules preventing media consolidation in local markets.\u201cThere was a good bit of overreach by the past F.C.C. that caused a lot of confusion,\u201d said Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, who was vice chairwoman for President Trump\u2019s transition. \u201cWe are going to have technology and telecommunications policy that is light touch.\u201dIn a major philosophical shift from the Obama administration, Republican leaders have said they will look for proof of harm before creating new regulations for telecom firms. They believe antitrust and consumer protection laws suffice for government oversight of the sector.\u201cThe F.C.C. needs a more evidence-based approach,\u201d said Roslyn Layton, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who was on Mr. Trump\u2019s F.C.C. transition team. \u201cNo one is writing in and asking for Title 2 reclassification of broadband. Consumers are complaining about unwanted calls and billing problems.\u201dThe changes have been a boon for telecommunications and cable firms that had for years fought unsuccessfully against a Democratic-led F.C.C.They have cheered Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to renominate Mr. Pai after his term ends in June. They want to overturn net neutrality and other rules so they can start offering new business plans that consumer groups have protested.\u201cThe repeal of net neutrality would be a clear positive for broadband network providers,\u201d analysts at Pacific Crest Securities wrote in a research note after the election. Internet service providers \u201cwould be able to charge for access to the network and for \u2018fast lanes,\u2019 which would increase potential monetization.\u201dMomentum is with the Republicans. Last month, they voted to overturn privacy rules (scheduled to take effect later this year) that required internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast to get permission from a customer before tracking and selling data browsing and app activity. Mr. Trump signed the measure on April 3.Lawmakers said the F.C.C.\u2019s rules were much stricter than any privacy requirements placed on web firms like Google and Facebook. They argued that the privacy watchdog duties should fall to the Federal Trade Commission, which does not have strong privacy regulations but requires companies to self-police the privacy policies they promise to customers.Republicans lawmakers moved against the privacy rules under the Congressional Review Act, a procedure used to overturn new agency rules.The lawmakers say their next target is the F.C.C.\u2019s declaration in 2015 that broadband should be treated like a common carrier service, such as the phone. That utility-like categorization strapped new rules on broadband providers.The F.C.C. chairman and lawmakers have promised to undo those rules soon. Ms. Blackburn said in an interview that the F.C.C. will likely create an order to overturn them.Democrats and consumer groups have protested, saying the internet has become essential for work, education and commerce, and needs greater oversight.\u201cThe recent weeks are prologue, and I am fearful that we are moving in a direction that will unravel and undo some incredible gains we\u2019ve made for consumers,\u201d said Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democratic commissioner at the F.C.C.The reclassification of broadband also served in 2015 as the foundation for the F.C.C.\u2019s net neutrality rules, which ban broadband providers from blocking or slowing down of traffic on the internet. Google, Facebook and Netflix have been the strongest corporate backers of net neutrality, but smaller start-ups could be most affected.Without strong net neutrality rules, an internet service provider like Verizon or Charter could give preference to certain content, making it harder for an independent streaming service like Vimeo to compete.An example is AT&T\u2019s free service offering mobile streaming of DirecTV videos to customers that does not count against data limits. Consumer groups have balked, saying the practice puts competing video providers at a disadvantage because their videos do count against those customers\u2019 monthly data limits.Mr. Pai has already signaled his approval of such \u201czero rating\u201d programs, saying they did not appear to violate net neutrality \u2014 and that they are popular with consumers. In January, he closed an investigation into zero-rating promotional streaming programs by AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile.Republicans will also look for ways to cut fat in programs they deem wasteful or abused. One target could be the Lifeline broadband subsidy for low-income households. Mr. Pai prevented nine providers from offering the subsidy weeks into his role at the F.C.C.He has also pointed to longtime media ownership rules that prevent a local TV station from also owning a newspaper in the same town. F.C.C. rules also prevent sharing of resources between TV stations. Mr. Pai has said the convergence of tech and media have made such rules too outdated. Companies like Netflix and Google are a bigger threat to broadcast television stations than media consolidation, Mr. Pai said.The greatest uncertainty surrounds telecom and tech mergers. AT&T\u2019s proposed $85 billion merger with Time Warner is being reviewed by antitrust officials at the Justice Department. Republicans are expected to be generally more permissive of mergers, but Mr. Trump remains the wild card.The president has said he would not allow the merger, and analysts say his complaints about news coverage by CNN, which is owned by Time Warner, could complicate the approval. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said he would not be influenced by politics in decisions at the agency.\u201cThis will be the first big test,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, who leads the investment firm Tusk Ventures. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t in Trump\u2019s wheelhouse, expect to get a more traditional Republican look at mergers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Misinformation on Facebook was not as big a problem as some believed it was, but Facebook nevertheless would do more to battle it, he pledged. Echo chambers were a concern, but if the source was people\u2019s own confirmation bias, was it really Facebook\u2019s problem to solve?It was hard to tell how seriously Zuckerberg took the criticisms of his service and its increasingly paradoxical role in the world. He had spent much of his life building a magnificent machine to bring people together. By the most literal measures, he\u2019d succeeded spectacularly, but what had that connection wrought? Across the globe, Facebook now seems to benefit actors who want to undermine the global vision at its foundation. Supporters of Trump and the European right-wing nationalists who aim to turn their nations inward and dissolve alliances, trolls sowing cross-border paranoia, even ISIS with its skillful social-media recruiting and propagandizing \u2014 all of them have sought in their own ways to split the Zuckerbergian world apart. And they are using his own machine to do it.Underneath it all was a nagging feeling of complicity. Trump had benefited from a media environment that is now shaped by Facebook \u2014 and, more to the point, shaped by a single Facebook feature, the same one to which the company owes its remarkable ascent to social-media hegemony: the computationally determined list of updates you see every time you open the app. The list has a formal name, News Feed. But most users are apt to think of it as Facebook itself.If it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that News Feed has become the most influential source of information in the history of civilization, it is only slightly so. Facebook created News Feed in 2006 to solve a problem: In the social-media age, people suddenly had too many friends to keep up with. At the time, Facebook was just a collection of profiles, lacking any kind of central organization. To figure out what any of your connections were up to, you had to visit each of their profiles to see if anything had changed. News Feed fixed that. Every time you open Facebook, it hunts through the network, collecting every post from every connection \u2014 information that, for most Facebook users, would be too overwhelming to process themselves. Then it weighs the merits of each post before presenting you with a feed sorted in order of importance: a hyperpersonalized front page designed just for you.Scholars and critics have been warning of the solipsistic irresistibility of algorithmic news at least since 2001, when the constitutional-law professor Cass R. Sunstein warned, in his book \u201cRepublic.com,\u201d of the urgent risks posed to democracy \u201cby any situation in which thousands or perhaps millions or even tens of millions of people are mainly listening to louder echoes of their own voices.\u201d (In 2008, I piled on with my own book, \u201cTrue Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society.\u201d) In 2011, the digital activist and entrepreneur Eli Pariser, looking at similar issues, gave this phenomenon a memorable name in the title of his own book: \u201cThe Filter Bubble.\u201dEmployees got the same message. \u201cWhen Facebook cares about something, they spin up teams to address it, and Zuck will come out and talk about it all the time,\u201d one former executive told me. \u201cI have never heard of anything close to that on the filter bubble. I never sensed that this was a problem he wanted us to tackle. It was always positioned as an interesting intellectual question but not something that we\u2019re going to go focus on.\u201dFacebook, under criticism, reinstated the picture, but the photo incident stuck with Zuckerberg. He would bring it up unbidden to staff members and to reporters. It highlighted, for him, the difficulty of building a policy framework for what Facebook was trying to do. Zuckerberg wanted to become a global news distributor that is run by machines, rather than by humans who would try to look at every last bit of content and exercise considered judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s something I think we\u2019re still figuring out,\u201d he told me in January. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to do here than what we\u2019ve done. And I think we\u2019re starting to realize this now as well.\u201dIt struck me as an unsatisfying answer, and it later became apparent that Zuckerberg seemed to feel the same way. On a Sunday morning about a month after the first meeting, I got a call from a Facebook spokesman. Zuckerberg wanted to chat again. Could Mike and I come back on Monday afternoon?What\u2019s striking about that 2012 letter, read through the prism of 2017, is its certainty that a more \u201copen and connected\u201d world is by definition a better one. \u201cWhen I started Facebook, the idea of connecting the world was not controversial,\u201d Zuckerberg said now. \u201cThe default assumption was that the world was incrementally just moving in that direction. So I thought we can connect some people and do our part in helping move in that direction.\u201d But now, he said, whether it was wise to connect the world was \u201cactually a real question.\u201dZuckerberg\u2019s new manifesto never quite accepts blame for any of the global ills that have been laid at Facebook\u2019s feet. Yet by the standards of a company release, it is remarkable for the way it concedes that the company\u2019s chief goal \u2014 wiring the globe \u2014 is controversial. \u201cThere are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone,\u201d Zuckerberg writes, \u201cand whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course.\u201d He also confesses misgivings about Facebook\u2019s role in the news. \u201cGiving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality.\u201dAt the time of our second interview, the manifesto was still only a draft, and I was surprised by how unsure Zuckerberg seemed about it in person. He had almost as many questions for us \u2014 about whether we understood what he was trying to say, how we thought it would land in the media \u2014 as we had for him. When I suggested that it might be perceived as an attack on Trump, he looked dismayed. He noted several times that he had been noodling over these ideas since long before November. A few weeks earlier, there was media speculation, fueled by a postelection tour of America by Zuckerberg and his wife, that he was laying the groundwork to run against Trump in 2020, and in this meeting he took pains to shoot down the rumors. When I asked if he had chatted with Obama about the former president\u2019s critique of Facebook, Zuckerberg paused for several seconds, nearly to the point of awkwardness, before answering that he had.Facebook\u2019s spokespeople later called to stress that Obama was only one of many people to whom he had spoken. In other words: Don\u2019t read this as a partisan anti-Trump manifesto. But if the company pursues the admittedly airy aims outlined in \u201cBuilding Global Community,\u201d the changes will echo across media and politics, and some are bound to be considered partisan. The risks are especially clear for changes aimed at adding layers of journalistic ethics across News Feed, which could transform the public\u2019s perception of Facebook, not to mention shake the foundations of its business.For the typical user, Cox explained when I met him on a morning in October at MPK20, News Feed is computing the relative merits of about 2,000 potential posts in your network every time you open the app. In sorting these posts, Facebook does not optimize for any single metric: not clicks or reading time or likes. Instead, he said, \u201cwhat you really want to get to is whether somebody, at the end of the day, would say, \u2018Hey, my experience today was meaningful.\u2019\u2009\u201d Personalizing News Feed, in other words, is a very big \u201cmath problem,\u201d incorporating countless metrics in extraordinarily complicated ways. Zuckerberg calls it \u201ca modern A.I. problem.\u201dLast summer, I sat in on two meetings in another glass-walled MPK20 conference room, in which News Feed\u2019s engineers, designers, user-research experts and managers debated several small alterations to how News Feed displays certain kinds of posts. The conversations were far from exciting \u2014 people in jeans on couches looking at PowerPoints, talking quietly about numbers \u2014 and yet I found them mesmerizing, a demonstration of the profound cultural differences between how news companies like The Times work and how Facebook does. The first surprise was how slowly things move, contrary to the freewheeling culture of \u201cthe hacker way.\u201d In one meeting, the team spent several minutes discussing the merits of bold text in a certain News Feed design. One blessing of making social software is that you can gauge any potential change to your product by seeing how your users react to it. That is also the curse: At Facebook, virtually every change to the app, no matter how small or obviously beneficial, is thoroughly tested on different segments of the audience before it\u2019s rolled out to everyone.The people who work on News Feed aren\u2019t making decisions that turn on fuzzy human ideas like ethics, judgment, intuition or seniority. They are concerned only with quantifiable outcomes about people\u2019s actions on the site. That data, at Facebook, is the only real truth. And it is a particular kind of truth: The News Feed team\u2019s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want \u2014 what they find \u201cmeaningful,\u201d to use Cox and Zuckerberg\u2019s preferred term \u2014 and to give them more of that.This ideal runs so deep that the people who make News Feed often have to put aside their own notions of what\u2019s best. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve all learned over the years is that our intuition can be wrong a fair amount of the time,\u201d John Hegeman, the vice president of product management and a News Feed team member, told me. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t expect will happen. And we learn a lot from that process: Why didn\u2019t that happen, and what might that mean?\u201d But it is precisely this ideal that conflicts with attempts to wrangle the feed in the way press critics have called for. The whole purpose of editorial guidelines and ethics is often to suppress individual instincts in favor of some larger social goal. Facebook finds it very hard to suppress anything that its users\u2019 actions say they want. In some cases, it has been easier for the company to seek out evidence that, in fact, users don\u2019t want these things at all.If a human editor ran News Feed, she would look at the clickbait scourge and make simple, intuitive fixes: Turn down the Upworthy knob. But Facebook approaches the feed as an engineering project rather than an editorial one. When it makes alterations in the code that powers News Feed, it\u2019s often only because it has found some clear signal in its data that users are demanding the change. In this sense, clickbait was a riddle. In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them? Was there something Facebook\u2019s algorithm was missing, some signal that would show that despite the clicks, clickbait was really sickening users?To answer these questions, Cox and his team hired survey panels of more than a thousand paid \u201cprofessional raters\u201d around the world who answer questions about how well News Feed is working. Starting in 2013, Facebook began adding first dozens and then hundreds and then thousands of data points that were meant to teach the artificial-intelligence system that runs News Feed how people were reacting to their feeds. Facebook noticed that people would sometimes click open a clickbaity story but spend very little time on it. In other cases, lots of people would click on a story but few would share or Like it. Headlines on stories that people seemed to reject often contained a set of signature phrases (\u201cyou\u2019ll never believe,\u201d \u201cthis one trick,\u201d etc.) or they came from a set of repeat-offender publishers.This approach \u2014 looking for signs of user dissatisfaction \u2014 could curb stories that constitute the most egregious examples of misinformation. Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s vice president in charge of News Feed, says that Facebook has begun testing an algorithm change that would look at whether people share an article after reading it. If few of the people who click on a story decide to share it, that might suggest people feel misled by it and it would get lower billing in the feed.But the solution to the broader misinformation dilemma \u2014 the pervasive climate of rumor, propaganda and conspiracy theories that Facebook has inadvertently incubated \u2014 may require something that Facebook has never done: ignoring the likes and dislikes of its users. Facebook believes the pope-endorses-Trump type of made-up news stories are only a tiny minority of pieces that appear in News Feed; they account for a fraction of 1 percent of the posts, according to Mosseri. The question the company faces now is whether the misinformation problem resembles clickbait at all, and whether its solutions will align as neatly with Facebook\u2019s worldview. Facebook\u2019s entire project, when it comes to news, rests on the assumption that people\u2019s individual preferences ultimately coincide with the public good, and that if it doesn\u2019t appear that way at first, you\u2019re not delving deeply enough into the data. By contrast, decades of social-science research shows that most of us simply prefer stuff that feels true to our worldview even if it isn\u2019t true at all and that the mining of all those preference signals is likely to lead us deeper into bubbles rather than out of them.\u201cAt some point, if they really want to address this, they have to say, \u2018This is good information\u2019 and \u2018This is bad information,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Emily Bell, the director for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School. \u201cThey have to say, \u2018These are the kinds of information sources that we want to privilege, and these others are not going to be banned from the platform, but they are not going to thrive.\u2019 In other words, they have to create a hierarchy, and they\u2019re going to have to decide how they\u2019re going to transfer wealth into the publishing market.\u201dDuring our first meeting in January, I posed this question to Zuckerberg: \u201cWhen you see various problems in the media, do you say to yourself, \u2018I run Facebook, I can solve that?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cUm,\u201d he started, and then paused, weighing his words as carefully as American presidents once did. \u201cNot usually.\u201d He argued that some of Facebook\u2019s critics\u2019 proposed fixes for news on the service, such as hiring editors, were impractical due to Facebook\u2019s scale and global diversity. Personalization, he said, remained a central tenet. \u201cIt really gets back to, like, what do people want at a deep level,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this oversimplified narrative that a company can get very successful by just scratching a very superficial itch, and I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s right over the long term.\u201dYet by our second meeting, Zuckerberg\u2019s position seemed to have evolved. Facebook had by then announced plans for the Facebook Journalism Project, in which the company would collaborate with news companies on new products. Facebook also created a project to promote \u201cnews literacy\u201d among its users, and it hired the former CNN news anchor Campbell Brown to manage the partnership between it and news companies. Zuckerberg\u2019s tone toward critics of Facebook\u2019s approach to news had also grown far more conciliatory. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to get to the core of the actual problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI also really think that the core social thing that needs to happen is that a common understanding needs to exist. And misinformation I view as one of the things that can possibly erode common understanding. But sensationalism and polarization and other things, I actually think, are probably even stronger and more prolific effects. And we have to work on all these things. I think we need to listen to all the feedback on this.\u201dStill, in both our conversation and his new manifesto, Zuckerberg remained preoccupied with the kind of problems that could be solved by the kind of hyperconnectivity he believed in, not the ones caused by it. \u201cThere\u2019s a social infrastructure that needs to get built for modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving more people oriented not just toward short-term things but toward building the long-term social infrastructure that needs to get built across all these things in order to enable people to come together is going to be a really important thing over the next decades.\u201d By way of example, he pointed to Safety Check, Facebook\u2019s system for letting people tell their friends that they\u2019ve survived some kind of dangerous event, like a natural disaster or terrorist attack.\u201cWe\u2019re getting to a point where the biggest opportunities I think in the world ... problems like preventing pandemics from spreading or ending terrorism, all these things, they require a level of coordination and connection that I don\u2019t think can only be solved by the current systems that we have,\u201d Zuckerberg told me. What\u2019s needed, he argues, is some global superstructure to advance humanity.This is not an especially controversial idea; Zuckerberg is arguing for a kind of digital-era version of the global institution-building that the Western world engaged in after World War II. But because he is a chief executive and not an elected president, there is something frightening about his project. He is positioning Facebook \u2014 and, considering that he commands absolute voting control of the company, he is positioning himself \u2014 as a critical enabler of the next generation of human society. A minor problem with his mission is that it drips with megalomania, albeit of a particularly sincere sort. With his wife, Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg has pledged to give away nearly all of his wealth to a variety of charitable causes, including a long-term medical-research project to cure all disease. His desire to take on global social problems through digital connectivity, and specifically through Facebook, feels like part of the same impulse.Yet Zuckerberg is often blas\u00e9 about the messiness of the transition between the world we\u2019re in and the one he wants to create through software. Building new \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d usually involves tearing older infrastructure down. If you manage the demolition poorly, you might undermine what comes next. In the case of the shattering media landscape, Zuckerberg seems finally to have at least noticed this problem and may yet come up with fixes for it. But in the meantime, Facebook rushes headlong into murky new areas, uncovering new dystopian possibilities at every turn.Just as quickly, though, Zuckerberg then pivoted to Facebook\u2019s next marvel, a system for digitally augmenting your pictures and videos. The technical term for this is \u201caugmented reality.\u201d The name bursts with dystopian possibilities \u2014 fake news on video rather than just text \u2014 but Zuckerberg never mentioned them. The statesman had left the stage; before us stood an engineer.Farhad Manjoo is a technology columnist for The New York Times. He is working on a book about what he calls the Frightful Five: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 the five technology giants that are swallowing up the rest of the economy.Advertisement"}

Why would I ever want to buy a GPS unit?The major maps apps are excellent, with awesome traffic information. If I\u2019m going for a short jaunt around town, I\u2019ll always grab my phone. But for longer trips, especially, dedicated car-GPS devices have some advantages.Like what?One big advantage is that GPS devices don\u2019t rely on a data connection to plot a route. They have the map data stored inside. I\u2019ve used my phone to navigate to a rural area \u2014 say, upstate Vermont \u2014 and since the app cached the original route, it got me there just fine. But when I went to navigate out, I didn\u2019t have a data connection. So, I was out of luck.There are some apps that let you download the route and map information so you don\u2019t have that problem, but you have to plan ahead, whereas a GPS you keep in your glovebox is always ready to go.OK, but what does a good GPS unit cost? Is it worth that much to avoid dead zones?Still, having a GPS frees your phone for other uses, such as music or calls. And the latest GPS units are now multitasking in ways that a phone\u2019s navigation app can\u2019t.For example, Garmin\u2019s entire Drive lineup can connect to a backup camera. And there are higher-end \u201ccombo models\u201d that integrate a dash cam. Traditionally, a dash cam is primarily for keeping a record in case of an accident, but some of these new GPS models can also provide some pretty advanced safety features, such as forward-collision warnings, lane-departure alerts, and even the ability to automatically send a text if there\u2019s a crash.Those are features we\u2019ve come to expect from new cars, but up until now were difficult to find as aftermarket add-ons for older or more basic cars. These camera-based units don\u2019t work as well as an expensive built-in system with multiple sensors, but they\u2019re still handy features that can help combat distracted driving.What about the color-coded roads on Google Maps that warn of delays? And the Waze app, which warns of the police and accidents ahead?Phone apps definitely have better traffic information than GPS devices. That\u2019s partly why I will grab my phone for around-town jaunts. The accuracy of Google Maps traffic is awesome. My wife will be checking it as I\u2019m driving and will say, right around this bend, it turns red. And sure enough, the traffic slows way down right at that spot.GPS devices provide traffic warnings, and a lot of them also now connect to a phone via Bluetooth for \u201clive traffic,\u201d but they don\u2019t measure up to Google or Waze in that regard.The better GPS units have better onscreen directions, especially at tricky interchanges, and they have more precise voice directions. While most navigation systems say \u201cTurn on such-and-such street.\u201d Garmins, for example, now say, \u201cTurn at the traffic light\u201d or even \u201cat the red building.\u201d This landmark-type voice guidance makes it easier to find your turn, especially when it\u2019s not easy to see the street signs.How do you test all the different GPS device models?While we\u2019ve compared the specs and features for more than 100 models, we\u2019ve done three rounds of hands-on testing with about 20. Most of the nitty-gritty testing is done over weeks inside a car while we use the units for everyday driving.At times, I have mounted three units on the windshield at once \u2014 one from each major brand \u2014 to see how they compare under the same circumstances. That\u2019s a challenge. I now record those sessions with a GoPro camera, so I can better keep my eyes on the road.Advertisement"}

As a bonus, each one comes with a largely blank case back: just the thing for an inscription celebrating a college graduation or a first job. Rolex\u2019s lower-priced sister brand continues to deliver bang for the buck. With its fixed stainless-steel tachymeter, the new Chrono feels both sporty and vintage. The big news for watch geeks is the new MT5813 movement in collaboration with \u2014 brace yourself \u2014 Breitling. Cooperation, even with rivals, is very Swiss, they say. Maybe that\u2019s how they stay neutral. Two years ago, the dawn of the smartwatch era was the talk of Baselworld. Now the smartwatch simply is. Movado is closing the gap between a stylish watch and a wrist computer with this sleek model, featuring Google\u2019s Android Wear 2.0 platform and five customizable versions of its minimalist Museum dial. At roughly the price of a new Porsche 911, Patek\u2019s latest showstopper is hardly cheap. Then again, it\u2019s Patek. The brand\u2019s well-heeled obsessives are toasting the retro-inflected cream-color dial of this perpetual calendar (which tracks the date for perpetuity, including leap years and months with 28 or 30 days) on a design that recalls Patek classics from the 1940s and 1950s. Hey, at least it\u2019s not priced like a Bentley. Celebrating the 60th anniversary of one of the most famous watches ever (a watch that astronauts would eventually take to the moon), Omega introduced this lovely and letter-perfect homage to the original Speedy, designed from a digital scan of the \u201950s original. It can be purchased individually or as part of the Trilogy collector\u2019s set, along with remakes of the 1957 Seamaster and Railmaster.Unlike more discreet watchmakers, Hublot is not the kind of brand that is going to install a tourbillon \u2014 the grandest of complications \u2014 and keep it hidden under the dial. With this limited-edition statement piece, the rock star of watch brands has included a tourbillon rotating on two axes inside its own display window, for maximum visibility. If you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it. An earlier version of this article misstated the price of the Longines Heritage 1945 watch. It is $1,800, not $1,700.Advertisement"}

We prefer the more polite modern term: \u201cfandom.\u201d When it comes to the objects of our own fascination, we are proud citizens under that flag.We were both noisy fans of Neil Gaiman well before we had the good fortune to meet him. (And it is a good fortune to meet Neil, to chat with him, to grow quiet in that chat and let the natural storyteller in him take over to beguile you with swirling half-sung sentences until a polite minder of the time taps him on the shoulder as he is expected elsewhere shortly, most likely the airport.) We had both bought multiple copies of his books, to lose, to lend, or just to have on that bookshelf too. We both very much wanted to see his indelible novel, \"American Gods,\" adapted into a television series worthy of its originality, visuals and voice.To be given the opportunity to adapt it ourselves is a level of deep-sea fandom few get to experience. Sometimes you make a show just because you want to sit back and see it.If that borders on obsession we welcome the water. We dive in head first.Humans have always sought to protect themselves from the dangers of an uncertain world, finding support in family, community and shared tradition. They have also created powerful allies: gods that they believe provide prosperity and safety in exchange for their worshippers\u2019 devotion. In \u201cAmerican Gods,\u201d the Starz TV series based on Neil Gaiman\u2019s acclaimed novel, these deities are very real, living amongst us in secret, their influence waxing and waning with society\u2019s changing views. If America had only one god in its short history, it would likely be capitalism. In the decade following the 1848 discovery of gold in the California territory, prospectors from across the country became obsessed with striking it rich out West. Early on, the daily wage for miners was 20 dollars \u2014 a powerful draw for workers elsewhere, like those earning just 88 cents a day building the Erie Canal. To new arrivals \u2014 many of whom had spent their life savings to get there \u2014 the territory\u2019s freedom from government was an added incentive. But this lax society had an inevitable downside: Thievery and violence were commonplace, as were illicit industries that sprang up catering to the influx of forty-niners. The effect of the Gold Rush was quickly apparent. California\u2019s population swelled from less than 8,000 in 1846 to 380,000 by 1860. Eventually, the Gold Rush faded, but the Golden State has retained its place in the American imagination as a beacon of new opportunities.Today, mining for data is more valuable than finding gold. Now it\u2019s engineers, entrepreneurs and computer scientists who seek fortunes in the West to become the new gods of Silicon Valley. The Bay Area is full of modern prospectors trying to get a taste of what the gold miners were searching for \u2014 and today, many actually do win big. When Google went public in 2004, over 900 employees instantly became millionaires. Similar stories abound at Facebook, Twitter and other former startups. And often striking it rich once isn\u2019t enough: Serial entrepreneurs sometimes have multiple successes or equally spectacular failures. Also, like its predecessor, today\u2019s gold rush has been riven with epic battles, betrayals, windfalls and scams \u2014 but contracts and lawsuits have generally replaced violence as tools for revenge.

{"Headline": "A Murder Posted on Facebook Prompts Outrage and Questions Over Responsibility", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Easter, Steve Stephens drove around downtown Cleveland on what he said was a mission to commit murder \u2014 and soon he had an audience of millions for his shooting of Robert Godwin Sr., 74, which he recorded and posted on Facebook, the police in Cleveland said.On Monday, the authorities nationwide were looking for Mr. Stephens, 37, with the police as far away as Philadelphia saying they had received calls about sightings of him in that area.Now Facebook is facing a backlash over the shooting video, as it grapples with its role in policing content on its global platform.The situation is increasingly fraught for Facebook. Even as it has become a forum for more sensational events, live and otherwise, it has said it does not want to be a media company that overly arbitrates what is posted on its site. But the more reluctant it is to intervene or the slower it is to respond, the more it may open itself to the posting of killings, sexual assaults and other crimes.\u201cAny of these platforms \u2014 especially live ones \u2014 encourages users to perform,\u201d said Elizabeth Joh, a law professor at the University of California, Davis. \u201cShould Facebook have a duty to rescue a crime victim? Should we, or is it O.K. for thousands or millions of people to watch a crime unfold without doing anything except sharing it?\u201d\u201cIt was a horrific crime \u2014 one that has no place on Facebook, and goes against our policies and everything we stand for,\u201d Mr. Osofsky wrote.But the attention is often focused on Facebook because of its nearly two billion users and global influence. It is an issue that is bedeviling Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive. Facebook has encouraged users to post more \u2014 it has spent the last two years emphasizing its push into photographs and video, underpinned by a thesis that cameras have become more important in how people share moments of their lives with their friends.The problems have been compounded by the issue of fake news \u2014 false stories across the social network that some Facebook users have taken as true and that may have swayed thinking in events like elections. Mr. Zuckerberg has had to address the fake news problem several times in recent months, including working more closely with fact-checking organizations and beginning efforts to teach Facebook users how to discern what is or is not a real news story.Initiatives such as Facebook Live have been embraced by Facebook users and advertisers. Video advertising, one of the largest growth areas for Facebook and others, commands a premium compared with traditional photo and text ad formats. The more users acclimate to posting and viewing video content across these platforms, the easier it will be for the companies to sell higher-priced advertisements against them.Yet monitoring the content is imperfect. Because Facebook\u2019s network of users is so vast, the company relies on a combination of artificial intelligence, human moderators and alerts from users to flag objectionable content. If many people report an instance of offensive or harmful content at once, Facebook\u2019s algorithms will show the post to a global team of human content moderators, who will review it and decide if it violates Facebook\u2019s terms of service.\u201cThe more users are posting every aspect of their lives online, including criminally heinous conduct, the more companies have to take a proactive approach to content moderation rather than relying just on users to flag content for review,\u201d said Hemanshu Nigam, founder of SSP Blue, an advisory company for online safety, security and privacy.\u201cFacebook does, however, work well with law enforcement, as is clear from the ongoing investigation and their active support in it,\u201d he said.Mr. Stephens\u2019s video on Facebook, which lasts about a minute, shows a driver pulling up to an older man on a sidewalk. The driver asks the man to say a person\u2019s name, then pulls out a gun and shoots the man. Afterward, the victim can be seen on the sidewalk, with a streak of what appears to be blood near his head.The police originally said that Mr. Stephens had broadcast the shooting on Facebook Live, but Facebook said that while he had posted a live video at some point on Sunday, the shooting itself was not live. By late Sunday afternoon, the video had been removed from Facebook and the account had been deactivated.In a second video that was posted on Facebook, Mr. Stephens explained his actions by saying, \u201cI\u2019m at the point where I snapped.\u201dA warrant was issued for Mr. Stephens on a charge of aggravated murder, and the police asked people in Indiana, Michigan, New York, northeast Ohio and Pennsylvania to be on alert. A $50,000 reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Christopher Mele from New York.

Now it is dedicated to commercializing digital-age hardware start-ups.On Thursday, New Lab announced that 14 of its companies, including StrongArm, are joining an urban technology initiative with the New York City Economic Development Corporation. The goal is to generate technology for urban challenges ranging from traffic congestion to local food cultivation.That you don\u2019t have to be a giant company to have a good hardware idea has been evident for years at Maker Faire events, where inventors showcase their homemade engineering projects. Last year, more than one million people attended Maker Faire events worldwide.Enthusiastic amateurs can matter a lot in technology. Hobbyists led the personal computer revolution, before it morphed into a huge industry.But progress in hardware \u2014 the messy physical world \u2014 tends to take longer than in the digital-only realm of software. For a decade now, cloud computing and open-source software have drastically lowered the cost of starting a software company. So the number of software start-ups has surged.Now, it seems, is the time for hardware, where a similar phenomenon is getting underway. It is helped by the software trend, but it is really driven by new hardware tools like 3-D printing and laser cutters as well as low-cost, open-source hardware that allows for rapid prototyping that accelerates the pace of development.This nascent hardware resurgence is difficult to measure precisely. The start-ups are working in many industries, from manufacturing to health care, and research analysts typically classify them as entrants in those industries rather than hardware companies.But there are signs of a groundswell of high-tech hardware start-ups, beyond breakout companies like the electric carmaker Tesla and Nest Labs, the digital thermostat company, which Google bought for $3.2 billion and is now a subsidiary of the parent company, Alphabet.Funding is becoming more plentiful from traditional venture capitalists, the venture arms of major corporations and venture funds that are dedicated to hardware start-ups, like Bolt and Lemnos Labs. The companies in New Lab, for example, have raised more than $250 million.For most companies in New Lab, the Brooklyn center is headquarters, and where their design and development are done. As the hardware start-ups grow, how much manufacturing will be done in the city is an open question.New Lab offers hardware makers free or low-cost access to 3-D printers, laser cutters and other manufacturing equipment. That has been a lure for companies like StrongArm.\u201cWhat we do requires a ton of equipment, and that\u2019s what got us in the door,\u201d said Sean Petterson, the company\u2019s 26-year-old co-founder and chief executive.A handful of corporate partners, including General Electric, Intel, JetBlue, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Autodesk, have signed up to work with the New Lab start-ups in various ways.The cities of Copenhagen and Barcelona, Spain, also plan joint innovation programs with the Brooklyn hardware center. And New Lab says it is setting up a fund, New Lab Ventures, to invest in its companies, with a goal of raising $50 million.\u201cWe need to be constantly learning, connecting with new companies coming up, and seeing new business models earlier,\u201d Ms. Comstock said.New Lab itself began as a test-and-learn start-up. In 2013, it created a \u201cbeta\u201d space nearby in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in a building with 8,000 square feet. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t obvious that companies would want to come here,\u201d said David Belt, chief executive of New Lab.But come they did. New Lab has fielded more than 400 applications to select its 80 companies. An idea and enthusiasm are not enough to make the grade. Companies, Mr. Belt explained, must have a product and usually a seed round of funding.Mr. Belt and his partner at New Lab, Scott Cohen, also recruited companies they thought could contribute a lot to their hardware community and mentor younger outfits.Nanotronics Imaging was one of them. The company, founded in 2010, grew out of the research of Matthew Putman, then a scientist at Columbia University. Its automated microscopes employ artificial intelligence and robotics to analyze and detect flaws in high-tech manufacturing for semiconductor, aerospace and other industries.In addition to the 3-D printers and other prototyping equipment at New Lab, Justin Stanwix, chief revenue officer at Nanotronics, said a vital asset of the Brooklyn work space was the connections and idea-swapping to improve manufacturing, tap investors and manage intellectual property.\u201cThat really helps mitigate the risks for these start-up companies,\u201d Mr. Stanwix said.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

You can mostly relax now. How about a nice crossword puzzle?Of course, if you\u2019re just starting out as a solver, you wouldn\u2019t want to begin with a Saturday puzzle. Saturday crosswords are the most difficult ones of the week, but you can always delve into our archive of early-week puzzles.On the other hand, if you can establish a foothold, there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t enjoy this solid puzzle by Peter Wentz. The clues will keep you guessing, but go slowly. Pour yourself another cup of [insert your choice of beverage here.] Scan the clue list for low-hanging fruit or, as we like to call them, gimmes. Do you like hockey? Then you are probably familiar with JAGR Jaromir. How about, um, (looks up ESIASON on Google) football? Sure, you like football, and you knew that Boomer ESIASON was the 1988 N.F.L. M.V.P. from the Cincinnati Bengals. And we all know that we don\u2019t put METAL in the microwave, right?My point is, even on Saturday, these clues are edited so that there is usually something for everyone in the puzzle. Find those clues and write the answers into the grid. You won\u2019t believe how much having a few entries confidently written into a Saturday puzzle can do for your solving self-esteem.Because you\u2019ll need it. I wrote in AIM for \u201cReady follower?\u201d, as in \u201cReady, aim, fire!\u201d instead of \u201cReady, SET, go!\u201d I misread the clue at 47D (\u201cSwimmer Thorpe with five Olympic gold medals\u201d) and wrote in JIM, only to be mystified to see JIM elsewhere in the puzzle (that\u2019s a constructing no-no).But the rewards are there if you keep going. Clue of the Day for me was \u201cOnes counting down to vacation time?\u201d for SPACE TOURISTS, which is an entry that makes its debut today. You get to meet THE JONESES you\u2019ve been trying to keep up with for all these years at 56A. You get to be completely flummoxed at 43D because you solved using the crossings and then you went back to look at the clue and couldn\u2019t parse DOTEDU or what it had to do with a school closing. Then you get to leave a divot in your forehead when you realize that the answer is DOT EDU, the typical internet ending (or closing) for a school website.And say you don\u2019t finish. So what? You showed up and you got somewhere, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. You made progress. You moved forward in your solving. Good for you. All of that should leave you feeling good. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u25a0 49A: I got Louis VI confused with Louis the XIV (those darned Roman numerals!) and thought the answer was SUN, as in the Sun King, but that wouldn\u2019t have made much sense, given the clue (\u201cEpithet for Louis VI, with \u2018the\u2019\u201d). Louis VI was nicknamed Louis the FAT.\u25a0 4D: I\u2019m not a big action flick person, but apparently actor Jason Statham starred in \u201cTHE MECHANIC\u201d in 2011.Looking at this puzzle again with fresh eyes, it feels clean and well arranged, and is of solid quality all around.I do wish I had added a little more sizzle with the longer answers. There are many good entries, and even more excellent clues, many of which belong to the editorial team, so this should (hopefully!) still be a fun solve.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Google Cashes In on the Space Right Under the Search Bar", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Before Sergey Brin and Larry Page founded Google, they wrote a research paper as doctoral students at Stanford University in which they questioned the appropriateness of ads on search engines.How times change. Two decades later, it\u2019s not unusual for a smartphone user to see only ads on a Google search page before scrolling down to the regular results.When Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, reports earnings this week, the internet giant\u2019s big profits are expected to demonstrate yet again that the billboard space accompanying Google queries is the web\u2019s most valuable real estate for advertisements.In the 17 years since Google introduced text-based advertising above search results, the company has allocated more space to ads and created new forms of them. The ad creep on Google has pushed \u201corganic\u201d (unpaid) search results farther down the screen, an effect even more pronounced on the smaller displays of smartphones.The changes are profound for retailers and brands that rely on leads from Google searches to drive online sales. With limited space available near the top of search results, not advertising on search terms associated with your brand or displaying images of your products is tantamount to telling potential customers to spend their money elsewhere.In recent years, Google has served more product ads and expanded their availability to more general search terms \u2014 for example, showing photo ads on a search for \u201crunning shoes,\u201d not just \u201cNike Air Max.\u201d It has also tinkered with the size, location and number of ads on results pages for both computers and smartphones.Retailers are snapping up product ads. They accounted for 52 percent of all Google search ad spending by retailers in the first quarter of 2017, versus 8 percent in 2011, according to the digital marketing agency Merkle.\u201cP.L.A.s takes the search engine results page to a different level,\u201d said Andy Taylor, Merkle\u2019s associate director of research.A Google spokeswoman said the company\u2019s goal had always been to quickly give people the best search results.\u201cOur goal has always been to deliver results that people find immediately useful, which is even more important on mobile devices with smaller screens,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Chi Hea Cho. \u201cFor most queries, we show no ads, and we recently removed right-hand text ads for all queries. For highly commercial queries, our extensive testing shows that people find relevant ads and offers extremely useful.\u201dOn a search result, Reef is competing with other manufacturers of flip-flops, as well as retail partners selling Reef sandals. On a desktop computer, a Google search for \u201cReef flip-flops\u201d brought back three text ads above the search results \u2014 one from Reef, one from Zappos and one from Amazon \u2014 selling Reef sandals. There were also nine image-based product listing ads displaying different Reef sandals for sale; only three were offered by reef.com while the rest were ads from other retailers.On a mobile phone, Reef is competing with even more retailers. The same search brought back only Reef\u2019s text ad, but below a scrolling carousel featuring more than 20 image ads for different types of Reef flip-flops. Only the first two images linked to reef.com.\u201cWe\u2019re competing against each other,\u201d Jessica Levens, director of e-commerce at Reef, said about the company\u2019s retail partners. \u201cWe need to spend the dollars to defend that real estate.\u201dMs. Levens said the advertising strategy was effective, although she had to convince her chief financial officer about the wisdom of spending more. Those product campaigns helped triple sales that started from online queries, including instances where customers searched without including the Reef brand name.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to rely simply on organic\u201d search, said Caitlin Aylward, a senior associate at L2, a research and advisory firm for consumer brands. \u201cThe winner in all this is Google.\u201dAndreas Reiffen, chief executive of the search engine marketing firm Crealytics, said Google\u2019s revenue from P.L.A.s on smartphones was more than double its revenue from text ads, because it can place three product ads in the same space as a single text ad, and consumers are more likely to click on image-based ads than text-based ones.The rise of product ads is also a reflection of a shift to people doing more searches on mobile phones. Google\u2019s mobile searches surpassed desktop queries for the first time last year. That\u2019s important for product ads, because P.L.A.s take up a larger proportion of phone displays, and Google increased the size of those mobile ads in 2015 to make them stand out even more.Alphabet doesn\u2019t break out revenue from search ads, but growth in paid clicks on Google\u2019s web properties \u2014 search, Gmail and YouTube, among others \u2014 is accelerating. It rose 40 percent last year, after an increase of 33 percent in 2015. At the same time, the average price of Google ads fell 13 percent in 2016, in part because mobile ads and P.L.A.s are less expensive than traditional desktop text ads.While retailers and brands may feel like they have no choice but to spend on search advertising, many do so willingly because it works. Kristi Argyilan, a senior vice president of marketing at Target, said search advertising was accounting for a larger portion of her digital spending because the ads were \u201cbecoming so useful\u201d and more relevant.Traffic from product listing ads accounted for more than 10 percent of sales on Target\u2019s website, while information in the ads, like whether a nearby store has inventory of a popular product, has provided important information to consumers.\u201cThe ads are becoming more purposeful,\u201d Ms. Argyilan said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Man Arrested in Killing of a New York Woman Jogging in Massachusetts", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byA 31-year-old man has been charged in the August death of a jogger who was found naked and partly burned in a wooded area near her mother\u2019s house in rural Massachusetts, the authorities said Saturday.The police tracked down Angelo Colon-Ortiz after investigators spent months following two strong but incomplete leads. People reported seeing a dark-colored sport utility vehicle near where the jogger, Vanessa Marcotte, 27, died. Witness accounts and DNA retrieved from her hands suggested the killer might be a Hispanic man about 30 years old.Those clues came together last week when a state trooper in Worcester spotted a man matching that description driving the same kind of vehicle. The trooper traced the license plate to Mr. Colon-Ortiz and met him at his apartment, and he voluntarily provided a DNA sample, the authorities said.The DNA samples came back as a match on Friday afternoon, Joseph D. Early Jr., the Worcester County district attorney, said at a news conference on Saturday.\u201cWe got him,\u201d Mr. Early said.The death of Ms. Marcotte, a marketing account manager at Google in New York City, caused alarm in Massachusetts and beyond for its apparent randomness and its striking resemblance to the death of a jogger in Queens five days before.Ms. Marcotte was visiting her hometown, Princeton, Mass., when she left her mother\u2019s house for a run on a country road in the afternoon of Aug. 7. After she was missing for two hours, the police began to search for her.A canine unit found Ms. Marcotte\u2019s body that night about a half-mile from the home, in a wooded area off a two-lane road. It was the first killing in Princeton in three decades. Ms. Marcotte, who often visited her mother on the weekends, was expected to return to New York that day.At first, the police offered few concrete clues but later said it appeared Ms. Marcotte tried to fight off her attacker, possibly leaving the person with scratches and bruises. In February, the authorities said that DNA collected from her hands during her autopsy helped create a possible suspect profile: an athletic, light-skinned Hispanic or Latino male with short hair and about 30 years old.Mr. Early declined to say Saturday whether Ms. Marcotte\u2019s death was the brutal result of a random encounter, or whether the attacker knew her. But Mr. Early said they believe that Mr. Colon-Ortiz, who lives in Worcester, was working in and around Princeton, about 20 miles away, when she was killed. Mr. Early also declined to reveal the man\u2019s occupation.At the news conference, Mr. Early credited Ms. Marcotte for helping to lead the police to the arrest. \u201cIt was through her determined fight and efforts that we obtained the DNA of her killer,\u201d he said.Mr. Colon-Ortiz was charged with aggravated assault and battery, and assault with attempt to rape. He is being held on $10 million bail. Mr. Early said Mr. Colin-Ortiz will likely be charged with murder in the coming days. He did not appear to have a criminal record, Mr. Early said.Advertisement"}

At the evening\u2019s conclusion, everyone was asked which of the many credit cards in their wallets they might consider using to pay.\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be American Express,\u201d one diner said. \u201cI feel like that would be braggy, like I\u2019m trying to prove I\u2019m a big shot.\u201dThat blue card, executives at American Express knew, was the Chase Sapphire Reserve, a wedge of plastic and metal that was already giving the Amex brass night terrors. In August, Chase released the Sapphire Reserve with an audacious sign-up bonus of 100,000 points and a smorgasbord of cardholder benefits, setting off an avalanche of applications from millennials and a flood of social media postings exalting the awesomeness of Chase.A credit card, mystifyingly, had suddenly become cool. And what really got under Amex executives\u2019 skin was that Chase was succeeding by, essentially, copying the American Express playbook and chasing the same up-and-coming elites who had traditionally joined Amex\u2019s ranks.A few months later, one of American Express\u2019s top executives confessed at a conference that \u201cI am deeply paranoid about these types of competitive assaults on our customer base.\u201d Then, the company announced a slew of new cardholder perks that seemed suspiciously timed to beat back Chase\u2019s enticements.The paranoia flowed even deeper within American Express\u2019s offices, according to seven current and former executives at the company who shared their insights on the condition of anonymity because they were fairly certain they would get fired if they were named.It was one thing for the company to fight a rewards war by offering ever-sweeter travel points and bonuses to attract new cardholders. Amex had waged such battles plenty of times.This challenge, however, seemed different. Inside Amex\u2019s plushly carpeted New York offices and between rounds of squash, the company\u2019s leaders began asking one another: Could it be that American Express, the card that had defined ostentatious luxury and capitalist striving since the 1980s, was on the brink of becoming pass\u00e9? What kinds of hoops would Amex need to jump through to attract these new hoodie-wearing moguls and young tycoons?Was it possible \u2014 and this really gave everyone the sweats \u2014 that millennials would never be convinced that income inequality was something they should aspire to?For more than 30 years American Express has reaped enormous profits by telling its customers that they are successful, elite, the cream of the moneyed crop \u2014 and, with mottos like \u201cMembership Has Its Privileges,\u201d that there\u2019s no better way to make certain everyone knows just how special you are than by pulling an Amex out of your wallet.And for decades, that pitch worked marvelously. American Express has become a financial behemoth with more than 109 million cardholders around the world. Nearly every year \u2014 at least until recently \u2014 more and more people paid American Express up to $7,500 for the privilege of carrying cards that are very similar to the ones Visa and MasterCard give away free.But in the last few years, Amex\u2019s hold on our affluent fantasies has started to wobble. Last year, for instance, the number of American Express cards in use declined by almost 18 percent, according to industry analysts. Amex\u2019s 2016 revenue was down more than $2 billion from two years before. And the company\u2019s relationships with Costco and JetBlue \u2014 long big sources of new cardholders \u2014 summarily ended when those firms found alternative credit card partners.One of the big reasons for those stumbles is that other financial companies, most notably Chase and Citibank, have started beating Amex at its own game, often by hiring the same executives who built Amex. The head of Citibank\u2019s credit card division as well as the heads of its branded cards, global rewards, customer acquisition, proprietary products and analytics all came from American Express. The woman credited with creating Chase\u2019s Sapphire Reserve is an Amex alum, as are her boss and two top colleagues.But there is also the problem of simple demographics. Amex, like all credit card companies, desperately needs new customers each year, preferably ones with decades of spending ahead of them. Hence the focus on millennials.\u201cTraditionally, American Express succeeds because of its customer service,\u201d said David Robertson, publisher of the industry newsletter The Nilson Report. \u201cThey can book travel for you, they have concierges to recommend the best restaurants. If you leave your reading glasses inside a hotel room in Budapest, Amex will get them mailed back to you. No one else does that.\u201dMillennials, however, don\u2019t really need travel agents or concierges: They have Priceline and Yelp. Nor are they traditionally fans of opera, ballet, Dom P\u00e9rignon tastings, or the other high-culture events Amex can get cardholders into. If you leave your reading glasses in Budapest, it\u2019s probably faster to order new ones from Warby Parker, which is pretty cheap to begin with.The Chase Sapphire Reserve \u2014 which in the seven months since it was released has signed up more than a million cardholders, half of whom are under 35 \u2014 is all about emphasizing what cardholders can do, rather than what they can buy.\u201cThe message we send is, this isn\u2019t your father\u2019s credit card,\u201d said Pam Codispoti, who created the Chase Sapphire Reserve after 18 years at Amex. \u201cFor millennials, travel might mean taking an Uber to a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Chinatown, and then riding the subway to karaoke, and then catching a taxi home. So we\u2019re going to give you accelerated travel points on all that. This is a card for accumulating experiences.\u201dBut it\u2019s an uphill battle for Amex, in part because the company is fighting an image of conspicuous consumption it has cultivated for decades. Amex sold a dream about what success looks like, a universe where handsome men and glittering women murmur about second homes over decanters filled with expensive booze. The company declined to put executives on the phone for this column, but it did send an email explaining that cardholder benefits included \u201cpremium access to the Grand Prix de Monaco, a wine enthusiast\u2019s dream trip through French wine country and a global fashion tour with Harper\u2019s Bazaar\u201d \u2014 not exactly the hipster\u2019s bucket list.The other challenge is that many people who work at American Express aren\u2019t all that millennially minded themselves. If you visit Amex\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan, you\u2019ll find squared-jawed men in bespoke suits and fashion model-glamorous women, but not a lot of young people in the uppermost ranks. The company\u2019s chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, has led Amex for almost 16 years, an eternity in corporate America. In one Amex brainstorming session, according to an executive I spoke with, participants spent 10 minutes trying to figure out what FOMO meant before turning to Google.They discovered it stands for \u201cfear of missing out.\u201d It is unclear if the group recognized the irony.That said, there\u2019s every reason to believe that American Express will eventually solve this puzzle. Amex, it should be remembered, created a world where leaving your glasses in a Budapest hotel seems like a realistic concern \u2014 even to its many customers (myself among them) who have trouble finding Budapest on a map. A few years from now, who is to say that your Amex won\u2019t get you into a foam party at the Electric Daisy Carnival as easily as a cocktail party at the Met?And until then, the real winner of all these battles is the cardholders. The long dark winter of the financial crisis hangover is, finally, being made glorious summer by the tussles between Amex and its competitors. You might think millennials are spiritually poorer for substituting the dream of the Grand Prix de Monaco with the reality of a subway ride to the karaoke bar. But, don\u2019t feel too bad for them.In the meantime, they \u2014 and, by extension, all of us \u2014 are almost getting paid to spend.Follow Charles Duhigg on Twitter: @CDuhiggAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "NRG, a Power Company Leaning Green, Faces Activist Challenge", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byOver the years, NRG, a leading independent power producer whose fleet once depended heavily on coal, has made big bets on low-carbon energy technologies and publicized its embrace of sustainability as essential to its future.It pursued developing renewable energy for customers large and small and set aggressive goals to reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide \u2014 50 percent by 2030, and 90 percent by 2050.But now, the company finds its strategy challenged from within.Activist hedge-fund investors, intent on extracting value from NRG assets, have installed two directors on the board who, in one potential approach, would push to sell off some of the company\u2019s renewable-power projects, raising questions about how it would meet its clean-energy goals.It is but the latest skirmish in NRG\u2019s long struggle to make several kinds of energy products \u2014 conventional and renewable, large-scale and decentralized \u2014 profitable under one corporate umbrella.\u201cIn light of Mr. Smitherman\u2019s stated views on climate change, which are incompatible with NRG\u2019s disclosed business strategy and risks, we question his ability to act in the best interests of NRG and its shareholders,\u201d Mr. Stringer wrote in the letter. \u201cAdditionally, we believe his role on the board sends a demoralizing message to the many NRG employees responsible for implementing the company\u2019s existing business strategy and managing its risks.\u201dMr. Smitherman did not return an email or phone call seeking comment about his views and how the board shake-up might affect NRG\u2019s long-term strategies and goals.The conflict has its roots in efforts led by Elliott Management, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund run by Paul E. Singer, and Bluescape Energy Partners, run by C. John Wilder, a former executive at the Texas utility TXU who has been credited with its turnaround.Under Mr. Singer, an early titan of the hedge-fund industry who has also made a name for himself as a top Republican donor, Elliott has been known for its no-holds-barred approach to taking on companies and governments over its investments around the world.As an activist investor, Elliott quietly builds up equity stakes in companies until it has a big enough position to start rattling the cages of a company\u2019s management. In South Korea, Elliott became the first investor to publicly spar with Samsung, a conglomerate run by one of the country\u2019s most powerful corporate dynasties. In Argentina, Elliott was pilloried in the local press as a \u201cvulture\u201d investor for waging a decade-long battle with the government over its defaulted debt.In its investment in NRG, Elliott has so far remained largely behind the scenes. But in an emailed statement on Thursday, Elliott said that if a buyer in the market were willing to pay a premium for some of NRG\u2019s renewables businesses, \u201cit may be a good decision for NRG and its shareholders to crystallize that value.\u201dMost of the company\u2019s power plants run on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, but it has extensive wind and solar farms, including several unfinished projects it bought last year from SunEdison, which had gone bankrupt. Earlier this year, the company reported a loss of $891 million for 2016, largely because of low natural gas prices, down from a $6.4 billion loss the year before.As for investor concerns about the appointment of Mr. Smitherman, Elliott pointed to the fact that Mr. Smitherman had extensive knowledge of the Texas regulatory landscape. NRG is one of the largest energy suppliers in Texas, and some of its assets in the state could be considered for sale, requiring extensive knowledge of the regulatory hurdles.\u201cHaving someone with Mr. Smitherman\u2019s strong Texas-centric utility regulatory background is crucial to helping NRG navigate this process,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Looney, an Elliott spokesman.\u201cAt NRG, the debate is not over clean versus conventional generation,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Looney said. \u201cThe debate is simply over who is the best long-term owner of individual assets and fleets of assets that currently reside inside the broader NRG portfolio.\u201dMr. Smitherman, an ally of Rick Perry, the energy secretary and former Texas governor, was chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission, where he helped usher in the high-voltage transmission lines that spurred the development of a robust wind industry. He then ran the state Railroad Commission, which largely regulates the oil and gas industries.NRG has reeled in recent years as it has sought to transform itself from a conventional-energy giant into a leader in the clean-energy economy.\u201cNRG is caught between what we consider the next generation of power supply and the status quo,\u201d said Travis Miller, an energy and utilities analyst at Morningstar. \u201cThe move toward renewable energy and gas generation is a trend that won\u2019t stop anytime soon so every power generator is trying to develop a strategy where they can benefit from the transition period.\u201dDavid Crane, a former chief executive, had tried to do that by transforming the company into the Google of green energy, investing in big renewable-energy projects and buying small start-ups to help capture emerging markets like rooftop solar, electric-vehicle charging and home automation. But the company pulled back from those ambitions as a combination of low oil and gas prices and the threat of rising interest rates led to turbulence in the energy markets and skittishness among renewable-energy investors and the company\u2019s stock tumbled. Despite an elaborate reorganization aimed at cutting costs, reducing debt and better aligning the businesses with investors, Mr. Crane was pushed out in 2015, and replaced by Mauricio Gutierrez, the executive vice president and chief operating officer.Mr. Gutierrez has continued to pursue the company\u2019s sustainability and carbon reduction efforts, but in a more restrained way, focusing more on large-scale renewable projects and less on the emerging markets.The company, for instance, recently re-signed the Business Backs Low Carbon pledge organized by Ceres, an advocacy group.But corporate aims may end up in the hands of directors with a different agenda.In January, Elliott and Bluescape announced that they had each bought a large stake in NRG and were teaming up to put pressure on the company to make changes to its business. NRG was \u201cdeeply undervalued\u201d and could be worth more if its management undertook \u201coperational and financial improvements\u201d as well as \u201cstrategic initiatives,\u201d Elliott said at the time in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Elliott said that Mr. Wilder and his team had \u201cdirectly relevant experience in effectuating such improvements,\u201d adding that they were in a dialogue with the board.By February, NRG announced that it had struck an agreement with Elliott, which owned 6.9 percent of the company\u2019s stock, and Bluescape, which had 2.5 percent, to replace two outgoing directors and appoint Mr. Wilder and Mr. Smitherman.NRG also agreed to undertake a business review of the different parts of the company, including examining \u201cpotential portfolio and/or asset de-consolidations.\u201dThe company\u2019s renewables business is likely to be among the assets spun off. Some analysts have argued that those businesses are undervalued because they are housed within NRG\u2019s legacy business, which involves burning natural gas, coal and oil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Non-Techies Can Get With the Programming", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byWhen the Georgetown University Law Center offered computer programming last year, it was an experiment, a single class for about 20 students. It was filled almost instantly, and the waitlist swelled to 130. This semester, the law school has five programming classes, and the waitlist still overflowed.\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to become programmers, but they realize these are skills that will make them better lawyers,\u201d said Paul Ohm, the Georgetown law professor who teaches the course. His students, for example, learn to write short, tailored programs that can identify clusters of words and concepts in Supreme Court rulings more accurately than a Google search or standard legal software.It\u2019s the same in every field, from marketing to manufacturing to medicine. Code, it seems, is the lingua franca of the modern economy.So you have no plans to become a computer engineer, no dreams of being code wizard at Google or Facebook. But you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time to pick up practical technology knowledge and skills, including writing some code. There are options aplenty, in college classes, online courses and boot camps. The offerings range widely in terms of time required, skills mastered and price tag, from free to more than $20,000 for some six-month programs.Enrollment in computer science courses has exploded in recent years, with both majors and nonmajors fueling the surge \u2014 so much so that many schools now restrict enrollment by nonmajors.One recent institutional adaptation is the creation of so-called CS+X initiatives at schools like Stanford, Northwestern and the University of Illinois. These programs are hybrid majors that combine computing with other disciplines, including anthropology, comparative literature and history \u2014 a nod to the reality that software skills can advance research in nearly every field.But the main on-ramp to computing for non-techies is an introductory computer science class. Today, at many universities, at least half of the student population takes the intro courses. At Stanford, it\u2019s 90 percent.These classes include coding as a window to \u201ccomputational thinking,\u201d which involves abstract reasoning, modeling and breaking down problems into the recipelike steps of an algorithm. That kind of thinking, said Ed Lazowska, professor of computer science at the University of Washington, has become \u201can essential component of a 21st-century liberal arts education.\u201d\u201cProgramming,\u201d he said, \u201cis the hands-on, inquiry-based way we teach computational thinking.\u201dNot a computer whiz? Not a problem. Try these practice exam questions from Computer Science Principles.The programming language for an introductory course, professors say, is not so important, though Python, JavaScript and Java are widely used.David J. Malan, a computer science professor at Harvard, has students work in several different languages in his popular introductory course for majors and nonmajors, CS50. The main goal, he says, is to demystify technology and provide a foundation for students who want to go further. \u201cYou come to realize it\u2019s just one idea after another, layered on top of each other,\u201d Dr. Malan said.No matter what your academic or career path, he has this advice: Take at least one course in computer science. \u201cIt\u2019s just so useful and empowering,\u201d he said.At the nation\u2019s coding boot camps, the pitch has nothing to do with a liberal arts education. This thriving niche of the for-profit education business tightly links courses to the job market.Today, there are 91 coding campuses across the country, producing 18,000 graduates last year, up from fewer than 2,200 in 2013, Course Report says. Programs vary, but the average length is 13 weeks and average cost $11,500.Most boot camp programs are full-time immersives, and the curriculum is tightly focused on the skills most in demand in the marketplace \u2014 these days, web development and data analysis.But this young industry is evolving and adding short introductory sessions and online courses. At General Assembly, which operates 20 boot camp campuses, one of the most popular offerings is \u201cProgramming for Non-Programmers,\u201d said Jake Schwartz, the chief executive. The two-day version of the course costs $525. General Assembly also has a free online course, \u201cDash,\u201d which covers the basics of writing software for the web.When considering a boot camp, first sample the free offerings. \u201cTry it out before you commit your money,\u201d said Liz Eggleston, co-founder of Course Report.Coding camps are not regulated or accredited. Within the industry, initiatives are underway to establish standards for required reporting of graduation and job placement rates. The leading boot camps are disclosing those numbers already.Some universities have started their own coding camps. Their efforts are mainly courses added to continuing education programs, and tap the expertise of outside partners.Trilogy Education Services, which manages skills-based training programs, is working with the continuing education arms of more than 20 universities, including Northwestern, Rutgers, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of California, Berkeley. The six-month courses, with classes held evenings and weekends, cost nearly $10,000. The initial course is on web development, but a new one on data analysis and data visualization is being added.Students graduate with new skills and a portfolio of work, said Dan Sommer, chief executive of Trilogy, and they can qualify for certificates that verify they took and completed the curriculum.Coursera, edX and Udacity, three major providers of MOOCs, or massive open online courses, have evolved into hubs for teaching computing skills. Their most popular courses are nearly all programming and technical. On edX, the lone nonprofit, the course taken by more people than any other is the online version of Harvard\u2019s introduction to computer science, CS50. The course is free, but for $90 students get a certificate of completion.Labor market demand largely explains the dominance of computing offerings. But Richard C. Levin, the former president of Yale and chief executive of Coursera, suggests another factor. Digital subjects, he said, are more naturally suited to being taught online. \u201cYou really can do it yourself with technology courses,\u201d Dr. Levin said. \u201cOr at least you don\u2019t lose as much by not having the classroom experience as you do with the liberal arts.\u201dCoursera\u2019s classes can be taken free, but the track for earning a certificate costs $39 to $79 a month, depending on the course. Udacity has developed more than a dozen certificate-bearing programs it calls nanodegrees, including digital marketing, Android programming, artificial intelligence and self-driving car engineering. The course work is created in partnership with leading companies in those fields, like Facebook, Google, IBM and Mercedes-Benz. A nanodegree course typically costs $200 a month, but if you complete it within 12 months you get half your money back.Sebastian Thrun, the co-founder and chairman of Udacity, who is a former Stanford professor and Google scientist, said his company has found a way to improve the notoriously low completion rates for online courses. Add people.And as he sees it, success in programming requires a certain kind of human empathy. \u201cIt\u2019s a people skill,\u201d said Dr. Thrun, who created and led the self-driving car project at Google, \u201cgetting your brain inside the computer, to think like it does and understand that it\u2019s just a little device that can only do what it\u2019s told.\u201dSteve Lohr is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Google and Twitter Say About Trump\u2019s First 100 Days", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byThe rulers of the social media and search worlds have run their high-powered analytics to give us incisive new insight into President Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office.And the results, are \u2026 well, basically what you\u2019d expect.We now have data to support the claim that, yes, our commander in chief posts often on Twitter about the media and making America great; we also now know that people spent his first few months in office searching mostly for information about immigration and other related topics.But let\u2019s start with Mr. Trump himself.A less rigorous analysis by yours truly found that, by comparison, former President Barack Obama sent out a dozen messages on Twitter over that span; Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, however, sent a ton; Beyonc\u00e9 did not send any.Mr. Trump sent Twitter messages containing the word \u201cgreat\u201d most often, followed by \u201cAmerica/American\u201d and \u201cnews/media,\u201d according to Twitter. Other words in the top 10 included: \u201cjobs,\u201d \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cfake news.\u201dIn its 100-days report, Twitter said Mr. Trump was mentioned most on Jan. 20 \u2014 his inauguration. Users also mentioned the president frequently on Twitter when he signed controversial executive orders, when he claimed that Mr. Obama had him wiretapped and when one of Mr. Trump\u2019s senior advisers urged television viewers to buy fashion products marketed by his daughter.Google similarly found in its analysis that search interest in Mr. Trump peaked during his first day in office before beginning a gradual decline.Still, if Mr. Trump seeks a \u201cwin\u201d over Mr. Obama, he can now say that he was searched 140 percent more than the former president during their respective first 100 days, according to the Google Trends analysis released Wednesday.Among the questions people asked Google to answer the most in that period:\u2022 \u201cHow many executive orders has Trump signed?\u201d\u2022 \u201cWhat countries did Trump ban?\u2022 \u201cWhy did Trump bomb Syria?\u201dAnd although many of the issues that divide the country were among those that people searched most, one needs only to turn back to Twitter for a possible sign of unity.The president\u2019s most reposted message since Jan. 20?Maybe, just maybe, we all can just get along.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steve Ballmer Serves Up a Fascinating Data Trove", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byDealBookGuess what Steven A. Ballmer has been up to for the last several years. (No, not just cheering for the basketball team he owns, the Los Angeles Clippers.) It\u2019s a novel project, and he plans to take the wrapping off it Tuesday.But first the back story, which is a valuable prelude to a description of the project itself.When Mr. Ballmer retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014, he was only 57 and quickly realized \u201cI don\u2019t, quote, \u2018have anything to do.\u2019\u201dAs he looked for a new endeavor \u2014 before he decided to buy the Clippers \u2014 his wife, Connie, encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic efforts, an idea he initially rejected.\u201cBut come on, doesn\u2019t the government take care of the poor, the sick, the old?\u201d Mr. Ballmer recalled telling her. After all, he pointed out, he happily paid a lot of taxes, and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net.Her answer: \u201cA, it won\u2019t, because there are things government doesn\u2019t get to, and B, you\u2019re missing it.\u201dMr. Ballmer replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201dThat conversation led Mr. Ballmer to pursue what may be one of the most ambitious private projects undertaken to answer a question that has long vexed the public and politicians alike. He sought to \u201cfigure out what the government really does with the money,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cWhat really happens?\u201dWant to know how many police officers are employed in various parts of the country and compare that against crime rates? Want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking tickets and the cost to collect? Want to know what percentage of Americans suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it? That\u2019s in there. You can slice the numbers in all sorts of ways.Mr. Ballmer calls it \u201cthe equivalent of a 10-K for government,\u201d referring to the kind of annual filing that companies make.\u201cYou know, when I really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing, Amazon or Apple, I\u2019d get their 10-K and read it,\u201d he told me in a recent interview in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s wonky, it\u2019s this, it\u2019s that, but it\u2019s the greatest depth you\u2019re going to get, and it\u2019s accurate.\u201dIn an age of fake news and questions about how politicians and others manipulate data to fit their biases, Mr. Ballmer\u2019s project may serve as a powerful antidote. Using his website, USAFacts.org, a person could look up just about anything: How much revenue do airports take in and spend? What percentage of overall tax revenue is paid by corporations? At the very least, it could settle a lot of bets made during public policy debates at the dinner table.\u201cI would like citizens to be able to use this to form intelligent opinions,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cPeople can disagree about what to do \u2014 I\u2019m not going to tell people what to do.\u201d But, he said, people ought to base their opinions \u201con common data sets that are believable.\u201dSo how exactly does one go about collecting and ordering the nation\u2019s data?Before he started, Mr. Ballmer was convinced someone must have already done this.His first instinct, naturally, was to go to a search engine. \u201cMy favorite one, of course: I go to Bing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, I check it with Google, just to make sure there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m missing.\u201dBut neither option led him to what he was looking for.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at federal, state and local together,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a citizen, I don\u2019t care whether I give my money to A, B or C. I just want to know how it lands, how it impacts what\u2019s going on.\u201dWith an unlimited budget, he went about hiring a team of researchers in Seattle and made a grant to the University of Pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together. Altogether, he has spent more than $10 million between direct funding and grants.\u201cLet\u2019s say it costs three, four, five million a year,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to fund the damn thing.\u201dFor Mr. Ballmer, the experience has been worth every cent simply for the surprises that he has discovered looking at the data.\u201cI love this one!\u201d he said, showing me a slide of information about government employees. \u201cDon\u2019t look, don\u2019t look!\u201d He instructed me to cover my eyes from the number at the bottom of the page.\u201cHow many people work for government in the United States?\u201d he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. \u201cAlmost 24 million. Would you have guessed that?\u201d\u201cThen people say, \u2018Those damn bureaucrats!\u2019\u201d Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. \u201cWell, let\u2019s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education \u2014 they are government employees.\u201d And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows.\u201cAnd you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?\u201d Mr. Ballmer continued. \u201cWell, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201dSuddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we\u2019re very glad to have.\u201cNow people might not think they\u2019re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people \u2014 and most of these people you like,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said.His other big surprises?\u201cMost of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said, referring to various efforts to fight poverty that he has supported. \u201cI mean it\u2019s funny, but I didn\u2019t realize all these not-for-profits were in a sense almost like government contractors.\u201dMr. Ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical. He has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle. But as he speaks, you can tell that some of his findings from the new data \u2014 which rebut his preconceptions \u2014 could change his own politics.At one point, as he showed me the value of certain tax deductions and blurted out, \u201cIf you look at these tax deductions for employer-provided health or for state and local taxes or mortgage-interest deductions, they\u2019re really subsidies to the affluent, which I guess I hadn\u2019t thought about them.\u201d\u201cTake the mortgage deduction,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes. That is worth, to a middle-income family, a hundred bucks a year. I was a little surprised by that. You can have your own reaction; I was a little surprised by that.\u201dOne rule Mr. Ballmer said his team made early on was to use only government data \u2014 no outside providers \u2014 to avoid accusations of bias. But this created its own challenges.For example, Mr. Ballmer, said: \u201cYou know it\u2019s not legal to know how many firearms that are in this country? The government is not allowed to collect the number.\u201dThere is data for the number of firearms manufactured, licenses, inspections, \u201calong with other data, but not a total,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t show it! I\u2019m shocked! But the N.R.A. apparently has lobbied in such a way government can\u2019t report the data.\u201dMr. Ballmer is hoping that the website is just the beginning. He hopes to open it up so that individuals and companies can build on top of it and pull out customized reports.\u201cWe\u2019re making philanthropic donations elsewhere \u2014 I think of this as another,\u201d he said, referring to himself and his wife. \u201cI don\u2019t even deduct this for my taxes. I pay this with after-tax money, no pretax money, because I don\u2019t want anybody being able to think that factors in. But I feel like it\u2019s a civic contribution more than anything else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A French Campaign Waged Online Adds a Wild Card to the Election", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byHis campaign has been gaining steam not only because of his energized rallies \u2014 he sometimes beams in by hologram to address multiple cities at once \u2014 and his platform. He has also been far more web savvy than his rivals, running what may be France\u2019s first viral campaign.When French voters go to the polls on Sunday for the first round of elections, they will do so after a campaign that has moved beyond rallies and other traditional events and migrated online for the first time. With some polls showing as many as 30 percent of the voters still undecided, every vote will count \u2014 and so will every \u201clike.\u201dFar-right websites, an ecosystem often referred to as the Fachosph\u00e8re, have long given oxygen to Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front, which was the first French party to create a website. And the left has traditionally had intense ideological debates in the mainstream news media.In this campaign, however, in which the left is split among several candidates, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, a former Trotskyite and longtime Socialist senator before breaking ranks, has more YouTube followers than any rival and a league of active online supporters eager to jump on critics.That\u2019s especially true on the left, where voters are deciding among Mr. M\u00e9lenchon; Mr. Macron, a 39-year-old centrist, former banker and finance minister under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a Socialist; and Beno\u00eet Hamon, a Socialist who comes from the party\u2019s leftist wing and whose flagging campaign represents that party\u2019s implosion.Enter the video game. The idea for Fiscal Kombat came from Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s grass-roots supporters, who created an online community, Le Discord Insoumis, or \u201cDefiant Discord\u201d \u2014 using the Discord gaming software \u2014 to debate ideas and find new ways to push his program. That program includes taking France out of NATO, renegotiating its treaties with the European Union, eliminating nuclear power, raising taxes and capping wages.In the final weeks of the campaign, those supporters have been out in force. When the satirical cartoonist Joann Sfar took to his own Facebook page, which has 33,000 followers, to criticize Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, he was attacked by M\u00e9lenchon supporters.\u201cThat creates a dynamic in the country that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople are really keyed up and comment a lot.\u201dOsons Causer and Usul are no fans of Mr. Hamon, the socialist, but they seem to have particular antipathy toward Mr. Macron, whom they see as the establishment candidate, a dynamic not unlike how supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders viewed his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.\u201cIt\u2019s our moment,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Lambert, one of three founders of Osons Causer, who are 28 to 30 years old and attended Paris\u2019s Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV, as did Mr. Macron. Started in June 2015 (the third founder is Xavier Cheung), the show has nearly 500,000 Facebook followers, up from 400,000 in January. (Le Monde, France\u2019s paper of record, has three million.)Usul agrees. \u201cA lot of young people are trying to discover Socialism,\u201d he said by telephone. Even if Mr. M\u00e9lenchon loses, \u201cwe\u2019ve entered a phase when social movements will be more important, more structured, more radical,\u201d he said, citing Spain\u2019s leftist Podemos party as a model. \u201cWe\u2019ll move from defense to attack.\u201d(In one of the more surreal twists, Usul is the pseudonym of a 31-year-old journalist in Lyon who has never revealed his name.)These YouTubers haven\u2019t exactly replaced the mainstream media in France, but they\u2019ve gone viral in ways that more established media outlets have not.But social media kept the scandal alive \u2014 so much so that Mr. Fillon was the candidate most discussed online, according to Linkfluence.Even though social media has helped bolster Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s campaign, Mr. Vedel, of Sciences Po, warned against drawing too direct a line between social media activity and electoral results.\u201cToday, social media doesn\u2019t always reflect opinion; that\u2019s the problem,\u201d he said. He added that much chatter during the campaign could be \u201cfilter bubbles,\u201d in which people share information that reinforces their own ideas.The Google News Lab in Paris, a division of the search engine company, found that the most searched candidates in recent weeks were Mr. Macron and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon.

He is expected to introduce a proposal as early as this month.Was this sincere outreach or window dressing?It is interesting to note that of the four companies, only Facebook was born on the internet and does almost of all of its business online. Intel sells chips. Cisco sells networking gear. Oracle sells software.Yes, they all have internet-based businesses. (Oracle, in particular, says its cloud-computing business is growing fast.) And their bottom lines are all dependent on the healthy growth of the internet.But they are all already cash-rich companies, able to afford all but the most ridiculous internet-access rates.

Ford executives acknowledged that the company needed to retrench as it prepared to deliver several promising new sport-utility models this year in the American and Chinese markets.As has been the case for several years, Ford\u2019s North American operations were the source of the bulk of its earnings. The company reported a pretax profit of $2 billion in the region, primarily from sales of its pickup trucks and S.U.V.s in the United States.Its international operations posted mixed results, with pretax earnings of $176 million in Europe and $124 million in Asia, and losses of $244 million in South America and $80 million in the Middle East and Africa.The bank said on Thursday that net earnings had more than doubled, to 575 million euros, or $627 million, from a year earlier. But revenue fell 9 percent to \u20ac7.3 billion.And despite frothy stock markets, Deutsche Bank\u2019s revenue from trading in equities fell 10 percent in the quarter. Revenue from sales and trading of bonds and other debt \u2014 traditionally the bank\u2019s strong suit \u2014 rose 11 percent, but analysts judged that performance inferior to those of rivals like Bank of America or Citigroup.\u201cRelative to the U.S. banks, this is a weak outcome,\u201d analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note to clients.The news sent Lloyds shares up 3 percent in early trading on Thursday.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to knowledge of Third Point\u2019s stake in Honeywell.

{"Headline": "Facebook Loses Appeal to Block Bulk Search Warrants", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byNew York State\u2019s highest court dealt a blow to Facebook and other social media companies seeking to expand privacy protections, ruling on Tuesday that Facebook had no right to ask an appellate court to quash search warrants ordering the company to hand over information from hundreds of accounts in a disability fraud case.The state Court of Appeals, in a 5-to-1 decision, with one judge recusing himself, upheld lower court rulings that New York law does not allow a social media company to appeal a judge\u2019s decision to issue search warrants in a criminal case, even if the company believes those warrants violate the constitutional rights of its users.The Facebook case is part of a broader battle between the government and technology companies over the limits on law enforcement requests for data under the federal Stored Communications Act. Much of that fight is playing out in New York.The ruling was a setback for civil libertarians and social media companies hoping the court might create new legal guidelines for search warrants aimed at seizing all the information in electronic accounts, treating them more like civil subpoenas, which can be challenged as overly broad before they are executed.But Judge Leslie E. Stein, writing for the majority, said state courts had held for decades that search warrants issued by judges cannot be appealed to a higher court. Instead, they may be challenged by a defendant only during a pretrial hearing, as illegal searches.\u201cIndeed, to hold otherwise would be to impermissibly and judicially create a right to appeal in a criminal matter that has not been authorized by our Legislature,\u201d Judge Stein wrote in her 25-page decision.She acknowledged that Facebook had presented the court with \u201cnovel and important substantive issues regarding the constitutional rights of privacy and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure\u201d but said the court was \u201cconstrained by law\u201d to dismiss the company\u2019s appeal. Because search warrants cannot be appealed, she said, the court did not need to rule on Facebook\u2019s central contention \u2014 that the warrants were so sweeping they amounted to an unconstitutional search.One judge dissented: Judge Rowan D. Wilson, who argued that the federal law authorizing the warrants \u2014 the Stored Communications Act of 1986 \u2014 did not distinguish between warrants and subpoenas. In his reading, that statute gives service providers a right to appeal all overly broad court orders, including search warrants. \u201cState rules of procedures applicable to garden-variety warrants cannot be used as a device to contravene or frustrate federal law,\u201d he wrote.Judge Wilson noted that the framers of the State Constitution in 1938 had specifically warned against the invasion of privacy in electronic communications. \u201cThe New York Constitution commands us to guard vigilantly against that evil,\u201d he said. He characterized the warrants as \u201cauthorizing the seizure of private information en masse,\u201d including deleted content and content shared by users not under investigation.The case \u2014 known formally as In Re 381 Search Warrants Directed to Facebook Inc. \u2014 had been closely watched as a test as Facebook sought to expand its ability to fight what it sees as fishing expeditions by prosecutors. Several tech giants, including Google, LinkedIn, Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter, filed amicus briefs, as did the New York Civil Liberties Union.The search warrants were signed in 2013 by Justice Melissa C. Jackson on the strength of a 96-page affidavit that has never been made public. In an unusual procedure, Facebook moved to quash the warrants, saying they were too broad and objecting to the judge\u2019s order prohibiting the company from telling its clients about them.Judge Jackson denied the motion, saying Facebook, as a service provider, could not argue the searches were unconstitutional on behalf of its clients, any more than a landlord could stop the police with a warrant from searching a storage facility. She also said there was enough evidence of fraud to justify the mass warrants.The warrants ordered Facebook to turn over all of the information in the accounts of 381 people, including private photos and conversations. That information was used by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to obtain indictments for disability fraud against more than 130 police officers and other former public employees. None of the people indicted challenged the search warrants.Mr. Vance personally argued the case before the court, underscoring its importance to his office, which has used private information in Facebook accounts not only as evidence of the enormous disability fraud scheme but also to help make conspiracy cases against hundreds of members of street gangs in housing projects.One of the concurring judges, Jenny Rivera, wrote a separate opinion, saying she agreed with the majority but on the narrower grounds that Facebook had not made the right arguments under federal law for quashing the warrants: that they would cause an undue burden and harm its business. Judge Rivera said she agreed with Judge Wilson that the federal law permitted Facebook to appeal a judge\u2019s decision on search warrants to a higher court.Jay Nancarrow, a spokesman for Facebook, said the company had yet to decide whether to take its case to the federal courts.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the court\u2019s ruling,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are encouraged to see the thorough dissent that supports Facebook\u2019s position arguing for people\u2019s online privacy.\u201dDonna Leiberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said she was heartened the court ruled only on procedural grounds, leaving the constitutional battle for another day.\u201cThis ruling does not reject our important claim that the state and federal Constitution do not permit district attorneys to rummage around in people\u2019s Facebook accounts like they did here,\u201d Ms. Leiberman said.Vindu Goel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s \u2018Hire American\u2019 Order May Affect Tech Worker Visas", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byThe order makes no immediate changes to work visa programs but tells the Departments of Labor, Justice, Homeland Security and State to study existing laws and procedures and recommend changes.In the case of one program, H-1B temporary visas, the order directs the agencies to suggest changes to help ensure that the visas are awarded to the most skilled, best-paid immigrant workers. \u201cRight now, H-1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery, and that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the signing in Kenosha, Wis.The order also calls for a crackdown on fraud and abuse in the current system of work visas \u2014 which the agencies had already signaled they would do.What is the H-1B program, and why is the president focused on it?The H-1B program grants 65,000 work visas a year to foreigners, with 20,000 more visas granted to foreigners with advanced degrees and an unlimited number of extra visas available for universities, teaching hospitals and other nonprofit organizations. The program is aimed at highly skilled workers, and most of the visas are awarded to technology companies, although other specialty industries such as fashion also use the visas. (Melania Trump, the first lady, worked as a model on an H-1B visa.)Under federal law, employers that use a large number of H-1B workers are supposed to document that they tried to hire Americans for the jobs. All H-1B employers are also required to pay prevailing wages to the immigrant workers who receive the visas.Labor Department data shows that about 40 percent of the visas go to entry-level workers and another 40 percent go to people with limited experience and skills. The Trump administration says that more of the jobs performed by those people could and should be filled by Americans.How are the visas allocated?Visa applications must be sponsored by employers. Every April 1, the government begins accepting applications for the next fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. This year, the government received 199,000 H-1B applications in the first five days and then stopped accepting them.Because there are more applicants than visas, the visas are awarded by lottery. Each visa is good for three years and can be renewed for three more years. Immigrants who are applying for a permanent residency visa, known as a green card, can typically stay longer while waiting for approval.In 2015, President Obama expanded the program to allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to also work in the United States, but in a recent court filing, the Trump administration said it was reviewing that policy.It is not clear exactly how many foreigners are in the United States on H-1B visas, but analysts estimate 650,000 to 900,000. In recent years, about 70 percent of the visas have been issued to citizens of India.Who employs these H-1B visa holders?The biggest employers are India-based outsourcing companies like Wipro Technologies, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Tata Consultancy Services. These firms contract with banks, health care companies and other businesses to handle various computing tasks and bring in thousands of immigrants to do the work. Outsourcing companies based in the United States, particularly IBM and Cognizant, also use large numbers of H-1B workers.The leading American technology companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple, employ thousands of H-1B workers. Two companies, Facebook and the chip maker Qualcomm, are heavily dependent on H-1B visas, with at least 15 percent of their American workforces holding the visas, according to federal filings. Thousands of Silicon Valley start-ups also hire some H-1B workers.How do these foreign workers contribute to the American economy?American technology companies argue that there is a shortage of qualified Americans for scientific and programming jobs, forcing them to turn overseas for workers to meet their hiring needs.In addition, immigrants or their children have played key roles in founding many technology companies, including giants like Apple, Google and Intel and up-and-comers like WhatsApp and Airbnb.The Indian outsourcers, which generally pay lower wages and operate in a different part of the technology ecosystem, say they are helping American companies cut spending on certain basic services so they can keep employing higher-paid workers in other parts of their businesses. R. Chandrashekhar, the president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies, a group that represents the Indian technology industry, says that more than three-quarters of the Fortune 500, America\u2019s largest companies by sales, use the Indian outsourcers for some operations.\u201cThese services play a critical role in ensuring that corporate America remains a job-creation engine,\u201d Mr. Chandrashekhar said.Still, Indian outsourcing companies are preparing for a world of fewer visas, shifting the work to people in India and other countries.Are American workers hurt by immigrant work visa programs?Some studies suggest that universities grant technology degrees to more than enough American students to fill all the open jobs in the United States, so critics of the visas say the program is unnecessary. Silicon Valley companies often do not cast a wide net for American job candidates. Instead, they compete to hire the same graduates of the top colleges for many jobs and rely heavily on immigrants to fill out their workforces.Under the H-1B program, all companies have to attest that they are paying foreign workers prevailing wages and that their existing workers will not be adversely affected, said Russ Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, the American branch of IEEE, the largest professional association for computer scientists and electrical engineers. \u201cBut all you have to do is check a box.\u201dForeign workers can also be abused by the visa programs. The H-1B visa is tied to a specific employer, which means the visa holder cannot easily change jobs. Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, who has long pushed for changes, said some H-1B holders earned less than their stated salaries because they were forced to repay their employer for various expenses, such as travel.What changes are under consideration for visa programs?The government will also publicly release more data about other visa programs, such as the L-1, which allows workers officially employed overseas by a company to work in the United States. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many L-1s are here, who employs them, where they are located and what they are paid,\u201d said Ronil Hira, an associate professor of political science at Howard University who has extensively studied immigrant visa programs.Many in Congress support changing the H-1B lottery system to give preference to the highest-paying jobs. \u201cWe should allocate visas based on who wants to pay the highest salary to avoid undercutting the wages of American workers,\u201d said Ms. Lofgren, who has sponsored one of several bills on the topic.Such a change would favor established American technology companies, which tend to pay high wages, and hurt the outsourcing companies, which hire immigrants to do more basic work at lower wages. But there is a risk of collateral damage to start-ups, which pay less in cash but award stock to new hires, and to hospitals, which recruit immigrants for nursing and other nontech jobs.Changes to work visas could also be wrapped into a broader immigration bill. Mr. Trump recently told members of Congress that he was open to discussing that approach.An article on April 19 about President Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d order referred incorrectly to the application process for employers seeking to hire H-1B workers. The employers must attest that they are paying the foreign workers prevailing wages and that the working conditions of existing workers will not be adversely affected. They do not have to attest that they tried to find an American first. This correction was delayed because the error was pointed out to editors only recently.Advertisement"}

As the writer and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry said: \u201cA pile of rocks ceases to be a rock pile when somebody contemplates it with the idea of a cathedral in mind.\u201d And, like the builders of France\u2019s storied cathedrals, today\u2019s inventors, researchers, entrepreneurs and business developers are reimagining the landscape of our world.France is known for the rigor of its education system, with its emphasis on math and science, and its high output of top-flight engineers. The country has produced 68 Nobel laureates and 13 winners of the prestigious Fields Medal in mathematics. But its creative minds are active in many fields, from the prodigious international product designer Philippe Starck to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze, voted World\u2019s Best Female Chef 2015....of degree holders are employed in the science and technology fieldsAdditionally, French Tech is investing \u20ac200 million ($212 million) in private start-up accelerators. Station F, conceived as the world\u2019s biggest business incubator, is opening on Paris\u2019s Left Bank this year. It is the brainchild of Xavier Niel, founder of 42, the tuition-free computer programming school. \u201cFrance has always been very proactive in terms of new technology and services adoption,\u201d says Niel. \u201cWe also have the talents, the engineers and more and more capital available to fund them.\u201d These and other initiatives, such as Cr\u00e9ative Next, a competition to identify key game-changers and innovators in each field of French industry, continue to raise the profile of French innovation.In light of these developments, a host of new industries is taking shape. For these, France provides an excellent ecosystem for innovation. Its internationally renowned universities, exceptional infrastructure, location in the heart of Europe and excellent quality of life make it an attractive location for companies of all sizes.This infrastructure includes initiatives like Orange\u2019s move into public cloud services and the smart cities sector. According to Thierry Bonhomme, CEO of Orange\u2019s enterprise arm, Orange\u2019s recently awarded contract to transform the center of Doha, Qatar, into a digital district is an initiative that can be extended elsewhere in the Middle East and in France.As a top-ranking tourist destination, France has long been a pioneer in transport. Little wonder, then, that it is home to BlaBlaCar, a leader in ridesharing and the product of an innovative, disruptive idea. BlaBlaCar, in addition to linking riders with ride-sharers, allows users to choose traveling companions according to their preferences.France\u2019s contributions to art and culture hardly need reiterating. But French creativity is alive and thriving in many newer areas, from animation to digital technology. As director and co-director, the French animator Pierre Coffin helped to create the \u201cDespicable Me\u201d film franchise, including voicing the famous Minion characters. Also well known in the animation world is Paris\u2019s Ecole de l\u2019Image Gobelins, which in 2016 was voted the top international animation school for the second year in a row.Another product by French entrepreneurs is DJiT\u2019s Edjing, the top free mobile app for D.J.s, now used in 182 countries.

{"Headline": "Uber Denies It Is Using Stolen Waymo Technology", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber denied claims from Waymo, the self-driving car company spun out of Google\u2019s parent company last year, that it is using driverless car technology stolen by a former Google employee.The component is called lidar, for light detection and ranging sensors, and it helps a self-driving car navigate. Uber said its lidar system is significantly different from Waymo\u2019s. For example, Uber said it uses four lenses while Waymo has a single-lens design.Uber also said a temporary injunction was not justified because there was no urgency to Waymo\u2019s claim, noting that Waymo did not ask for the injunction until last month despite knowing about the file downloads in October.\u201cWaymo\u2019s injunction motion is a misfire,\u201d Angela Padilla, Uber\u2019s associate general counsel, said in a statement. \u201cIf Waymo genuinely thought that Uber was using its secrets, it would not have waited more than five months to seek an injunction. Waymo doesn\u2019t meet the high bar for an injunction, which would stifle our independent innovation \u2014 probably Waymo\u2019s goal in the first place.\u201dA temporary injunction could be damaging to Uber, because it is rushing to catch up to Waymo and others in the rapidly shifting world of self-driving cars.Technology companies like Google and Apple are devoting extensive resources to putting self-driving cars on the road, while traditional automakers like Ford and General Motors are snapping up talent in the hopes of preventing technology companies from moving onto their turf.Uber said it couldn\u2019t explain his actions, because Mr. Levandowski, who is not a named defendant in the suit, was pleading the Fifth.\u201cUber never possessed \u2014 and never used \u2014 any information Mr. Levandowski allegedly took from Waymo,\u201d Uber said in its filing.Judge William Alsup in United States District Court in San Francisco said in a hearing earlier this week that since neither Uber nor Mr. Levandowski were denying that the documents were stolen, the fact that the documents had not been found in Uber\u2019s possession was not enough to stave off an injunction.\u201cUber\u2019s assertion that they\u2019ve never touched the 14,000 stolen files is disingenuous at best, given their refusal to look in the most obvious place: the computers and devices owned by the head of their self-driving program,\u201d Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman, said in a statement. He said Waymo had \u201cclear evidence\u201d that Uber was using or planned to use Waymo technology, \u201cas seen in both circuit board blueprints and filings in the State of Nevada.\u201dUber said it should not have to stop work on self-driving cars because its lidar is still in development and is based on a 2015 design from one of its employees, while the one on Uber\u2019s current self-driving car is an off-the-shelf version from a supplier.Separately, Waymo is pursuing arbitration with Mr. Levandowski and Otto\u2019s other founder, Lior Ron, also a former Google employee, accusing them of building a competitor to Google\u2019s self-driving car project while still working there.In arbitration documents, Waymo said the Otto founders tried to poach Google employees \u2014 a violation of their employment agreement. In one eye-popping detail, Waymo said Mr. Levandowski had acted disloyally even though it had paid him $120 million in bonus incentives for his work on the autonomous vehicle project.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Chairman Pushes Sweeping Changes to Net Neutrality Rules", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday outlined a sweeping plan to loosen the government\u2019s oversight of high-speed internet providers, a rebuke of a landmark policy approved two years ago to ensure that all online content is treated the same by the companies that deliver broadband service to Americans.The chairman, Ajit Pai, said high-speed internet service should no longer be treated like a public utility with strict rules, as it is now. The move would, in effect, largely leave the industry to police itself.The plan is Mr. Pai\u2019s most forceful action in his race to roll back rules that govern telecommunications, cable and broadcasting companies, which he says are harmful to business. But he is certain to face a contentious battle with the consumers and tech companies that rallied around the existing rules, which are meant to prevent broadband providers like AT&T and Comcast from giving special treatment to any streaming videos, news sites and other content.His plan, though still vague on the details, is a sharp change from the approach taken by the last F.C.C. administration, which approved rules governing a concept known as net neutrality in 2015. The rules were intended to ensure an open internet, meaning that no content could be blocked by broadband providers and that the internet would not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for internet and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else.In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Pai said he would undo that classification.Mr. Pai said he was generally supportive of the idea behind net neutrality but said the rules went too far and were not necessary for an open internet. He said he would also seek public comment on how to preserve the basic principles of net neutrality \u2014 the prohibitions of blocking, throttling and paid priority for online traffic.Mr. Pai voted against the current rules as a commissioner. Critics of his ideas for changing the rules warned that making any commitments only voluntary would pave the way for the creation of business practices that harm competition.\u201cIt would put consumers at the mercy of phone and cable companies,\u201d said Craig Aaron, president of the consumer advocacy group Free Press. \u201cIn a fantasy world, all would be fine with a pinkie swear not to interrupt pathways and portals to the internet despite a history of doing that.\u201dThe new policy faces several hurdles before going into effect, including months of comments and revisions. But Republicans have a 2 to 1 majority on the commission, including Mr. Pai, so most proposals he puts up for a vote will generally be expected to pass.Consumer groups and tech companies have warned of a legal challenge, however. The current net neutrality rules were affirmed by a federal appeals court, which could put an extra burden on Mr. Pai to justify his changes.The F.C.C.\u2019s policing of broadband companies has drawn greater interest with recent proposals for big mergers, such as AT&T\u2019s $85 billion bid for Time Warner, that create huge media conglomerates that distribute and own video content. Already, AT&T is giving mobile subscribers free streaming access to television content by DirecTV, which it owns. Consumer groups have complained that such practices, known as sponsored data, put rivals at a disadvantage and could help determine what news and information is most likely to reach consumers.Telecom and cable companies applauded the announcement on Wednesday. Since Mr. Pai\u2019s appointment in January by President Trump, their lobbyists have flooded the agency and the offices of Congress, pushing for an unwinding of rules that they say hamper their businesses. The No. 1 target has been the rules on broadband providers, which they complain have crimped their willingness to invest in their networks.Excerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.\u201cWe applaud F.C.C. Chairman Pai\u2019s initiative to remove this stifling regulatory cloud over the internet,\u201d Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cIt was illogical for the F.C.C. in 2015 to abandon that light-touch approach and instead regulate the internet under an 80-year-old law designed to set rates for the rotary-dial-telephone era.\u201dMr. Pai has been an active figure in the Trump administration\u2019s quest to dismantle regulations. He froze a broadband subsidy program for low-income households, eased limits on television station mergers and eased caps on how much a company like AT&T or Comcast can charge another business to get online.Consumer groups have opposed some of his changes, and they challenged the assertions of telecom companies that broadband regulations harm their businesses. They said publicly traded broadband companies have increased investments in their networks 5 percent since the current rules went into effect.About 800 tech start-ups and investors, organized by the Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator and the San Francisco policy advocacy group Engine, protested the unwinding of net neutrality in a letter sent to Mr. Pai on Wednesday.\u201cWithout net neutrality, the incumbents who provide access to the internet would be able to pick winners or losers in the market,\u201d they wrote in the letter.So far, Google and Netflix, the most vocal proponents of net neutrality in previous years, have not spoken individually about Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal. Speaking through their trade group, the Internet Association, they said the broadband and net neutrality rules should stay intact.\u201cRolling back these rules or reducing the legal sustainability of the order will result in a worse internet for consumers and less innovation online,\u201d Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, said in a statement.Mr. Pai vowed a strong commitment to the plan: \u201cMake no mistake about it: This is a fight that we intend to wage and it is a fight that we are going to win.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect location for the policy advocacy group Engine.

They attended a Montessori preschool on site while she worked next door on developing her idea over 14 months.\u201cIt was especially wonderful because I was able to breast-feed, take breaks to see my kids, and I felt I was able to be very involved with what was going on in their classrooms,\u201d she said.At Nido, whose name is Italian for nest, Ms. Rudel also attended workshops on starting a business and sought feedback from the other members.\u201cNido enabled me to set up a foundation for my business,\u201d she said. She set out to raise $20,000 through Kickstarter and ultimately raised over $24,000.There are 3,900 co-working spaces in the country and approximately 11,100 worldwide, according to a 2016 report by Emergent Research, a research and consulting firm. Although there are no formal numbers on how many of those offer child care, Emergent estimates only 15 do nationwide.\u201cCo-working spaces with child care are a great idea,\u201d said Steve King, a partner at Emergent Research. \u201cThe challenge is in the implementation.\u201dThe main difficulties, Mr. King said, are the stringent regulations for running a child care site. Furthermore, running two very different businesses \u2014 an office-space firm and a day care operation \u2014 can be tricky, he said. \u201cStill with the growth of the broader co-working industry, we expect to see more,\u201d he added.Nido has beaten the odds. It began in fall 2014 in the living room of Tiffany Frye, one of its co-founders. When she was returning to work after the birth of her daughter, she wanted to build community with other like-minded parents. Seven families gathered, allowing some parents to work while others watched the young children.Today, 28 families have memberships, which start at $405 a month for two half-days a week of co-working space and school and run to $905 a month for five half-days a week.With a waiting list growing for their infant room, the founders are looking to find a new facility to allow them to expand to four classrooms from two. Ms. Frye has also hosted webinars for women across the country who hope to replicate the setup.A twist on the concept has been to add child care to existing hacker spaces \u2014 community-operated places where people who like to tinker with crafts, technology or food can meet and work on projects.\u201cI was working on an unfunded start-up project but I also had a newborn son, which is a very real obligation,\u201d said William Fertman, who lives in Berkeley, Calif.\u201cMy wife had a steady job and steady paycheck, so it was obvious I would be the one taking care of our son,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t simply disappear into an incubator for two weeks or longer and remain married.\u201dWhen his son, Leo, was a few months old, Mr. Fertman started looking for a workspace where he could also take his son.Mr. Fertman said he felt unwelcome at the hacker spaces he tried first. \u201cMany of the local hacker spaces were full of 20-something males and none of them had kids yet.\u201dHis wife, Minda Berbeco, introduced him to mothers who shared ideas on balancing parenthood with careers.\u201cI generally felt like a wet blanket showing up,\u201d Mr. Fertman said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly welcome when the conversation turned to chapped nipples and residual spotting.\u201d\u201cIt was a godsend. This was a place I could go with my baby,\u201d Mr. Fertman said. \u201cWhen he was a bit older, I brokered several deals with my cheese distributors with Leo playing next door.\u201d HackerMoms uses Berkeley students as babysitters, who charge parents $3 to $5 an hour per child.Mr. Fertman\u2019s company, which he started with a business partner, Stephanie Skinner, now has 100 active users on its test site. The site will have its formal start in September.Child care costs can be prohibitive to many start-up founders whose businesses are yet unfunded. Some entrepreneurs are applying to a Google-sponsored start-up program for parents called Campus for Moms.She wanted to expand abroad but had no idea how to tackle other markets. \u201cWe were more like a manufacturing company with one product,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had no proper business plan.\u201dMs. Sielicka-Kalczynska was accepted into the Campus for Moms in Warsaw in 2016. She received a co-working space and went in for workshops once a week for 10 weeks.Nearby were crying rooms, feeding spaces and playrooms for her young children. \u201cThe play area was a great solution because I could bring my children and not miss any of the workshops or meetings,\u201d she said.She also connected with various mentors at Google and was invited to a workshop in Palo Alto, Calif. There she learned Americans preferred stuffed animals that feel fluffier and sleeker than those favored by European shoppers, who are accustomed to simpler cotton.Google does not charge for the program or take any equity in the new companies.Ms. Sielicka-Kalczynska now has a group of Google mentors in several countries. Whisbear just won the top award at one of the biggest baby trade shows in Europe.\u201cHaving a start-up is like having another child,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really need to care about it. Sometimes it\u2019s really disappointing and then five minutes later it gives you energy and you\u2019re positive again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Inaugural Drew Big Dollars From Donors With Vested Interests", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byThe casino magnate and philanthropist Sheldon G. Adelson wants some big things from the Trump administration: banning the online poker sites that compete with his luxury casinos, for example, and moving the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.And while President Trump was not Mr. Adelson\u2019s first choice during the Republican primary season last year, he has been generous since: The billionaire donated $5 million to the committee organizing Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration festivities \u2014 the largest single contribution given to any president\u2019s inaugural committee.The stream of money is a striking contrast to the way Mr. Trump funded his campaign, chiefly with small donations and his own fortune. While some big checks for the inauguration came from longtime Trump friends and associates, much of the money came from the industries that have traditionally excelled at wielding Washington influence: telecommunications, tobacco and pharmaceutical giants, which have bankrolled presidential inaugurations for Republicans and Democrats alike. And a generous amount came from people who had been hostile to his candidacy.If the crowds at Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing-in celebrations were relatively small, the checks paying for all the nonofficial festivities were not: Freed of many of the voluntary restrictions adopted by Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors, 48 people or corporations gave $1 million or more, according to the disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission. Besides Mr. Adelson, they included a trust controlled by the coal industry billionaire Joseph W. Craft III; the parent company of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; and Robert Mercer, the billionaire investor and close ally of Stephen K. Bannon, a White House adviser.The donor rolls also included a host of blue-chip American companies, like Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Intel, Google and Bank of America, which contribute significant sums regardless of the incoming president\u2019s political party.\u201cDuring the campaign, he attacked over and over again precisely these kinds of huge contributions,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, the president of the watchdog group Democracy 21 and a longtime advocate of tighter campaign finance rules. \u201cHe also said he knew from personal experience that you can buy influence with politicians by making these kinds of contributions. That didn\u2019t seem to bother him in raising ridiculous amounts of money to pay for the inauguration.\u201dBoeing, the country\u2019s biggest exporter, made a million-dollar contribution in January. This month, Boeing won a major victory when Mr. Trump abandoned his campaign pledge to eliminate the Export-Import Bank, which has provided billions in loan guarantees to help Boeing\u2019s overseas customers finance plane purchases.Central to the money-raising effort was Thomas Barrack Jr., a private equity investor who is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest and oldest friends. It was Mr. Barrack who hosted one of Mr. Trump\u2019s first major fund-raisers at his home in Santa Monica, Calif., last May, and who spoke in Cleveland the night Mr. Trump accepted the Republican nomination. As inaugural chairman, Mr. Barrack was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s chief liaisons to those business executives who had kept him at arm\u2019s length.Contributions to the festivities were not intended to accrue favor with the new president, Mr. Barrack said in a text message, but were made \u201cin support of the coming together of our country and its people to commemorate the cornerstone of our American democratic process.\u201dBut the democratic process moves along more quickly for some than for others. While Mr. Trump promised during the campaign to give Medicare and Medicaid the power to negotiate prices they pay for prescription drugs, two of the biggest drugmakers, Pfizer and Amgen, gave a combined $1.5 million in December.Amgen\u2019s chief executive was among the industry executives who attended a February meeting with Mr. Trump. After entering the meeting promising to do something \u201cto get prices down,\u201d Mr. Trump exited with a more industry-friendly line, saying he would oppose \u201cprice-fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare.\u201d (A White House spokesman later said Mr. Trump remained in favor of negotiating prices.)Few industries have stood to gain as much under Mr. Trump as private prison operators, and they gave generously to his inauguration. Two of the largest such companies, the Corrections Corporation of America, now known as CoreCivic, and the GEO Group, each contributed $250,000.For many Washington interests and for large donors \u2014 particularly those who had not anticipated a Trump victory or had no relationship with his insurgent campaign, or had actively opposed him \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural was an easy way to make inroads with the president-elect.The Ansary family, prominent Iranian-Americans in Dallas who are longtime allies of the Bushes, gave $2 million to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Paul Singer, the billionaire Republican investor who opposed Mr. Trump and once predicted that his policies were \u201cclose to a guarantee of a global depression,\u201d donated $1 million on Dec. 6.The two have mended fences recently. In February, Mr. Singer visited Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, and Mr. Trump declared afterward that \u201cnow he\u2019s a very strong ally and I appreciate that.\u201dMr. Zuberi is now making inroads in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle. After making the donation, he earned a coveted spot at the Chairman\u2019s Global Dinner, a pre-inauguration, black-tie gathering intended to introduce the incoming president to the foreign diplomatic corps. A photo from the event shows Mr. Zuberi in conversation with Mr. Trump and other guests.Mr. Zuberi did not return a phone call seeking comment.Because inaugural committees face few of the regulations that limit campaign fund-raising, each administration sets its own restrictions.George W. Bush, for example, capped gifts at $100,000 for his first inaugural and at $250,000 for his second. Mr. Obama accepted gifts up to only $50,000 in 2009, while banning all gifts from lobbyists and corporations altogether. He loosened those restrictions in 2013, accepting corporate gifts up to $1 million and individual gifts up to $250,000.Just what other perks and souvenirs their donations helped pay for will probably remain a mystery. While donations must be reported, the Federal Election Commission does not require inaugural committees to account for what they spend or how much is left in their coffers when the revelers head home.Mr. Trump\u2019s committee said it was still identifying charities toward which it would direct leftover money.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

But in a range of situations, Times reporters and editors wrestle with whether to include that basic fact in a story \u2014 the name of the person we\u2019re writing about.Our instinct is always to tell readers as much as we know. But the question can raise tangled issues of privacy, fairness and compassion. And it takes on even greater weight in the age of Google, when a single mention in The Times may follow someone digitally forever.Nowhere is the calculation more sensitive than in reporting on allegations of sexual assault, abuse or misconduct, as several recent articles showed.In that case, Times editors had another question: Would we name the man she accused? Was that fair? Was it newsworthy? The incident was not reported to the police. There was no criminal case. And only the two people involved knew exactly what had occurred in the executive\u2019s office. But based on multiple sources, we knew who the executive was, that he had been terminated after the incident and that Fox had agreed to a big settlement. His identity and role at the network seemed crucial to the story: Fox has faced a series of allegations of sexual harassment involving top executives, including Roger Ailes, the former network boss, and Bill O\u2019Reilly.Editors decided to name the man, but only after ensuring that we had made extensive efforts to reach him for comment (eventually his lawyer made a brief statement). We also consulted a Times lawyer, who supported the decision.In the Stanford case, the woman who said she was assaulted did not publicly identify herself, so we followed our usual practice and withheld her name. But what about the man she accused? A majority on two different university panels had ruled against him, but under Stanford\u2019s rules that was not enough to find him responsible for sexual misconduct, so he faced no official sanctions. In the end, given the tangled outcome, editors decided not to identify him by name \u2014 but we did note that he was a football player, a fact that seemed potentially germane.Besides sexual assault cases, many other stories present tough decisions \u2014 reporting about children, for instance, or people worried about their safety, or others who may be na\u00efve about the impact publicity could have on them. Few weeks go by without at least one story that gives us pause. And since no set of guidelines can cover every situation, the best we can do is to try to balance those questions of fairness and privacy with our chief goal: to tell readers what we know.Philip B.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Environmental Woes, in Films That Go Viral, Then Vanish", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileBEIJING \u2014 Achieving fame was not hard for Wang Jiuliang, but staying in the spotlight has proved more difficult.His career as a documentary filmmaker has followed a distressing pattern: spectacular internet reactions to his movies and videos on environmental topics, followed by their rapid disappearance from the web in China.The video became an instant internet sensation, but four days after it was posted it disappeared.The wiry, 40-year-old Mr. Wang said he had no idea who had deleted the items or why. \u201cSome invisible power,\u201d he joked in a recent interview over coffee in Beijing\u2019s central business district.Before the talk on the environmental destruction from quarrying, Mr. Wang had spent the last decade filming China\u2019s mostly unregulated garbage dumps and their environmental impact. He produced two critically acclaimed documentaries that made him an authority on the subject.\u201cIt is very important work, a milestone,\u201d Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, said in a telephone interview.Born a peasant\u2019s son in a village in China\u2019s eastern Shandong Province. Mr. Wang sold cellphones and vegetables to save for college, finally making it to the Communication University of China in Beijing, at 26, to study photography.In 2008, a year after graduating, Mr. Wang went back to his village to shoot a photo project and was horrified by the devastated landscape he found.\u201cI spent my childhood summers catching locusts and fish. Now where are they? Are there still tadpoles and frogs in the creek? No,\u201d he said. That prompted him to question what had happened and who was responsible.That quest drew him into environmental issues and he became curious about garbage and where it went in Beijing. Following garbage trucks, he found hundreds of trash dumps outside Beijing\u2019s fifth-ring road. The dumps, he found, were unregulated; trucks brought in whatever they liked without supervision.After three years of filming \u2014 and 9,300 miles on his motorbike \u2014 he marked on Google maps all the dumps he found. At the end, he produced \u201cBeijing Besieged by Waste.\u201dThe Beijing government has since cleaned up more than 80 percent of the garbage dumps, Mr. Wang said. \u201cI found some answers. But I also started to have more questions,\u201d he said.In 2011, wanting to learn more about how garbage is recycled, Mr. Wang went to California. In one of the biggest waste recycling companies in Oakland, a manager pointed to a truck loaded with containers of plastic waste that was about to be shipped to China.\u201cI\u2019m not a nationalist at all, but somehow his words provoked me,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cBecause I saw this junk \u2014 dirty and detrimental \u2014 going to China.\u201dAnother six years\u2019 work went into finding and documenting what happens to imported plastic waste. The discovery shocked Mr. Wang. Thousands of family-run factories operate in the open air shredding the waste plastic into small particles to sell to factories in southern China, which then make them into new plastic goods. The air and nearby rivers are heavily polluted, he found. Workers sifting through the waste with their bare hands are often pricked by used needles.\u201cI\u2019m not against recycling plastic waste, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cBut absolutely not this kind of raw method of recycling without protection and producing more pollution. The profit and cost is disproportionate.\u201dFor one and a half years, Mr. Wang lived in a rented place near the two families he filmed, in a small town largely dependent on recycling imported plastic waste in Shandong, his home province. He hung out with the families every day, eating together and sometimes helping them with the work.The final product was \u201cPlastic China,\u201d an 81-minute film featuring the two families, and a 26-minute version that explains the industry itself and every character in its chain, like waste suppliers in the United States and Europe and Chinese workers who make their living from the trade.The longer version is nonjudgmental, showing the tough conditions faced by people scratching out an existence in a tough business with razor-thin margins. Its images are raw and bleak: dying fish in a nearby contaminated river are picked up for a family meal; a baby is born amid mountainous heaps of plastic; Yi Jie, 9, eldest daughter of one of the two families featured, cut pictures of ballet flats from an English magazine, just to have them to look at.Yi Jie was not going to school when Mr. Wang started to film, because her father said he did not want to pay the fees. When Yi Jie turned 11, Mr. Wang and the film\u2019s producing companies spent their own money to send Yi Jie back to her hometown in Sichuan to go to school.\u201cThey work for scanty wage and their health is impaired. This needs to be addressed from different sectors in a society,\u201d Mr. Ma said.Mr. Wang said there were handsome profits to be made from plastic waste, but mostly in the international trade.But \u201cPlastic China\u201d does not seek to criticize specific groups of people, said Ruby Chen, one of the film\u2019s producers. Rather, she said, everyone should reflect on their own roles in the trade after watching how the two families live.\u201cIf I\u2019m a policy maker, how to solve problems? If I run a small factory, is there a better way to do things? If I\u2019m a boss, is it really necessary to use all this plastic packaging?\u201d said Ms. Chen, joining the conversation with Mr. Wang over coffee. \u201cPeople who have watched it have told us: \u2018I will need to think carefully whether to use plastics.\u2019\u201dMr. Ma compared Mr. Wang\u2019s films with Rachel Carson\u2019s book \u201cSilent Spring,\u201d a seminal work that helped start the environmental movement. \u201cRecycling plastics could have been a good thing, but if it isn\u2019t done well, it causes secondary pollution,\u201d he said. \u201cPlastics can\u2019t be degraded or buried. So it\u2019s very important to mobilize people to reduce using them.\u201dMr. Wang said he was perplexed by the censorship of his work on the internet. \u201cOur goal is to let more people see it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope they would pay attention and changes could be made. But if the channel for communication is jammed, I have to reconsider what our efforts mean.\u201dStill, it is not stopping what the filmmaker is, in his own words, destined to do. \u201cHe won\u2019t stop caring. Otherwise he couldn\u2019t even sleep at night,\u201d Ms. Chen said with a laugh, \u201cHe is unrelenting. If he thinks this is important, he does it at all costs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Technology Is Built on a \u2018Stack.\u2019 Is That the Best Way to Understand Everything Else, Too?", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsNearly three decades later, now that computing has become truly ubiquitous, its metaphors are deployed without a moment\u2019s thought. We don\u2019t just talk intuitively about the ways in which people are \u201cprogrammed\u201d \u2014 we talk about our emotional \u201cbandwidth\u201d and look for clever ways to \u201chack\u201d our daily routines. These metaphors have developed right alongside the technology from which they\u2019re derived, starting with hardware and then moving to software, apps and networks. Now we\u2019ve arrived at a tempting concept that promises to contain all of this: the stack. These days, corporate managers talk about their solution stacks and idealize \u201cfull stack\u201d companies; athletes share their recovery stacks and muscle-building stacks; devotees of so-called smart drugs obsessively modify their brain-enhancement stacks to address a seemingly infinite range of flaws and desires.\u201cStack,\u201d in technological terms, can mean a few different things, but the most relevant usage grew from the start-up world: A stack is a collection of different pieces of software that are being used together to accomplish a task. A smartphone\u2019s software stack, for instance, could be described as a layered structure: There\u2019s the low-level code that controls the device\u2019s hardware, and then, higher up, its basic operating system, and then, even higher, the software you use to message a friend or play a game. An individual application\u2019s stack might include the programming languages used to build it, the services used to connect it to other apps or the service that hosts it online; a \u201cfull stack\u201d developer would be someone proficient at working with each layer of that system, from bottom to top.The stack isn\u2019t just a handy concept for visualizing how technology works. For many companies, the organizing logic of the software stack becomes inseparable from the logic of the business itself. The system that powers Snapchat, for instance, sits on top of App Engine, a service owned by Google; to the extent that Snapchat even exists as a service, it is as a stack of different elements. \u201cWhat you end up with is entire companies being built on a set of software tools and services,\u201d says Yonas Beshawred, whose own company, StackShare, lets tech professionals publish their companies\u2019 stacks and see what others are using, comparing technology the way hobbyists might compare gear. \u201cYou can think of them as Lego blocks.\u201d A healthy stack, or a clever one, is tantamount (the thinking goes) to a well-structured company.Other attempts to elaborate on the stack have been more rigorous and comprehensive, less personal and more global. In a 2016 book, \u201cThe Stack: On Software and Sovereignty,\u201d the professor and design theorist Benjamin Bratton sets out to, in his words, propose a \u201cspecific model for the design of political geography tuned to this era of planetary-scale computation,\u201d by drawing on the \u201cmultilayered structure of software, hardware and network \u2018stacks\u2019 that arrange different technologies vertically within a modular, interdependent order.\u201d In other words, Bratton sees the world around us as one big emerging technological stack. In his telling, the six-layer stack we inhabit is complex, fluid and vertigo-inducing: Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface and User. It is also, he suggests, extremely powerful, with the potential to undermine and replace our current conceptions of, among other things, the sovereign state \u2014 ushering us into a world blown apart and reassembled by software. This might sound extreme, but such is the intoxicating logic of the stack.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

The allure of Baltimore lies not in its built-for-tourists Inner Harbor, where you\u2019ll find chain restaurants like Hard Rock Cafe, but in its abundance of 19th-century architecture and hip cocktail bars \u2014 not to mention its welcoming outdoor spaces and world-class art museums.\nExplore street view and find things to do in Baltimore.\nThe narrow, speakeasy-style pub W. C. Harlan, tucked away in a quiet, residential part of Remington, was the first destination bar in the area when it opened in 2013. In 2015, the owner Lane Harlan opened a second, a mezcaleria called Clavel, just a block away. While somewhat isolated from the rest of Baltimore\u2019s nightspots, W. C. Harlan is worth a detour. The reclaimed furniture, candelabras and old-timey knickknacks make a cozy, relaxed space for sampling the inventive cocktail menu, which features a list of vintage amari and includes an amaro flight ($12 for three pours) for the uninitiated.

Voyager pairs the view provided by its maps with a still image and a so-called knowledge card to let users hop around the city as though they were on a packed three-day vacation. Similar tours of \u201cHemingway\u2019s Hangouts,\u201d Frank Gehry buildings and museums around the world are also available.Want a less urban experience?

We see it as a way to bridge cultures.\u201dFor more than a decade, Google Earth has allowed users to see the places they plan to visit before they actually do \u2014 or to revisit places they once knew.But as Google Earth became more ubiquitous, people found other ways to leverage it. Virtual flights over land and sea with Google Earth, it turned out, were an excellent way to learn about places, Ms. Moore said.\u201cIn an ad hoc, kind of grass-roots manner, people were using it to tell stories,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we realized is we wanted to take it to the next level.\u201dThe latest update took two years to create, Gopal Shah, a Google Earth project manager, said in a blog post.

Costco said it was working toward maintaining its carbon footprint growth \u201cto less than our company sales growth.\u201d The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.Still, the growing number of American companies setting targets is in contrast to an administration that appears ready to shirk them.Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, has pledged to reduce that carbon footprint by 18 percent by 2025, and also recently committed to work with suppliers to reduce emissions by many times the scope of its own carbon footprint.

Now, at a moment of political upheaval around the globe, that isolation has become a selling point.For all sorts of reasons, New Zealand suddenly makes sense. The cost of living is less than in San Francisco. Commuting is less wearying. And American politics, \u201cBrexit\u201d and the Islamic State are on the other side of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things where the stars are aligned,\u201d said David Jones, general manager at the Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency.New arrivals describe New Zealand as more idealistic and less frustrating than other places.\u201cIn the U.S., I feel extremely disconnected,\u201d said Alanna Irving, 33, who came here from San Francisco to start two companies. \u201cThings happen all the time that I don\u2019t agree with or understand or think are really good for most people, and I just don\u2019t see any way that I can change that.\u201dThis is the second time New Zealand has tried to use Silicon Valley to jump-start its fledgling tech economy. The current effort is in some ways an outgrowth of the first, featuring the same players.The first time, there were big promises that were never fulfilled. It was a typical Silicon Valley story, in other words, which makes it a bit of a cautionary tale even as everyone assumes that this time will be different.The story began more than a decade ago when a billionaire entrepreneur came here to visit and, like so many others, fell in love with the majestic mountains and sweeping vistas. New Zealand is where Peter Jackson filmed \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d a beloved text for many techies. It is the real Middle-earth, a fantasy come to life.Fantasies are rarely free. People applying for citizenship here are required to have spent 70 percent of the previous five years living in the country, and to commit to living in it afterward. Even humanitarian exceptions are rare.Peter Thiel, the contrarian investor who made his fortune with PayPal and Facebook, made an irresistible financial proposal to New Zealand in early 2011. He would bring the local economy \u2014 whose biggest exports were concentrated milk and the meat from sheep and goats \u2014 into the high-tech era. Mr. Thiel would serve as the country\u2019s roving tech ambassador, opening doors around the world that are closed to mere government officials.Even before applying, he set up Valar Ventures, an investment fund named after the gods in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d Valar put about $3 million into Xero, an online accounting software firm, and was part of a $4 million infusion of cash into Pacific Fibre, which proposed a trans-Pacific undersea cable.And that, Mr. Thiel signaled, would be just the beginning.\u201cI intend to devote a significant amount of my time and resources to the people and businesses of New Zealand,\u201d he wrote in his citizenship application. He donated about $750,000 to earthquake relief after the city of Christchurch was struck in February 2011.\u201cWe were so blown away that Peter Thiel was interested,\u201d said Rod Drury, the chief executive of Xero. \u201cHim getting a passport wasn\u2019t a big deal at the time. No one really thought about it.\u201dWhen the secret was revealed, it created a small uproar.\u201cSomeone being able to invest and get citizenship goes against that important New Zealand value of equality,\u201d Mr. Drury explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why it has played so much in the media here.\u201dMr. Drury is the biggest name in New Zealand\u2019s tech scene, a local version of Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg. He recommended Mr. Thiel for citizenship, and Xero was held up as a model of what, with the investor\u2019s help, all the new start-ups could become.The New Zealand government was so enthusiastic about Mr. Thiel\u2019s investing prowess that it became a partner with him in early 2012, putting about $7 million into a Valar fund. The fund did well, primarily because of its big position in Xero.Valar is now based in New York, where it has been investing in European and Brazilian companies. Mr. Thiel declined to comment.\u201cIt\u2019s sad for New Zealand that Thiel and Valar didn\u2019t follow on with more investments,\u201d Lance Wiggs, a local investor, said. \u201cWe are starved for cash.\u201dXero, which has 1,400 employees and customers in 180 countries, took a different path. Its goal is to turn accountants into \u201cgrowth consultants,\u201d becoming a platform that soars above national borders.\u201cGay marriage, cultural tolerance, refugees, active strategies to address diversity \u2014 more than ever our leadership here is important,\u201d Mr. Drury wrote in an email to his staff immediately after the election. He proposed setting a moral example by bringing \u201csome refugee groups into our Wellington office.\u201dA postelection arrival at Xero from the United States is Nick Piesco, 40, who was writing code for a start-up in Austin, Tex. \u201cI\u2019d say the timing is coincidental but fortuitous,\u201d the programmer said of his move 7,437 miles west. Already he and his wife, Reneau Skinner, 39, are talking about becoming citizens.\u201cOne of the things that attracted me to Xero was the culture \u2014 how they make people feel welcome,\u201d Mr. Piesco said.That means those barred from the United States under the new administration\u2019s policies, or who think they might be, are ripe for recruitment, Mr. Drury said.\u201cEspecially in the U.S. technology industry, where something like 50 percent of the billion-dollar companies have been built by immigrants, it\u2019s nuts that you make it difficult for engineers to come in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy for us not to exploit that.\u201dThe LookSee Wellington initiative to bring in 100 software engineers was initially focused on Americans. Then word began to spread. By the time the contest was finally cut off on March 30, India had overtaken the United States in applications.\u201cWe\u2019re in a global talent war,\u201d said Chris Whelan, chief executive of the Economic Development Agency in Wellington.Mr. Drury is already looking to make LookSee an annual affair. After all, it takes the expensive problem of recruitment off Xero\u2019s hands and lets the government do it.\u201cIt\u2019s boom time for the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Drury said. The more immigrants, the better. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a lot. We\u2019ll take hundreds.\u201dAn article last Friday about New Zealand\u2019s efforts to court technology workers misstated the surname of a local investor. He is Lance Wiggs, not Biggs. Because of an editing error, the article also attributed incorrectly a quotation about immigration and tech labor. It was Rod Drury, the chief executive of the accounting software firm Xero \u2014 not Nick Piesco, a Xero employee \u2014 who said, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy for us not to exploit that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

YouTube\u2019s process for mechanically pulling ads from videos is particularly concerning, because it takes aim at whole topics of conversation that could be perceived as potentially offensive to advertisers, and because it so often misfires. It risks suppressing political commentary and jokes. It puts the wild, independent internet in danger of becoming more boring than TV.\u201cIt\u2019s getting so bad that you can\u2019t even speak your mind or be honest without fear of losing money and being not \u2018brand-friendly,\u2019\u201d said Ethan Klein, the creator of h3h3. \u201cYouTube is on the fast track to becoming Disney vloggers: beautiful young people that wouldn\u2019t say anything controversial and are always happy.\u201dThis is not all the algorithm\u2019s fault. People create these systems, and they are sensitive to bad press and skittish advertisers. The YouTube ad crisis \u2014 and the company\u2019s response \u2014 also speaks to a persistent public misunderstanding of the worth of digital creators. The mainstream media barely engages with YouTube videos as an artistic product in the way it does traditional television and film. Coverage is focused on how much money YouTube stars make, how improbably famous they are among teenagers and, now, on the small number of racist and extremist videos that have slipped through the cracks of the ad system.Jamie Byrne, director of creators and enterprise at YouTube, said that concerned companies had requested tougher controls to keep their ad dollars flowing. \u201cFor creators to flourish on our platform, we need an incredibly strong advertising community engaged on YouTube as well,\u201d he said. He hopes that as the ad systems learn to decipher context, and advertisers relax, creators will see greater returns.All of that means that new media creators hoping to make a living online need to play by YouTube\u2019s rules, and steer clear of anything \u201cpotentially objectionable\u201d \u2014 not to real people, who might actually be offended, but to robots. If YouTube wants to fulfill its promise of an online environment where independent creators can make interesting work, it will find a way to scrub ads from truly vile content without penalizing the merely controversial.Advertisement"}
