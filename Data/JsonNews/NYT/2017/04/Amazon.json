{"Headline": "Review: Gertrude of Arabia in \u2018Queen of the Desert\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byMr. Herzog has spent his career making movies about quixotic quests. When these films are at their finest, Mr. Herzog can seem as driven and half-mad as his characters. Like his heroes, he has plunged into the Amazon to face what he once called, in the documentary \u201cGrizzly Man,\u201d \u201cthe overwhelming indifference of nature.\u201dThat makes him a natural fit to tell the life story of Gertrude Bell, the British adventurer, archaeologist and linguist who has been labeled the female Lawrence of Arabia. (One of her less couth colleagues in the film calls her a \u201cchattering windbag of conceited, gushing, heavy-chested man-woman.\u201d)Mr. Herzog\u2019s aesthetic adventurousness also makes him a bit of a mismatch with the conventional way he has chosen to relay Bell\u2019s exploits, which include attempts to make inroads with the Bedouins and the Druse and (eventually) advising the British on the carving up of the Middle East. Bell is embodied, in a commanding and versatile performance, by Nicole Kidman, who supplies a gravitas and emotional complexity worthy of the woman she plays.Unavoidably, the material puts Mr. Herzog on geographic and thematic territory previously charted by David Lean. (The heroine, like the protagonist of Mr. Lean\u2019s \u201cLawrence of Arabia,\u201d is shown in the Nafud Desert, the site of \u201cthe sun\u2019s anvil\u201d in that great 1962 film.) T. E. Lawrence himself appears; he is played, in a winking turn, by Robert Pattinson, who can be seen to even better effect \u2014 in the same period \u2014 in James Gray\u2019s coming \u201cThe Lost City of Z.\u201dThe first half dwells on Bell\u2019s romance with a junior diplomat (James Franco, surprisingly credible as a dashing Brit). In one of the few moments that smacks of true Herzogian weirdness, Mr. Franco\u2019s character takes Bell to the top of a tower where human remains have been left and asks to kiss her in front of a vulture. By the time Bell\u2019s affections turn to a married miliary officer (Damian Lewis), the movie has abandoned most of its eccentricities.But if Mr. Herzog mostly seems content to follow Hollywood rules, there are respects in which he improves on them. He has cast Arab actors in Arab roles, a change from the practice in Mr. Lean\u2019s era. And unlike Mr. Lean, he doesn\u2019t sentimentalize the landscape, which is not to say that \u201cQueen of the Desert\u201d is an ugly film. Even the stodgiest biopic would be redeemed by Mr. Herzog\u2019s eye. The shots that track Bell into her meetings with Arab leaders may have you catching your breath.Wrath-of-god level? No. But explorers need to work with what they find.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do Seas Make Us Sick? Surfers May Have the Answer", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byLA JOLLA, Calif. \u2014 On a recent trip, Cliff Kapono hit some of the more popular surf breaks in Ireland, England and Morocco. He\u2019s proudly Native Hawaiian and no stranger to the hunt for the perfect wave. But this time he was chasing something even more unusual: microbial swabs from fellow surfers.Mr. Kapono, a 29-year-old biochemist earning his doctorate at the University of California, San Diego, heads up the Surfer Biome Project, a unique effort to determine whether routine exposure to the ocean alters the microbial communities of the body, and whether those alterations might have consequences for surfers \u2014 and for the rest of us.Mr. Kapono has collected more than 500 samples by rubbing cotton-tipped swabs over the heads, mouths, navels and other parts of surfers\u2019 bodies, as well as their boards. Volunteers also donate a fecal sample.He uses mass spectrometry to create high-resolution maps of the chemical metabolites found in each sample. \u201cWe have the ability to see the molecular world, whether it\u2019s bacteria or a fungus or the chemical molecules,\u201d he said.Then, working in collaboration with U.C.S.D.\u2019s Center for Microbiome Innovation \u2014 a quick jaunt across the quad from his lab \u2014 Mr. Kapono and his colleagues sequence and map the microbes found on this unusually amphibious demographic.He and his colleagues are looking for signs of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Part of their aim is to determine whether, and to what extent, the ocean spreads the genes for resistance.Many antibiotics used today derive from chemicals produced by microbes to defend themselves or to attack other microorganisms. No surprise, then, that strains of competing bacteria have also evolved the genetic means to shrug off these chemicals.While drug resistance comes about because of antibiotic overuse, the genes responsible for creating resistance are widely disseminated in nature and have been evolving in microbes for eons. Startlingly, that means genes giving rise to drug resistance can be found in places untouched by modern antibiotics.\u201cThere was a gene that encoded resistance to it in something that was alive 6,000 years ago,\u201d he said in an interview.The ocean, home to an incredible diversity of dissolved chemistry, also acts as a reservoir for these genes, and researchers are trying to figure out if they move from the seas into the human population. So who better to study than surfers?\u201cA lot of the research of the transmission of resistant bacteria has focused on the role of the health care environment,\u201d said Anne Leonard, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Exeter who is investigating whether surfers have higher rates of bacterial colonization. \u201cWhat\u2019s less well studied is the role that natural environments play.\u201dBecause bacteria readily pick up and pass on genetic information across species, researchers suspect the risks of acquiring resistant genes are higher in places that facilitate direct transfer with microbes inhabiting the body. Coastal waters polluted with sewage, in this view, are probably more worrisome than smog or deep caves.At the moment, no one is sure whether it is actually possible for people to pick up these microbial genes from a long day at the beach. In the lab, however, Mr. Kapono has found evidence for the transfer of resistance genes from bacteria in the ocean into strains associated with the human gut when they are placed in proximity.Evolutionary pressures favored the emergence of resistant genes. Microbes are drawing upon this natural bank of resistance today to fend off the best drugs devised by humans.\u201cThese antibiotic resistance genes did not arise in order to make our lives awkward,\u201d Dr. Hanage said. \u201cThey have completely different functions that only have recently been repurposed.\u201d\u201cThese things are everywhere,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we want to stop them from moving into pathogens that are killing us, we need to understand where they are.\u201dBack in California, Mr. Kapono has begun analyzing the data from his globe-trotting quest. So far, neither he nor his collaborators have found evidence that swimmers or surfers are picking up antibiotic-resistant infections from the ocean.But Mr. Kapono noticed in his preliminary data that certain metabolites from his body came to resemble those of other local surfers as he moved from region to region. That could be a result of commonalities in diet or lifestyle \u2014 or it could be evidence that immersing our bodies in saline, microbe-rich environments has a detectable biochemical impact.Mr. Kapono has taken samples from surfers in California and Hawaii; surfers in the South Pacific are next. He is mulling a trip to Chile to conduct field work at Punta de Lobos. The rural location may yield some unique microbes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Heart Healthy in the Amazon", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byWell How to maintain a healthy heart is a surprisingly contentious question. Diet and exercise are crucial, everyone agrees \u2014 but the ideal specifics and the relationships among them remain mysterious. Some experts recommend avoiding dietary fats; others endorse fat and low carbohydrates. The impact of high levels of inflammation on heart disease is disputed. And almost no one can agree about how much (or what type of) exercise is optimal.But a study published last month in The Lancet points the way to resolving some of these issues by focusing on the Tsimane, a group of subsistence farmers and hunters living in Bolivia along a tributary of the Amazon River.Anthropologists have learned a lot about the lives of the Tsimane since they began studying them 15 years ago. The men typically spend seven hours or so of every day hunting, fishing or poling their canoes to towns to sell and procure food. The women devote almost as much time to gathering nuts and farming rice, corn and plantains. Men and women each cover roughly eight miles, or 17,000 steps, each day.Their diet is heavy on carbs: 72 percent of their daily calories derive from unprocessed starches, 14 percent from saturated and unsaturated fats and 14 percent from protein. Many Tsimane experience frequent infections and show chronically elevated levels of inflammation.Even among those older than 75, only 8 percent exceeded 99. A single person scored higher than 399. As a group, the Tsimane had scores less than one-fifth those of people in the United States or Europe. They exhibited less atherosclerosis than even Japanese women, previously thought to have the world\u2019s healthiest arteries. In general, the Tsimane developed the first signs of atherosclerosis almost 25 years later than their counterparts in the industrialized West.The implications of these findings are complex, says Hillard Kaplan, an anthropologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and the study\u2019s co-author. They raise questions about the effect of fats and carbohydrates on the heart and also about the cardiac impacts of inflammation, which does not contribute noticeably to atherosclerosis among the Tsimane.But Kaplan says the study indicates how essential it is to be very active physically \u2014 the Tsimane were in almost constant motion every day. The future of the Tsimane may tell us more about lifestyles and hearts, too. Modernity is intruding into their lives. Some now use motorized canoes, putt-putting up the river instead of poling by hand. Kaplan plans to continue monitoring his Tsimane volunteers. In a few years, their hearts may look more like ours.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Friday Mailbag: A Patriots Photo Lets Trump Score a Point", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byThe Public EditorPromoting the story on its Twitter feed, the Sports section spliced photos of the two events together, both taken on the south side of the White House, to indicate the comparative difference in attendance. (The photos were also included in the story.)The problem, however, was that the photo taken Wednesday included only players and coaches, whereas the photo taken during President Obama\u2019s tenure included over 40 additional support staff \u2014 who, this time around, were seated on the South Lawn \u2014 which greatly exaggerated the difference.After the Patriots pointed this out through the team\u2019s Twitter handle, the Times Sports section promptly sent another tweet to correct the earlier one, then removed the photo from its story and appended a correction.By Thursday morning President Trump had gotten wind of the error.Several readers were upset that The Times provided ammunition for right-wing critics.For every one thousand solid journalistic pieces you produce, each misstep like this puts you in the hole for two thousand more. Please \u2014 we are trying to save the real news, of which you are one of the few remaining outlets.Rick Regan, New Fairfield, Conn.One reader put the issue succinctly:Are you trying to give the right wing more to criticize The Times for?Dan Gerstman, BuffaloWe asked Jason Stallman, the Sports editor, for an explanation.Bad Tweet by me. Terrible Tweet. I wish I could say it\u2019s complicated, but no, this one is pretty straightforward: I\u2019m an idiot. It was my idea, it was my execution, it was my blunder. I made a decision in about four minutes that clearly warranted much more time. Once we learned more we tried to fix everything as much as possible, as swiftly as possible and as transparently as possible. Of course, at that point the damage was done. I just needed to own it.The booking photo of the victim, Demetrius Bryan Hollins, was included near the end.Several readers wrote in to protest the photo choices for the article.The news story uses professional, smiling photos of the two perpetrators and a mug shot of the (African American) victim. This perpetuates the stereotype of African Americans as violent criminals, even when they are the victims of crimes. I am sure that the Times would have been able to find a more appropriate photo of Mr. Hollins to use for this story.Beth Davidson, Washington, D.C.We brought the concern to Beth Flynn, the deputy photo editor, for a response.The only photos readily available for this piece were the handouts of the police officers and the booking mug of Mr. Hollins. That said, I think there were a few missed opportunities here. One, both (civilian) videos showing the horrific behavior by the police officers during the arrest were accessible online, and we should have made the effort to track down usage rights and add one to the top of the piece. Two, the (smiling) handout images of the officers should never have been the top of the article art. And three, the booking mug of Mr. Hollins, if that is all we had access to, could have been captioned to say he was kicked in the head by officers during the arrest (and then seeing his bleeding face in this picture would have added value). Thanks for sending the note along, this is a good post mortem conversation for our editors.We asked Celia Dugger, the editor of Health and Science, to explain the reasoning behind the decision.I began writing about this back in 1996 when I was an immigration reporter on the Metro desk covering the asylum case of Fauziya Kassindja. I decided in the course of reporting that case \u2014 especially after a reporting trip to Togo, her home country, and the Ivory Coast \u2014 to call it genital cutting rather than mutilation. I never minced words in describing exactly what form of cutting was involved, and there are many gradations of severity, and the terrible damage it did, and stayed away from the euphemistic circumcision, but chose to use the less culturally loaded term, genital cutting. There\u2019s a gulf between the Western (and some African) advocates who campaign against the practice and the people who follow the rite, and I felt the language used widened that chasm.This week a reader wrote in to ask The Times to drop the courtesy title \u201cMrs.\u201d for women altogether.Jillian Goodman, New York CityWe asked Phil Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, to address the question.Our style guidelines call for \u201cMs.\u201d as the regular courtesy title for a woman, unless the woman specifically expresses her preference for \u201cMrs.\u201d (or, rarely, \u201cMiss\u201d). So, for example, in the case of Theresa May, we had actually been referring to her as \u201cMs. May\u201d until we learned from her aides that she prefers \u201cMrs. May.\u201d Her Parliament webpage even makes this explicit. This approach is in keeping with our general practice of referring to people and organizations as they prefer. I realize, though, that the Ms./Mrs. distinction troubles many readers \u2014 and I think the use of \u201cMrs.\u201d has grown less and less common, in The Times as well as everywhere else.I just read the article in tonight\u2019s online edition about great old film noir classics now available to Amazon Prime subscribers, complete with in-story links to their pages on Amazon Prime. Is this a paid placement paid for by Amazon Prime meant to encourage readers to subscribe to Amazon Prime, and if so shouldn\u2019t that fact be noted?Christopher Ho, San FranciscoThe article is not paid placement from Amazon Prime. That list ran on Watching, The New York Times\u2019s new film and TV recommendation site. Given that there\u2019s more to watch than ever before \u2014 and more outlets on which to watch that content \u2014 we often try to direct Times readers toward great movies and series on specific streaming services. The idea for the list that Christopher points to came from the editorial staff, the films mentioned were chosen by me and the writer and there was not \u2014 and never is \u2014 any communication with Amazon about such things. Given the topics we write about on Watching, we often hope to provide value to readers by focusing on specific genres or streaming services. If you\u2019re interested in film noir, this list is for you. If you\u2019re not, there are other genre specific lists that might be. If you are already a subscriber to Amazon Prime, we hope to point you to movies that you may not have come across yet. Same can be said for lists we do that pertain to Netflix or Hulu or other streaming services. The goal in each of those cases is to dig into large and scattershot catalogs and tell readers what is worth their time.As for our recommendation for what to watch on Amazon Prime, though it\u2019s not a moody film noir classic, we highly endorse \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Well, one of us does, at least, if you can guess who.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Growth in Pizza, Paint and Credit-Card Companies", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byGrowth stocks \u2014 those whose earnings are expected to grow faster than average \u2014 surged in the first quarter. They carried with them the managers of several of the quarter\u2019s top-performing stock funds.Those managers grabbed onto that growth in expected sorts of companies, like Alphabet and Facebook, and in more surprising and mature ones like MasterCard, Domino\u2019s and Sherwin-Williams.The funds are also unified by a philosophy, Mr. Lynch said.\u201cWhat we do is try to buy good growth companies and own them for many years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look very different from any benchmark. We have differentiated holdings, and we take concentrated positions. And with that, comes some volatility.\u201d Shares of Amazon and Facebook, for example, each accounted for about 9 percent of the Growth fund\u2019s assets at the end of February.Morningstar\u2019s numbers bear out Mr. Lynch\u2019s points. The three funds\u2019 turnover ratios, indicating the percentage of holdings sold annually, are below average, while their risk ratings are above. Put differently, the funds tend to trade less than average, but their returns tend to roller-coaster more than the indexes they\u2019re benchmarked against.A characteristic shared by many of the funds\u2019 holdings is that they can be tough to pigeonhole in a conventional investment sector, like technology or health care, Mr. Lynch said. \u201cIf there\u2019s not an easy category or comparison, then the company is more likely unique,\u201d he said.Take Alphabet, the holding company for Google. Many people call it a tech company, but it makes its money from advertising, which would traditionally point to media. \u201cThey used the internet to create a large audience and then disrupted the advertising world,\u201d he said.The largest and, in the most recent quarter, best performing of the three Morgan Stanley funds was the Growth fund. The fund, whose A shares carry an expense ratio of 0.96 percent, returned 16.25 percent for the quarter, compared with 5.5 percent for the S.&P. 500-stock index.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to identify two to three dozen high-growth companies whose stocks have little to do with one another,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then let that growth germinate. We\u2019re trying to invest in companies for three or four years.\u201dAnother point of emphasis is ensuring the returns of the fund\u2019s investments are not correlated with one another. The managers do that by using both statistical screens and fundamental analyses of how businesses may interact in unexpected ways, Mr. Galvin said. It is also one of the reasons they limit the portfolio\u2019s size. After about 35 stocks, he said, correlations in stock prices start to rise. \u201cEither the companies are competing with each other, or they\u2019re impacted by the same macroeconomic trends,\u201d he said.One of the qualities that drew Mr. Galvin and his colleagues to Domino\u2019s, the pizza delivery chain, was that its size and strong financials have enabled it to invest heavily in technology. And that has differentiated it from independent pizza peddlers, he said.\u201cThe digital divide is finally separating them from the mom-and-pop operators,\u201d he said. \u201cWith digital, you tap the app and have a pizza delivered, along with other menu items. Local operators don\u2019t have the financial wherewithal to invest in that kind of technology.\u201dMr. Galvin and his team divide their holdings into two groups: established companies, like Domino\u2019s, and emerging ones, like biotechnology outfits. The former \u201cprovide ballast to the portfolio,\u201d and the latter, opportunities for outsized returns, he said.\u201cWhen you have about half the portfolio in each of those, it blends out at an 18 to 22 percent level\u201d of average earnings growth, he said.The Columbia fund, whose A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.08 percent, returned 15.6 percent in the first quarter.\u201cI was just trading too much, and I didn\u2019t think I was that good at trading,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m doing good work, I should recognize mistakes, but I should also let the ideas develop.\u201d That means selling when he\u2019s sure an investment has gone bad but also hanging on through down periods if he is confident in a company\u2019s plans and prospects.Like any growth manager, Mr. Weiner hunts for strong, sustainable earnings growth. That has led him to put more than a third of the portfolio in technology stocks, like Facebook and Amazon. But it can also lead him into less obvious plays like the paint company Sherwin-Williams.\u201cThe paint-store business is huge and consistent and grows nicely year in and year out,\u201d he said. Sherwin-Williams caters to professional painters, and they\u2019re loyal in return. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go to Home Depot,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want 30-day terms.\u201d That is, they want to finance purchases for a month, rather than paying upfront.The business has pricing power, too, he said. The actual paint is a small enough portion of the cost of most paint jobs that the final consumer is not that sensitive to changes in price. \u201cPeople hire a painter and get a quote and have no idea what the cost of paint is in the quote,\u201d Mr. Weiner said.The Growth Discovery Fund, with an expense ratio of 0.78 percent, returned 12.15 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}

Netflix has a little over 250 horror movies, many of them classics \u2014 \u201cThe Legend of Hell House,\u201d from 1973, loomed large in my early-teen years, because it\u2019s really scary, and also because it touched off my lifelong crush on the actress Pamela Franklin.

Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. It was a session that Mr. Kalanick was dreading.For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple\u2019s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased \u2014 a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple\u2019s privacy guidelines.But Apple was onto the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve been breaking some of our rules,\u201d Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber\u2019s app would be kicked out of Apple\u2019s App Store.For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber\u2019s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers \u2014 essentially destroying the ride-hailing company\u2019s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded.In a quest to build Uber into the world\u2019s dominant ride-hailing entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow.But the previously unreported encounter with Mr. Cook showed how Mr. Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale, sometimes to the very brink of implosion.Crossing that line was not a one-off for Mr. Kalanick. According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships, Mr. Kalanick, 40, is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost \u2014 a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009.\u201cTravis\u2019s biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals,\u201d said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Mr. Kalanick. \u201cTravis\u2019s biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That\u2019s the best way to describe him.\u201dThat quality also extended to his personal life, where Mr. Kalanick mixes with celebrities like Jay Z and businessmen including President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn. But it has alienated some Uber executives, employees and advisers. Mr. Kalanick, with salt-and-pepper hair, a fast-paced walk and an iPhone practically embedded in his hand, is described by friends as more at ease with data and numbers (some consider him a math savant) than with people.Through an Uber spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined an interview request. Apple declined to comment on the meeting with Mr. Cook. Many of the people interviewed for this article, who revealed previously unreported details of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s life, asked to remain anonymous because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with Uber or feared damaging their relationship with the chief executive.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s pattern for pushing limits is deeply ingrained. It began during his childhood in suburban Los Angeles, where he went from being bullied to being the aggressor, continued through his years taking risks at two technology start-ups there, and crystallized in his role at Uber.Mr. Kalanick grew up in the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles. His parents, Bonnie and Donald Kalanick, made sure he and his brother, Cory, were never left wanting. He was naturally athletic and competitive, and excelled at running track and playing football.At Patrick Henry Middle School, he was a wiry student who got good grades \u2014 putting him in the sights of some older kids who picked on him. Mr. Kalanick later vowed never to be bullied again and turned the tables on his tormentors.He also showed signs of entrepreneurialism. One summer, he sold knives door-to-door for the cutlery company Cutco. At 18, he started New Way Academy, his own SAT prep business, with a partner.The start-up life soon called to him. After attending the University of California, Los Angeles, to major in computer engineering, Mr. Kalanick dropped out in 1998 to form a start-up with several classmates. The company, Scour, became a peer-to-peer file exchange similar to Napster, which let people digitally share music and media files through legally dubious means.Scour, which was eventually sued for $250 billion for alleged copyright infringement, filed for bankruptcy in October 2000, a move that protected it from the suit. The failure did not stop Mr. Kalanick from helping to found another Los Angeles start-up, Red Swoosh, four months later. Red Swoosh made a technology to efficiently transfer large files of digital data; one of its investors was Mr. Cuban.Sean Stanton, Red Swoosh\u2019s former vice president for sales, said of Mr. Kalanick: \u201cScour was about efficiency. Swoosh was about efficiency. It\u2019s just the way his brain is wired. It\u2019s like the way Uber works right now: What\u2019s the fastest, cheapest and most efficient way to get from point A to point B? That consumes him, and all parts of his life.\u201dWith Red Swoosh, Mr. Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness. When the company struggled, Mr. Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks \u2014 which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the Internal Revenue Service \u2014 and reinvested the money into the start-up, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal.With Mr. Kalanick desperate to keep Red Swoosh afloat, he moved back into his parents\u2019 house. He staved off bankruptcy for a second time by raising another round of funding. The wayward tax dollars eventually went to the I.R.S.Mr. Kalanick also decamped to Thailand with his software team in April 2006 to save money by living cheaply abroad, while also using the trip as a team-building exercise.In 2007, Mr. Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai, a cloud services company, for roughly $19 million. The deal turned the executive, who had headed north to San Francisco, into a millionaire.By then, some advisers had soured on him. \u201cThe Travis Kalanick I came to know 17 years ago was relentless in pursuit of his goals at the expense of those who supported him along the way, deluded by his own embellished personal narrative, and a serial prevaricator,\u201d said Peter Yorke, a former Red Swoosh adviser and a longtime tech executive.Others stuck by him. Michael Robertson, chief executive of MP3.com, an early digital music sharing service, said that he told Mr. Kalanick, \u201cSometimes in business you have to battle the establishment, and it can get brutal and ugly.\u201dIn San Francisco, Mr. Kalanick and Angie You, his longtime girlfriend, bought a townhouse nestled in the upper hills of the city\u2019s Castro section. Though the couple have since split, the two remain close and still speak on a regular basis.The idea for Uber came in 2009 from Garrett Camp, a friend of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s, who became fixated on hailing a private luxury car with a smartphone app after being unable to catch cabs in San Francisco.A few months later, Mr. Kalanick changed his mind and took over as UberCab\u2019s chief. He quickly positioned the start-up as an alternative to the taxi industry. At the time, taxi companies had iron grips in many towns. City-by-city regulations required procedures like base stations for cabs, safety measures and other stipulations.Mr. Kalanick ignored those rules.\u201cWe\u2019re in a political campaign,\u201d he once said at a technology conference, and the candidate is Uber. The opponent is named Taxi, he said, adding a rude descriptive. \u201cNobody likes him, he\u2019s not a nice character, but he\u2019s so woven into the political machinery and fabric that a lot of people owe him favors.\u201dMr. Kalanick carried that same level of intensity into Uber\u2019s headquarters, pacing briskly while working by doing laps around the office. His pacing is so legendary, his father once said, that he wore a hole in the carpeting.Mr. Kalanick focused on expanding UberCab quickly. The company typically sent a small strike team into a new city \u2014 say, Seattle \u2014 to aggressively recruit new drivers through Craigslist and other online listings. Then the team marketed UberCab\u2019s app to increase ridership.That drew attention from regulators. In October 2010, the company shortened its name to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from San Francisco officials for marketing itself as a taxi company without the proper licenses and permits.To influence local legislators to accept Uber, Mr. Kalanick took extra steps. In 2014, Uber hired Ben Metcalfe, an engineer who described his job on LinkedIn as building \u201ccustom tools to support citizen engagement across legislative matters\u201d to drive \u201csocial good and social change.\u201dIn practice, Mr. Metcalfe and his team created an email-based system to aid Uber users and drivers to directly contact local legislators to lobby for allowing Uber in their cities. The system was similar to Change.org, a website that pushes social change through online petitions. City and state officials were soon deluged with emails supporting Uber.In some places, Uber employees were also told to create computer programs known as scripts that would automatically vote for the ride-hailing service in city-administered surveys.Mr. de Blasio capitulated, and the cap did not take place.As Uber gained momentum, Mr. Kalanick moved into the spotlight.It did not come naturally. One friend recalled a night out with a group of married couples at the Gold Club, a San Francisco strip club, a few years ago. Mr. Kalanick, who was single, pulled out a laptop to work on a spreadsheet, crunching Uber\u2019s numbers while friends watched the dancers onstage.Another friend called Mr. Kalanick a \u201ctech world rock star,\u201d which means something different in Silicon Valley than in the music world.\u201cTo work with and around one requires a different kind of mentality and skill,\u201d said Andy Abramson, an early adviser to Mr. Kalanick. Mr. Abramson likened the chief executive to other idiosyncratic founders like Jeff Bezos of Amazon.Mr. Kalanick was eventually coaxed more into the limelight by others. Shervin Pishevar, an Uber investor, sometimes took Mr. Kalanick to clubs in Los Angeles on the weekend, providing a car and a change of \u201cclub clothes.\u201d Mr. Pishevar, who did not respond to a request for comment, was the Uber chief\u2019s entryway into Los Angeles\u2019s world of celebrity.Hollywood stars were eager to buy into Uber, which they had started using to get around. Actors like Edward Norton, Olivia Munn and Sophia Bush took small stakes in the company. Mr. Kalanick and a top lieutenant, Emil Michael, sometimes hung out with Leonardo DiCaprio, who is also an investor, and Jay Z, whose wife, Beyonc\u00e9, performed for Uber employees at a poolside party in Las Vegas in 2015.Jay Z once wired money to Mr. Michael in an attempt to invest even more in Uber. Mr. Michael and Mr. Kalanick, giddy at rebuffing a celebrity, wired some of the money back, saying they already had too many interested investors. Representatives for Jay Z did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Kalanick also dreamed of luring celebrities into advisory roles at Uber. One aim was persuading Oprah Winfrey to join the board \u2014 something Uber executives believed could happen after Mr. Kalanick met Ms. Winfrey at a party on the Spanish island of Ibiza \u2014 but the idea never jelled. A spokeswoman for Ms. Winfrey declined to comment.Mr. Kalanick began mixing with elite business executives. He developed a close relationship with Mr. Cohn, then a top-ranking executive at Goldman Sachs. At one point, the two men spoke on a near daily basis. Mr. Cohn and a White House spokeswoman did not return requests for comment.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s main mantra was \u201cgrowth above all else.\u201dThat meant Uber\u2019s top performers were often promoted and protected. When one general manager, a title for a city-level chief, threw a coffee mug at a subordinate in a fit of rage, the incident was reported to human resources \u2014 but there was no follow-up. At the time, Uber\u2019s business in the general manager\u2019s city was strong.Other complaints also fell on deaf ears.After a backlash over Uber\u2019s use of \u201csurge pricing\u201d (raising ride prices when demand is high) amid an East Coast snowstorm in 2013, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s response to upset riders was a torrent of economics and math.Friends and employees told Mr. Kalanick that he should at least pretend to care about how it looked to take such a hostile stance with Uber\u2019s users. Several described him as \u201cemotionally unintelligent.\u201dWith Mr. Kalanick setting the tone at Uber, employees acted to ensure the ride-hailing service would win no matter what.They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers\u2019 emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft\u2019s business. (Lyft, too, operates a competitive intelligence team.)Uber also tried to win over Lyft\u2019s drivers. Uber\u2019s \u201cdriver satisfaction rating,\u201d an internal metric, has dropped since February 2016, and roughly a quarter of its drivers turn over on average every three months. According to an internal slide deck on driver income levels viewed by The New York Times, Uber considered Lyft and McDonald\u2019s its main competition for attracting new drivers.To frustrate Lyft drivers, Uber dispatched some employees to order and cancel Lyft rides en masse. Others hailed Lyfts and spent the rides persuading drivers to switch to Uber full time.That year, Uber came close to buying Lyft. At a meeting at Mr. Kalanick\u2019s house, and over cartons of Chinese food, he and Mr. Michael hosted Lyft\u2019s president, John Zimmer, who asked for 15 percent of Uber in exchange for selling Lyft. Over the next hour, Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Michael repeatedly laughed at Mr. Zimmer\u2019s audacious request. No deal was reached. Lyft declined to comment.The rivalry remains in force. In 2016, Uber held a summit meeting in Mexico City for some top managers, where it distributed a playbook on how to cut into Lyft\u2019s business and had sessions on how to damage its competitor.To develop its own business, Uber sidestepped the authorities. Some employees started using a tool called Greyball to deceive officials trying to shut down Uber\u2019s service. The tool, developed to aid driver safety and to trick fraudsters, essentially showed a fake version of Uber\u2019s app to some people to disguise the locations of cars and drivers. It soon became a way for Uber drivers to evade capture by law enforcement in places where the service was deemed illegal.The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber\u2019s app, began in 2014.At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased and resold. Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides from those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers could earn more money this way.The start-up has undertaken an extraordinary experiment in behavioral science to subtly entice an independent work force to maximize company revenue.To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called \u201cfingerprinting.\u201d Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents.There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple\u2019s rules. Mr. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner\u2019s identity remained on the device.So Mr. Kalanick told his engineers to \u201cgeofence\u201d Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber\u2019s software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code for people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber\u2019s fingerprinting.The ruse did not last. Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Uber\u2019s methods, prompting Mr. Cook to call Mr. Kalanick to his office.Mr. Kalanick was shaken by Mr. Cook\u2019s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting.But only momentarily. After all, Mr. Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Uber Uses Psychological Tricks to Push Its Drivers\u2019 Buttons", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "The secretive ride-hailing giant Uber rarely discusses internal matters in public. But in March, facing crises on multiple fronts, top officials convened a call for reporters to insist that Uber was changing its culture and would no longer tolerate \u201cbrilliant jerks.\u201dNotably, the company also announced that it would fix its troubled relationship with drivers, who have complained for years about falling pay and arbitrary treatment.And yet even as Uber talks up its determination to treat drivers more humanely, it is engaged in an extraordinary behind-the-scenes experiment in behavioral science to manipulate them in the service of its corporate growth \u2014 an effort whose dimensions became evident in interviews with several dozen current and former Uber officials, drivers and social scientists, as well as a review of behavioral research.Uber\u2019s innovations reflect the changing ways companies are managing workers amid the rise of the freelance-based \u201cgig economy.\u201d Its drivers are officially independent business owners rather than traditional employees with set schedules. This allows Uber to minimize labor costs, but means it cannot compel drivers to show up at a specific place and time. And this lack of control can wreak havoc on a service whose goal is to seamlessly transport passengers whenever and wherever they want.Uber helps solve this fundamental problem by using psychological inducements and other techniques unearthed by social science to influence when, where and how long drivers work. It\u2019s a quest for a perfectly efficient system: a balance between rider demand and driver supply at the lowest cost to passengers and the company.Employing hundreds of social scientists and data scientists, Uber has experimented with video game techniques, graphics and noncash rewards of little value that can prod drivers into working longer and harder \u2014 and sometimes at hours and locations that are less lucrative for them.To keep drivers on the road, the company has exploited some people\u2019s tendency to set earnings goals \u2014 alerting them that they are ever so close to hitting a precious target when they try to log off. It has even concocted an algorithm similar to a Netflix feature that automatically loads the next program, which many experts believe encourages binge-watching. In Uber\u2019s case, this means sending drivers their next fare opportunity before their current ride is even over.And most of this happens without giving off a whiff of coercion.\u201cWe show drivers areas of high demand or incentivize them to drive more,\u201d said Michael Amodeo, an Uber spokesman. \u201cBut any driver can stop work literally at the tap of a button \u2014 the decision whether or not to drive is 100 percent theirs.\u201dBut an examination by The New York Times found that Uber is continuing apace in its struggle to wield the upper hand with drivers. And as so-called platform-mediated work like driving for Uber increasingly becomes the way people make a living, the company\u2019s example illustrates that pulling psychological levers may eventually become the reigning approach to managing the American worker.Of course, many companies try to nudge consumers into buying their products and services using psychological tricks. But extending these efforts to the work force is potentially transformative.Uber exists in a kind of legal and ethical purgatory, however. Because its drivers are independent contractors, they lack most of the protections associated with employment. By mastering their workers\u2019 mental circuitry, Uber and the like may be taking the economy back toward a pre-New Deal era when businesses had enormous power over workers and few checks on their ability to exploit it.In early 2016, a group of roughly 100 Uber employees responsible for signing up drivers and getting them to drive more voted to change its name \u2014 from \u201csupply growth\u201d to \u201cdriver growth.\u201dThe vote was not unprompted. For much of the previous year, Uber executives had agonized over how to lower the rate at which drivers were deserting the platform.Alongside Uber\u2019s already daunting targets for expanding its pool of drivers to meet mounting demand, the high turnover threatened to cap the company\u2019s growth and throw it into crisis.Uber conducted interviews and focus groups while executives peppered employees with questions like, \u201cWhat are we doing to have more empathy for the driver side of the equation?\u201dThis is particularly true of shortages so pronounced as to create a \u201csurge\u201d \u2014 that is, a higher fare than normal. While surges do mitigate shortages, they do so in part by repelling passengers, something directly at odds with Uber\u2019s long-term goal of dominating the industry. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s better not to surge,\u201d said Daniel Graf, Uber\u2019s vice president of product. \u201cIf we don\u2019t surge, we can produce more rides.\u201dAs a result, much of Uber\u2019s communication with drivers over the years has aimed at combating shortages by advising drivers to move to areas where they exist, or where they might arise. Uber encouraged its local managers to experiment with ways of achieving this.\u201cIt was all day long, every day \u2014 texts, emails, pop-ups: \u2018Hey, the morning rush has started. Get to this area, that\u2019s where demand is biggest,\u2019\u201d said Ed Frantzen, a veteran Uber driver in the Chicago area. \u201cIt was always, constantly, trying to get you into a certain direction.\u201dSome local managers who were men went so far as to adopt a female persona for texting drivers, having found that the uptake was higher when they did.\u201c\u2018Laura\u2019 would tell drivers: \u2018Hey, the concert\u2019s about to let out. You should head over there,\u2019\u201d said John P. Parker, a manager in Uber\u2019s Dallas office in 2014 and 2015, referring to one of the personas. \u201cWe have an overwhelmingly male driver population.\u201dUber acknowledged that it had experimented with female personas to increase engagement with drivers.The friction over meeting demand was compounded by complaints about arrangements like aggressive car leases that required many drivers to work upward of 50 or 60 hours each week to eke out a profit. Uber officials began to worry that a driver backlash was putting them at a strategic disadvantage in their competition with Lyft, which had cultivated a reputation for being more driver-friendly.Now Uber began a process of, in effect, becoming a little less like Mr. Kalanick, and a little more like Lyft.It rethought a lease program, softened the hectoring tone of its messages and limited their volume. At times it became positively cheery.During roughly the same period, Uber was increasingly concerned that many new drivers were leaving the platform before completing the 25 rides that would earn them a signing bonus. To stem that tide, Uber officials in some cities began experimenting with simple encouragement: You\u2019re almost halfway there, congratulations!While the experiment seemed warm and innocuous, it had in fact been exquisitely calibrated. The company\u2019s data scientists had previously discovered that once drivers reached the 25-ride threshold, their rate of attrition fell sharply.And psychologists and video game designers have long known that encouragement toward a concrete goal can motivate people to complete a task.\u201cIt\u2019s getting you to internalize the company\u2019s goals,\u201d said Chelsea Howe, a prominent video game designer who has spoken out against coercive psychological techniques deployed in games. \u201cInternalized motivation is the most powerful kind.\u201dMr. Amodeo, the Uber spokesman, defended the practice. \u201cWe try to make the early experience as good as possible, but also as realistic as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to decide for themselves if driving is right for them.\u201dThat making drivers feel good could be compatible with treating them as lab subjects was no surprise. None other than Lyft itself had shown as much several years earlier.In 2013, the company hired a consulting firm to figure out how to encourage more driving during the platform\u2019s busiest hours.At the time, Lyft drivers could voluntarily sign up in advance for shifts. The consultants devised an experiment in which the company showed one group of inexperienced drivers how much more they would make by moving from a slow period like Tuesday morning to a busy time like Friday night \u2014 about $15 more per hour.For another group, Lyft reversed the calculation, displaying how much drivers were losing by sticking with Tuesdays.The latter had a more significant effect on increasing the hours drivers scheduled during busy periods.Still, Ms. Berman disclosed in an interview, Lyft eventually decided against using the loss-aversion approach, suggesting that the company has drawn brighter lines when it comes to potential manipulation.As he tried to log off at 7:13 a.m. on New Year\u2019s Day last year, Josh Streeter, then an Uber driver in the Tampa, Fla., area, received a message on the company\u2019s driver app with the headline \u201cMake it to $330.\u201d The text then explained: \u201cYou\u2019re $10 away from making $330 in net earnings. Are you sure you want to go offline?\u201d Below were two prompts: \u201cGo offline\u201d and \u201cKeep driving.\u201d The latter was already highlighted.\u201cI\u2019ve got screen shots with dozens of these messages,\u201d said Mr. Streeter, who began driving full time for Lyft and then Uber in 2014 but quit last year to invest in real estate.Mr. Streeter was not alone. For months, when drivers tried to log out, the app would frequently tell them they were only a certain amount away from making a seemingly arbitrary sum for the day, or from matching their earnings from that point one week earlier.The messages were intended to exploit another relatively widespread behavioral tic \u2014 people\u2019s preoccupation with goals \u2014 to nudge them into driving longer.Uber, for its part, appears to be aware of the ludic loop. In its messages to drivers, it included a graphic of an engine gauge with a needle that came tantalizingly close to, but was still short of, a dollar sign.And the ludic loop is far from the only video game feature that Uber has adapted as a way of keeping drivers on the road.At any moment, the app shows drivers how many trips they have taken in the current week, how much money they have made, how much time they have spent logged on and what their overall rating from passengers is. All of these metrics can stimulate the competitive juices that drive compulsive game-playing.\u201cThe whole thing is like a video game,\u201d said Eli Solomon, a veteran Uber and Lyft driver in the Chicago area, who said he sometimes had to fight the urge to work more after glancing at his data.Sometimes the so-called gamification is quite literal. Like players on video game platforms such as Xbox, PlayStation and Pogo, Uber drivers can earn badges for achievements like Above and Beyond (denoted on the app by a cartoon of a rocket blasting off), Excellent Service (marked by a picture of a sparkling diamond) and Entertaining Drive (a pair of Groucho Marx glasses with nose and eyebrows).Of course, managers have been borrowing from the logic of games for generations, as when they set up contests and competition among workers. More overt forms of gamification have proliferated during the past decade. For example, Microsoft has used the approach to entice workers to perform the otherwise sleep-inducing task of software debugging.But Uber can go much further. Because it mediates its drivers\u2019 entire work experience through an app, there are few limits to the elements it can gamify. Uber collects staggering amounts of data that allow it to discard game features that do not work and refine those that do. And because its workers are contractors, the gamification strategies are not hemmed in by employment law.Kevin Werbach, a business professor who has written extensively on the subject, said that while gamification could be a force for good in the gig economy \u2014 for example, by creating bonds among workers who do not share a physical space \u2014 there was a danger of abuse. \u201cIf what you\u2019re doing is basically saying, \u2018We\u2019ve found a cheap way to get you to do work without paying you for it, we\u2019ll pay you in badges that don\u2019t cost anything,\u2019 that\u2019s a manipulative way to go about it,\u201d he said.For some drivers, that is precisely the effect. Scott Weber said he drove full time most weeks last year, picking up passengers in the Tampa area for both Uber and Lyft, yet made less than $20,000 before expenses like gas and maintenance. \u201cI was a business that had a loss,\u201d said Mr. Weber, who is looking for another job. \u201cI\u2019m using payday loans.\u201dStill, when asked about the badges he earns while driving for Uber, Mr. Weber practically gushed. \u201cI\u2019ve got currently 12 excellent-service and nine great-conversation badges,\u201d he said in an interview in early March. \u201cIt tells me where I\u2019m at.\u201dWhen asked whether Uber\u2019s product managers and data scientists were akin to developers at a social gaming company like Zynga, Jonathan Hall, Uber\u2019s head of economic and policy research, accepted the analogy but rejected the implication.\u201cI think there\u2019s something to that, but ultimately Zynga should worry mostly about how fun its games are rather than trying to get you to play a little bit more by some trick,\u201d he said. He argued that exploiting people\u2019s psychological tics was unlikely to have more than a marginal effect on how long they played Zynga\u2019s games or drove for Uber. It is \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d he said.Mr. Hall is clearly right about the effects of certain techniques, like those pitched at drivers\u2019 tendency to set income targets or to focus more on losses than gains. On the other hand, even features that produce relatively small changes in driving patterns can become quite important to a company like Uber.According to Mr. Parker, the former Uber manager in Dallas, increasing the number of drivers on the road by 20 percent at certain hours of the day, or in a busy part of town, can rein in a large fare surge.More important, some of the psychological levers that Uber pulls to increase the supply of drivers have quite powerful effects.Consider an algorithm called forward dispatch \u2014 Lyft has a similar one \u2014 that dispatches a new ride to a driver before the current one ends. Forward dispatch shortens waiting times for passengers, who may no longer have to wait for a driver 10 minutes away when a second driver is dropping off a passenger two minutes away.Perhaps no less important, forward dispatch causes drivers to stay on the road substantially longer during busy periods \u2014 a key goal for both companies.Uber and Lyft explain this in essentially the same way. \u201cDrivers keep telling us the worst thing is when they\u2019re idle for a long time,\u201d said Kevin Fan, the director of product at Lyft. \u201cIf it\u2019s slow, they\u2019re going to go sign off. We want to make sure they\u2019re constantly busy.\u201dWhile this is unquestionably true, there is another way to think of the logic of forward dispatch: It overrides self-control.As with viewers and binge-watching, many drivers appear to enjoy the forward-dispatch feature, which can increase earnings by keeping them busier. But it can also work against their interests by increasing the number of drivers on the road and defusing fare surges. And whether they enjoy it is separate from the question of agency \u2014 whether they have it, or whether the company does.Uber officials say the feature initially produced so many rides at times that drivers began to experience a chronic Netflix ailment \u2014 the inability to stop for a bathroom break. Amid the uproar, Uber introduced a pause button.\u201cDrivers were saying: \u2018I can never go offline. I\u2019m on just continuous trips. This is a problem.\u2019 So we redesigned it,\u201d said Maya Choksi, a senior Uber official in charge of building products that help drivers. \u201cIn the middle of the trip, you can say, \u2018Stop giving me requests.\u2019 So you can have more control over when you want to stop driving.\u201dSometimes all that is necessary is the mere setting of a so-called default. Because humans tend to be governed by inertia, automatically enrolling them in retirement savings plans and then allowing them to opt out results in far higher participation than letting them opt in. Making Post-Play the default can have the same effect.\u201cIf done right, these things can be socially beneficial,\u201d Mr. Laibson said. \u201cBut you can think of all sorts of choice architecture that are quite contrary to human well-being.\u201dEven Mr. Hall, the Uber research director who downplayed the importance of behavioral economics to the company, did make at least one concession. \u201cThe optimal default we set is that we want you to do as much work as there is to do,\u201d he said of the company\u2019s app. \u201cYou\u2019re not required to by any means. But that\u2019s the default.\u201dThere are aspects of the platforms that genuinely do increase drivers\u2019 control over their work lives, as Uber frequently points out. Unlike most workers, an Uber driver can put in a few hours each day between dropping children off at school and picking them up in the afternoon.Uber is even in the process of developing a feature that allows drivers to tell the app in advance that they need to arrive at a given location at a given time. \u201cIf you need to pick up your kids at soccer practice at 6 p.m.,\u201d said Nundu Janakiram, the Uber official in charge of products that improve drivers\u2019 experiences, \u201cit will start to give you trips to take you in the general direction to get to a specific place in time.\u201dThere is also the possibility that as the online gig economy matures, companies like Uber may adopt a set of norms that limit their ability to manipulate workers through cleverly designed apps.Kelly Peters, chief executive of BEworks, a management consulting firm specializing in behavioral science, argued that the same data that makes it easier for Uber to nudge drivers into working an additional 30 or 60 minutes also makes it hard to escape the obligation to look after them.That moment of maturity does not appear to have arrived yet, however. Consider a prompt that Uber rolled out this year, inviting drivers to press a large box if they want the app to navigate them to an area where they have a \u201chigher chance\u201d of finding passengers. The accompanying graphic resembles the one that indicates that an area\u2019s fares are \u201csurging,\u201d except in this case fares are not necessarily higher.Some drivers believe that the intent is to trick them into driving where Uber wants them to go, rather than where driving would be most profitable, by implying that they will find a surge there. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to move people where they want them,\u201d said Mr. Weber, the Tampa-area driver. \u201cBut you get there and it\u2019s nothing. It happens all the time.\u201d Mr. Weber noted that the design of the graphic makes the prompt much easier to accept than decline, which requires pressing a small rectangle in the top left corner.Uber said that the feature was an experiment intended primarily to help new drivers who frequently say they do not know where to find passengers, and that it could be changed if drivers were dissatisfied.Individual features aside, the broader question of how much Uber seeks to influence drivers through behavioral science may come down to how much its business model requires it.While the company has made no secret of its investment in self-driving cars, it could be a decade or more before they completely replace human drivers. In the meantime, as long as Uber continues to set growth and passenger volume as critical goals, it will have an incentive to make wringing more hours out of drivers a higher priority than the drivers\u2019 bottom line whenever it faces a close call between the two.Moreover, the contractor model itself provides a strong impetus for companies like Uber to grow. Many companies in the gig economy simply do not have enough workers, or rich enough data about their workers\u2019 behavior, to navigate busy periods using nudges and the like. To avoid chronic understaffing, they have switched to an employee model that allows them to compel workers to log in when the companies most need them.Once companies achieve a certain scale, on the other hand, they enter a virtuous cycle: The risk of understaffing drops with a big enough pool of workers, and the cost savings of using contractors begins to outweigh the inefficiencies. This in turn frees up money to enter new markets and acquire new customers, which makes the contractor model still more efficient, and throws off still more savings.It is, as a result, not too hard to imagine a future in which massive digital platforms like Uber have an appetite for tens of millions of workers \u2014 not only for ferrying people, but also for delivering food and retail goods. Nor is it hard to imagine workers\u2019 obliging them, perhaps because their skills do not match the needs of more traditional employers, or because they need to supplement their wages.In such an economy, experts say, using big data and algorithms to manage workers will not simply be a niche phenomenon. It may become one of the most common ways of managing the American labor force.\u201cYou have all these players entering into this space, and the assumption is they\u2019ll do it through vast armies of underemployed people looking for extra hours, and we can control every nuance about what they do but not have to pay them,\u201d said David Weil, the top wage-and-hour official under President Barack Obama.When you stop to consider the enormous cost advantages, Mr. Weil said, \u201cit says to me this is an area that will grow fast.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cloud Produces Sunny Earnings at Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 The moneymaking machines at the core of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, are notably different. But the respective kings of online retailing, software and internet search should all credit a relatively new line of business for lifting their financial results.In their quarterly earnings reports on Thursday, the three said cloud computing \u2014 through which they rent computing services and online access to software hosted in their data centers \u2014 was growing faster than their larger, older businesses.For the first quarter, which ended March 31, Amazon said its total net income rose to $724 million, or $1.48 a share, from $513 million, or $1.07 a share, a year ago. The company said the $890 million in operating income from its cloud business, called Amazon Web Services or A.W.S., accounted for most of its overall profits.The worry, however, is that this cannot last forever, not with Microsoft and Google making big investments in their own cloud businesses while trying to undercut Amazon with lower prices.That has not happened \u2014 at least not yet. While A.W.S. revenue grew at a slower pace than in the past, it still rose a healthy 43 percent to $3.66 billion. The company\u2019s shares rose 1 percent in after-hours trading.\u201cThere\u2019s always this moment when people think, \u2018Is the magic going to run out?\u2019\u201d said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t panned out.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s Azure cloud hosting business grew by 93 percent from the year-earlier quarter. And the cloud version of its productivity software Office 365, sold to companies as an online service, grew by 45 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing continued strong demand for our commercial cloud-based services,\u201d Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview.Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts that the Google cloud platform was one of the company\u2019s \u201cfastest-growing businesses,\u201d though she offered no details.Still, nearly all of Alphabet\u2019s business comes from advertising on the Google sites and services, which is still expanding despite tough competition from Facebook.First-quarter earnings increased to $7.73 a share while revenue jumped 22 percent to $24.75 billion. Average estimates from Thomson Reuters had been for $7.39 a share in earnings with revenue of $24.19 billion.The stock rose 4 percent in after-hours trading on the news.Alphabet\u2019s speculative ventures, including its home electronics division, Nest, and its autonomous car division, Waymo, are listed as \u201cother bets.\u201d In the first quarter, the other-bets revenue rose 48 percent to $244 million. But losses increased 10 percent to $855 million.Google\u2019s total digital ad revenue has doubled since 2012. But for all the success that demonstrates, so much of advertising is becoming digital that Google\u2019s share of the online portion is actually slipping, according eMarketer. Five years ago, Google had a 35.9 percent share of global digital ad revenue, the data firm said. In 2016, it was 32.8 percent.The pots of money Alphabet is making could provide some consolation after major brands, including AT&T and Verizon, recently learned that their ads were appearing alongside inflammatory YouTube videos that promoted hate speech. Some advertisers vowed to drop YouTube, a Google property, until the problem was fixed.For its part, Microsoft\u2019s overall revenue rose 8 percent in the quarter, to $22.09 billion. That was enhanced by $975 million in revenue from LinkedIn, the professional networking site that Microsoft bought for $26 billion in a deal that closed in December.Microsoft\u2019s total operating revenue, which includes the deferred accounting for sales of its Windows 10 personal computer operating system, was higher, at $23.56 billion. That figure is the focus of Wall Street analysts, and the result was slightly below their consensus estimate of $23.62 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.The modest shortfall was attributable to weaker-than-expected sales of Microsoft\u2019s Surface tablet computers during the quarter, which were down 26 percent. The company\u2019s share price fell about 1 percent in after-hours trading.Microsoft\u2019s net income rose 28 percent to $4.80 billion. Its operating earnings per share, which excludes one-time gains, increased 16 percent to 73 cents a share, ahead of the average analyst estimate of 70 cents a share.The company\u2019s results also added to evidence that the personal computer industry is stabilizing and even growing, at least among corporate customers.Sales of Windows operating systems to PC makers rose 5 percent in the quarter. The market research firm IDC recently reported that PC shipments grew slightly during the first quarter of 2017, the first gain in five years.Microsoft\u2019s Windows sales to PC makers are advancing by more than the rate of PC shipments, because of a shift to higher-priced versions as corporate customers upgrade to Windows 10.Overall revenue at Amazon rose 23 percent to $35.71 billion from $29.13 billion in the same period a year ago. The company\u2019s results were well ahead of the $1.12-a-share average earnings estimate and $35.3 billion revenue estimate of analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters.In a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company was still heavily investing in the creation of new devices, video content and fulfillment centers to bring orders to customers more quickly.\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to look for things customers love, can grow to be large and provide strong financial returns in the long run and can last for decades,\u201d he said.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, David Streitfeld from San Francisco and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hollywood Writers\u2019 Unions Vote to Authorize Strike Against Producers", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Unions representing 12,000 Hollywood writers said on Monday that members had overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike, bringing show business closer to its first production shutdown in a decade.Leaders of the Writers Guild of America, East, and the Writers Guild of America, West, announced the results of an online strike authorization vote in an email to members. The unions said that 6,310 eligible members voted; 96 percent of the vote was in favor of a strike.\u201cWe thank you for your resolve,\u201d the union email said. \u201cWe are determined to achieve a fair contract.\u201dIn a statement, the producers\u2019 alliance said: \u201cThe companies are committed to reaching a deal at the bargaining table that keeps the industry working. The 2007 writers\u2019 strike hurt everyone. Writers lost more than $287 million in compensation that was never recovered.\u201dIf no agreement is reached, a walkout could happen as soon as May 2 and potentially idle tens of thousands of workers \u2014 not just writers but the drivers, caterers, set carpenters, dry cleaners and other service providers who make Hollywood\u2019s wheels turn. Writers picketed for 100 days in the 2007 strike, bringing TV production to a halt and causing $2.5 billion in economic losses in Los Angeles, according to government economists.A strike would first affect late-night talk shows and soap operas that use guild writers, sending the programs into repeats or forcing hosts to ad-lib. The production of scripted TV series would slow down, as producers burned through scripts. Networks would rely more heavily on news, sports and reality programming. Moviegoers would not experience immediate effects; studios have finished shooting most summer and fall movies.Striking is awkward for Hollywood unions because of optics: The workers involved are not coal miners struggling to feed their families. Some television staff writers earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. A few elite wordsmiths \u2014 Chuck Lorre, Shonda Rhimes \u2014 earn millions.But leaders of the two writers\u2019 unions, which bargain as one, say that the middle-class majority of their members are struggling as never before, even as television production booms in the video-streaming age and some blockbusters take in more than $1 billion at the worldwide box office.Networks are ordering fewer episodes per season \u2014 as few as 10 compared with 22 just a few years ago \u2014 so series writing jobs pay less than they once did. At the same time, staff writers can work for only one series at once, taking them off the market for up to a year. And broadcast network reruns do not attract many viewers anymore, limiting residual payments. On the movie side, studios have cut way back on what is known as development, or the polishing and reworking of scripts to produce a good one.\u201cThere\u2019s a wild disparity between what writers are paid and the profits that are generated from their work,\u201d Howard A. Rodman, president of the West guild, said in an interview this month. \u201cIf you look at the budgets of television shows, the part allotted for writing is generally 2 percent. That strikes me as a very small amount given the importance of writing to the enterprise.\u201dHealth care is also a major union concern. In part because it provides extremely generous benefits \u2014 by some measures, studios say, better than coverage offered to other Hollywood unions \u2014 the writers\u2019 health fund has begun to run steep deficits. Writers want studios to help make up the shortfalls, which can total tens of millions of dollars a year.The movie and television companies point to systemic industry problems as reasons they must limit improvements to the Writers Guild contract. Studios contend that they are facing an uncertain future, with streaming services threatening their enormously profitable cable operations: With the rise of Netflix, HBO Go and Amazon, consumers are downgrading cable TV packages or foregoing connections altogether.Media companies have their own optics problem. While they contend that they are unable to give writers more than small raises, most have boasted to Wall Street of climbing profits. And pay for media moguls has been rising. Earlier this month, CBS disclosed that its chief executive, Leslie Moonves, received a 2016 pay package worth $69.6 million, a 22 percent increase over 2015, when the company did not perform as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Hearts of Darkness and Light in \u2018The Lost City of Z\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byThat dream isn\u2019t only about the Amazon in \u201cThe Lost City of Z\u201d but also about the movies and their ability to transport us to astonishing new worlds. For us, the Age of Discovery is long gone and, for the most part, so are old-fashioned historical epics, other than the occasional Chinese extravaganza or one of those international waxworks with clashing accents. Hollywood used to churn these out regularly, but they\u2019ve faded, casualties of shifting industry logic, audience taste, cultural norms and other pressures. The romance of adventure has largely shifted from history to fantasy fiction, an easier, less contested playground for conquering white heroes.The movie opens shortly before Fawcett is approached by the Royal Geographical Society to map uncharted territory in Bolivia. A career soldier and son of a disgraced aristocrat, Fawcett is anxious to change his fortunes and increase his social standing. Leaving behind, rather too easily, his loving wife, Nina (Sienna Miller, wonderful), and their young son (later played by Tom Holland), he sets off and is soon struggling through the Amazon with a small crew that includes an aide-de-camp, Henry Costin (an excellent Robert Pattinson, shaggy and almost unrecognizable). Deep in a jungle, where each wonder is matched by terror, Fawcett is ravaged \u2014 and then transformed \u2014 by his discoveries of both a new world and another self.In time, native peoples emerge from those trees, by turns watchful, threatening and welcoming. Much as he does throughout his Amazonian travels, Fawcett is enlivened by his encounters with the Indians. He\u2019s a natural, somewhat surprisingly peaceful ambassador given his background and historical moment (even if his restraint also nicely suits Mr. Hunnam\u2019s slow-burning charisma). When his expedition comes under siege at one point, he orders his men not to fire and instead waves a kerchief while calling out \u201cAmigo!\u201d It\u2019s a stratagem, but Fawcett\u2019s curiosity is boundless and he sees accomplishment and complexity in this world, which sharply goes against bigoted orthodoxies back home.That passion sends Fawcett back to the Amazon several more times over the years, eventually becoming a kind of steadily devouring fever. He\u2019s hailed as a hero after he returns from his first trip, but by the time he\u2019s home he has a new child, whose birth he missed. This sets the template for his life, as Fawcett increasingly gives himself over to the Amazon and neglects his family, a familiar divide that Mr. Gray turns into the story\u2019s axis point. In most movies of this type, the great man kisses the little woman goodbye and sets off. Here, partly because Fawcett repeatedly returns home, Nina emerges as a substantial narrative force and not only a reminder of what he\u2019s willing to sacrifice.Fawcett finds ecstasy in and out of the Amazon, as does Mr. Gray, who fills the screen with intimate reveries and overwhelming spectacle, including a harrowing interlude during World War I. Until now, Mr. Gray has tended to work on a somewhat modest scale, often with art films that play with genre. Here, he effortlessly expands his reach as he moves across time and continents and in the process turns the past into a singular life. There\u2019s much to love in this film, but what lingers are those lapidary details that often go missing in stories about great men, as if they had built the world alone and no child had ever raced down a road waving goodbye as a father disappeared into history.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos Says He Is Selling $1 Billion a Year in Amazon Stock to Finance Race to Space", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byCOLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 Standing against the backdrop of his New Shepard rocket booster and a full-scale mock capsule for carrying humans into space, Jeff Bezos revealed on Wednesday that he was selling about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company.Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, showed off the reusable rocket booster and the mock-up of the capsule that will take people up for panoramic views back down at earth, during a symposium here.Mr. Bezos, who hopes to build Blue Origin into a commercial and tourist venture, also disclosed that it would cost about $2.5 billion to develop an even bigger rocket, New Glenn, capable of lifting satellites and, eventually, people into orbit.Like his fellow technology titan Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, Mr. Bezos has identified reusable rocket parts as a key to lowering the price of admission to the field, which he said on Wednesday would lead to a \u201cgolden age of space exploration.\u201d\u201cIf we can make access to space low-cost, then entrepreneurs will be unleashed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see creativity, you will see dynamism, you will see the same thing in space that I\u2019ve witnessed on the internet in the last 20 years.\u201dMr. Bezos has repeatedly expressed caution about setting timetables for the start of Blue Origin\u2019s commercial or passenger trips, and he did not diverge from that on Wednesday. He would not say when New Shepard would undergo its next round of test flights, or set a specific date as a goal, merely mentioning next year for possible tourist trips.\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to race to a deadline when you\u2019re talking about a flying vehicle, especially one that you\u2019re going to put people on,\u201d he said. \u201cI still think we can do commercial paying passengers in 2018.\u201dAsked how much passengers would pay, Mr. Bezos said he did not know yet, but he predicted ticket prices would decline as spaceflight became more common. (Hundreds of people have already put down deposits to reserve places on similar commercial trips on Virgin Galactic that could cost $250,000 a ticket, although that company\u2019s spaceplane has yet to take anyone up.)New Shepard is a modest start for Mr. Bezos\u2019s ambitions to tap into the nascent space tourism market. It is a single-stage booster with a capsule on top that is designed to carry six passengers at a time on trips of about 10 to 11 minutes.There will not be a Blue Origin crew on the spacecraft. Passengers wearing sleek jumpsuits will be able to peer out what the company says will be the largest windows in space, taking up about one-third of the surface area of the dome.About 12 feet in diameter, the passenger capsule holds six black seats that resemble recliners, with panels offering details about altitude and other features of a trip.The engine that powers the booster produces up to about 110,000 pounds of thrust.On ascent, passengers will experience forces of about 3 Gs, about three times the normal force of gravity that humans experience on earth. When the booster reaches a certain altitude, the capsule will detach and coast above the Karman line, which is 62 miles above sea level, officially entering into space.There, the passengers will experience about four to five minutes of weightlessness. They can unbuckle their harnesses and do somersaults, if desired, in the padded-dome interior.On descent, they will encounter forces of 5 Gs.The capsule will parachute back to the plains of West Texas, slowing to a coasting speed of about 20 miles per hour, while the booster drops and fires its engine to slow down and make a vertical landing. The capsule slows to 3 m.p.h. before touching down. Both pieces are reusable to make the trips more economical.\u201cReusability is the key to getting millions of people living and working in space,\u201d Mr. Bezos said.New Shepard has a simpler flight path: just up and down, almost like a big roller coaster that slows to a stop at the top of its arc.The abort system worked. To the pleasant surprise of the engineers, the booster survived the force of separation, righted itself and descended to a landing.

{"Headline": "Canada Tries to Turn Its A.I. Ideas Into Dollars", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byTORONTO \u2014 Long before Google started working on cars that drive themselves and Amazon was creating home appliances that talk, a handful of researchers in Canada \u2014 backed by the Canadian government and universities \u2014 were laying the groundwork for today\u2019s boom in artificial intelligence.But the center of the commercial gold rush has been a long way away, in Silicon Valley. In recent years, many of Canada\u2019s young A.I. scientists, lured by lucrative paydays from Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies, have departed. Canada is producing a growing number of A.I start-ups, but they often head to California, where venture capital, business skills and optimism are abundant.Now bringing A.I. home is a priority for the Canadian government, companies, universities and technologists. The goal, they say, is to build a business environment around the country\u2019s expertise and to keep the experts its universities create in the country.There are encouraging signs, including new government funding, big company investments, programs to nurture start-ups, and the changing habits of homegrown entrepreneurs and American venture capitalists.Mr. Hinton, who was hired by Google in 2013 but remains a professor at the University of Toronto, will serve as its chief scientific adviser. The new institute will be in the Mars Discovery District, a cluster of buildings in downtown Toronto, run by a public-private partnership, that is home to many tech start-ups including A.I. companies..Major technology companies, like Google, Microsoft and IBM, are adding to their A.I. research teams in Canada. So are companies in other industries.Last year, General Motors said it was going to locate one of its research and engineering hubs for self-driving cars in the Toronto suburb of Markham. And Thomson Reuters announced it would open a center for \u201ccognitive computing\u201d in Toronto for research into new ways professionals will use information and technologies to assist decision making.Building businesses that use A.I. is an economic imperative for Canada. The Canadian tech industry has stalled in recent years. Nortel, Canada\u2019s big telecommunications equipment maker, declared bankruptcy in 2009, and was wound down over the next several years. And BlackBerry, once a leader, has faded in the smartphone market.The experience of two start-ups applying A.I. technology to drug discovery illustrate the challenges \u2014 and the opportunities \u2014 facing Canadian start-ups.When Mr. Heifets sought funding, he recalled, one potential Canadian investor said people had tried the same thing 20 years ago. \u201cWhat could possibly be new?\u201d Mr. Heifets said the investor had asked, and turned him down.Later, Mr. Heifets went to the Bay Area and met with Timothy Draper, founder of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Mr. Draper observed that he had invested in a couple of companies trying a similar approach 20 years ago. That didn\u2019t deter him from trying again.\u201cThat\u2019s a cultural issue, a different appetite for risk and willingness to accept failure,\u201d Mr. Heifets said.Atomwise moved to San Francisco to be close to its investors and the region\u2019s enormous talent pool.Brendan Frey, the chief executive, studied under Mr. Hinton at the University of Toronto, and he has spent years on research that combines deep-learning A.I. and cell biology. When he hires software engineers, he asks them to make multiyear commitments.\u201cThere are a lot of distractions in the Bay Area,\u201d said Mr. Frey, who is also a professor at the University of Toronto and a co-founder of the new Vector institute. \u201cThe hype is a little too hot down there. Besides, we have some of the best talent in the world here.\u201dIn 2015, the program tilted toward A.I. start-ups, with 25 companies admitted. Last year, 50 A.I. start-ups were admitted, and this year will likely have 75, Mr. Agrawal said.The program lasts nine months, with fall and spring terms, much like a school year. The participants gather every eight weeks in Toronto for two days to make presentations, listen to advice and set goals for the next eight weeks.At every gathering, at least one and sometimes several companies are voted out. The voters are a growing group of tech entrepreneurs and investors whom Mr. Agrawal has recruited.One of the X factors in Canada\u2019s drive to develop an A.I. industry is the Trump administration. Canadian A.I. scientists say they have received a stream of inquiries from researchers in the United States, concerned about the new administration\u2019s stance on immigration and other policies.Should there be a northward migration it wouldn\u2019t the first time. Mr. Hinton settled in Canada in 1987 in part because of America\u2019s clandestine support for the Contra guerrillas who sought to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.Mr. Hinton, who is from Britain, was at Carnegie Mellon University at the time, and he realized that continuing his research in America would have meant accepting funding from the Reagan administration. \u201cI preferred Canada,\u201d Mr. Hinton recalled.Mr. Sutton left the United States to become a professor at the University of Alberta in 2003, after American troops landed in Baghdad. \u201cGeorge Bush was invading Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good time to leave.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Hulu and \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 Revived 2 Careers", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byBut none of this would have been possible without Danny and Fran.Until recently, the production company run by Daniel Wilson, 87, and his business partner, Fran Sears, 70, had more or less been dormant. Work had dried up, and Hollywood had stopped getting in touch many years ago.Whenever the phone rang, they assumed that people were \u201ctrying to find out if we were, in fact, still alive,\u201d Ms. Sears said in a recent interview, laughing.But Mr. Wilson had something special stowed away: He controlled a big chunk of the TV and movie rights to the 1985 Margaret Atwood novel, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which he had made into an otherwise forgettable 1990 feature. If Hulu wanted to bring the story to television, it would have to deal with Daniel Wilson Productions.So through a twist of fate, prescient deal-making and an intensely competitive television landscape \u2014 where studios seem to be willing to turn over any stone to find a hit \u2014 Danny and Fran are back in business.In short order, they had to, among other things, revive a production company that had gone dark and study up on a vastly changed television landscape, in which streaming services were becoming increasingly important. They also had to acquaint themselves with tasks foreign to them \u2014 like creating an online imprint.\u201cWe just looked at each other and said, \u2018Oh, God, we better do this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sears said, about creating a website. \u201cWe\u2019ve been terrible about a Wikipedia page or IMDB. It\u2019s not part of our sensibility.\u201dOn a recent Tuesday in Manhattan, the duo (they are, alas, not a couple) were discussing their unlikely comeback at Mr. Wilson\u2019s Upper East Side apartment. Over the course of an afternoon, Ms. Sears excused herself each time the phone rang. \u201cDaniel Wilson Productions,\u201d she cooed as she answered.A bookshelf in the living room was filled with awards Mr. Wilson had won in the 1970s and \u201980s, including several Emmys. It was difficult to identify what some of the Emmys were for; the plaques were too faded.Though Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears were not in charge of making \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d they found themselves, somewhat surprisingly, in the role of executive producers. They were given a front-row seat to script development, casting and the production process, and offered notes to the writers and executives overseeing the show.They marveled at just how much the business had changed. Television executives nowadays? \u201cMuch less combative,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. And they have been transformed from cigar-chomping titans to, as Ms. Sears put it, \u201cyoung hipster types.\u201dThen there were the dailies, rough cuts from each day of filming. They used to be an exhaustive process that took hours to produce, with filmmakers packing a room to watch poor-quality film reels of scenes shot the day before. Now, Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears could watch high-quality footage from \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d from the comforts of their own homes, at 8 a.m. each day.\u201cI\u2019d get up in the morning, I\u2019d be wandering around, crashing into the wall in my jimjams with a cup of coffee, and I\u2019d watch the dailies and call up Danny and say, \u2018Did you watch that?\u2019\u201d Ms. Sears recalled.Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears met in the 1960s when they were working on a children\u2019s show for ABC. Soon, Daniel Wilson Productions was up and running, and they were making after-school specials with titles like \u201cThe Terrible Secret\u201d and \u201cMe and Dad\u2019s New Wife.\u201dIt was in the late 1980s when, at the suggestion of his wife, Mr. Wilson read \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d the dystopian novel that presents a grim future for women in the United States. Impressed, Mr. Wilson met with Ms. Atwood, secured the film rights to the book and shared them with the independent movie company Cinecom, which helped finance the film.The movie, which starred Robert Duvall and Natasha Richardson and was written by Harold Pinter (Ms. Atwood was not interested in screenwriting), was released in 1990 and was a dud at the box office. (\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as good as perhaps it should have been,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.)Soon, their careers began to wind down. Mr. Wilson learned that his wife had Alzheimer\u2019s, and he put aside work to tend to her. Ms. Sears said she would return to the business only if she actually had passion for a project.\u201cI guess I just didn\u2019t really think that was going to happen,\u201d she said.Then everything changed.\u201cWe realized, \u2018Wait a minute, no, no, no, it\u2019s not all ours,\u201d said Steve Stark, the studio\u2019s president for television development and production. \u201c\u2018We have to call a Danny Wilson. Where\u2019s he at?\u2019 We didn\u2019t know. We couldn\u2019t find him.\u201dIt took some time to track him down, and, initially, Mr. Wilson was unmoved. Cinecom had gone bankrupt, and Mr. Wilson was convinced he owned all the rights to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d In fact, MGM had secured what was once Cinecom\u2019s 50 percent.Even in the sometimes confounding world of Hollywood copyrights, this odyssey was \u201cexceptional,\u201d Mr. Stark said. It took a lengthy negotiation to get Mr. Wilson on board.\u201cWe decided to make him an executive producer, we gave him a nice fee, and we figured it all out,\u201d Mr. Stark said. Mr. Wilson did not disclose financial details, but the deal, if the show reaches a third season (which appears possible, considering the reviews), is expected to be worth $1 million.The show was originally written for Showtime by Ilene Chaiken, a veteran of \u201cThe L Word.\u201d Mr. Wilson did not like her script, which he said was far too \u201cgraphic sexually.\u201d\u201cThey wanted bare-breasted women running around,\u201d he said, sounding exasperated.But Ms. Chaiken was soon tied up with obligations to the new Fox hit \u201cEmpire,\u201d and the story was back on the market. Suddenly, FX and Hulu were neck and neck in pursuit of the series.But Hulu?\u201cFor me, Hulu is where you can watch old episodes of \u2018The Andy Griffith Show,\u2019 if you\u2019re so inclined,\u201d Ms. Sears said.Mr. Wilson was not entirely sure to trust the streaming service until Mr. Stark convinced him it was just fine.\u201cI heard about it from Steve, and I said, \u2018Really?\u2019\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Danny, they\u2019re the new kid on the block; they\u2019re going to back this series to the hilt.\u2019\u201cI said, \u2018Terrific!\u2019\u201dBruce Miller, the new showrunner for \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d wrote scripts that they adored. Elisabeth Moss, a veteran of \u201cMad Men,\u201d seemed ideal to play the main character, Offred. For Hulu, which has failed to match the buzzy original series of rivals like Amazon and Netflix, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d may have finally delivered a drama that can drive up subscriptions.It also didn\u2019t hurt that the Trump administration has made the show\u2019s bleak themes feel more relevant to certain viewers.\u201cIts timing is a hell of a lot better than when the feature was released,\u201d Ms. Sears said. \u201cMargaret\u2019s book was extraordinary, but it was about another time. We didn\u2019t see it coming fast and furious at us the way it is now.\u201dMr. Wilson and Ms. Sears are hopeful that \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is just the beginning of their comeback.And last Friday night, they were able to take their victory lap in earnest.As Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears circled a room in the Beekman Hotel for the show\u2019s premiere party, a remix of Prince\u2019s \u201cRaspberry Beret\u201d blasted at full volume. And what did these two reborn producers think of their return to show business, all these years later?They answered in unison: \u201cLoud!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Witches, Beasts, Sorcerers: The Gothic Horror of Michael Reeves", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byOn DVDCredited with directing three d\u00e9class\u00e9 horror movies, dead from an overdose of barbiturates at 25, the British filmmaker Michael Reeves (1943-1969) is a quintessential cult figure.Reeves, like Steven Spielberg and the avant-gardist brothers George and Mike Kuchar, made eight-millimeter films in his movie-obsessed youth and, on a trip to America, paid an unannounced visit to his Hollywood idol, the genre director Don Siegel \u2014 an act of chutzpah that actually resulted in a job. After working in commercials and as an assistant director, Reeves made and even partly financed his first feature, \u201cRevenge of the Blood Beast\u201d (1966), newly out on Blu-ray from Raro Video.This amalgam of the awful and the audacious is a demented gross-out comedy that often evokes the early work of John Waters. It clearly amused Reeves to depict modern Transylvania as a shabby police state ruled by inept policemen. Much of the action takes place in the run-down Hotel Moskva; one gruesome attack winks at Communist iconography when the weapon \u2014 a sickle \u2014 is tossed away to land neatly on a hammer. There is also some effective filmmaking. A flashback in which an accused witch is put to death by hysterical townspeople previews similar lynch-mob sequences in Reeves\u2019s last and strongest film, \u201cWitchfinder General\u201d (1968).As self-reflexive as it is, \u201cThe Sorcerers\u201d (available on DVD from Warner Archive) has been compared to Michael Powell\u2019s \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d (1960). Better written than directed, \u201cThe Sorcerers\u201d is at once an evocation of psychedelic fascism and a Freudian comedy with a hapless protagonist subject to subliminal prompts from two parental figures.\u201cWitchfinder General\u201d has been released on disc several times, most recently on Blu-ray as one of six films included in Scream\u2019s \u201cVincent Price Collection.\u201d Perhaps some altruistic distributor will thrill cultists with a Reeves collection, even including \u201cCastle of the Living Dead,\u201d a 1964 French-Italian vehicle for Christopher Lee that some fans believe was mainly shot, uncredited, by Reeves, the second-unit director.The suitably outlandish plot, loosely adapted from a novel by Bram Stoker, concerns an outbreak of pagan snake-worship in present-day Derbyshire. The young Hugh Grant is surprisingly intense as a drawling young lord, but the movie is stolen by a neighboring aristocrat, played by Amanda Donohoe (known then mainly as an associate of the New Wave singer Adam Ant). Fabulously chic and seductively sinister, Ms. Donohoe is actually a vampire priestess, prone to coldblooded hissy fits, sprouting fangs at will and spraying a venom that transports victims into a mad delirium of screaming nuns, rampaging serpents and bloody crucifixions.One of Mr. Russell\u2019s most enjoyable films, \u201cWhite Worm\u201d seems a uniquely British amalgam of high camp, lurid psychedelia and rowdy Celtic folk-punk. As regional as \u201cWitchfinder General,\u201d it feasts on the Midlands countryside. Setting the movie in England rather than Transylvania, Mr. Russell told Film Comment magazine, \u201cmade it potentially more alarming \u2014 and, of course, absurdly comical.\u201dNEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Movers: Trump Bump, Time Inc. and Exxon", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byWe\u2019re following major developments in the markets throughout the day. Check below for the latest updates.In his first 100 days as president, Donald J. Trump may have found much of his agenda stymied, from a health care overhaul to a hotly contested immigration order.Many American consumers may not have heard of Synchrony Financial, but there is a good chance they have one of the company\u2019s credit cards.Synchrony issues credit cards in partnership with giant retailers like Walmart and JCPenny, which consumer use to purchase goods typically in return for discounts or other rewards.And on Friday, Synchrony\u2019s share price was getting hammered \u2014 down more than 14 percent in midmorning training.Synchrony, which was spun out of GE Capital in 2014, reported a smaller profit \u2014 61 cents a share \u2014 compared with the 74 cents that many Wall Street analysts had expected.The miss was driven partly by the company\u2019s need to reserve more money to deal with potential defaults from consumers.Investors took that as a worrisome sign that the credit quality of Synchrony\u2019s cards \u2014 which total about $70 billion \u2014 is declining faster than predicted.General Motors said on Friday that strong sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles drove a 34 percent increase in first-quarter earnings and positioned the company for a solid year ahead.The company\u2019s core North American market set a record for pretax profit, $3.4 billion, as buyers continued to flock to G.M.\u2019s truck and S.U.V. lineup.Exxon Mobil posted strong first-quarter earnings on Friday, as expected, with oil prices up by more than 50 percent from this time last year.With cash flow up and capital and exploration spending down, net income jumped to $4.01 billion from $1.81 billion in the year-ago quarter. Exxon Mobil shares, which have slumped so far this year, climbed 1 percent in morning trading.\u2022 The economy barely grew, expanding at an annual rate of only 0.7 percent.\u2022 The growth was a sharp decline from the 2.1 percent annual rate recorded in the final quarter of last year. It was the weakest quarterly showing in three years.\u2022 Consumption, the component reflecting individual spending, rose by only 0.3 percent, well below the 3.5 percent rate in the previous quarter.The economy\u2019s weakness reflected new caution among consumers. Other sectors like housing and business investment turned in a stronger showing, but not enough to offset factors like weaker retail sales.James E. Staley, the Barclays chief executive, offered another apology to investors on Friday about a \u201cmistake\u201d that led to an inquiry by British regulators into his treatment of a whistle-blower.Directors at Barclays have said they will formally reprimand Mr. Staley and make a \u201cvery significant compensation adjustment\u201d to his bonus after the inquiry.\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Mr. Staley said on a conference call with journalists on Friday. \u201cI was trying to protect a vulnerable colleague, but I should have left the organization to handle it. I\u2019ve accepted the judgment of the board. We are cooperating fully with the regulatory investigation.\u201dOn Thursday, Institutional Shareholder Services, a prominent proxy adviser, said that, because of concerns over the inquiry, investors should refrain from voting or abstain when Mr. Staley comes up for re-election to the bank\u2019s board at the annual meeting next month.The generally positive momentum for lenders in Europe in the first quarter continued on Friday as the Swiss bank UBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland reported their results.The quarterly profit was the lender\u2019s first since the third quarter of 2015. The bank has reported annual losses for the past nine years, but says it expects to be profitable in 2018.A consortium of investors led by the private equity firms Hillhouse Capital and CDH Investments have offered to buy China\u2019s Belle International in a transaction that would value the shoe retailer at $6.8 billion.That represents a premium of nearly 20 percent to the company\u2019s share price before trading was halted at the company\u2019s request on April 18.Belle has suffered as China\u2019s vast and fast-growing consumer culture changes the way it shops. Increasingly, Chinese people shop online, leading to booming business for American-traded online Chinese e-commerce firms like Alibaba Group and JD.com. But like in the United States, that shift has resulted in slower traffic at brick-and-mortar stores.Advertisement"}

Outside, a dozen young staff members tapped diligently in front of similarly oversize screens.\u201cEvery photograph I started to take went from photography to fine-art photography to photographs that are meant to look great inside your home,\u201d Mr. Malin said. \u201cIt was like social media before social media.\u201dHe is intimately acquainted with such a concept: His mother, Amy Muzzy Malin, edited the interior design sections of Glamour and Mademoiselle magazines before the family moved from New York to Dallas (his father is a real estate developer). In Dallas, Ms. Malin oversaw photo shoots and scouted locations for other magazines, and often brought Gray along.\u201cI\u2019d do my homework in the corner while they were shooting interiors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I was very aware of, at a young age, how a room looked.\u201dAt 16, he took a high school photography class, spending nights and weekends in the darkroom and studying the clean lines of the Hungarian photographer Andre Kertesz. At Emerson College, Mr. Malin studied photography and marketing, to appease his parents.\u201cI realized I didn\u2019t want to do commercial work or portraiture,\u201d Mr. Malin said. \u201cI really wanted to do fine art, which sounds so 21-year-old-y.\u201d He enrolled in continuing-education classes and took odd jobs like assisting on a wedding. \u201cI shot some family in Manhattan Beach\u2019s Christmas card,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all wore white shirts and jeans.\u201dSix months later, in September 2010, he returned to Marfa to do a more organized shoot around the Prada store. His lanky cousin served as a model, his father\u2019s buddy brought a mule, and a friend from Paramount brokered a deal for secondhand Prada shopping bags after Mr. Malin\u2019s eBay searches came up empty. \u201cIt\u2019s hysterical how hard it is to get shopping bags,\u201d he said.\u201cI hadn\u2019t really seen anything like it,\u201d said Susan Feldman, a founder of One Kings Lane.The site would put up limited quantities of Mr. Malin\u2019s prints and they would routinely sell out; he would invite friends over to watch movies while they slapped labels on boxes. \u201cIt was just what I was hoping \u2014 I was seeding myself into these somewhat affluent homes all over the country,\u201d Mr. Malin said.He eventually embarked on more ambitious projects: shooting beach scenes from helicopters over Miami and Kauai, Hawaii, and joining a National Geographic expedition to Antarctica, where he juxtaposed a beach ball with hulking glaciers.\u201cNow,\u201d Mr. Malin said, \u201cthey really want to get paid.\u201dMr. Malin himself is a low-key presence, spending summers on Lake Michigan with his husband, Jeff Richardson, a former business analyst for Mattel and Disney who became the chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Gray Malin last year and oversees pesky things like shipping and logistics.Mr. Malin wears polo shirts and sweaters around his neck and chooses not to dye gray streaks in his close-cropped hair. At a Vanity Fair party before the Oscars, while sequined starlets swirled around, he gushed that the most exciting week of his life was when Jenna Bush filmed a \u201cToday\u201d show segment on him and Maria Shriver came over to look at prints. \u201cIn one week, there was a Kennedy and a Bush in my house,\u201d he said.As for the current administration, \u201cthe day after the election, my dad called me and said, \u2018Are you kind of excited about this, for your brand?\u2019\u201d Mr. Malin said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Are you kidding? I\u2019m devastated!\u2019\u201d\u201c\u2018But think about it, you bring this escape to everyone,\u201d he remembers his father telling him. \u201c\u2018And now more than ever, people are going to need the escape.\u2019\u201dIndeed, Mr. Malin\u2019s professional Instagram profile says that he is \u201con a mission to make every day a getaway.\u201d In the aquamarine-hue feed of photos that follows, there is no indication of political tensions or nuisances like Mondays and hailstorms. If art reflects the times, this art reflects a collective desire to decamp to some place with beautiful natural light and no visible charging cables. While Mr. Malin claims he knows \u201clike, no artists,\u201d some have taken note.\u201cI get jealous sometimes,\u201d Mr. Ugalde said. \u201cI get jealous in a very positive way. He\u2019s very young, he\u2019s not trying to influence the collector or the observer with big philosophical, conceptual messages. Sometimes, it\u2019s just to make people happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Kind of Pet Should Donald Trump Get?", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byOpinionOf all the stains besmirching the Trump presidency \u2014 the ethical lacunae, the spasmodic \u201cpolicy\u201d fits, the Golf Digest aesthetic \u2014 none looms so large as the absence of a White House pet. Breathes there a man with a soul so dead that he doesn\u2019t want a loyal dog or faithful feline trotting beside him when he mounts that lonely staircase to the venerable Master Bedroom?Apparently, yes.It seems emblematic of President Trump\u2019s blaring tone-deafness for the office that he doesn\u2019t even feign interest in recruiting a furry, fowlish or finny friend. Pets reap vast, humanizing rewards for presidents, as almost every one of his predecessors has discovered.The White House has at various times hosted snakes, a badger, a lion, a hyena, zebra, bears and even elephants, gifted to James Buchanan from the king of Siam, present-day Thailand. The animal lover and killer Theodore Roosevelt doubled as zookeeper, sheltering such exotic charges as the guinea pig Admiral Dewey and Jonathan Edwards, a small bear.More mundane pets such as Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s Scottish terrier, Fala, and Senator Richard M. Nixon\u2019s cocker spaniel, Checkers, have clawed their way into American history. It is said that Lyndon B. Johnson received more negative mail when he hoisted his beagle, Him, by the ears in 1964 than he did waging the Vietnam War. Many animal lovers never forgave Johnson, who received some tepid support from hunters, who sometimes pulled their dogs\u2019 ears to make sure they were in full throat for the chase.Mr. Trump\u2019s reluctance to take a pet under his wing seems silly when you consider how little work it must involve. Let\u2019s get real; it\u2019s not as if he would have to follow them around with a pooper scooper, or empty that foul-smelling litter box. That is why God invented White House ushers, and there are plenty of them.By all appearances, Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t like animals. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to notice his lack of commitment to companion animals and nature in general,\u201d comments Alan M. Beck, a professor of animal ecology at Purdue University and director of the Center for the Human-Animal Bond. \u201cHis sons are trophy hunters.\u201dProfessor Beck says that politicians often adopt animals \u201cbecause people with animals are given more positive attribution. If you have an animal, you are somehow a better person. There are lots of studies on this. But I don\u2019t think the president even seems to care about that.\u201dProfessor Beck supported Hillary Clinton in the last election and isn\u2019t sheepish about baring his fangs. \u201cHis not liking dogs doesn\u2019t surprise me, but it\u2019s the least of my concerns. Frankly it doesn\u2019t tell us anything that we didn\u2019t already know.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to see how a pet could serve as a badly needed emollient for the notoriously blunt President Trump. In a hypothetical meeting with the North Korean strongman Kim Jong-un, Mr. Trump could let his hypothetical dog Fido \u2014 the same name as Abraham Lincoln\u2019s mixed-breed pet \u2014 do the talking. \u201cFido has some serious concerns about your medium-range weaponry,\u201d I hear Mr. Trump saying.What is that great line? Once you\u2019ve learned to fake sincerity, the rest is easy. Once Donald Trump learns to pretend to love animals, he can move on to pretending to love the human race.Alex Beam is a writer who lives outside Boston with his wife and a West Highland terrier named Micah.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why You Should Wait Before Buying Samsung\u2019s New Galaxy S8", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byTech FixWhen a splashy new smartphone hits the market, consumers often weigh whether to place an order right away or to wait and see how others react to the device.Samsung declined to provide an early review unit of the Galaxy S8 to The New York Times, but several consumer electronics experts who tried the device ahead of its release this Friday were cautiously optimistic about the product. Even so, they said the phone had some radical design changes that might make people uncomfortable, a few key features were unfinished and Samsung\u2019s recent safety record remained a concern.For those who may not recall, Samsung killed the Galaxy Note 7 last year after some of the phones overheated and several of them caught fire. The South Korean company issued two recalls for the big-screen smartphone and blamed battery manufacturing problems and design flaws for the issues.\u201cWhat happened to the Galaxy Note raised questions about Samsung phones in general,\u201d said Mark Spoonauer, the editor in chief of the product reviews site Tom\u2019s Guide, who had early access to the Galaxy S8. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any harm in waiting to make sure that everything is safe with this phone.\u201dBroadly speaking, a wait-and-see approach is the most practical route that consumers can take with any brand-new product. Waiting a few months or even years gives tech companies time to improve existing features and to fix bugs. The only reason to rush to buy a gadget is if you are extremely enthusiastic about it and think it might be sold out for a while.Here are some of the reasons consumer electronics experts said you should wait for the Galaxy S8.When introducing the Galaxy S8 last month, Samsung highlighted its larger 5.8-inch screen, up from 5.1 inches on the previous model. To make more room for the screen without adding bulk to the body, the company reduced the size of the bezel \u2014 or the forehead and the chin \u2014 on the face of the device. Samsung also made the home button into a virtual button and shoved it under the display. And the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone is now on the back of the device a few millimeters to the right of the camera lens.Several product reviewers took issue with the location of the fingerprint sensor, saying it made it easy to bump into the camera lens when trying to unlock the phone.\u201cThey should just give you a cloth with the phone to wipe it,\u201d said Mike Gikas, a phone reviewer for Consumer Reports who had tried the Galaxy S8. He added that the placement of the fingerprint sensor might make it difficult for left-handed people to unlock the phone.Jessica Dolcourt, a product reviewer for CNET who used the Galaxy S8 at a media event last month, agreed that it felt awkward to use the fingerprint reader because of its location on the back. Mr. Spoonauer of Tom\u2019s Guide also said the placement of the fingerprint sensor was not ideal, though not a deal breaker.The Galaxy S8 includes some other unlocking methods, like facial recognition. Raise the phone to your face as if you were taking a selfie to unlock the Galaxy S8.Samsung highlighted Bixby, its voice-controlled virtual assistant that will rival Apple\u2019s Siri, Google\u2019s Assistant and Amazon\u2019s Alexa, when it initially unveiled the S8. What makes Samsung\u2019s assistant unique is that you will be able to ask it to accomplish tasks like sending your most recently taken photo to your spouse, or streaming a specific video to a Samsung television, which other assistants don\u2019t do.Yet last week, Samsung said that while some portions of Bixby would be available on Day 1, Bixby\u2019s voice features would not be released in the United States until later this spring. To Mr. Spoonauer, this incompleteness was a problem.\u201cI think the other more disappointing thing is the fact that one of the most exciting features is not going to be fully baked at launch,\u201d he said. \u201cFor that reason people might want to wait and see.\u201dMs. Dolcourt was less concerned about Bixby because the Galaxy S8 will also include access to Google\u2019s virtual assistant. She said consumers might take greater issue with the lack of a dual-lens camera similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus or the new LG G6 smartphone. With a dual-lens camera, the two cameras work together to show the photo\u2019s main subject clearly while gently blurring the background, among other effects.While the Galaxy S8 includes some neat filters and effects for taking photos, it has only a single-lens camera, Ms. Dolcourt noted.\u201cIf somebody has their heart set on two cameras, this device doesn\u2019t have it,\u201d she said.All the reviewers agreed that it was highly unlikely for the Galaxy S8 to face similar problems, largely because the device is crucial to Samsung\u2019s profit. Ms. Dolcourt of CNET said she would personally wait three months to see if the phones were safe to buy.\u201cThe proof is in the pudding if the phones survive without incident for three months,\u201d she said.Kyle Wiens, the owner of iFixit, a company that sells hardware components, noted that among the roughly two million Note 7 devices that were recalled, only a few dozen were defective. In other words, consumers will need a large sample of devices to be in the wild before concluding that Samsung\u2019s new safety tests worked.\u201cSomebody\u2019s got to be the guinea pig,\u201d he said, before asking, \u201cDo you want to be the guinea pig?\u201dA headline and a picture caption with the Tech Fix column on Thursday, about Samsung\u2019s new smartphone, misstated the name of the device in some copies. It is the S8, not the G8.Advertisement"}

And it was horrible, and we were absolutely devastated, and at the same time feeling madly lucky to have come into contact with this incredible presence. God, she knew how to deliver a line.You and Rob met on Twitter, and then mined your real-life experiences for the show \u2014 agreeing not to make anything up. Is that still true?It\u2019s really not, if I\u2019m honest. It was a good rule to have because if we know that what we\u2019re talking about is at least the truth in our world, then no one can call us out on it, you know? Yes, there\u2019s definitely still bits and bobs in there that we\u2019ve taken from our own lives. But you can\u2019t stop those characters from becoming their own people.Now you\u2019ve got Sarah Jessica Parker delivering your lines in HBO\u2019s \u201cDivorce,\u201d which you created.It\u2019s a pretty joyous thing watching someone like her saying your words. That\u2019s a good buzz, sitting by the monitors watching Thomas Haden Church and Sarah Jessica Parker sparring. So that never stops being strange and wonderful.Couples watch that sparring in squirmy silence.I\u2019ve had that comment a lot, and I love the idea of couples watching my shows together. But I always felt that would be uncomfortable because things are said \u2014 and if people haven\u2019t said them, they\u2019ve thought them.Does it take different chops to write about the beginning of a relationship versus the end of one? Oh gosh, you have to use your imagination more about the beginning of one. It\u2019s a very fun, sweet thing to write about two people falling in love, but I would say it comes more naturally to me to write about the dark side of it. Amy Gravitt, the head of comedy at HBO, said anyone who\u2019s been long-term married could write about how it feels to want a divorce. And it\u2019s a nice, vent-y thing. You can get things down on paper that you then don\u2019t have to say out loud to the person you love.Rob says \u201cCatastrophe\u201d was written against the idea that long-term relationships are boring. I do agree with him. Whether you\u2019re at a really high point or a sort of desperate low point, they\u2019re always going to be interesting. And really, if they\u2019re boring then shame on you.The things that roll off your characters\u2019 tongues are deliriously smutty. Which one of you is innately filthier? Well, there\u2019s definitely a lot of filth in there from me. But there\u2019s something about the fully formed filth that comes straight out of Rob that I need most. I\u2019ve never seen the like of it. I have to work really hard to make sentences funny or find the \u201cthing\u201d in them. But he has this ability to open his mouth and just perfect dialogue comes out of it and 80 percent of it is vile [laughs] \u2014 and it goes straight in there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Market Surge Has Even Fans Looking for Feet of Clay", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byIn the past four weeks, exuberant investors have driven up the share price of Tesla, putting the upstart in the league of car companies that have been in the business for a century.But there are others who think Tesla, for all its potential, has become an overpriced investment \u2014 and something of a risky play in the near or medium term, given the challenges of turning battery-powered cars into mass-market products.Among the skeptics are some of Tesla\u2019s biggest fans.Take Dennis Pascual, a tech industry consultant in Long Beach, Calif., and owner of two Teslas \u2014 a Model S sedan and a two-seat Roadster, the first car Tesla put on the road. He is such a fan, in fact, that he has put down deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts once Tesla starts making the car later this year.He also owns some Tesla stock, but is not about to buy more.\u201cIt\u2019s a little pricey for me to jump back in,\u201d he said, speaking by phone from his Model S. \u201cRight now, I think we\u2019re in a hold.\u201dMoreover, he worries about Tesla\u2019s ability to carry out the bold expansion plans it has for this year and next. Tesla\u2019s high-profile chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the company expects to begin production this summer on its first mass-market offering, the Model 3, ramping up to 5,000 cars a month by the end of the year and driving output to several hundred thousand cars over the course of 2018.\u201cThey really need to deliver, and that has me concerned,\u201d Mr. Pascual said, who has worked at start-up companies and has years of experience in the technology business. \u201cI\u2019m bullish long term, but yes, I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m always worried about companies executing.\u201dTesla\u2019s market surge has been extraordinary. Since March 13, its shares are up 25 percent, in a period when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has declined slightly.Along the way, the market value of Tesla, which sold fewer than 80,000 cars last year and does not yet generate steady profits, has grown to $50 billion \u2014 roughly equal to that of General Motors, which sold more than 9.8 million vehicles worldwide and earned $9.4 billion. (On Tuesday, Tesla closed at $308.71, a decline of 1.2 percent, pushing it slightly below G.M. in market capitalization a day after surpassing it.)That Tesla and G.M. are comparably valued is \u201ctotally inexplicable,\u201d Michael J. Jackson, the chief executive of the dealership chain AutoNation, said on Tuesday at an auto-industry conference in New York. He added that Tesla \u201cis either one of the great Ponzi schemes of all time\u201d or will somehow work out for investors.The run-up was fueled in part by some encouraging signs that Tesla\u2019s Model 3 is proceeding on schedule. Early this year the company began production of batteries at its gigantic new plant in Nevada, known as the Gigafactory. Then it announced that Model 3 production would start in July, despite concerns among some analysts that the debut would be delayed until late this year.A smooth Model 3 rollout could propel Tesla to new heights. It has customer deposits of $1,000 for close to 400,000 orders of the new model, which is priced at $35,000, making it affordable to far more buyers than Tesla\u2019s existing models, which go for $90,000 with options.\u201cThe market seems to be thrilled,\u201d said David Whiston, an equity analyst at Morningstar. \u201cThe thinking seems to be that this could be the next Amazon or Apple, and people want to get in early.\u201dAdding to this enthusiasm seems to be a belief in Mr. Musk\u2019s vision of the future. He is trying to revolutionize the auto industry with Tesla, which has jumped ahead of traditional automakers in both battery-powered cars and self-driving technology. At the same time, he is promising to bring affordable renewable energy to homes with SolarCity, which merged with Tesla last year, and commercialize the heavens with SpaceX, a separate company he founded.Tesla, in Mr. Musk\u2019s view, is more than a carmaker. It is leading the shift to renewable energy \u2014 on the road and at home.While Mr. Musk\u2019s vision has captured the imagination of both car buyers and investors, the company\u2019s financial situation is less compelling. Tesla has reported losses in each of the past five years, and must invest heavily to achieve his goals. It had $3.4 billion in cash at the end of 2016, but some $7 billion in debt after the SolarCity acquisition. It has debt payments coming due in 2018, 2019 and 2021. Problems or delays in Model 3 production could make it harder to meet its obligations.\u201cRight now, nobody seems to care about balance-sheet risk,\u201d Mr. Whiston said. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t seem to be concerned about cash-flow risk. People are looking at the potential, and the old-fashioned analysis of fundamentals aren\u2019t seen as important.\u201dAnother question overshadowed by Tesla\u2019s stock surge is whether the company can make the big leap to making, shipping, selling and servicing a half a million cars a year \u2014 a fivefold increase in production of cars that are made out of thousands of parts and components.\u201cAll you need is a problem with one part to delay the Model 3,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book.Producing a half a million cars a year in one plant will not be easy even without such problems. Other car plants in the United States typically make only 200,000 to 300,000 vehicles a year.Pete Cordaro, the owner of a vending-machine company in Connellsville, Pa., drives a 2015 Model S and loves the car. Mr. Cordaro is such a fan, in fact, that he has put down deposits to buy two Model 3s once they are available.But the stock? He is not sold on it. He said he knew well from his own business how important a sound financial footing was.\u201cI think there\u2019s too much enthusiasm in the market like with any growth company,\u201d Mr. Cordaro said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bubble.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Soon, Your Car May Be Able to Read Your Expressions", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byWheelsWhen you shop for cat food online, Amazon knows who you are. When you look for the best airfares for summer vacation, Google knows who you are. Soon, when you get behind the wheel, your car may recognize you, too.Using cameras with facial recognition software and other biometric indicators, automakers are looking to personalize the driving experience with cars that stare back at you, quietly adjusting seats and driving modes. They may even anticipate your wants and desires by playing your favorite music based on your mood. And it\u2019s not only about convenience, but also about the possibility of improving safety and security.Continental has already demonstrated in-car systems that allow drivers to register their faces using something as simple as a driver\u2019s license picture. An interior infrared camera is used to overcome potential obstacles like sunglasses, which would stymie a conventional video camera. Putting the camera in the center instrument cluster also helps to pinpoint the driver\u2019s eyes, even if she\u2019s wearing a hat. The biggest technical challenge \u2014 glare caused by sunlight \u2014 can be filtered out using machine learning, Mr. Bolton said.Once the car knows who you are, systems in vehicles like the Chrysler Portal concept car would automatically adjust the seat for maximum comfort, select a driving mode (for example, one driver likes to let the car do most of the work; another likes taking control in sport mode) and suggest a destination based on the owner\u2019s past behavior.Watching a driver\u2019s face can also give a car important clues about that person\u2019s state of mind. For several years, carmakers like Ford and tech companies like Intel have been interested in determining whether a driver is happy or sad. Depending on your mood, a car could change its tune, playing a bouncy Beach Boys song and changing the interior lighting to improve your attitude.There are practical reasons as well, designers say, for detecting a driver\u2019s emotional state: A calm driver is a safer driver. So cars that recognize when you are becoming angry and thus prone to road rage could potentially quell annoying bells and chimes in the car and play some mellow jazz to soothe you.In this digital age, our faces are everywhere: in online company profiles, on Twitter accounts, even tagged in friends\u2019 Facebook accounts. Finding an image to print out and foil a car\u2019s facial recognition system would not be very difficult.Fortunately, engineers have devised high-tech countermeasures. Stereoscopic video cameras, for example, can tell the difference between a flat image and a three-dimensional object. Continental\u2019s cameras measure the distance of reflected light off various parts of a person\u2019s face, ensuring that it is a real object rather than a high-resolution shot of the owner\u2019s visage.\u201cSome systems have added blink detection and aliveness detection,\u201d said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer for security at Intel. But he acknowledged that it was still possible to thwart such technology. \u201cWe had 3-D masks printed that we ordered and were able to trick some systems,\u201d he said. But he said most thieves would be unlikely to go to such extreme lengths to steal a car.On the other hand, high-tech personalization could be used not only to create amenities for single owners, but also to instantly adapt a vehicle to suit a variety of drivers. Valets, for example, could be automatically prevented from accessing personal information in a navigation system or driving faster than, say, 30 miles per hour. In a ride-sharing situation, such systems could also be used to quickly tailor a car\u2019s interior to the physical characteristics of different drivers and passengers.Rental cars would be easier to operate and safer, Mr. Bolton of Continental said. \u201cIf I know where your head is and where your eyes are,\u201d he said, \u201cI can adjust the position of the steering wheel and the mirrors so you don\u2019t have to fumble looking for the right buttons.\u201dEven airbags could be fine-tuned, reducing the intensity of their deployment depending on the size and position of a driver or young passenger.Such convenience may come with some trade-offs on privacy.Using traffic-tracking programs like Waze, some consumers have already signaled their preference for convenience in return for giving up some information like their location. Programmers also point out that such services are optional: You don\u2019t have to let the company track you \u2014 but then you may get stuck in traffic for 45 minutes.And it could be fun. Consider the entertainment and social media repercussions in the vein of James Corden\u2019s \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d segments. A built-in camera could record and broadcast your singalong on Facebook or Twitter \u2014 assuming the car was in autonomous driving mode. Of course, drivers could grab quick selfies on the road, too.\u201cIt\u2019s a novel ideal,\u201d Mr. Bolton said, \u201cbut remember that an infrared camera makes your face look a little like a skeleton, so it\u2019s not that flattering.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Ups and Downs of the Sears Empire", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAlthough the company had stores all over America, they were in the big cities and towns. We went only once to the Kansas City store, when I was about 6, when a neighbor drove us there to shop for bedding \u2014 my parents didn\u2019t learn to drive until some years later.The size of the store terrified me \u2014 floor after floor with display shelves twice my height. Although every aisle showed something different, in their symmetry they all looked the same to me. I got lost and thought my parents would be so angry that they wouldn\u2019t bother to look for me. Fortunately my resourceful older brother tracked me down before I spent the rest of my childhood riding the elevators, bleating piteously.The rest of the time, we shopped through the catalog. My mother bought all her appliances from Sears, along with the husky-size jeans my brothers and I needed. Twice a year, Mom carefully filled in the order forms for everything from children\u2019s underwear to Craftsman tools and Kenmore vacuum cleaners, enclosed a check and waited for delivery.When she\u2019d finished shopping, my brothers and I got to use the catalog to make paper dolls or soldiers. Special catalogs had fabric samples that I could use for bedspreads and carpets in my dollhouse.My mother herself, during her Depression childhood, had cut out pictures of grand pianos and diamond tiaras and presented them as her wish list for presents.Our Jewish family stood out like giraffes in our small Kansas town: stared at and commented on but rarely targets of hostility. We were even more rarely targets of reverence, but the local Kenmore repairman belonged to a Protestant sect that believed, with Calvin, that Jews were the first called by God. The repairman thought working for a Jewish family brought him close to holiness, and he would never charge my mother for fixing her Kenmore washer or dryer.When I heard the news that Sears might be closing, that repairman was the first person I thought of. I\u2019m sure, like my mother, he has been dead many years, but he exemplified what Sears meant in small towns across the country. Unlike Amazon and other contemporary retail behemoths, Sears had employees who were part of our communities.Sears was the Amazon of its day. It sold everything: dishes, appliances, clothes, toys, groceries, motorcycles, car parts and even houses that you could construct bit by bit from the catalog. Having moved its headquarters from Minneapolis to Chicago, the company officially opened its 40-acre warehouse in 1906 to hold merchandise for national distribution. Retail stores would come later.When I moved to Chicago in 1968, Sears was the world\u2019s largest retailer. It employed about 350,000 people; its insurance company subsidiary, Allstate, dominated the auto and homeowners market. It had long outgrown its million-square-foot warehouse and had regional distribution centers three or four times that size.In 1970, with antiwar and civil rights protests roiling the country and the economy stagnant, Sears broke ground for a new headquarters building in downtown Chicago. It wanted three million square feet of office space and it wanted a monument to its historic market success \u2014 from small Minneapolis watch company in 1886 to retail giant in 1970.I couldn\u2019t afford Sears when I first moved here \u2014 everything I bought came from Goodwill. Besides, I\u2019ve never overcome my 6-year-old\u2019s anomie inside giant retail spaces. The fluorescent lights, the mind-numbing Muzak and the miles of aisles disorient me.The store where I used to daydream was Marshall Field \u2014 another vanished icon \u2014 where I\u2019d try on $2,000 frocks in the 28 Shop and imagine myself at opening night at the opera.By the time the Sears Tower was topped in 1973, the company had already begun to decline. The marketing strategies of the past century didn\u2019t work against muscular young competitors like Walmart. Sears closed stores; it eliminated products; it sold off Allstate, its most profitable subsidiary; but it wasn\u2019t able to stop the bleeding.A friend took a job at Dean Witter, the brokerage house Sears bought in an effort to stanch the flow. I\u2019d visit her at Sears on our lunch breaks, where the smell of stale popcorn made the store seem dreary and old. It was a far cry from the company\u2019s prime, when you could visit the dentist or podiatrist while you were buying a house, a tombstone or a dining room set.The London-based Willis insurance company took over naming rights for the tower when Sears\u2019s rights expired. The building is now officially Willis Tower, but for me and millions of other Chicagoans, it will always be the Sears Tower.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Tools Needed to Track Technology\u2019s Impact on Jobs, Panel Says", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byAmerica needs new tools for the timely measurement and monitoring of technology, jobs and skills to cope with the advance of artificial intelligence and automation, an expert panel composed mainly of economists and computer scientists said in a new report.The panel\u2019s recommendations include the development of an A.I. index, analogous to the Consumer Price Index, to track the pace and spread of artificial intelligence technology. That technical assessment, they said, could then be combined with detailed data on skills and tasks involved in various occupations to guide education and job-training programs.A public-private collaboration, they added, is necessary to create such tools because information from many sources will be the essential ingredient. Those information sources range from traditional government statistics to the vast pools of new data from online services like LinkedIn and Udacity that can be tapped to gain insights on skills, job openings and the effectiveness of training programs.Both the report and commentary were spurred by the advances in A.I. in recent years, including document-reading software and self-driving cars, which promise to make inroads into work done by humans. That prospect has created angst for many American workers about the difficulties of adapting to technological change and the failure of institutions to help them.Yet technologists and academics still differ sharply on how fast the next wave of automation will proceed and how many occupations will be affected. That prompted the panelists to suggest the new data-monitoring tools and the pulling together of government and online data sources to sort through the consequences.Those moves could eventually give a worker in a declining occupation useful information about a more promising occupation, with some similar skills but also requiring some new ones, Mr. Mitchell said. Then the software tool might also pull information on job placement rates for courses that teach those new skills.That style of data-driven decision-making is a hallmark of internet companies like Amazon and Google, and it has been increasingly embraced across corporate America. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason government can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Brynjolfsson said.\u201cBut our surveys are not really designed to track technology or its impact,\u201d said Professor Haltiwanger, who was a member of the expert panel. \u201cThe best shot at that is the private sector data.\u201dA broad national initiative, perhaps with the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis setting rules for private sector data sharing and privacy protections, might not be possible, Mr. Brynjolfsson conceded. But he and Mr. Mitchell wrote in Nature, \u201cPerfection here is not a prerequisite for utility \u2014 anything is better than flying blind.\u201dOne program that embodies the panel\u2019s recommendations is Skillful, a collaboration of the Markle Foundation, LinkedIn, Arizona State University and edX, a nonprofit provider of online courses. The partners are working with employers, educators and local governments in Colorado and the Phoenix metropolitan area to link jobs, skills and training more tightly.Past times of economic turmoil have led to new kinds of economic data collection and analysis.At the outset of the Depression in 1929, for example, there was no measure of national economic activity or reliable information on unemployment. In June 1930, based on scattered reports of improvement, President Herbert Hoover prematurely declared, \u201cThe Depression is over.\u201dTo address the information gap of its day, the government hired economists and statisticians to come up with a scientific method for measuring the national economy. In 1934, a team led by Simon Kuznets published its report on how to calculate national income. The field of econometrics took a big step forward, and policy makers were less in the dark.The time has now come, the expert panel suggested, for a similar effort to adapt to the modern digital economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Brick-and-Mortar Travails, a Tipping Point for Amazon in Apparel", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 If future anthropologists want to study the rubble of early-21st-century retail, a good place to start will be what Amazon.com did to apparel shopping in the few years before and after 2017.It is looking at ways to keep expanding, too. Amazon is exploring the possibility of selling custom-fit clothing, tailored to the more precise measurements of customers, and it has considered acquiring clothing manufacturers to further expand its presence in the category.If there are tipping points in retail \u2014 moments when shopping behavior swings decisively in one direction \u2014 there\u2019s a strong case to be made that apparel is reaching one now, with broad implications for jobs, malls and shopping districts.Those moments often occur around the time that online shopping reaches about 20 percent of total national retail spending in a category, the research firm L2 has concluded after studying the evolution of e-commerce. Online clothing and accessory shopping\u2019s share of retail hit 21 percent last year, according to estimates by Cowen and Company, a stock research firm.\u201cI do think this year is the year apparel e-commerce takes off,\u201d said Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2.Apparel has been something of an e-commerce laggard. In years gone by, buying clothing over the internet was only for the fearless, with most shoppers unwilling to take the risk that a dress or a pair of shoes would fit poorly or look terrible on them.It took time, but shopping habits for clothing are shifting profoundly.Pia Arthur, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment for this article.Amazon is by far the biggest beneficiary of e-commerce growth, accounting for 43 cents of every dollar spent online in the nation last year, estimated Slice Intelligence, a company that measures online shopping.But there\u2019s little chance Amazon will come to have in apparel the crushing dominance it has established in, say, books, because of the way clothing sales are fragmented among so many retailers. Amazon accounts for half the country\u2019s consumer book market on a unit basis, according to the Codex Group, a book market research firm.Last year, the company\u2019s gross merchandise apparel sales \u2014 Amazon\u2019s direct sales of clothing plus the commission it collects on sales by independent merchants on its site \u2014 were $22 billion, or 6.6 percent of the market, Cowen estimated. By 2021, the firm has forecast, Amazon will account for just over 16 percent of apparel sales.\u201cWe look at it as winner take most,\u201d said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen. \u201cThat\u2019s their game.\u201dStill, Amazon faces hurdles in its apparel business. Some apparel makers have been frustrated by the prevalence of counterfeit versions of their products on Amazon, peddled by independent merchants.\u201cWe have seen improvements on the Amazon marketplace addressing our core issues of unauthorized sellers and counterfeit goods,\u201d said Dania Shiblaq, a spokeswoman for Birkenstock USA, adding that the company still does not directly sell to Amazon.The idea of buying clothing without first trying it on is still a deal breaker for many shoppers, even with the security of free returns. Amazon executives look at such hurdles as \u201cfriction,\u201d which they are constantly seeking to eliminate.One idea Amazon is considering to lubricate apparel shopping: custom-fit clothing. The company\u2019s apparel team is exploring the possibility of offering \u201con-demand\u201d clothing that would be made only after a customer submitted an order, using the customer\u2019s precise measurements, according to a person briefed on the discussions who asked for anonymity because they were confidential.If it works, the plan could make shoppers happier by delivering clothing that looks better on them, while also addressing the ruinous consequences that returns can have on the profits of internet apparel retailers. It\u2019s not uncommon for shoppers to order three sizes of a shirt or dress and send back two.About 35 percent of all apparel orders are returned, said Stefan Weitz, chief product and strategy officer for Radial, a company that runs e-commerce operations for other brands and retailers.\u201cThat has huge impact on customer experience and satisfaction and also on that retailer\u2019s P and L,\u201d said Drew Green, chief executive of Indochino, an internet retailer of custom-fit suits, referring to profit and loss statements. Mr. Green said fewer than 1 percent of Indochino\u2019s orders were returned.Mr. Green declined to comment about whether Amazon had made an offer for Indochino.There\u2019s still the matter of how Amazon would get a customer\u2019s precise measurements. Indochino\u2019s answer has been to coach customers to do the measurements themselves, and to open showrooms where Indochino employees can do the measurements for them. (Its 13th store opened on Friday.)Amazon has developed a camera and scanning software designed to automatically determine customers\u2019 measurements and upload them to their accounts, according to the person familiar with Amazon\u2019s apparel talks, who saw an early prototype of the device.The source said the device resembled a camera product that Amazon announced last week, Echo Look, the latest in a line of gadgets powered by the company\u2019s Alexa intelligent assistant.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "El Salvador\u2019s Historic Mining Ban", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe prospect of job creation and short-term returns has prompted several governments in Latin America to welcome mining companies and keep regulation to a minimum. In remote areas, unauthorized miners have sucked up natural resources without regard for the environmental and social damage they leave behind.The enactment of the legislation was a victory for activists and Catholic Church leaders, who argued that giving miners free rein in El Salvador would further pollute the water sources of one of the most environmentally wrecked countries in the hemisphere.After that decision, support for a sweeping ban on mining became widespread among Salvadorans, who concluded that they had more to lose than gain from allowing this industry.Mining can, of course, be an important economic driver when it is properly regulated, and El Salvador\u2019s mining ban is unlikely to become a model for its neighbors. Nonetheless, it ought to prompt other countries to consider more carefully the toll mining takes on vulnerable communities and the need for tighter regulations and stronger enforcement of environmental rules. Progress on this front could start with more robust national debates about the pros and cons of individual projects.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Vanguard Is Growing Faster Than Everybody Else Combined", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byMALVERN, Pa. \u2014 The Vanguard trading floor is the epicenter of one of the great financial revolutions of modern times, yet it is a surprisingly relaxed place.A few men and women gaze at Bloomberg terminals. There is a muted television or two and a view of verdant suburban Philadelphia. No one is barking orders to buy or sell stock. For a $4.2 trillion mutual fund giant that is still growing rapidly, it occupies a small fraction of the space of a typical Wall Street trading hub.You can barely hear the quiet hum of money being invested \u2014 money in scarcely imaginable quantities, pouring into low-cost index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (E.T.F.s) that track financial markets.In the last three calendar years, investors sank $823 billion into Vanguard funds, the company says. The scale of that inflow becomes clear when it is compared with the rest of the mutual fund industry \u2014 more than 4,000 firms in total. All of them combined took in just a net $97 billion during that period, Morningstar data shows. Vanguard, in other words, scooped up about 8.5 times as much money as all of its competitors.\u201cFlows of this magnitude into one company are unprecedented,\u201d said Alina Lamy, an expert on fund flows at Morningstar. \u201cSince the crisis, investors have been saying, \u2018I may not be able to control the market, but I can control how much I pay in mutual fund expenses.\u2019 And when they look for quality funds with low fees, the first answer is Vanguard.\u201dThe triumph of index fund investing means Vanguard\u2019s traders funnel as much as $2 billion a day into stocks like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, as well as thousands of smaller companies that the firm\u2019s fleet of funds track. That is 20 times the amount that Vanguard was investing on a daily basis in 2009. It is manageable, in large part, because no stock-picking is involved: The money simply flows into index funds and E.T.F.s, and through February of this year, nine out of every 10 dollars invested in a United States mutual fund or E.T.F. was absorbed by Vanguard.By any measure, these are staggering figures. Vanguard\u2019s assets under management have skyrocketed to $4.2 trillion from $1 trillion seven years ago, according to the company. About $3 trillion of this is invested in passive index-based strategies, with the rest in funds that rely on an active approach to picking stocks and bonds.More broadly, this deluge of money abandoning higher-price actively managed funds for Vanguard\u2019s plain vanilla cut-rate vehicles has come as an existential shock to a mutual industry that has long been resistant to change.The effect within Vanguard has been no less profound. For decades, the firm has made the case that cheaper index funds will, over time, outperform more-expensive mutual funds that rely on brainy portfolio managers to pick stocks.Unlike its peers, Vanguard is owned by its funds \u2014 and ultimately its investors \u2014 so as money rushes in, expenses are persistently reduced, resulting in perpetual savings for the legions of Vanguard clients. They number well over 20 million and include New York Times employees: Vanguard runs the company\u2019s 401(k) retirement plans.The model has been a powerful one: Since 1976, fees on Vanguard funds have fallen to about 0.12 percent from about 0.70 percent. By comparison, Lipper calculates that the average fee for all mutual funds is currently 1 percent, although it has been coming down rapidly.\u201cMr. Bogle used to say, \u2018This is not our money,\u2019 and I agree,\u201d said F. William McNabb III, Vanguard\u2019s chief executive, referring to the extraordinary inflows. \u201cFor many years, there has been a real move to our way of investing. And it\u2019s more than active versus passive \u2014 it\u2019s high cost versus low cost.\u201dThis no-frills approach has come under some strain as cash flowing into Vanguard funds reaches new highs year after year, some people who follow Vanguard closely say. There have been reports of operational snarls, including website outages, longer-than-usual wait times on the phone and misdirected fund transfers.There is no doubt about Vanguard\u2019s commitment to pinching pennies. In touring the 287-acre campus of pathways, low-slung buildings and a commanding statue of Mr. Bogle, the sensibility is decidedly puritan.There are few flashy cars to be found in the parking lots. The walls are largely devoid of eye-catching art \u2014 with the exception of some musty paintings of the HMS Vanguard, a Napoleonic-era British warship that inspired the company\u2019s name.In sum, the look is slightly drab, certainly by Wall Street standards: rows of uniform cubicles, colorless carpets and an executive boardroom that seems more appropriate for a community college than one of the largest financial institutions in the land.Vanguard executives say they are disciplined in terms of plowing money back into people and technology, but not overly so. \u201cOur true investment spending has doubled in the past five years,\u201d Mr. McNabb said.This tension between breakneck growth and spending restraint is most acutely felt in the firm\u2019s retail division \u2014 or the front lines, as they are referred to here \u2014 where 6,000 customer service representatives attend to the wishes, demands and whims of the close to eight million clients who purchase their mutual funds directly from Vanguard. In 2015 and 2016, this division added 350,000 new accounts each year, numbers never before seen at the firm.\u201cThe spotlight is on us, given the growth, and there have been operational challenges,\u201d said Karin A. Risi, who oversees Vanguard\u2019s retail investor group and is in the midst of an aggressive hiring push. \u201cBut it is not fair to say we are not investing. Bringing in 2,000 crew on a base of 6,000 is not insignificant.\u201dAs with many executives at Vanguard, Ms. Risi gets a glint in her eye when she talks of the virtues of investing in low-cost index funds. Like the majority of her peers, she has spent the bulk of her career at the firm and, as a certified culture carrier, it is clear that she is taking the current growing pains to heart.\u201cMy parents were Vanguard investors, and I was investing in Vanguard funds in high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I feel the burden of this responsibility. We are serving a mission here.\u201dBeyond their devotion to indexing, Vanguard employees talk as if they are working on a frigate, a nod to the nautical images and themes embraced by Mr. Bogle at the company\u2019s founding.Employees are called crew, one eats at the galley (not the cafeteria) and works out in the \u201cship shape\u201d room, and new workers come onboard as opposed to being hired.\u201cYou absorb the culture and you join the cause,\u201d said Joseph Brennan, who, as head of global equity indexing, has had a front-row seat as the firm has expanded. His division embodies Vanguard\u2019s credo of do more with less: The 45 people he oversees globally look after $2 trillion in assets.\u201cOur assets per head are incredible,\u201d he said. At $44 billion per person, that certainly qualifies as an understatement.Already, six out of the 10 largest mutual funds by asset size belong to Vanguard, with the largest, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, now weighing in at $465 billion, according to Morningstar. Only two \u2014 American Funds\u2019 Growth Fund of America and its EuroPacific Growth Fund, both belonging to the Capital Group \u2014 are actively managed, promising higher returns for a steeper fee.An article in the Mutual Fund Quarterly last Sunday about the growth in inflows to the index fund giant Vanguard misspelled the given name of the executive who oversees its retail investor group. She is Karin A. Risi, not Karen. (The error was repeated in a picture caption.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Signs Order That Could Lead to Curbs on Foreign Workers", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byAfter recent policy reversals that have angered his populist base, Mr. Trump described the visa program as an initiative gone awry that has driven down wages for Americans. The order was a means to end the \u201ctheft of American prosperity,\u201d which he said had been brought on by low-wage immigrant labor.Yet the order calls for a series of relatively modest steps, like a multiagency report on changes needed for the H-1B program, under which the government admits 85,000 foreign workers annually, many of them in the high-tech, industrial, medical and science fields. Collectively, the efforts outlined in the order could take years to carry out.The H1-B program has become a focus in the debate over the impact of foreign workers. Mr. Trump has criticized employers for abusing the program and using it to avoid hiring higher-paid American counterparts. He vowed to revamp its lottery-based selection process.The order, signed at the sprawling Snap-on tool factory here, represents a small win for bigger tech companies, which have been in pitched battles for those visas. Companies like Google and Microsoft, which rely heavily on high-skilled foreign workers, had worried that President Trump would make drastic curbs to worker programs that could cripple them.\u201cI think people are cautiously optimistic that this will be O.K., and maybe even better,\u201d said Tom Alberg, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle firm that invests in high-tech start-ups.But the order would likely hurt the biggest users of the visa program, technology outsourcing firms that bring foreign workers to the United States to perform technical jobs, typically from India.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump stoked outrage from his supporters with accounts of companies like Walt Disney forcing laid-off technical workers to train their overseas replacements.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump spoke in terms of an apple-pie populism that helped him pull off upset victories in November in Midwestern states like Wisconsin.H-1B visas \u201cshould include only the most skilled and highest-paid applicants and should never, ever be used to replace American workers,\u201d Mr. Trump told a gathering of about 500 workers and local luminaries, including the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who hails from Kenosha.On this point, many executives at American technology companies agree with Mr. Trump. They argue that they mostly apply for H-1Bs for workers when they can\u2019t find qualified American workers, usually those with advanced degrees like a masters or Ph.D.In recent years, there has been so much demand for H-1B visas that the whole fiscal year\u2019s allocation has run out in a few days in April, when applications are accepted. The visas are then awarded by lottery to qualified applicants. Some 600,000 to 900,000 immigrants are currently in the United States on H-1B visas, researchers estimate.Outsourcing firms \u2014 the top 13 of which accounted for a third of all granted visas in 2014, the last year for which information is publicly available \u2014 typically flood the system with visa applications. The top recipients were Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro, all from India.India\u2019s leading tech trade group, the National Association of Software and Services Companies, said Indian companies were being treated unfairly. \u201cWe believe that the current campaign to discredit our sector is driven by persistent myths, such as the ideas that H-1B visa holders are \u2018cheap labor\u2019 and \u2018train their replacements,\u2019 neither of which is accurate,\u201d the group said in a statement.Companies like Microsoft, Intel and Amazon are also big recipients. At least 15 percent of the American workforces of Facebook and the chip maker Qualcomm hold H-1Bs, according to the most recent documents the companies have filed with the Labor Department.\u201cThis does nothing,\u201d said Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cLike all the other executive orders, it\u2019s just words \u2014 he\u2019s calling for new studies. It\u2019s not going to fix the problem. It\u2019s not going to create a single job.\u201dRepresentative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat whose district includes Silicon Valley, said the issue of foreign workers was real, but dismissed the president\u2019s order as poorly targeted and unlikely to achieve its desired result.\u201cHalf of the start-ups in Silicon Valley were created by highly skilled people from other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president and his staff fully appreciates that fact.\u201dIn a briefing with reporters on Monday, White House officials said the \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d order would also overhaul federal procurement practices to increase the selection of products from American companies, especially in the domestic steel industry, which has faced stiff competition from China.One reform advocated by the Trump administration, which has drawn bipartisan support from Congress, would change the lottery system for awarding H-1B visas, giving extra preference to the highest-paying jobs \u2014 a proposal favored by many in the American technology industry.Representatives from Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google either declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Blake Irving, the chief executive of domain name and web hosting firm GoDaddy, said he supported the idea of changing the system for issuing H-1Bs to give priority to higher-skilled workers. He said GoDaddy typically receives only about 20 percent of the H-1B visas it applies for.\u201cIf anything, it moves the policy towards something that\u2019s preferential to the expert work force,\u201d said Mr. Irving. \u201cAnything that gets us closer to that is goodness.\u201dBut some smaller technology companies said they were concerned about the changes proposed by the Trump administration.Punit Soni, the chief executive of Learning Motors, a six-person company in Silicon Valley that is trying to apply artificial intelligence to health care, said the visa changes proposed by the Trump administration would hurt start-ups.Small companies cannot afford to pay high salaries and are already struggling to attract talent in a tight market, he said. A visa system that favors the highest-paid workers will steer immigrants only to already successful big companies like Google, his former employer.\u201cWe\u2019re a small start-up. Everyone is getting way below-market average salary,\u201d he said.Glen Thrush reported from Kenosha, Nick Wingfield from Seattle and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Charles Murray\u2019s \u2018Provocative\u2019 Talk", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byGray MatterThe talk that the political scientist Charles Murray attempted to deliver last month at Middlebury College in Vermont must have been quite provocative \u2014 perhaps even offensive or an instance of hate speech. How else to explain the vehement opposition to it?Before Mr. Murray\u2019s arrival on campus, an open letter to the college from several hundred alumni protested that his scholarly opinions were \u201cdeceptive statistics masking unfounded bigotry.\u201d And when it came time for Mr. Murray to give his speech, which was based on his 2012 book, \u201cComing Apart,\u201d an analysis of the predicament of the white working class in the United States, he was shouted down by student and faculty protesters. In chants they accused him of being a racist and a white supremacist. Some of the protesters became unruly and physically violent, forcing Mr. Murray to flee.Mr. Murray ended up giving a version of his talk later that day, via livestream, from another room. How extreme were his views?We have our own opinion, but as social scientists we hoped to get a more objective answer. So we transcribed Mr. Murray\u2019s speech and \u2014 without indicating who wrote it \u2014 sent it to a group of 70 college professors (women and men, of different ranks, at different universities). We asked them to rate the material on a scale from 1 to 9, ranging from very liberal to very conservative, with 5 defined as \u201cmiddle of the road.\u201d We also offered them a chance to explain why they gave the material the score they did.American college professors are overwhelmingly liberal. Still, the 57 professors who responded to our request gave Mr. Murray\u2019s talk an average score of 5.05, or \u201cmiddle of the road.\u201d Some professors said that they judged the speech to be liberal or left-leaning because it addressed issues like poverty and incarceration, or because it discussed social change in terms of economic forces rather than morality. Others suggested that they detected a hint of discontent with the fact that Donald Trump was elected president. No one raised concerns that the material was contentious, dangerous or otherwise worthy of censure.We also sent the transcript to a group of 70 college professors who were told that the speech was by Mr. Murray. The 44 who responded gave it an average rating of 5.77. That score is significantly more conservative, statistically speaking, than the rating given by the professors unaware of the author\u2019s identity (suggesting that knowing Mr. Murray was the author colored the evaluation of the content). Even still, 5.77 is not too far from \u201cmiddle of the road.\u201dFinally, we divided Mr. Murray\u2019s speech into 10 portions and got ratings on each portion from a paid sample of 200 American adults via Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk, an online marketplace for jobs and tasks. These participants identified themselves as having an average political orientation of 4.21, or leaning slightly liberal. When their ratings for the 10 sections were averaged, they too gave the talk a centrist score: 5.22. (Average ratings for the 10 portions ranged from 4 to 6.)Our data-gathering exercise suggests that Mr. Murray\u2019s speech was neither offensive nor even particularly conservative. It is not obvious, to put it mildly, that Middlebury students and faculty had a moral obligation to prevent Mr. Murray from airing these views in public.Of course, many of the protesters may have been offended by Mr. Murray\u2019s other scholarship, in particular his controversial 1994 book, \u201cThe Bell Curve,\u201d written with the Harvard psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein, which examined intelligence, social class and race in America. Or rather, they may have been offended, as many people have been, by what they assume \u201cThe Bell Curve\u201d says; only a small fraction of the people who have opinions about that book have actually read it. (Indeed, some people protesting Mr. Murray openly acknowledged not having read any of his work.)\u201cThe Bell Curve\u201d has generated an enormous literature of scholarly response and rebuttal, a process that is still underway. Many scholars have deemed the book\u2019s most provocative argument \u2014 that differences in average I.Q. scores among races may have genetic as well as environmental causes \u2014 to be flawed and racist. Some have judged it to be judicious and reasoned, if still controversial. But its academic critics have nonetheless treated it not as hate speech to be censored but as a data-based argument with which they must engage in order to disagree.This is not how the Middlebury protesters treated Mr. Murray\u2019s talk, and that is an intellectual disappointment. It is incumbent on each of us, in the spirit of free inquiry, to make a decision for ourselves \u2014 after actually reading a book or listening to a speaker \u2014 about how the views in question hold up to critical scrutiny. It is also incumbent upon colleges to offer protesters meaningful opportunities to share alternative views.Not everyone deserves to get to speak at a college campus. But those like Mr. Murray who use reasoned, evidence-based approaches to investigate matters of scholarly concern shouldn\u2019t be forcibly silenced after they have been invited to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Family Values Book Tops Charts, as He Faces Abuse Claims", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byThe timing of Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s latest best-selling book could hardly be more awkward.On Friday, it was among the top 15 books in sales on Amazon and was No. 1 on Barnes & Noble\u2019s nonfiction best-seller list.But it was still unclear how the disclosure of the sexual harassment settlements might affect sales for the book, or Mr. Reilly\u2019s career as a prolific author. The strong start for \u201cOld School\u201d includes preorders and largely reflects the first week of sales, before The Times published its article about the settlements.Though best known as a combative Fox News personality, Mr. O\u2019Reilly has carved out an incredibly lucrative side pursuit as an author. His ongoing \u201cKilling\u201d series, which he started in 2011 and writes with Martin Dugard, has more than 17 million copies in print, according to his publisher, Henry Holt. His book, \u201cKilling the Rising Sun,\u201d about the final years of World War II, holds the No. 3 spot on the New York Times\u2019s hardcover list, while his 2013 book, \u201cKilling Jesus,\u201d is No. 4 on the paperback list.\u201cKilling the Rising Sun\u201d topped all adult nonfiction books last year, selling 1,104,389 copies, according to Publishers Weekly.Patricia Eisemann, the director of publicity for Henry Holt, and Stephen Rubin, the company\u2019s president and publisher, declined to comment when asked if the company would continue to publish Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s books in the aftermath of the new revelations.Commercial publishing houses depend heavily on core authors, and some industry analysts said it was unlikely that Holt would sever ties with Mr. O\u2019Reilly, whose Fox show provides a built-in marketing machine for his books.\u201cI doubt very much that they would take a drastic action like cutting him loose,\u201d said Mike Shatzkin, the chief executive of Idea Logical Company, a book industry consulting firm. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to die if he\u2019s not there, but they certainly would be scrambling to make up the revenue.\u201dA publishing house is not subject to the same pressures as a network, which depends on advertising revenue, but occasionally a public scandal will drive publishers to drop an author. Simon & Schuster faced a fierce backlash this year from independent booksellers and some of its own authors after it bought a memoir by Milo Yiannopoulos, a former editor at Breitbart News who espouses views that many regard as xenophobic and misogynist.Even if Henry Holt continues to publish Mr. O\u2019Reilly, his sales could fall as a result of the allegations against him, particularly if major book retailers decide not to carry his titles, or Fox cancels his show. His children\u2019s book series, a spinoff of the \u201cKilling\u201d books, could be particularly vulnerable to a consumer or retailer boycott, given the nature of the allegations. \u201cGive Please a Chance,\u201d a picture book he wrote with James Patterson, has sold 181,200 copies since it was released in November, according to NPD BookScan.Then again, the allegations against Mr. O\u2019Reilly could lead his most loyal fans to double down on their support.\u201cThe people who like him may be even more inclined to support him now and vote with their dollars to say, \u2018I\u2019m with you, Bill,\u2019\u201d said Michael Cader, the founder of Publishers Marketplace.So far, major book retailers are sticking by him. \u201cWe leave it to our customers to decide what to buy and read,\u201d a Barnes & Noble spokeswoman said. Amazon, which declined to comment, features \u201cOld School\u201d in its spring reading nonfiction recommendations.Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s literary ambitions and his TV career evolved simultaneously.Mr. O\u2019Reilly went on to write about 20 other books, creating a publishing empire that includes children\u2019s titles, political and cultural critiques, and a best-selling memoir, \u201cA Bold Fresh Piece of Humanity.\u201dLike Mr. Patterson, the juggernaut of the thriller genre, Mr. O\u2019Reilly has kept his sales numbers high in part by being incredibly prolific and relying on his co-authors to help him produce a steady stream of blockbusters.It appears as though Holt is still invested in the Fox News host\u2019s brand. The company\u2019s fall catalog includes a new book by Mr. O\u2019Reilly and Mr. Dugard scheduled for September, listed as \u201cUntitled O\u2019Reilly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s Pick for Top Antitrust Cop May Shape Competition", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byAs a young Senate staff member years later, Mr. Delrahim found those early experiences had laid the foundation for his conservative views.In the interview with The New York Times, Mr. Delrahim declined to address AT&T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner, which is now undergoing regulatory review, or other large deals, saying he would \u201cexamine any matter according to evidence and economic analysis.\u201d But he gave other hints of how he might act as the department\u2019s top antitrust official.Specifically, Mr. Delrahim, a former lobbyist, said he would not go after a company just because it was big, and would do so only if there were violations of antitrust law. \u201cJust like any other industry, if there is wrongdoing, we would investigate,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said. But \u201cfederal laws should not be used as a fishing expedition by government.\u201dHe also intimated that he was skeptical of antitrust action against intellectual property rights holders, referring to some earlier comments on the matter. In a 2007 statement, for example, he had warned that cases that blended intellectual property rights with antitrust enforcement could hamper innovation.Legal experts have extrapolated that Mr. Delrahim is also likely to credit mergers with helping competition \u2014 not only reducing it \u2014 and to point out how big deals can promote the United States economy. That \u201cwould be a major change from his most recent predecessors,\u201d the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell recently said in a memo to clients.Mr. Delrahim\u2019s views contrast subtly with those of the Obama administration, which took a more aggressive approach in antitrust toward protecting innovation, especially in the technology industry.Mr. Delrahim would take over antitrust duties at a moment of profound economic transformation, with tech companies like Google and Amazon dominating search and commerce while extending their reach in transportation, media and other industries. Telecom companies are trying to morph into media powerhouses that control the distribution and creation of television and online content.With a wave of corporate mergers in other areas \u2014 chemicals, agricultural products and health insurance \u2014 some Democratic lawmakers have warned that industries have become too concentrated, putting consumers in danger of higher prices and giving them fewer options in vital services.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who will be at the Wednesday hearing, said in a statement, \u201cI plan to ask if Mr. Delrahim will enforce the laws to protect American consumers and if he will commit to being independent, focusing on the merits of each case, not on interference from the White House.\u201dMr. Delrahim has had years of experience in antitrust matters. He graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1991 with a degree in kinesiology and obtained a law degree at George Washington University in 1995. He then joined the law firm Patton Boggs before leaving to be a counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1998. There, he cut his teeth on antitrust working for Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. Mr. Hatch had pushed for an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s practice of tying its web browser, Internet Explorer, to its ubiquitous Windows operating system.In 2005, Mr. Delrahim left Washington and joined the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck in Los Angeles. Over the years, he was the lawyer or federal lobbyist for clients including Ultimate Fighting Championship, Comcast, Google, Johnson & Johnson, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield.Mr. Delrahim endorsed Mr. Trump relatively early in last year\u2019s presidential campaign. In an op-ed in The New York Post in March 2016, he called on conservatives to back Mr. Trump, even if he was not their \u2014 or his \u2014 top choice.Former Democratic and Republican colleagues at the Justice Department describe Mr. Delrahim as fiercely loyal to the Republican Party, though he has a reputation for forging bipartisan relationships. His wife was a Democrat when they met and has voted for Democrats; Mr. Delrahim said he still did not know how she voted in the 2016 election.Democrats recall when Mr. Delrahim became a crucial ally in 2000 to help pass amendments to an antitrust law. House Republicans were unwilling to sign on, but Mr. Delrahim worked to allay their concerns and brokered compromises between them and Senate Democrats, said Jonathan Leibowitz, a partner at Davis Polk who was then working on the bill for Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat. Mr. Leibowitz later was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cHe\u2019s a conservative but his instincts tend toward pragmatism and not ideology,\u201d Mr. Leibowitz said of Mr. Delrahim.\u201cI\u2019m seeing more complaints about enforcement motivated by protectionism, so that will be an important area of inquiry for antitrust enforcement and cooperation,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said.He emphasized that antitrust is intended to support free markets and that the government should intervene only when necessary. A monopoly is perfectly legal until it abuses its monopoly power, he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "ESPN Layoffs: The Struggling Industry Giant Sheds On-Air Talent", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byThe \u201cWorldwide Leader in Sports,\u201d as ESPN brands itself, laid off scores of journalists and on-air talent on Wednesday, showing that even the most formidable media kingdom was vulnerable to the transformation upending the sports broadcasting industry as more and more people turn away from cable television.Among the prominent people let go were the former N.F.L. players Trent Dilfer and Danny Kanell, the former N.B.A. player Len Elmore, the former baseball general manager Jim Bowden and the longtime N.F.L. reporter Ed Werder.ESPN is by far the biggest and most powerful entity in the sports media industry, and it has felt the sting as viewers turn away from traditional ways of consuming live sports.In October 2015, ESPN laid off about 300 people, most of whom were not on camera. The network has been periodically culling its staff as it searches for ways to cut costs and adapts to changing consumer habits, with fans increasingly watching video clips on their smartphones at the expense of traditional highlight shows like \u201cSportsCenter.\u201d With ESPN locked into long-term contracts for programming rights with various sports leagues, savings must primarily come from a reduced staff.In a letter to employees on Wednesday, ESPN\u2019s president, John Skipper, acknowledged the \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d ahead and suggested what the network was looking for as it reshapes itself.In the most recent quarter, Disney\u2019s cable networks division reported $864 million in operating income, an 11 percent drop from the same period a year ago, with ESPN the reason for the entire decline, Disney said at the time. The company blamed higher N.B.A. and N.F.L. programming costs and lower ad sales for the weak results.Earlier this month, Amazon paid $50 million for streaming rights to 10 of the N.F.L.\u2019s Thursday night games for the 2017 season \u2014 or five times more than what Twitter paid a season ago, according to SportsBusiness Journal, which also reported that Facebook and YouTube bid on the package.The ESPN layoffs come as Disney accelerates efforts to introduce an ESPN-branded subscription streaming service. The offering, expected this year and made possible by Disney\u2019s $1 billion purchase in 2016 of part of BamTech, Major League Baseball\u2019s streaming division, will include coverage of sports like hockey, tennis, cricket and college sports \u2014 mostly rights that are owned by ESPN, but not televised.\u201cYou have to be willing to either create or experience some distribution as we migrate from what has been a more traditionally distributed world to a more nontraditional distribution world,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call in February. \u201cAnd some of that we\u2019re going to end up doing to ourselves, meaning that we understand there is disruption, but we believe we have to be a disrupter, too.\u201dDisney has long relied on ESPN\u2019s steadily climbing cable subscriber fees as a profit engine. But cable networks across the board have been losing viewers to online media, which has slowed growth, and Wall Street has responded unfavorably.Despite assurances by Mr. Iger that ESPN remains strong, investors and analysts have remained concerned about upheaval in the television business. Viewership via satellite and cable services is declining as streaming options proliferate, and ESPN, the naysayers contend, is particularly exposed to a slowdown because Disney has locked itself into lavish, long-term payments for sports rights.In a sign that Disney had done a good job preparing investors for the layoffs, shares climbed slightly in Wednesday morning trading.Here are some of the ESPN employees who have made statements on social media so far (we will update this list):Jay Crawford, \u201cSportsCenter\u201d anchor Ed Werder, N.F.L. reporterJayson Stark, baseball writerTrent Dilfer, N.F.L. analystAndy Katz, college basketball reporterLen Elmore, college basketball analyst Dana O\u2019Neil, college basketball reporter  Eamonn Brennan, college basketball reporterDanny Kanell, \u201cRussillo and Kanell\u201d radio hostJustin Verrier, N.B.A. reporterRobin Lundberg, radio hostCalvin Watkins, N.B.A. reporterMelissa Isaacson, columnistTed Miller, Pac-12 reporterJane McManus, writerAshley Fox, N.F.L. reporterEthan Strauss, N.B.A. reporterJeremy Crabtree, college football reporterBrian Bennett, Big Ten reporterDoug Padilla, baseball writerMax Olson, college football reporterC.

Amid the chaos, they sprayed gunfire on the entrance of a Spanish cash transporting company before using explosives to blast their way into the safe room.\u201cThis is something war-torn countries endure,\u201d said Cornelio Melgarejo, the director of a shelter for street children adjacent to the plundered complex in Ciudad del Este. Still, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you hear the blast of explosives in a place where children are sleeping.\u201dStill, some security specialists expressed caution about rushing to blame the P.C.C., contending that thorough investigations were needed in both Paraguay and Brazil to determine who orchestrated the robbery.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to inflate the importance of the P.C.C. into a regional or national security threat, which then bolsters the bureaucratic apparatus that positions itself to respond to such a threat,\u201d said Renato S\u00e9rgio de Lima, the director of the Brazilian Public Security Forum, a group that analyzes organized crime in the country.Officials on Tuesday scaled back some descriptions of the heist. While news reports in Paraguay and Brazil initially claimed that the thieves had stolen about $40 million, Liliana Denice Duarte, a Paraguayan prosecutor investigating the case, said that about $10 million was stolen.In a statement, Prosegur, the Spanish cash transporting company targeted in the robbery, said on Tuesday that no more than $8 million was stolen in Ciudad del Este, contending that unspecified moves by Prosegur\u2019s employees allowed the company to \u201cendure more than two hours of assault and limit the actions of the assailants.\u201dLincoln Gakiya, a prosecutor in S\u00e3o Paulo who investigates organized crime networks, said the P.C.C. was pushing into Paraguay in an effort to control coveted transshipment points for smuggling drugs into Brazil.

{"Headline": "Misgivings Diminish the Mighty N.F.L.\u2019s Swagger", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byOn Pro FootballPHILADELPHIA \u2014 When the N.F.L. draft was last held here, in 1961, teams chose players in a smoke-filled hotel ballroom, a modest group of sportswriters dutifully covered the proceedings, and only a few fans bothered to attend.Since then, and especially in the past few years, the league has turned the draft into a mammoth spectacle, complete with red-carpet entrances for prospective players broadcast live on two television networks. This year, the league outdid itself by holding the event outdoors for the first time, in a park in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where more than 70,000 people drank beer, rubbed elbows with fans of rival teams and hooted and hollered as the names of the first 32 players chosen were announced.Fittingly, perhaps, the N.F.L. also embraced the spirit of Rocky Balboa, the movie character who defined the city\u2019s underdog quality, and whose statue stands next to the museum. Carl Weathers, who played Balboa\u2019s rival, Apollo Creed, made a cameo appearance before the draft began. The draft picks bucked the odds, just like Rocky, the N.F.L. seemed to be saying.Underdog status is not something normally assigned to the N.F.L., the most powerful sports league in the country. But amid the jubilation was a sense that storm clouds are gathering. Last season, for the first time, ratings at every one of the league\u2019s top broadcast partners declined. Ratings may rebound, but the league\u2019s owners \u2014 who make the majority of their revenue from television deals \u2014 now must confront the possibility that the networks will resist paying ever larger sums for the right to air games.Before then came a wave of relocations that pushed the league into new markets \u2014 but also alienated fans in three cities that lost, or are losing, teams: San Diego, St. Louis and Oakland, Calif. The Rams are now playing in Los Angeles; next season the Chargers will be there, and by 2019, the Raiders will be in Las Vegas.The moves re-emphasized that the league\u2019s biggest priority remains making money \u2014 from relocation fees the moving teams pay the league, plus the league\u2019s cut of naming rights, sponsorships and other revenue boosts \u2014 no matter the complaints from deserted fans.The league is still facing more cosmic questions, most notably the long-term effects of concussions. With the help of a federal judge in Philadelphia, the N.F.L. agreed to pay millions of dollars to former players who have received diagnoses for serious neurological conditions. So far, a few hundred players have applied for cash payouts, with many more likely to come.Though they continue to watch N.F.L. games in droves, some fans now take a jaundiced view of the owners, and particularly the commissioner, Roger Goodell, who speaks for them.Mike Carr, a Cleveland Browns fan who drove 15 hours from Michigan to watch the draft, seemed to sum up that outlook. Carr wore a T-shirt that said \u201cJohnny Rehab,\u201d a nod to Johnny Manziel, the troubled quarterback drafted by the Browns in 2014. Before the draft began, Carr said he had made the trip in the hope that he could watch the Browns acquire Myles Garrett, the defensive end from Texas A&M, as the No. 1 overall pick, which they ultimately did.\u201cBut I\u2019m mostly really looking forward to booing Goodell,\u201d he said.Carr was not alone, based on the deafening boos from fans that greeted Goodell every time he took the stage.Concussions aren\u2019t the only legal headache confronting the league. Hundreds of retired players have also sued the N.F.L., asserting that their teams gave them painkillers without explaining the risks, including the possibility of addiction. A growing number of players are now asking the N.F.L. to let them use medical marijuana to deal with the pain associated with playing football. But Goodell once again shot down that idea on Friday, suggesting that marijuana is addictive and nodding to the possibility that the N.F.L. could be sued if it softened its stance on its use.The N.F.L. will also continue to turn the draft into a moneymaking roadshow by moving it to new cities every so often.But if that is not enough, the draft might take on underdog status after all.Advertisement"}

Awesome!\u201d\u201cHaving Maroon 5 on Messenger,\u201d she wrote in an email, \u201cmakes you feel really close to your favorite artists!\u201dFor celebrities who already use Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat to lend a personal touch to their interactions with fans, the next frontier of social media is a deliberately impersonal one: chatbots, a low-level form of artificial intelligence that can be harnessed to send news updates, push promotional content and even test new material.In the music world, \u201cbot\u201d is often a dirty word, conjuring up the tools used by high-tech ticket scalpers. Yet 50 Cent, Aerosmith, Snoop Dogg and Kiss have all deputized chatbots as their automatic, ever-alert greeters on Facebook Messenger, handling the flood of inquiries that would overwhelm any human.When someone connects to Maroon 5 on Messenger, a text bubble pops up: \u201cHi,\u201d it says, \u201cI\u2019m the Maroon 5 bot. Want to be the first to know when we release new music?\u201d A series of questions with multiple-choice answers follows, leading the fan down a path lined with emojis and video clips; social media links then point other fans back to the bot.It is a purposely simple interaction, created through technology developed by a start-up named Octane AI. Yet even in their programmed responses, chatbots can convey human personality, said Christina Milian, a singer and actress who has been among the earliest proponents of the technology, and helped found Persona Technologies, an Octane competitor.\u201cI feel like it\u2019s personal,\u201d Ms. Milian said of her own chatbot. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely in my words. It\u2019s how I talk. My fans know how I talk.\u201dNot all celebrity bots are quite up to the level of verbal verisimilitude, however.

Matt Schlicht, Octane AI\u2019s chief executive, said that with more than a billion users, Messenger \u2014 the chat app connected to Facebook \u2014 was too large for celebrities to ignore. And once they are paying attention, his company\u2019s bots can help them make efficient use of it.\u201cRight now people are looking at bots and saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know, maybe they\u2019re cool, maybe not,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schlicht said. \u201cBut based on the data we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s not crazy to think that a year from now it\u2019s going to be their No. 1 distribution channel.\u201dChatbots have become a common part of online interaction for major consumer companies; Domino\u2019s, for example, lets customers use one to order a pizza. They have quickly spread since April of last year, when Facebook made it possible for developers to build bots on Messenger.The change made Messenger a more useful channel to broadcast information to numerous recipients, and for many artists and marketers it solved a frustrating problem: As Facebook has grown, its news feeds have become more crowded \u2014 not to mention pruned by algorithms \u2014 making it harder and harder to reach followers.Chris Mortimer, the head of digital marketing at Interscope, said Messenger was now a critical way for his artists to reach their fans.\u201cRight now, a Facebook Messenger inbox is what an email inbox was before the spammers got to it,\u201d he said.Maroon 5 also demonstrated its value for commercial research. In February, a day before the band released its single \u201cCold,\u201d it sent a 10-second clip of the song to its chatbot followers. Within 24 hours, fans sent 100,000 messages to the bot, and shared the clip widely on social media.\u201cYou can get pretty strong sentiment analysis in a snap,\u201d said Ben Parr, Octane AI\u2019s chief marketing officer.\u201cI hate the word bot,\u201d said Josh Bocanegra, Persona\u2019s chief executive, who founded the company with Ms. Milian. \u201cIt\u2019s never been associated with anything positive.\u201dOctane AI, which lets anyone use its technology to build a bot, does not charge for its services. The company is supported by $1.6 million from investors including the venture capital firm General Catalyst, and says it will introduce revenue-generating features soon.So far, the bots\u2019 ability to create interactions with pop stars \u2014 even if those interactions are programmed in computer code \u2014 has been enough to intrigue fans.\u201cI know it\u2019s a robot,\u201d Ms. Winett said. \u201cDoes it creep me out that it\u2019s a robot? No.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But this is problematic for home builders and real estate agents, who worry about it diminishing the importance of mortgage interest deduction.What\u2019s not included?\u2022 As of Tuesday, there was no $1 trillion infrastructure program, two of the people briefed on the proposal said.\u2022 There was also no border adjustment tax to offset the cost of the tax cuts.The final plans remained in flux as late as midafternoon Tuesday.The biggest unknown?

You know, the bad old days of the 2000s. While the TV renaissance has radically changed the mix \u2014 hello, superheroes, political soaps, brittle sitcoms \u2014 the crime drama hasn\u2019t gone away. And the rising tide has meant that it\u2019s often more interesting than it used to be, and present in greater variety.We\u2019re in a soft spot in the schedule at the moment \u2014 \u201cLegion\u201d is over with; \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d is not quite here \u2014 so why not check out some current examples of TV\u2019s most durable genre? A surreal Arctic thriller, a classic Los Angeles hard-boiled procedural and an operatic Mafia melodrama: Choose one or try all three. (Spoiler alert: Crucial details will be disclosed about the shows\u2019 earlier seasons.)Dennis Quaid joins the cast as a fishing boat captain named Lennox, in keeping with the show\u2019s odd scheme of having British and Scandinavian actors play the Norwegians, while Americans \u2014 Stanley Tucci in Season 1, and now Mr. Quaid \u2014 play characters who are apparently British.Also on Amazon, where its third 10-episode season went live last week, \u201cBosch\u201d couldn\u2019t be more different from \u201cFortitude.\u201d Resolutely naturalistic, and predictable in a way that\u2019s more reassuring than deflating, it\u2019s straight-up Los Angeles noir: a cop with a code (and, in this case, a cool hilltop house) seeking justice amid the moral squalor of Hollywood.The show, based on the novels of Michael Connelly, wears its heart pretty prominently on its sleeve, and sometimes it goes awfully far in its determination not to be flashy. It works because Detective Harry Bosch is embodied \u2014 in some absolute sense of the word \u2014 by Titus Welliver in a performance so natural and convincing that it\u2019s hard to imagine him playing anything else.It\u2019s a shaky one, though, and Ciro (Marco D\u2019Amore), the cool, calculating counterpart to the raging Genny, immediately gets back to work, figuring out how to eliminate everyone above him. (Four of the season\u2019s 12 episodes were available for review.) Ciro is about as anti as TV antiheroes get, and in Season 2, he\u2019s even more ruthless and violent.

{"Headline": "Trump Rides a Market Wave, but Business Looks for Results", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byThe investor enthusiasm that began with President Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in November has burst out anew on Wall Street, even as Washington remains gridlocked and evidence of any real pickup in the economy is scarce.Stocks have surged 5 percent since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. And that is on top of the 6 percent rally that followed his win in November.The cause for bullishness on Tuesday was Mr. Trump\u2019s new call to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent \u2014 deficits, perhaps, be damned.\u201cC.E.O.s are pragmatists,\u201d said Bill George, a Harvard Business School professor who formerly ran Medtronic, the giant medical-device maker. \u201cIf you cut my taxes and ease up on regulations, then I will like you. The bigger question is, can he get anything done?\u201dThe market impact of the Trump presidency is based so far on prospects \u2014 with details and congressional dynamics left to be sorted out \u2014 rather than accomplishments.But plenty of other factors are providing a tailwind for traders, including unexpectedly strong earnings reports from blue-chip companies like Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s and the receding chances that French voters will turn their backs on Europe.Technology giants like Apple, Facebook and Amazon have shown robust growth, lifting the Nasdaq index past 6,000 for the first time on Tuesday, a 26 percent gain from a year ago.Blair Effron, a founder of Centerview Partners, a prominent independent investment bank on Wall Street, said he believed that beyond any immediate policy shift in Washington, investors had taken their cue from signs of healthier growth globally.\u201cEurope and emerging markets are doing better,\u201d Mr. Effron said, \u201cand there is an underpinning of global stability and growth that are having much more of an impact than people think.\u201dNot all the signals domestically are coming in strong, however. The government\u2019s initial report on the economy\u2019s first-quarter performance is due Friday, and it is expected to be weak.And even if Mr. Trump manages to get Congress to pass a tax overhaul, and corporate profits then boom, that will not necessarily translate into better overall economic performance, warned Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago.\u201cWe have to distinguish between pro-profit and pro-growth policies,\u201d she said. \u201cA pro-profit approach increases the share of the pie going to corporate earnings and shareholders. Pro-growth policies increase the size of the pie.\u201dSo far, Ms. Swonk said, the Trump administration seems to favor the former. And while Wall Street will always reward rising corporate profits with higher share prices in the short term, the country\u2019s long-term prospects will be undermined if that trend is not accompanied by policies that lead to faster economic growth.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to cut taxes, but reform is harder,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about closing loopholes than reducing rates because if you just go to 15 percent, you\u2019re going to leave a large hole in the federal budget.\u201dWhile the prospects for a tax overhaul are murky on Capitol Hill, especially in light of the failure of House Republicans in March to agree on a replacement for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, executives say they are encouraged by the business-friendly stance of the White House.Bruce Van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, said he was initially concerned by Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements on trade and immigration when he took office in January.\u201cI feel better because in the first 100 days, the president\u2019s tone on those issues has moderated,\u201d Mr. Van Saun said.At the same time, executive actions, like requiring government agencies to roll back two existing regulations for every new one, have also played well with business leaders, especially in the financial services industry.\u201cThat\u2019s caused some of the regulatory apparatus to pause and appreciate there is a new sheriff in town and the rules of the game are changing,\u201d said Mr. Van Saun, who took over at Citizens, a regional banking chain based in Rhode Island, after more than two decades on Wall Street.What is more, Mr. Van Saun added, \u201cthe commitment to the positive elements of the platform \u2014 lower taxes, less regulation and pro-energy policies \u2014 continues to be there.\u201dEnergy industry executives are hoping that Mr. Trump will deliver on his promises to reduce regulation in their sector and open up new areas for drilling and development.\u201cIf you watch what he does as opposed to the noise around him, so far so good,\u201d said Charif Souki, chairman of Houston-based Tellurian and a leading industry spokesman for increasing natural gas exports from the United States.Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major oil and gas independent, echoed Mr. Souki\u2019s cautiously optimistic assessment of President Trump.\u201cI think generally he\u2019s doing well,\u201d Mr. Sheffield said. \u201cI think the Republicans have to get together and get something done.\u201dTo be sure, Mr. Trump has spent more time listening to business leaders in the first few months of his presidency than actually delivering on what they want.\u201cIn the first 100 days of his presidency, Trump has given more attention to C.E.O.s than Obama did in eight years,\u201d said Mr. George, who is not a supporter of Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat he does is a whole different story. But they do feel like he\u2019s listening, and there\u2019s a lot of ego gratification in having the president listen to you.\u201dIf the president cannot deliver, or the economy fails to pick up speed, investors may be setting themselves up for a fall, warned Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank.A look at the business backgrounds of Trump administration appointees and advisers.\u201cExpectations for the future are wild,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cThere is quite a disconnect between what the data suggests and where the stock market is trading.\u201dStill, even if it looks frothy, the euphoria is not approaching tech-bubble levels circa 2000.\u201cIn 2000, the price-to-earnings ratio for Nasdaq was 170; today it is trading at 26 times,\u201d Charlie Bilello, the director of research at the investment advisory firm Pension Partners, said, referring to a common gauge for measuring stock valuations. \u201cThat is not cheap, but it\u2019s not crazy. We are definitely not at the level where the average guy quits his job to trade stocks.\u201dThat may be true, but there is no doubt that the explosion in the market value of these companies has taken many investment professionals by surprise, even if most investors agree that their corporate fundamentals are solid.With the rollback of the health care law put off and big infrastructure spending plans still up in the air, bulls and bears alike on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms will be focused on the prospects for a tax overhaul in the coming months.But within the business community itself, there are sharp differences between industries that stand to gain and those that stand to lose as the tax code is redrawn.A low overall corporate tax rate would be great but would not be worth giving up provisions like the mortgage interest deduction or homeowners\u2019 ability to write off state and local taxes, said William E. Brown, the president of the National Association of Realtors.At the same time, smaller manufacturers and others worry that they might still be subject to a nearly 40 percent rate even if larger corporations use their political clout to guarantee a hefty cut.Suku V. Radia, the chief executive of Bankers Trust, Iowa\u2019s largest independently owned bank, said he was eager to learn more details, like the impact of a major tax cut on the budget deficit.\u201cIt is obviously a significant drop from where we are currently, and I\u2019d like to at least be able to better understand what do we do to make up for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the loss of revenues going to be, and how are we trying to fill the gap?\u201dWhatever details come out of the White House, getting a tax bill passed will be anything but easy.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is such a thing as \u2018tax simplification,\u2019\u201d Mr. Radia said. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently complicated.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019: A Newly Resonant Dystopia Comes to TV", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "The Hulu series, which stars Elisabeth Moss and is based on Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian novel, arrives with an unexpected resonance in Trump\u2019s America.Supported byBased on Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 dystopian novel, the series tells the story of a country reinvented: A violent religious coup has turned the United States into Gilead, a theocracy where women have been stripped of their rights and the more fertile conscripted into \u201chandmaids,\u201d forced to bear children for the elite. Though the protest scene was filmed last fall, and, like the series itself, conceived long before a dizzying election season and aftermath that have catapulted Ms. Atwood\u2019s book up the Amazon best-seller list, the television adaptation arrives with a newfound and unexpected resonance in Trump\u2019s America.The tonal dread and brutality of Ms. Atwood\u2019s novel are omnipresent in the series, but there are potential pitfalls to adapting a feminist touchstone so faithfully while also having to speak to a political moment the creators did not anticipate. Will fans of the novel want to subject themselves to 10 hours of immersion into their deep fears?It was still the Obama era when Hulu pursued the property two years ago, as part of a strategy to broaden its identity from a glorified video recorder to a producer of original programming. The showrunner Bruce Miller threw his hat in the ring when Ilene Chaiken, who had been developing the adaptation at MGM, departed for \u201cEmpire.\u201d A veteran writer-producer on shows including \u201cE.R.\u201d and \u201cEureka,\u201d Mr. Miller had been obsessed with the novel since reading it as an undergraduate at Brown, even having his agent continually check to see if the film or TV rights were available.\u201cOffred spoke to me,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cShe\u2019s in this nightmarish situation but she keeps her funny cynicism and sarcasm. She finds really interesting ways to pull levers of power and express herself.\u201dBut Mr. Miller wasn\u2019t a shoo-in for showrunner because producers were looking for a woman, he recalled. \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d has been a seminal rite-of-passage novel for many young women for over three decades; a feminist sacred text.\u201cIt\u2019s sacred to me, too,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a male or female story; it\u2019s a survival story.\u201dMGM and Hulu selected Mr. Miller after he pitched what he described as an adaptation grounded in a recognizable reality, and hewing closely to the book\u2019s first-person point of view through close-ups and Offred\u2019s Atwoodian voice-over. Structured like a thriller where no one can be trusted, the tense adaptation doesn\u2019t sanitize the book\u2019s cruelty either. Offred\u2019s daughter has been taken by the state, and she has become a possession \u201cOf-Fred,\u201d the Commander (Joseph Fiennes). The depths of his control and the horrific absence of hers are unflinchingly displayed when Offred lies impassively between the legs of the Commander\u2019s wife while enduring government-sactioned rape. Close-ups amplify the claustrophobia; Ms. Moss said that the camera sometimes came so near to her face that she would bump up against it.\u201cI was incredibly, and am still incredibly mindful, of the fact that I\u2019m a boy,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cYou always try to find people who support your deficits.\u201dTo that end, when Mr. Miller finished writing the first two episodes, he sent them to Ms. Atwood; she approved. He made sure his writing staff was almost entirely female, and hired women to direct all but two of the 10 episodes.Ms. Moss (\u201cMad Men\u201d) agreed to the part if she could be an active producer, weighing in on scripts and cuts. She pushed to hire the director Reed Morano (Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d movie) for the first three episodes.\u201cWe didn\u2019t pull back or lean in,\u201d Ms. Moss said. \u201cWe just tackled the story we intended to tell and that Margaret Atwood told in 1985. Behind the scenes we were kind of taking a deep breath and saying, \u2018Wow, this is becoming a bit close for comfort.\u2019 You\u2019re in a scene, and the character would say something and it would be a little more meaningful, a little more chilling, more resonant.\u201d Ms. Moss recalled being especially struck when a character said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t look up from our phones until it was too late.\u201dOn a suburban soundstage in January, Ms. Moss sat by the window in Offred\u2019s tiny room-cum-prison. To Atwood fans, the monastic set will be instantly recognizable as an early line from the novel: \u201cA chair, a table, a lamp.\u201d Ms. Moss was wrapped in a modest autumn-red gown, her head bubbled in a white bonnet, staring out the window silently. (\u201cThat\u2019s where the voice-over will go,\u201d Mr. Miller whispered, watching on a monitor.) Carved in the closet was the phrase left by the handmaid who preceded Offred, the one who hanged herself: \u201cNolite te bastardes carborundorum.\u201d Don\u2019t let the bastards grind you down.The edict was scrawled on signs at women\u2019s marches around the world in January, as were other nods to the book. Meanwhile, the debate over legislation to defund Planned Parenthood included frequent references to the measures as Handmaid-ian, and the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood said: \u201cWe\u2019re living \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s all publicity, true, a kind of pop-up grass-roots marketing that a new series on a streaming service trying to compete with Netflix and Amazon can only dream of. But these associations aren\u2019t exactly positive.Bleakness is a hurdle for any dystopia, an imaginary society of the worst kind that articulates anxieties about the world we\u2019re in now. Hulu\u2019s version of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d enters a cultural landscape crowded with the genre: A new film of \u201cBlade Runner\u201d will be released in the fall, and George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d is another retro best-seller, and scheduled for a run on Broadway this summer.The journalist Omar El Akkad has just released his first novel, a dystopia called \u201cAmerican War,\u201d and in an email, he wrote, \u201cI suspect the appetite for dystopian fiction reaches its peak not when things are at their worst, but when it looks like they\u2019re headed there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, we\u2019ve retained that darkness,\u201d Ms. Moss said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also been very important to us to show the hope that exists. At the heart of the story is a woman who has had everything taken away from her: her family, daughter, friends, rights, freedom \u2014 everything. And she will not give up.\u201dGilead is not technically a futuristic society, but a backward (or sideways) glance. Ms. Atwood is something of a scholar of Puritanism, and she said every horrific episode in the story happened somewhere in history already, whether stonings or enslavement, reproductive restrictions or forbidding women to read.\u201cThat will be my image forever,\u201d she deadpanned.Ms. Atwood, who was born in Canada, began writing the novel in \u2014 appropriately \u2014 1984, in West Berlin. At the time, the Christian evangelical movement was finding common ground in the United States with anti-porn feminists, and the ethics of surrogacy were hotly debated. Contemporary audiences are likely to shrug at surrogacy and gravitate toward identity politics instead, and the series subtly updates its feminist bona fides. Pornography was the locus of Gilead\u2019s anti-sex agenda in the book; in the series, the pious headmistress at the handmaid training center spits a mention of Tinder. There\u2019s intersectionality, too, with Moira, a lesbian, played by a black actress, Ms. Wiley. (In the novel, minorities have been shipped to so-called homelands in the Midwest.) In the book\u2019s flashbacks to the heroine\u2019s college days, Moira is writing a paper on \u201cdate rape\u201d; in the TV series, Offred\u2019s composing a paper on \u201ccampus sexual assault.\u201dThe tweak locates the story in the now, flicking at those who rail against collegiate feminist \u201csnowflakes\u201d with their \u201csafe spaces\u201d and \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d \u2014 viewers are invited to recognize a new iteration of \u201980s Moral Majority scorn.But these are small details, and fans will immediately identify the familiar \u201cfeminist dystopia,\u201d as the book is frequently tagged in academia. Ms. Atwood, on the phone from her Toronto home, interrogated the phrase. \u201cWhen you say \u2018feminist\u2019 do you mean: Should women have the same rights as other human beings? Then, yes. But what else do we mean by that term? Do we mean women are angelically more perfect than men? Well, no. Women are human beings. That can be a plus or a minus.\u201dWell, what about the dystopia part? \u201cOh, I\u2019ll put up my hand for that.\u201d\u201cRight after the Iron Curtain came down, people were saying: It\u2019s the end of history \u2014 tra la la! All is well! At those times, dystopia is less chord striking because it seems less possible,\u201d Ms. Atwood said.So perhaps our hunger for the genre serves as catharsis for those in difficult times, which may bode well for Hulu, at least.Almost accidentally, the new \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d enters the culture as its own kind of Offred-like resistance, pushing back against a reality that somehow got ahead of the show\u2019s own imagination. On set in January, several people were wearing a uniform of sorts, as if enlisted: baseball hats that Ms. Moss had bought and distributed. Inscribed on them: Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.An article last Sunday about a new television series based on Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 novel \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d misstated the novel\u2019s opening line. It is \u201cWe slept in what had once been the gymnasium\u201d \u2014 not \u201cA chair, a table, a lamp.\u201d (That is the first sentence of the second chapter.)Advertisement"}

(Sedated sleep \u2014 hello Ambien \u2014 has been shown to be as deleterious as poor sleep.)\u201cSleep is the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body,\u201d Dr. Walker of U.C. Berkeley said. \u201cWe have a saying in medicine: What gets measured, gets managed.\u201dSleep entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley and beyond have poured into the sleep space, as branders like to say \u2014 a $32 billion market in 2012 \u2014 formerly inhabited by old-style mattress and pharmaceutical companies.\u201cI can see sleep being another weapon in competitive parenting and career-building,\u201d Ms. Salzman said. \u201cIf you want your child to succeed, do you have to buy them these sleep devices? Sleep is personal, it\u2019s class, not mass, and now the sleep industry is based on technical services, customized for me. It\u2019s a bizarre marriage of high tech and low tech. Chamomile tea is going to have a resurgence, as the antithesis to the whole pharma thing.\u201dThe familiar paradigm of success used to center on the narrative of the short sleeper: Corporate titans and world leaders \u2014 like Martha Stewart and our last two presidents \u2014 counted abbreviated rest as proof of their prowess. It turns out that short sleepers, as they are known, may have a genetic mutation, as Arianna Huffington pointed out in her 2016 book, \u201cThe Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life One Night at a Time.\u201d(It\u2019s worth noting that George W. Bush, formerly a sleep outlier among his presidential peers for clocking in around nine hours of nightly shut-eye, along with a daily nap, is newly popular.)But the growing pile of apps, gizmos and gurus \u2014 some from unlikely corners \u2014 has led to \u201cpandemonium in the bedroom,\u201d Ms. Rothstein said.Start by turning off the lights (yes, that includes you, Mr. Phone) and saying your prayers. Then you can move on to more newfangled techniques.\u201cI don\u2019t know where this is leading,\u201d Mr. Bridges said the other day, \u201cbut I\u2019m steeping myself in the subject. We\u2019re working on something called Sleep Club, which will be sort of a hub for all things sleep related.\u201dMr. Mercier sent me his Dreem headset, a weighty crown of rubber and wire that he warned would be a tad uncomfortable. The finished product, about $400, he said, will be much lighter and slimmer. But it wasn\u2019t the heft of the thing that had me pulling it off each night. It skeeved me out that it was reading \u2014 and interfering with \u2014 my brain waves, a process I would rather not outsource.I was just as wary of the Re-Timer goggles, $299, which make for a goofy/spooky selfie in a darkened room. My eye sockets glowed a deep fluorescent green, and terrified the cat.The Ghost Pillow, $85, has \u201cpatent-pending thermo-sensitivity technology\u201d designed to keep your head cool. It is wildly comfy, but when I read what it is made from, a polyurethane foam, I lost sleep. I bought a Good Night Light LED Sleep bulb, $28, which comes with its own \u201cpatented technology\u201d to support your body\u2019s melatonin production. I can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s what happened, but since the bulb is too dim for my middle-aged eyes, I struggled to read my go-to sleep aid, a worn copy of \u201cThe Pursuit of Love,\u201d by Nancy Mitford, and knocked off a good half-hour earlier than usual. I was up again at 3 a.m., however, as my new Sense pod alerted me the next day, through an app on my phone. And again at 5 a.m., when the cat swatted the pod off the night stand and it glowed red in protest. \u201cThere was a noise disturbance,\u201d the app explained.My so-called sleep summary, as provided by Sense, was both compelling and off-putting. Why is my air quality \u201cnot ideal\u201d? And how comfortable am I sharing my sleep habits with a Silicon Valley start-up?Ms. Rothstein, the sleep ambassador, is less bothered by privacy concerns than by the temptation to wakefulness that phone interfaces pose. And nearly every gizmo seemed to have one.\u201cI\u2019d like to have a survey done to show how many people are also reading their texts while they\u2019re tracking their sleep,\u201d Ms. Rothstein said. \u201cIf you want to improve your sleep, you have to make some changes. Your Fitbit and your Apple Watch are not going to do it for you. We\u2019ve lost the simplicity of sleep. All this writing, all these websites, all this stuff. I\u2019m thinking, Just sleep. I want to say: \u2018Shh. Make it dark, quiet and cool. Take a bath.\u2019\u201dMs. Rothstein taught me her relaxation recipe, a practice that mixed gratitude with body awareness and breathing. Start with your toes, she said, and thank your body parts for their hard work. (My favorite: \u201cKnees, I know it\u2019s not always easy for you. You can rest now.\u201d)Mr. Keledjian, a meditator, aims to make the practice both secular and modern: a \u201cmindful luxury,\u201d he said. Though there are human \u201cfacilitators\u201d in each class, who gently touch the feet of snoring attendees if they get too loud, the practice is guided by a recording made by an Australian female member of Mr. Keledjian\u2019s company. \u201cWe call her \u2018Skye,\u2019\u201d he said. It was lunchtime on a rainy Tuesday, and I settled onto a soft mat outfitted with a bolster, a pillow and a cozy fleece blanket. \u201cSkye\u201d urged me to stay awake, and then delivered a script like Ms. Rothstein\u2019s, in mellifluous antipodean tones. I drifted once or twice, and from the muffled snorts of the other attendees, they did too. That night, I slept until dawn.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When in the Amazon, Please Do Not Punch the Dolphins", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byWhen I recently went on a boat tour in the Janauari Ecological Reserve, near the meeting of waters, the boatman asked if I would also like to visit a family of ribeirinhos (riverside dwellers) who have a caiman, a sloth and a snake. \u201cYou can take selfies with the animals, and later give them some gratification,\u201d he told me, euphemistically suggesting tips for the people who keep the animals. I vociferously declined.We resumed our navigation on the small motorboat through cool, peaceful igarap\u00e9s (forest streams) leading to dazzling igap\u00f3s (swampy, flooded forests). It seemed as if a dam had ruptured somewhere and the place was about to be submerged. Trees as high as buildings were half drowned by the river. The boatman became less talkative, as if I\u2019d offended him by refusing his last offer. I enjoyed the scenery; there was no need to hug illegally domesticated sloths.Brazil still has a long way to go in the field of ecotourism. While in some places, as on the island of Fernando de Noronha, in the northeast, the rules concerning wildlife preservation are strict, in others there is less attention to long-term conservation and the ecological and social impact of tourism, often leading to the pure and simple exploitation of animals, as well as local people and their cultures.A few years ago, a commission of federal agencies and research institutes issued local guidelines for the activity \u2014 including the amount of food to be offered and the requirement that only tour guides could feed the dolphins \u2014 but few people adhere to them. According to the owner of one flutuante, tourists must only avoid touching the dolphin\u2019s blowhole. (Please!)There\u2019s no federal legislation prohibiting feeding and touching the dolphins. As a result, their behavior has already changed: Many now survive on the frozen fish provided by tourism groups. They\u2019re also conditioned to stay close to the flutuantes and to humans. According to researchers, aggression is now common among the dolphins.Another popular activity in the Brazilian Amazon is caiman-spotting. In the evening, groups of people cruise the riverbanks, seeking out the huge nocturnal lizards that resemble crocodiles. It wouldn\u2019t be disruptive if so many guides didn\u2019t make a point of jumping in the water to grab the caimans and hold them up for photos.All of these activities take advantage of a lack of clear laws governing ecotourism and the use of natural resources. Tour operators promote packages by using questionable environmentalist phrases. One advertises \u201cecological fishing\u201d; another promises to have the federal environmental agency\u2019s authorization to take tourists swimming with dolphins. That\u2019s enough for most people visiting the Amazon \u2014 even if it\u2019s not true. The local people who keep wild animals as pets to lure tourists often claim that they release the animals at night and recapture them in the morning.Animals are not the only ones being abused. Another popular activity in Manaus is a visit to an indigenous community formed by five ethnic groups (Dessana, Tukana, Tuyuca, Wanana and Tatuia), which some tour operators deceitfully describe as a \u201ctribe.\u201d Since the beginning of the last century, the indigenous people, who are perhaps Brazil\u2019s most marginalized and impoverished population, have migrated (or been expelled) from their original lands. (And I\u2019m talking only about the small remnant left after the genocides that started with the arrival of the Portuguese.) They stage traditional music and dance performances for the guests of expensive jungle lodges.Indigenous people are often forced by their employers to meet tourists\u2019 stereotypes: the romantic, noble savage with slightly frightening rituals and no refrigerator. But that\u2019s not the worst part. Indigenous people didn\u2019t know that some of their bosses have traditional practices of their own: For five years, 34 Tariano people worked for a jungle lodge in exchange for only leftover food and a collective paycheck of $30 per performance. Others are not even paid and instead rely on selling handicrafts and jewelry to the visitors. There is no industry-standard agreement on the fair share of revenues for indigenous groups, and again, no federal regulation. It seems nothing will change until indigenous people themselves have the means to control all aspects of the experience they offer to tourists \u2014 and also reap the profits.On the other hand, many jungle lodges and tour operators are becoming more aware of these issues. Environmentally conscious tourists are also pushing for changes. The sustainable Uakari Lodge in the Mamirau\u00e1 Reserve, for example, is run by members of the local community. So maybe there is some progress.In another jungle lodge called Anavilhanas, better attuned to an environmental conscience, I\u2019ve enjoyed the most jaw-dropping tour of my trip: a simple kayak expedition through igarap\u00e9s and igap\u00f3s, stopping here and there to watch birds, monkeys and spiders at a distance. In the Amazon, there\u2019s no need to do more than that.Vanessa Barbara, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of two novels and two nonfiction books in Portuguese.Advertisement"}

Pretty straightforward, yes. Intrepid or surprising, not in the least.Not all of the documentaries are so cinephile-oriented, but this is a site that rewards buffs capable of appreciating the tendrils of its library and how it\u2019s organized. Returning to \u201cAction/Adventure,\u201d the selection under that rubric reflects a wide and arguably generous interpretation of the category.

But thinking about how one of that film\u2019s characters, a street hustler played by Juliet Berto, struggles with identity questions throughout her story line, it occurred to me that perhaps I had been looking at the film narrowly.\u201cWe\u2019re always having interesting arguments internally about genre and tagging systems.\u201d she said. \u201cDoes one category contain too many films or not enough films is one aspect of the discussion. But often times where we place a given film offers an opportunity for conversation with the film community of both subscribers and nonsubscribers who look at the editorial and social part of the site, or on the Facebook page. We want to make the experience not just about viewing, but connecting with other film lovers.\u201dAlso contributing to what Ms. Gendler calls a \u201conce you get there, it\u2019s hard to leave\u201d aim, the site features monthly \u201cSpotlights,\u201d which gather library films under occasionally timely topics. February, for instance, featured 2017 Oscar nominees, with work by Mr. Jenkins; Mr. Chazelle; and Maren Ade, whose \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d was a nominee for best foreign language film.Sometimes the topics are just topics, as in last month\u2019s \u201cTwenty Something,\u201d with titles from Bertrand Blier\u2019s corrosive bad-boys-on-the-road \u201cGoing Places\u201d (co-starring a young and hunky G\u00e9rard Depardieu in 1974) to Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cStarlet\u201d (2012), about an aimless young woman in the fringes of California\u2019s porn industry (a very fringy place to be). This month, a nod to the Tribeca Film Festival comes in the form of a \u201cNew York films\u201d spotlight.The company is expanding into the funding and production of original documentary shorts \u2014 one of which, \u201cGut Hack,\u201d is having a premiere as a New York Times Op-Doc on Monday, April 10 \u2014 and anticipating more good things from a deal with Amazon, offering the service at a slightly reduced rate for Amazon Video subscribers. (Fandor\u2019s stand-alone monthly fee is $10.) \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful for us,\u201d Ms Gendler said. \u201cAny platform wants more growth.

The company is still scrambling to compete with Amazon and recover from steep losses from its digital Nook business. And despite some encouraging signs that the physical bookstore market has stabilized, Barnes & Noble has struggled to reverse sales and revenue declines.\u201cThe biggest challenge is the sales performance; that\u2019s no secret,\u201d Mr. Parneros said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out ways to change things up a little bit and increase traffic.\u201dHe was optimistic about other aspects of the business, including the loyalty of its customer base and the possibility of increasing sales and traffic by expanding further into educational games, toys and gifts.He was also enthusiastic about the company\u2019s new concept stores. In an attempt to update the look and feel of its stores and experiment with new ways of attracting customers, Barnes & Noble has opened three concept stores \u2014 in Minnesota, California and New York \u2014 that are sleeker and brighter and have full-service restaurants that serve wine and beer. Two more such stores are in development, in Virginia and Texas.James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester, said Barnes & Noble needed to innovate to survive, and quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be that mass brand in every mall anymore because malls are gone,\u201d he said.Mr. Parneros has virtually no experience in book sales, and he said he had undertaken a crash course in the business in the last few months.Born in Cyprus, Mr. Parneros moved to New York City when he was in elementary school and spoke no English when he arrived. He attended New York University and joined Staples, the office supplies company, in 1987, when it had just four stores. He rose to president of Staples North American Stores and online, overseeing 1,800 stores and the web business.Before he joined Barnes & Noble in November, he visited dozens of stores around the country to get a feel for the company. In his five months as chief operating officer, he spent a lot of time with Mr. Riggio, he said.Mr. Riggio, who has been heavily involved in designing the concept stores and reorienting the company since Mr. Boire\u2019s departure, will stay on as chairman.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Woo Young Moviegoers, AMC Thinks More Like McDonald\u2019s", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Adam Aron, the chief executive of AMC Theaters, the largest multiplex chain in the world, sat in a hotel suite here last month and sang the praises of a new menu item he called \u201cthe Bavarian Beast.\u201dIt\u2019s a pound-and-a-half salted pretzel the size of a steering wheel. \u201cThere\u2019s also a new jalape\u00f1o-flavored Southwestern dog that\u2019s to die for,\u201d he said. But Mr. Aron was most effusive about another new AMC offering, a juicy chicken sandwich with waffles as buns.\u201cSounds fattening just to hear it described,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201clet alone when you eat it.\u201dPopcorn, candy and soda? How quaint. The concession counter at your local AMC is about to turn into a full-fledged fast-food restaurant.It\u2019s part of a strategy to attract younger audiences and stay relevant in the streaming age of HBO Go, Netflix and Amazon Prime. While small theater companies like the 25-location Alamo Drafthouse have been offering full-restaurant cinemas for years \u2014 AMC itself already operates a 60-location chainlet of Dine-In Theaters \u2014 this effort will bring greatly expanded menus to more than 400 theaters in the United States.Beating its national competitors to the punch, AMC Feature Fare will include cheeseburger sliders, four types of stone-fired pizza, chili dogs, salami bites, chicken tenders, three new popcorn flavors and \u2014 for the health-conscious \u2014 seven gluten-free snacks.\u201cAnd, yes, we now have a curly fry in the portfolio,\u201d said Nels Storm, AMC\u2019s senior culinary director, sounding like a proud papa. \u201cWe wanted to think more like a restaurant company.\u201d Mr. Storm promoted the offerings as the most important advancement in multiplex concessions since the invention of the armrest cup holder.AMC Feature Fare, which will begin rolling out nationwide this summer, comes with risks, starting with the cost of installing equipment and retraining staff. Mr. Aron said AMC planned to spend $700 million on theater upgrades in 2017. (That includes improvements well beyond food, including reclining seats.)Some patrons may not be thrilled to find themselves seated within sniffing distance of those curly fries and salami snacks. (Talk about Smell-O-Vision.)\u201cTime to pack a bottle of ketchup in my purse, I guess,\u201d Jeanine Basinger, founder of Wesleyan University\u2019s film studies program, said with a dose of sarcasm. \u201cAnd wet wipes.\u201dBut Mr. Aron, who took over AMC in 2015 after serving as chief executive of Starwood Hotels & Resorts, has made giving the masses what they want a hallmark of his early tenure. In many ways, food is the last component. AMC has already been aggressively installing advanced Dolby sound and projection systems, extra-wide screens, and La-Z-Boy-style seats. AMC now serves alcohol in roughly 200 of its 660 domestic theaters, with plans to add 100 more this year.Even so, AMC cannot stand pat. Over all, domestic attendance was flat last year at 1.32 billion. Under pressure to increase profits, multiplex chains can increase ticket prices only so much before driving attendance down. That means the concession counter must work harder. Analysts say tens of millions of patrons buy tickets but never snacks.Mr. Aron, who was in Las Vegas for the annual CinemaCon movie-theater owners convention, noted that AMC\u2019s culinary staff had spent a year testing ideas for menu items at the company\u2019s headquarters in Leawood, Kan.It\u2019s trickier than you might imagine, said Mr. Storm, the culinary director.\u201cYou have to be able eat in the dark while still paying attention to Hugh Jackman doing something crazy,\u201d Mr. Storm said.The AMC Feature Fare team also thought about smell. In some cases, Mr. Storm said, the goal \u2014 as with popping popcorn \u2014 is actually to create an I\u2019ll-have-what-they\u2019re-having waft.\u201cIf it\u2019s a smell that we feel will complement the experience,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will promote it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is American Retail at a Historic Tipping Point?", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byAlong the cobblestone streets of SoHo, Chanel handbags and Arc\u2019teryx jackets are displayed in shops like museum pieces, harking back to the height of the neighborhood\u2019s trendiness. But rents there are softening, and the number of vacant storefronts is rising.Today, some of the most sought-after real estate by retailers is not in SoHo, but five miles away in Red Hook, a gritty Brooklyn enclave with a shipbuilding past. E-commerce merchants are vying to lease part of a huge warehouse space, spanning 11 acres, that would allow them to deliver goods the same day they\u2019re ordered online.The profound reordering of New York\u2019s shopping scene reflects a broad restructuring in the American retail industry.E-commerce players, led by the industry giant Amazon, have made it so easy and fast for people to shop online that traditional retailers, shackled by fading real estate and a culture of selling in stores, are struggling to compete. This shift has been building gradually for years. But economists, retail workers and real estate investors say it appears that it has sped up in recent months.Between 2010 and 2014, e-commerce grew by an average of $30 billion annually. Over the past three years, average annual growth has increased to $40 billion.\u201cThat is the tipping point, right there,\u201d said Barbara Denham, a senior economist at Reis, a real estate data and analytics firm. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Doppler effect. The change is coming at you so fast, it feels like it is accelerating.\u201dThis transformation is hollowing out suburban shopping malls, bankrupting longtime brands and leading to staggering job losses.More workers in general merchandise stores have been laid off since October, about 89,000 Americans. That is more than all of the people employed in the United States coal industry, which President Trump championed during the campaign as a prime example of the workers who have been left behind in the economic recovery.The job losses in retail could have unexpected social and political consequences, as huge numbers of low-wage retail employees become economically unhinged, just as manufacturing workers did in recent decades. About one out of every 10 Americans works in retail.\u201cThere is a sea change happening in the retail industry,\u201d said Mark Cohen, a former executive at Sears, who now runs the retail studies program at Columbia Business School. \u201cAnd that is bringing a sea change in employment.\u201dStore closures, meanwhile, are on pace this year to eclipse the number of stores that closed in the depths of the Great Recession of 2008. Back then Americans, mired in foreclosures and investment losses, retrenched away from buying stuff.The current torrent of closures comes as consumer confidence is strong and unemployment is low, suggesting that a permanent restructuring is underway, rather than a dip in the normal business cycle. In short, traditional retail may never recover.The reordering should come as no surprise to anyone who has enjoyed the instant gratification of receiving that book or garden hose within 24 hours of ordering it. Or to anyone who has encountered the tired-looking mannequins and haggard sales associates at many department stores.Modern-day retail is becoming unrecognizable from the glory era of the department store in the years after World War II. In that period, newly built highways shuttling people to and from the suburbs eventually gave rise to shopping malls \u2014 big, convenient, climate-controlled monuments to consumerism with lots of parking.Over time, malls grew to be the size of indoor cities. Minnesota\u2019s Mall of America opened in 1992 with a footprint so large that it could fit nine Yankee Stadiums inside.Now, many of these once celebrated malls are emptying out or being turned into trampoline parks and community colleges. \u201cThe retail industry built too much space,\u201d said Bruce Batkin, chief executive of Terra Capital Partners, a commercial real estate lender.Last week, Mr. Batkin got a call from a landlord looking to refinance his shopping center with a 10-year loan. Mr. Batkin passed on the deal because it was too difficult to predict what might happen to occupancy in the property 10 years from now.\u201cThings are changing so fast in retail that a year needs to be measured in dog years,\u201d he said.Still, there are many investors who are not giving up on the notion that online retail and traditional stores can coexist and even thrive together. Retailers have hoped that their traditional stores, by offering catchy displays and top-notice service, can lure shoppers away from their screens. Some of the best evidence that brick-and-mortar retail is still viable may be Amazon\u2019s experimentation with operating physical stores of its own.In reality, however, some workers say that they will often spend time helping out a customer on the shop floor, only to have that person leave the store and order a product online. That often hits salespeople in the wallet: Many are paid on commission, but only on sales they complete in person in the store.At Bloomingdale\u2019s, employees who are members of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union are arguing that the company should improve how sales staff are compensated for helping facilitate e-commerce business \u2014 like helping customers pick up goods in the store that were ordered online.\u201cYou want an in-store experience that will make customers want to come into the store,\u201d the union president, Stuart Appelbaum, said. \u201cThat requires highly motivated employees.\u201dA Bloomingdale\u2019s spokeswoman said the company is negotiating with the union over a new contract in \u201cgood faith\u201d and was taking steps to invest in its work force..The retail industry has always had its ups and downs. Workers frequently hop from one store to another, as styles and brands fall out of fashion. But even to many experienced retail workers, who are used to losing their jobs based on the seasons, this downturn feels different.Hilda Awuor, 27, lost her job at the Saks Fifth Avenue store in Lower Manhattan last month. After bouncing between jobs in different clothing stores, she said she is now done with retail and is trying to find a different career entirely.\u201cI really like helping customers create a new style,\u201d said Ms. Awuor, who was paid $16 an hour. \u201cBut there is no job security anymore.\u201dSome economists say this is how the market is supposed to work. After the recession, retail hiring was a big driver of the recovery. But now that the economy is stronger, retail workers theoretically should be pushed out into potentially higher paying jobs that offer more chances to create wealth.\u201cThis is creative destruction at its best,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWe are downsizing a part of the economy that is uncompetitive. While painful for those in the middle of it, this is how we grow and wealth is created.\u201dBut Mr. Cohen, of Columbia University, said the upending of an entire industry will not be so tidy. Warehouses like the one in Red Hook typically employ a few hundred people, according to Sitex Group, a private equity firm that is expected to close on the property in a few weeks.While these distribution centers could replace some of the work lost in stores, they likely won\u2019t make up the entire difference. That is because much of the operations are automated and require different skills and sensibilities than selling jeans.\u201cThere is a rolling crisis that has emerged in the last couple of years as store closings are being announced,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cPeople are losing their jobs and have no other place to go.\u201cTheoretically this is the marketplace rationalizing itself, but in the interim how do people survive?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Special Ops With a Studious Bent Fight Destruction of Brazil\u2019s Amazon", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byAlto Turia\u00e7u JournalALTO TURIA\u00c7U INDIAN TERRITORY, Brazil \u2014 Deep in the Amazon jungle, a squad of nerds is on the loose.One of its members spent more than a decade as an environmental activist for a tree-hugging nonprofit. Another studied Arctic oceanography in Germany. Their commander is a former high school science teacher.But together they have forged one of Latin America\u2019s most feared elite fighting units, on the front lines of Brazil\u2019s struggle to curb the destruction of the Amazon.The team\u2019s commander, Roberto Cabral, laughed when I asked him recently how his assemblage of Special Ops nerds came together.\u201cIn the universe of illegal activities in Amazonia, there\u2019s deforestation, gold prospecting, bush meat hunting, clandestine logging and animal smuggling,\u201d said Mr. Cabral, 48, who was shot in the shoulder in 2015 while pursuing gunmen who were razing tracts of forest. \u201cWe wanted to combat these dealings with brains as well as boots on the ground.\u201dI went on a grueling patrol in March with the nine-member unit, which has the decidedly unglamorous name of Grupo Especializado de Fiscaliza\u00e7\u00e3o, or Specialized Inspection Group.Facing such logistical obstacles, GEF, which operates as part of Ibama, Brazil\u2019s environmental protection agency, usually patrols in helicopters, using satellite images and intelligence gathered through Ibama\u2019s regional offices, to detect deforestation and signs of illegal mining.But even as GEF relies on cutting-edge technology, its missions often resemble an elusively frustrating game of cat and mouse.On the first day that I accompanied an operation in Maranh\u00e3o State on the fringes of the Amazon, members of the unit rose at 3 a.m.Clad in combat fatigues, body armor and bulletproof helmets, they strapped Taurus assault rifles around their shoulders and journeyed for hours in four-wheel-drive pickup trucks along potholed roads from S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, the state capital, to Santa In\u00eas, an outpost in the interior.Then they waited for the weather to improve.Heavy rain prevented the unit\u2019s two Bell helicopters from taking off for patrols over Maranh\u00e3o and the vast neighboring state of Par\u00e1. After hours of standing by, the choppers finally lifted off around midday, flying for monotonously long stretches over lands cleared for cattle ranching.\u201cYou have to see the Amazon from above to get a sense of how much of it has already been devastated,\u201d said Maur\u00edcio Brichta, 44, an oceanographer who specialized in studying Arctic algae at Germany\u2019s Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research before joining Ibama.\u201cAs you can imagine,\u201d he added with a grin, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t much demand in Brazil for expertise in the Arctic regions.\u201dLike nearly everyone else in the unit \u2014 which includes forestry engineers, a wildlife biologist, a fisheries specialist, even someone who used to work in advertising \u2014 Mr. Brichta said he never expected to take up arms to protect the Amazon.Before this phase in his life, he was a stay-at-home father in Jakarta and New York, cities where his ex-wife was stationed as a diplomat for Brazil\u2019s Foreign Ministry.After returning to Brazil, Mr. Brichta said he was drawn to Ibama by the agency\u2019s sense of idealism and the strides it had made in lowering deforestation rates from alarmingly high levels at the start of the previous decade.When GEF was created, he made the cut by completing a punishing survival course in which candidates endure jumping out of helicopters, protracted treks through the jungle, foraging for food, treating snakebites, going for long stretches without food and sleep, and training for gun battles and knife fights.\u201cObviously, this kind of work isn\u2019t for everybody,\u201d said Eduardo Rafael de Souza, 39, a bearded, chain-smoking military veteran who often pilots the helicopters used for GEF\u2019s missions.But environmental activists argue that a major reason for resurgent deforestation in Brazil involves efforts to reduce Ibama\u2019s sway, drawing parallels with the Trump administration\u2019s plans to overhaul the Environmental Protection Agency. Since 2013, Ibama\u2019s budget was slashed by about 46 percent.Either way, GEF\u2019s fortunes shifted on the second day of their patrol.\u201cI saw their helicopter land in a clearing, like a scene out of some Hollywood movie,\u201d said Francinaldo Martins Ara\u00fajo, 43, who was arriving in his truck to buy scraps of discarded timber from the sawmill as the unit swooped down for its raid.Members of the squad, some hiding their faces behind balaclavas out of fear of retribution if their identities are made public, quickly went to work. They set the sawmill on fire and destroyed two domed furnaces used to make charcoal, before setting out again in the helicopters for their next target.A few minutes later, they hit pay dirt again when one of the pilots observed a truck on a logging road. The unit jumped out of the choppers in a nearby clearing, as one member punctured the truck\u2019s fuel tank and set the vehicle on fire.Then the shouting came from the forest. While searching for the logging crew, two GEF members stumbled across a tractor used for hauling felled trees. A chain saw, still warm from being used minutes earlier, was left stuck in a tree, evidence of a hasty getaway.The unit set fire to the tractor and chain saw before resuming the search for the loggers. Nerves were on edge. It was on such an operation in a nearby jungle that Mr. Cabral, GEF\u2019s commander, was taken by surprise by a fleeing logger and wounded by gunfire.No shots were fired this time, but the loggers managed to elude the squad, fleeing into the forest. A pilot radioed the coordinates of the exfiltration point and the unit started the long trek back to the choppers in humidity so thick it felt as if they could slice through it with their hunting knives.Drenched in sweat as they boarded the helicopters, the squad could see the smoke billowing from the destroyed vehicles, a small victory in the battle against deforestation.\u201cI never dreamed that I would hold a rifle in my hands to defend the Amazon,\u201d said one 44-year-old GEF member, a former environmental activist who declined to disclose his name because of security fears. \u201cBut this is war, and war can open your eyes to what needs to be done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If the boss doesn\u2019t care about accountability, why should anyone else?Here\u2019s a good reason: Unlike the president, for whom conflict of interest laws don\u2019t apply, staff members could go to jail for actions that affect their financial interests.The Office of Government Ethics spent months pushing Senate-confirmed nominees to resolve the potential conflicts in their disclosures, because they won\u2019t get a hearing, and therefore their jobs, without it. But it has more limited power with Mr. Trump\u2019s White House employees, who did not face a Senate vote. The ethics office reviews these disclosures and can raise red flags as a condition for certifying them. But the White House released them before the ethics office could do so, leaving many questions unanswered.White House employees are required to file the disclosures within 30 days of taking their posts. Most of them blew that deadline, and many missed extended deadlines as well. So how did these officials manage their business dealings during the months they avoided disclosing them?Kellyanne Conway\u2019s filing indicates she still has a financial interest in her firm, the polling company/WomanTrend. Is she recusing herself from White House initiatives that could benefit her company and clients?There may be legitimate answers. But the White House has provided none and has no legal responsibility to do so.Mr. Trump has boasted about bans on lobbying by executive branch officials, but the White House staff can be granted waivers from any ethical restrictions with no reason given and no disclosure of who gets them. The entire White House could be exempt and Americans would never know it.If the administration were committed to \u201can ethical and transparent government,\u201d Friday\u2019s releases would be a first step in an extensive, public examination of these officials\u2019 holdings, followed by steps to avoid potentially criminal conflicts. We\u2019ll be watching \u2014 but we won\u2019t hold our breath.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Meaning of Fast Fashion", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byUnbuttonedHow fast is fast enough when it comes to clothes and gratification? How much do you really need that dress or bag or platform sandal?I don\u2019t often hear Simon & Garfunkel tunes playing in the back of my mind (unless I am in a Parisian subway and yet another busker is singing \u201cThe Boxer\u201d), but now I can\u2019t get the opening line of \u201cThe 59th Street Bridge Song\u201d out of my head. \u201cSlow down, you move too fast.\u201d Yadda yadda yadda.Farfetch, Net-a-Porter, Matchesfashion.com and other higher-end retail sites have been offering same-day service in world capitals and vacation destinations for a while now (and Matchesfashion offers 90-minute delivery in London), but the Gucci deal takes it to a whole new level. And while it is, for now, more of a niche offering than a rule, it\u2019s easy to imagine it snowballing to other brands and platforms, as the Great Race for Retail Domination (and Survival) heats up, online and off.\u201cFaster fulfillment\u201d is the mantra of the moment, a response by companies to what has been called the culture of impatience. But I can\u2019t help wondering if at least when it comes to designer fashion \u2014 the clothes that define a particular moment in time and often filter down to shape the styles of every day \u2014 it\u2019s solving a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. And maybe creating a new one.I understand that we live in a world where, as Mr. Neves pointed out, no one waits for cabs or groceries or tables in restaurants, where information is immediate and pictures go viral. I understand that the millennials and Gen Y-ers are (theoretically) the IWWIWWIWI generations \u2014 the \u201cI want what I want when I want it\u201d folks. Conventional wisdom goes that if retailers miss that moment of wanting, they miss the sale. I recognize that defying this seems like the classic behavior of a Luddite. But along the way we have lost some perspective.\u201cWhy should we lose face with Amazon?\u201d Mr. Neves said when we were talking. But another question might be: Why should we assume Amazon controls this particular playing field? It may be time to call, well, time on this game of one-upmanship.A handbag is not a bottle of milk for a baby. It\u2019s not a staple. And it\u2019s not necessarily a good idea to create a situation in which it is equated to one. It may not be sustainable, in any sense of the word.Because in treating investment fashion \u2014 which is to say fashion that takes time to create and consumers to understand (and often, desire) \u2014 as a commodity, you risk changing how people think about it, and value it, in an essential way. It is true that no one is forcing consumers to opt for the fastest delivery (you can have your jacket in two days if you want, or even a full week), but the sheer fact that the option exists makes the decision seem, somehow, less of a commitment.Besides, just because consumers say they want something \u2014 and according to Mr. Neves, timely delivery is the No. 1 criterion for online shopping in every consumer survey Farfetch has done \u2014 doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a crucial determinant of their behavior.Just consider the recent, somewhat abortive, move to change the fashion show schedule to the \u201csee now, buy now\u201d model. The rationale behind the change was almost exactly the same as the one behind super-speedy delivery: Everyone has a truncated attention span because of Instagram, and if you don\u2019t get a product to customers as soon as they feel desire for it, you miss your window.Indeed, when it comes to investment fashion, as opposed to what we formerly called fast fashion (which perhaps now will have to be rechristened \u201cquick turnover fashion\u201d or some such), there is value in having to wait, which should not be dismissed.By conflating investment fashion with, effectively, groceries, you undermine its claims of specialness, effort and creative muscle \u2014 all the criteria on which it is built and which justify, in many ways, its price. You link it to the idea of disposability (which, let\u2019s face it, is the definition of what was normally called fast fashion, a sector in which it is often cheaper to buy a new shirt, say, than to clean the one you already own). If investment suggests value over time, reducing the time reduces the value. Put another way: There is a downside to rushing to fulfill the wants of today; it suggests they may not be the wants of tomorrow.At a certain point it\u2019s hard not to wonder if all that immediate gratification just adds up to a lot of extraneous stuff. The fact is, it is possible to consume opinion and events (and carrots) without feeling the same need to consume garments. Clothes are signposts of personal communication, and as such they should be long-term acquisitions. Otherwise you risk identity whiplash.Time may be luxury, but we should not assume spending it in anticipation is a waste.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Outsider Poet Who Courted Contradictions", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byPoetryIn 2014, the brilliant poet and morbid eccentric Bill Knott had his lifelong death wish fulfilled. Knott began his career to acclaim and controversy with \u201cThe Naomi Poems: Corpse and Beans,\u201d a 1968 collection he published under the pseudonym Saint Geraud. An ersatz author\u2019s note described the poet as \u201ca virgin and a suicide\u201d who had lived from 1940 to 1966.After going on to publish 11 other full-length books under his own name, Knott actually did die \u2014 not by his own hand, but of complications from heart surgery at the age of 74.Now, thanks to the release of the remarkable \u201cI Am Flying Into Myself: Selected Poems, 1960-2014,\u201d readers have access in one place to what the collection\u2019s editor \u2014 Knott\u2019s friend the poet Thomas Lux, who himself died in February \u2014 calls \u201cKnott\u2019s high imagination, great skills, singular music and crazy-beautiful heart.\u201dKnott\u2019s lifelong obsession with mortality manifests itself in this volume\u2019s title, drawn from his short poem \u201cDeath,\u201d which reads in its entirety: \u201cGoing to sleep, I cross my hands on my chest./\u2009They will place my hands like this./\u2009It will look as though I am flying into myself.\u201dSleep, death and desire turn up over and over across these pages, as does the introspection suggested by \u201cflying into myself.\u201d Knott\u2019s work is shot through with the pleasure that comes from thinking thoughts that amuse oneself, and colored with the originality and lyrical nimbleness that cause such thoughts to amuse others as well. Take the five-line thought experiment \u201cAlternate Fates\u201d:This book serves as a treasury of Knott\u2019s colossal talent \u2014 a true treasury, which merits being treasured for the way it showcases the range and consistently high quality of his poetic output. To that end, the ars poetica \u201cTo Myself\u201d reads like a mission statement:Knott repeatedly achieves this objective, sometimes in free verse, sometimes in strict rhyme and meter; sometimes in 39 lines, as in the zany yet poignant sestina \u201cHollywood Nightmare,\u201d and sometimes in just one, as in the grim critique \u201cHistory,\u201d which reads: \u201cHope .\u2008.\u2008. goosestep.\u201dKnott counterbalances his impulses toward both romance and hilarity with terror, self-deprecation, philosophy or all of the above. A love poem called \u201cPoem\u201d begins as one might expect: \u201cI first loved you\u2009/\u2009Second to your gentleness.\u201d Then, before it ends, the poem takes an expansive and political turn:NeverUntil each woman and man is freeUntil each woman and man is in the custodyThe tensions between lightness and seriousness, between the predictable and the unforeseen, weave themselves together constantly in Knott\u2019s poems.Dark and death-obsessed as they are, so too do they possess an unmistakable jouissance \u2014 a kind of poetic YOLO expressed through wordplay \u2014 as well as a Dickinsonian compression and linguistic virtuosity. Even the longest, \u201cOvernight Freeze (Heptasyllabics),\u201d distills its language for maximum sonic effect, both intoxicating and intoxicated with sound:kick can dislodge. .\u2008.\u2008.It goes on in that mesmerizing fashion for a full 11 pages, and if you read it out loud (as you should) it sounds almost like hip-hop.Lux\u2019s conversational and comprehensive introduction provides immense and balanced insight into Knott the person and Knott the poet, while giving the reader a sense of how monumental a task the selection process must have been. For not only was Knott steadily prolific for half a century, so too was he a restless experimenter, shapeshifting from surrealist to Oulipean to anti-poet to formalist.Moreover, although one of his later books was called \u201cThe Unsubscriber,\u201d Knott embraced and became a frenetic user of the internet. Starting in 2005 and continuing until his death, he circulated his poems \u2014 sometimes in edited or updated versions \u2014 on his blog and in handmade chapbooks (also available as PDF downloads).Luckily, as Lux explains, Knott kicked off the selection process himself. Almost all of the poems in this volume come from the book \u201cCollected Poetry 1960-2014,\u201d which Knott released through Amazon less than three weeks before he died. That book had 964 poems as opposed to this one\u2019s 152, but in paring them back Lux mostly maintained the order, which Knott said \u201cis meant to be random, neither chronological nor thematic.\u201dJames Wright called Knott an \u201cunmistakable genius.\u201d Knott\u2019s \u201cOutremer\u201d won the Iowa Poetry Prize in 1988, he received a Guggenheim in 2003 and he taught at Emerson College for over 25 years. Yet constitutionally, Knott remained an outsider, perpetually frustrated both by his fame and by his lack thereof. As Lux writes, \u201cBill had serious self-esteem problems\u201d stemming from a hellish childhood that included time in an orphanage and a mental institution, and he most likely lived \u201cwith various levels of depression .\u2008.\u2008. for the rest of his life.\u201dDying can be an effective path to attention if you\u2019re an artist. People who didn\u2019t know or care about your work rush to see what the fuss was about \u2014 what they missed. That\u2019s probably partly why Knott opted to kill himself off with his very first book. Now that he\u2019s really gone and this distilled treasury is in print, one of our best and most arresting poets might get the bigger audience he deserved. Bill Knott is dead. Long live Bill Knott.Kathleen Rooney\u2019s second novel, \u201cLillian Boxfish Takes a Walk,\u201d was published in January. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Invokes Internet Freedom While Trying to Kill It", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byEditorialHere we go again. The Federal Communications Commission, now led by an anti-regulation ideologue appointed by President Trump, wants to gut the net neutrality rules that keep powerful broadband companies from calling the shots on the internet, at the expense of consumers.Under the cynical guise of \u201crestoring internet freedom,\u201d the new F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, wants to give big telecom companies carte blanche to treat the content of their subsidiaries and partners more favorably than information from other companies \u2014 a practice that AT&T, Comcast and Verizon are already starting to employ. They would also be able to demand fees from companies like Netflix and YouTube to deliver videos and other content to customers.If the commission, which has a 2-to-1 Republican majority, approves Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, there will be little stopping the broadband industry from squelching competition, limiting consumer choice and raising prices. The previous F.C.C. chairman, Tom Wheeler, helped put the rules Mr. Pai is attacking in place in 2015, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld them last year.Large telecommunications companies have been raking in profits in recent years. And they have been making multibillion-dollar acquisitions \u2014 not something you see from an industry that is withering from senseless regulations. Charter spent more than $65 billion last year to buy Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. AT&T bought DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015 and is trying to buy Time Warner, the media company, for $85 billion.Not only is Mr. Pai\u2019s lament for the broadband industry based on alternative facts, it misses the bigger point. Net neutrality is meant to benefit the internet and the economy broadly, not just the broadband industry. That means the commission ought to consider the impact the regulations have on consumers and businesses. In particular, the commission has a responsibility to protect people with few or no choices; most Americans have access to just one or two companies for residential service and just four big operators for wireless.Mr. Pai argues that if the Wheeler rules are revoked, some safeguards will remain. For example, he says, broadband companies would refrain from blocking or slowing the content of competitors. He has not said how he would ensure that. But the F.C.C. is considering using voluntary commitments from the industry.Under that approach, officials at the Federal Trade Commission would have the power to fine or sue companies that make pledges and then fail to uphold them. But it is hard to believe that voluntary standards would be strong enough. It also puts the onus on individuals and small businesses to complain to regulators and request investigations.Big internet businesses like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix will probably be fine under Mr. Pai\u2019s plans, because they are well established and have the money to cut special deals with broadband companies.Smaller firms and start-ups \u2014 some of which may never get started \u2014 will not be as lucky.Ultimately, though, the real losers will be all Americans, because there will be fewer choices and less innovation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is It Time to Break Up Google?", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byOpinionIn just 10 years, the world\u2019s five largest companies by market capitalization have all changed, save for one: Microsoft. Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Citigroup and Shell Oil are out and Apple, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon and Facebook have taken their place.They\u2019re all tech companies, and each dominates its corner of the industry: Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising, Facebook (and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic and Amazon has a 74 percent share in the e-book market. In classic economic terms, all three are monopolies.We have been transported back to the early 20th century, when arguments about \u201cthe curse of bigness\u201d were advanced by President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s counselor, Louis Brandeis, before Wilson appointed him to the Supreme Court. Brandeis wanted to eliminate monopolies, because (in the words of his biographer Melvin Urofsky) \u201cin a democratic society the existence of large centers of private power is dangerous to the continuing vitality of a free people.\u201d We need look no further than the conduct of the largest banks in the 2008 financial crisis or the role that Facebook and Google play in the \u201cfake news\u201d business to know that Brandeis was right.While Brandeis generally opposed regulation \u2014 which, he worried, inevitably led to the corruption of the regulator \u2014 and instead advocated breaking up \u201cbigness,\u201d he made an exception for \u201cnatural\u201d monopolies, like telephone, water and power companies and railroads, where it made sense to have one or a few companies in control of an industry.Could it be that these companies \u2014 and Google in particular \u2014 have become natural monopolies by supplying an entire market\u2019s demand for a service, at a price lower than what would be offered by two competing firms? And if so, is it time to regulate them like public utilities?Consider a historical analogy: the early days of telecommunications.In 1895 a photograph of the business district of a large city might have shown 20 phone wires attached to most buildings. Each wire was owned by a different phone company, and none of them worked with the others. Without network effects, the networks themselves were almost useless.The solution was for a single company, American Telephone and Telegraph, to consolidate the industry by buying up all the small operators and creating a single network \u2014 a natural monopoly. The government permitted it, but then regulated this monopoly through the Federal Communications Commission.In a 1956 consent decree in which the Justice Department allowed AT&T to maintain its phone monopoly, the government extracted a huge concession: All past patents were licensed (to any American company) royalty-free, and all future patents were to be licensed for a small fee. These licenses led to the creation of Texas Instruments, Motorola, Fairchild Semiconductor and many other start-ups.True, the internet never had the same problems of interoperability. And Google\u2019s route to dominance is different from the Bell System\u2019s. Nevertheless it still has all of the characteristics of a public utility.We are going to have to decide fairly soon whether Google, Facebook and Amazon are the kinds of natural monopolies that need to be regulated, or whether we allow the status quo to continue, pretending that unfettered monoliths don\u2019t inflict damage on our privacy and democracy.It is impossible to deny that Facebook, Google and Amazon have stymied innovation on a broad scale. To begin with, the platforms of Google and Facebook are the point of access to all media for the majority of Americans. While profits at Google, Facebook and Amazon have soared, revenues in media businesses like newspaper publishing or the music business have, since 2001, fallen by 70 percent.There are a few obvious regulations to start with. Monopoly is made by acquisition \u2014 Google buying AdMob and DoubleClick, Facebook buying Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon buying, to name just a few, Audible, Twitch, Zappos and Alexa. At a minimum, these companies should not be allowed to acquire other major firms, like Spotify or Snapchat.The second alternative is to regulate a company like Google as a public utility, requiring it to license out patents, for a nominal fee, for its search algorithms, advertising exchanges and other key innovations.The third alternative is to remove the \u201csafe harbor\u201d clause in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which allows companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube to free ride on the content produced by others. The reason there are 40,000 Islamic State videos on YouTube, many with ads that yield revenue for those who posted them, is that YouTube does not have to take responsibility for the content on its network. Facebook, Google and Twitter claim that policing their networks would be too onerous. But that\u2019s preposterous: They already police their networks for pornography, and quite well.Removing the safe harbor provision would also force social networks to pay for the content posted on their sites. A simple example: One million downloads of a song on iTunes would yield the performer and his record label about $900,000. One million streams of that same song on YouTube would earn them about $900.I\u2019m under no delusion that, with libertarian tech moguls like Peter Thiel in President Trump\u2019s inner circle, antitrust regulation of the internet monopolies will be a priority. Ultimately we may have to wait four years, at which time the monopolies will be so dominant that the only remedy will be to break them up. Force Google to sell DoubleClick. Force Facebook to sell WhatsApp and Instagram.Woodrow Wilson was right when he said in 1913, \u201cIf monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of the government.\u201d We ignore his words at our peril.Jonathan Taplin is the director emeritus of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Google, Facebook and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Activist Investment in Whole Foods Exposes Shifting Power on Wall St.", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byAs a steward of pension funds and retirement accounts, Neuberger Berman has traditionally employed a staid strategy familiar among big Wall Street money managers: Buy and hold stocks, sit back, and hope for the best.But recently, the firm has eschewed its nearly 80-year-old tactic of playing nice. Instead it turned to the bare-knuckled world of activist investors made famous by the likes of Carl C. Icahn and William A. Ackman.Last year, as Neuberger Berman\u2019s roughly $200 million investment in Whole Foods Market languished, the firm quietly approached some hedge funds and urged them to agitate for change at the high-end grocer.Two weeks ago, Jana Partners took up the fight.Neuberger Berman\u2019s behind-the-scenes campaign to shake up Whole Foods is the latest example of a dynamic that is upending relations between public companies and the big investors that own their stock.For decades, Neuberger Berman \u2014 which invests some $267 billion for pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and individuals \u2014 and peers like T. Rowe Price and BlackRock were reluctant to rock the boat at the companies they invested in. Agitating for change was left to the activist hedge fund managers like Mr. Icahn and Mr. Ackman, rabble-rousers with a reputation for shaking up companies, raising their stock prices and making big profits.Traditional money managers in search of market-beating returns are demanding a seat at the table, turning to activists for help and even employing some hedge fund tricks of their own. And activists, once the black sheep of the investment world, are now accepted as regular, if meddlesome, investors.Do companies \u201creally listen to the feedback they get from their mainstream investors?\u201d said Michelle Edkins, global head of corporate governance at BlackRock. \u201cI think they are certainly making an effort to listen more.\u201dBut activists, she added, \u201ccan act as an important \u2018check and balance\u2019 on management that has lost its way.\u201dBefore Neuberger Berman approached the activists, it talked to Whole Foods representatives and made its case for change. While the company undertook some reforms \u2014 for one, scrapping its dual-chief-executive structure in November \u2014 the conversations yielded little effect on the company\u2019s dwindling share price.So Neuberger Berman executives prepared an inch-thick presentation, the kind of document usually produced by activists. It took broad aim at Whole Foods, criticizing everything from its cozy board and wilting produce to its pricey real estate in well-heeled neighborhoods like Columbus Circle, where Whole Foods has a store in the Time Warner Center \u2014 one of the most expensive retail spaces in New York City. With that in hand, they approached several hedge funds, including Starboard Value and Elliott Management.Before long, Jana was amassing shares of Whole Foods. On April 10, as it unveiled its stake in the company, it ticked off a list of complaints that echoed Neuberger Berman\u2019s concerns: The brand was suffering, customer service was lagging and the company needed fresh blood on the board.Jana declined to comment.Neuberger Berman declined to comment about its interactions with hedge funds regarding Whole Foods, but said the firm was willing to take a more active role in certain situations. \u201cWe have engaged with the company quite aggressively over the course of the last period of time,\u201d said Joseph Amato, president and chief investment officer of Neuberger Berman, referring to Whole Foods.Earlier this week, Neuberger Berman sent a letter to the board of directors at Whole Foods, praising it for undertaking \u201cpositive changes\u201d in recent months. But Neuberger Berman also strongly urged the board to consider a potential sale of the company or a merger or alliance with another company, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by The New York Times.Relations between institutional investors and activists have evolved in recent years, and it is not unheard-of for big investors to support activists who have set their sights on a high-profile company. In 2013, T. Rowe Price teamed up with Mr. Icahn to oppose a leveraged buyout of Dell.Neuberger Berman has taken a more confrontational approach before. Last year it campaigned for change at another company in which it had invested, the technology company Ultratech. It secured two board seats, but the process, Mr. Amato said, was \u201cin all honesty expensive and time-consuming.\u201dIn the case of Whole Foods, Neuberger Berman lobbied for the activists to do the messy work of battling the company in public.But it is less common for an institutional investor to share its work on a specific target with activists in the way Neuberger Berman did with Whole Foods. Mr. Ackman has described receiving occasional calls from institutional investors hoping to pique his interest in a company. There is even a term for the interplay: \u201cR.F.A.s\u201d or \u201crequests for activism.\u201dFor many large shareholders, the 2008 financial crisis was the turning point that led to greater collaboration with activists. Investors watched as the value of their stock portfolios plummeted.At the same time, activists, who at times could be brash, have softened their images. Third Point\u2019s Daniel S. Loeb \u2014 once famous for the verbal invective that he lobbed at chief executives \u2014 has opted more recently for the quiet approach of complimenting executives but emphasizing \u201cundervalued\u201d aspects of their businesses. In a letter to investors two years ago he sought to dispel the notion that activists were \u201chit and run\u201d investors.\u201cIt might surprise people to hear that we completely agree that the sort of activism they describe is abominable,\u201d he wrote.In the case of Whole Foods, Jana has focused on a broad range of issues with the business \u2014 which has earned the nickname \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d for its expensive products. It pointed to failures in how Whole Foods handled its brand development, and to what it said were customer service deficiencies and a poor strategy for distribution.Once the vanguard of the natural and organic food movement, Whole Foods now faces competition from big-name grocers like Safeway and Costco that have started to offer similar organic products at lower prices.As its share price slid last year, Whole Foods cut its prices, offered promotions and started a loyalty program. After Jana\u2019s announcement, the company said it was \u201ccommitted to driving value for all Whole Foods Market shareholders and will continue to act to achieve this important objective.\u201dBut analysts have speculated the company could be a takeover target, which would result in a big payday for Jana, Neuberger Berman and other investors. A flurry of reports of takeover interest \u2014 the supermarket chain Albertsons and the e-commerce giant Amazon are reported to have explored bids \u2014 has helped to lift the share price.Charles Kantor, who oversees Neuberger Berman\u2019s investment in Whole Foods, said that the company had \u201ca phenomenal brand and had executed the difficult things,\u201d but that \u201cthey haven\u2019t done well with the basic Retail 101.\u201dMr. Kantor said it was normal for his group to speak with other investors. But, he added, \u201cWe\u2019ve never made an investment predicated on an activist showing up.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hand of U.S. Leaves North Korea\u2019s Missile Program Shaken", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When a North Korean missile test went awry on Sunday, blowing up seconds after liftoff, there were immediate suspicions that a United States program to sabotage the test flights had struck again. The odds seem highly likely: Eighty-eight percent of the launches of the North\u2019s most threatening missiles have self-destructed since the covert American program was accelerated three years ago.But even inside the United States Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, where the operation is centered, it is nearly impossible to tell if any individual launch is the victim of a new, innovative approach to foil North Korean missiles with cyber and electronic strikes.Bad welding, bad parts, bad engineering and bad luck can all play a role in such failures \u2014 as it did in the United States\u2019 own missile program, particularly in its early days. And it would require a near impossible degree of forensic investigation to figure out an exact cause, given that the failed North Korean missiles tend to explode, disintegrate in midair and plunge in fragments into faraway seas.But this much is clear, experts say: The existence of the American program, and whatever it has contributed to North Korea\u2019s remarkable string of troubles, appears to have shaken Pyongyang and led to an internal spyhunt as well as innovative ways to defeat a wide array of enemy cyberstrikes.By all accounts, the program that President Barack Obama stepped up in 2014 has been adopted with enthusiasm by the Trump administration. President Trump\u2019s national security aides are eagerly hoping that the Chinese, among others, will get North Korea to freeze or reverse its program. Yet they have no compunctions about using this new class of weapon against missile tests that the United Nations has already prohibited.Speaking in Moscow last week, Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, was put on the defensive by a Russian reporter who challenged American complaints of interference in the American election, despite Washington\u2019s cyber attacks against Iran\u2019s nuclear program and North Korea\u2019s missile program. \u201cCybertools to disrupt weapons programs \u2014 that\u2019s another use of the tools, and I make a distinction between those two,\u201d Mr. Tillerson argued back, without specifically confirming their use against Pyongyang.Perhaps taken by surprise at the question, Mr. Tillerson never took the next step to voice the argument that some of his Trump administration colleagues make in private: that since the United Nations Security Council has banned North Korean missile tests, any effort to interfere with them would have some basis in international law.\u201cWhen you look at what is emanating out of North Korea,\u201d Michael Chertoff, a former secretary of homeland security who now runs a cyberconsulting group in Washington, said Tuesday at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \u201cI have sympathy for the argument that anything we can do to stop an unpredictable person from using nuclear weapons is worth trying.\u201dBut the question for the United States\u2019 intelligence agencies is whether this new tool is as effective as many have hoped. While billions of dollars have been poured into new offensive cyberweapons, touting a success in thwarting North Korea \u2014 whether it is real or imagined \u2014 can be turned into an argument for more.It is a particularly difficult question in light of Sunday\u2019s botched test, because it is still unclear exactly what missile was launched. By nature, missiles teeter on the brink of failure, and new designs are often accident prone. At their best, missiles are dense welters of pipes, engines, valves, pumps, volatile fuels, relays, explosive bolts, wires, sensors and circuit boards that suddenly emit blistering flames and roar skyward with such shattering violence that they often quickly hit the breaking point. Things can easily go wrong, and frequently do.But even by those measures, the North Koreans are having a rough time, and it has gotten a lot rougher since the United States accelerated its sabotage program.In the annals of rocketry, experts say, roughly 5 to 10 percent of developmental test flights go awry. That holds even for such high practitioners of the art as the billionaires Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, who are now racing to redefine the future of spaceflight. (By contrast, American commercial airline flights have a success rate of more than 99.9999 percent. And when crashes do occur, it can take investigators weeks, months or even years to identify the cause.)But the sheer frequency of North Korean missile mishaps suggests that sabotage lies behind at least some of the recent failures.So does the timing. Typically, countries encounter high failure rates when they start their rocket programs. As the programs mature, and engineers gain experience, spectacular failures decline and success tends to become a habit. In North Korea, the situation has been the exact reverse.By and large, the North was a reliable maker of missiles in the 1980s, \u201990s and into the 2000s. The government sold its missiles to Pakistan and Iran, among others.Then came the effort to launch the Musudan, an intermediate-range missile that Pyongyang first displayed in a military parade in late 2010. It was 5 feet wide and 40 feet long \u2014 remarkably small compared with the North\u2019s big rockets. But it represented an enormous threat. Carried on a truck, it could be hauled on country roads through forested regions or kept in tunnels, making it easy to hide and, as a target, difficult to find and destroy.To date, the proven reach of the Musudan makes it the most threatening potential weapon in the North\u2019s emerging arsenal of missiles that might loft nuclear warheads. It is seen as able to hit targets up to 2,200 miles away \u2014 far enough to strike the sprawling American base at Guam.Last year, the North conducted eight flight tests. Only one succeeded, giving the missile an overall failure rate of 88 percent. It was after the last failure that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, was reported to have ordered an investigation into whether the United States was sabotaging his country\u2019s test flights, searching for spies in his system.Experts say that the best way to slow a program is to send a country scrambling for the causes of failures. \u201cDisrupting their tests,\u201d William J. Perry, defense secretary in the Clinton administration, said at a meeting this year in Washington, would be \u201ca pretty effective way of stopping their ICBM program.\u201dBut more recently, the effectiveness of the United States\u2019 sabotage has grown increasingly uncertain. Some new North Korean missile designs, using solid fuels, have had a higher success rate. Moreover, the North Koreans, as sophisticated cyberoperators, have grown better at defense.John Schilling, a technical expert on North Korea\u2019s missile program, expressed skepticism on Tuesday about the efficacy of the foreign cyberattacks against Pyongyang\u2019s missiles.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything yet pointing to cyber specifically,\u201d Dr. Schilling said on a conference call organized by 38 North, a think tank specializing in North Korea at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.An easier target of sabotage, Dr. Schilling added, would be the parts and supplies that North Korea imports to feed its factories that make the missiles.Longtime North Korea watcher Martyn Williams, who runs a California-based blog called North Korea Tech, recently reported that the North\u2019s scientists have developed a quantum encryption device that could completely secure communications systems from hackers, eavesdroppers and saboteurs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Learning From Our Parents\u2019 Heart Health Mistakes", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byPersonal HealthAmong these indigenous South Americans, known as the Tsimane (pronounced chee-MAH-nay), coronary atherosclerosis was found to be one-fifth as common than in the United States. CT scans of the hearts of 705 Tsimane adults aged 40 to 94 revealed that nearly nine in 10 had clean coronary arteries and faced no risk of heart disease. The research team estimated that an 80-year-old in the Tsimane group has the same vascular age as an American in his mid-50s.I\u2019ll return to the likely reasons and the lifesaving lessons we can all learn from them even now after a discussion of a half-century of improvements in the heart health of Americans.In the early 1960s, when I began writing about science and health, American hearts were in dismal condition. Heart disease, an uncommon cause of death at the turn of the 20th century, had become the most common cause of death by midcentury.Had the coronary death rate continued its meteoric rise, today more than 1.7 million Americans would succumb to heart disease each year. Instead, there\u2019s been a significant decline, to some 425,000 deaths a year, with a commensurate increase in longevity of 8.7 years between 1970 and 2010. More than 70 percent of the rise in life expectancy is attributable to fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease, primarily heart attacks and strokes.People with high total cholesterol face nearly twice the risk for heart disease as those with ideal levels (200 milligrams or less), and a high level of LDL cholesterol \u2013 above 100 milligrams \u2014 is even more problematic. Yet even now, fewer than half of adults with elevated LDL levels are being treated to reduce it.So what can we learn from the Tsimane? Are medications, treatment with stents and other costly procedures our only hope for cutting coronary mortality further? Yes, if millions of Americans continue to spurn changes in their living habits that have been shown over and over again to be protective.The Tsimane have a forager-horticulturist lifestyle. Tsimane men are physically active for an average of six to seven hours a day \u2014 accumulating about 17,000 steps a day \u2014 and Tsimane women are active for four to six hours a day, walking about 15,000 steps a day. Smoking is rare in this population.The Tsimane diet derives 72 percent of its calories from carbohydrates, though not the overly refined starches and sugars consumed by most Americans. The Tsimane eat unprocessed complex carbs high in fiber, like brown rice, plantain, manioc, corn, nuts and fruits.But the Tsimane are not vegetarians. Protein accounts for 14 percent of their calories and comes primarily from animal meats that, unlike American meats, are very low in artery-clogging saturated fat.This does not mean we must return to hunting and gathering or subsistence farming to protect our hearts. But we\u2019d do well to adapt the Tsimane example and modify our modern high-fat, highly processed, low-fiber and high-sugar diet and our extremely sedentary lifestyle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Facebook Fix Its Own Worst Bug?", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "FeatureMark Zuckerberg now acknowledges the dangerous side of the social revolution he helped start. But is the most powerful tool for connection in human history capable of adapting to the world it created?Supported byZuckerberg used to be a nervous speaker, but he has become much less so. He speaks quickly but often unloads full paragraphs of thought, and sometimes his arguments are so polished that they sound rehearsed, which happened often that morning. \u201c2016 was an interesting year for us,\u201d he said as the three of us, plus a P.R. executive, sat around a couple of couches in the glass-walled conference room where he conducts many of his meetings. (There are many perks to working at Facebook, but no one, not even Zuckerberg, has a private office.) It was an understatement and a nod to the obvious: Facebook, once a mere app on your phone, had become a global political and cultural force, and the full implications of that transformation had begun to come into view last year. \u201cIf you look at the history of Facebook, when we started off, there really wasn\u2019t news as part of it,\u201d Zuckerberg went on. But as Facebook grew and became a bigger part of how people learn about the world, the company had been slow to adjust to its new place in people\u2019s lives. The events of 2016, he said, \u201cset off a number of conversations that we\u2019re still in the middle of.\u201dAfter the election, Zuckerberg offered a few pat defenses of Facebook\u2019s role. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite proud of the impact that we were able to have on civic discourse over all,\u201d he said when we spoke in January. Misinformation on Facebook was not as big a problem as some believed it was, but Facebook nevertheless would do more to battle it, he pledged. Echo chambers were a concern, but if the source was people\u2019s own confirmation bias, was it really Facebook\u2019s problem to solve?It was hard to tell how seriously Zuckerberg took the criticisms of his service and its increasingly paradoxical role in the world. He had spent much of his life building a magnificent machine to bring people together. By the most literal measures, he\u2019d succeeded spectacularly, but what had that connection wrought? Across the globe, Facebook now seems to benefit actors who want to undermine the global vision at its foundation. Supporters of Trump and the European right-wing nationalists who aim to turn their nations inward and dissolve alliances, trolls sowing cross-border paranoia, even ISIS with its skillful social-media recruiting and propagandizing \u2014 all of them have sought in their own ways to split the Zuckerbergian world apart. And they are using his own machine to do it.Underneath it all was a nagging feeling of complicity. Trump had benefited from a media environment that is now shaped by Facebook \u2014 and, more to the point, shaped by a single Facebook feature, the same one to which the company owes its remarkable ascent to social-media hegemony: the computationally determined list of updates you see every time you open the app. The list has a formal name, News Feed. But most users are apt to think of it as Facebook itself.If it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that News Feed has become the most influential source of information in the history of civilization, it is only slightly so. Facebook created News Feed in 2006 to solve a problem: In the social-media age, people suddenly had too many friends to keep up with. At the time, Facebook was just a collection of profiles, lacking any kind of central organization. To figure out what any of your connections were up to, you had to visit each of their profiles to see if anything had changed. News Feed fixed that. Every time you open Facebook, it hunts through the network, collecting every post from every connection \u2014 information that, for most Facebook users, would be too overwhelming to process themselves. Then it weighs the merits of each post before presenting you with a feed sorted in order of importance: a hyperpersonalized front page designed just for you.Scholars and critics have been warning of the solipsistic irresistibility of algorithmic news at least since 2001, when the constitutional-law professor Cass R. Sunstein warned, in his book \u201cRepublic.com,\u201d of the urgent risks posed to democracy \u201cby any situation in which thousands or perhaps millions or even tens of millions of people are mainly listening to louder echoes of their own voices.\u201d (In 2008, I piled on with my own book, \u201cTrue Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society.\u201d) In 2011, the digital activist and entrepreneur Eli Pariser, looking at similar issues, gave this phenomenon a memorable name in the title of his own book: \u201cThe Filter Bubble.\u201dEmployees got the same message. \u201cWhen Facebook cares about something, they spin up teams to address it, and Zuck will come out and talk about it all the time,\u201d one former executive told me. \u201cI have never heard of anything close to that on the filter bubble. I never sensed that this was a problem he wanted us to tackle. It was always positioned as an interesting intellectual question but not something that we\u2019re going to go focus on.\u201dFacebook, under criticism, reinstated the picture, but the photo incident stuck with Zuckerberg. He would bring it up unbidden to staff members and to reporters. It highlighted, for him, the difficulty of building a policy framework for what Facebook was trying to do. Zuckerberg wanted to become a global news distributor that is run by machines, rather than by humans who would try to look at every last bit of content and exercise considered judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s something I think we\u2019re still figuring out,\u201d he told me in January. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to do here than what we\u2019ve done. And I think we\u2019re starting to realize this now as well.\u201dIt struck me as an unsatisfying answer, and it later became apparent that Zuckerberg seemed to feel the same way. On a Sunday morning about a month after the first meeting, I got a call from a Facebook spokesman. Zuckerberg wanted to chat again. Could Mike and I come back on Monday afternoon?What\u2019s striking about that 2012 letter, read through the prism of 2017, is its certainty that a more \u201copen and connected\u201d world is by definition a better one. \u201cWhen I started Facebook, the idea of connecting the world was not controversial,\u201d Zuckerberg said now. \u201cThe default assumption was that the world was incrementally just moving in that direction. So I thought we can connect some people and do our part in helping move in that direction.\u201d But now, he said, whether it was wise to connect the world was \u201cactually a real question.\u201dZuckerberg\u2019s new manifesto never quite accepts blame for any of the global ills that have been laid at Facebook\u2019s feet. Yet by the standards of a company release, it is remarkable for the way it concedes that the company\u2019s chief goal \u2014 wiring the globe \u2014 is controversial. \u201cThere are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone,\u201d Zuckerberg writes, \u201cand whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course.\u201d He also confesses misgivings about Facebook\u2019s role in the news. \u201cGiving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality.\u201dAt the time of our second interview, the manifesto was still only a draft, and I was surprised by how unsure Zuckerberg seemed about it in person. He had almost as many questions for us \u2014 about whether we understood what he was trying to say, how we thought it would land in the media \u2014 as we had for him. When I suggested that it might be perceived as an attack on Trump, he looked dismayed. He noted several times that he had been noodling over these ideas since long before November. A few weeks earlier, there was media speculation, fueled by a postelection tour of America by Zuckerberg and his wife, that he was laying the groundwork to run against Trump in 2020, and in this meeting he took pains to shoot down the rumors. When I asked if he had chatted with Obama about the former president\u2019s critique of Facebook, Zuckerberg paused for several seconds, nearly to the point of awkwardness, before answering that he had.Facebook\u2019s spokespeople later called to stress that Obama was only one of many people to whom he had spoken. In other words: Don\u2019t read this as a partisan anti-Trump manifesto. But if the company pursues the admittedly airy aims outlined in \u201cBuilding Global Community,\u201d the changes will echo across media and politics, and some are bound to be considered partisan. The risks are especially clear for changes aimed at adding layers of journalistic ethics across News Feed, which could transform the public\u2019s perception of Facebook, not to mention shake the foundations of its business.For the typical user, Cox explained when I met him on a morning in October at MPK20, News Feed is computing the relative merits of about 2,000 potential posts in your network every time you open the app. In sorting these posts, Facebook does not optimize for any single metric: not clicks or reading time or likes. Instead, he said, \u201cwhat you really want to get to is whether somebody, at the end of the day, would say, \u2018Hey, my experience today was meaningful.\u2019\u2009\u201d Personalizing News Feed, in other words, is a very big \u201cmath problem,\u201d incorporating countless metrics in extraordinarily complicated ways. Zuckerberg calls it \u201ca modern A.I. problem.\u201dLast summer, I sat in on two meetings in another glass-walled MPK20 conference room, in which News Feed\u2019s engineers, designers, user-research experts and managers debated several small alterations to how News Feed displays certain kinds of posts. The conversations were far from exciting \u2014 people in jeans on couches looking at PowerPoints, talking quietly about numbers \u2014 and yet I found them mesmerizing, a demonstration of the profound cultural differences between how news companies like The Times work and how Facebook does. The first surprise was how slowly things move, contrary to the freewheeling culture of \u201cthe hacker way.\u201d In one meeting, the team spent several minutes discussing the merits of bold text in a certain News Feed design. One blessing of making social software is that you can gauge any potential change to your product by seeing how your users react to it. That is also the curse: At Facebook, virtually every change to the app, no matter how small or obviously beneficial, is thoroughly tested on different segments of the audience before it\u2019s rolled out to everyone.The people who work on News Feed aren\u2019t making decisions that turn on fuzzy human ideas like ethics, judgment, intuition or seniority. They are concerned only with quantifiable outcomes about people\u2019s actions on the site. That data, at Facebook, is the only real truth. And it is a particular kind of truth: The News Feed team\u2019s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want \u2014 what they find \u201cmeaningful,\u201d to use Cox and Zuckerberg\u2019s preferred term \u2014 and to give them more of that.This ideal runs so deep that the people who make News Feed often have to put aside their own notions of what\u2019s best. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve all learned over the years is that our intuition can be wrong a fair amount of the time,\u201d John Hegeman, the vice president of product management and a News Feed team member, told me. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t expect will happen. And we learn a lot from that process: Why didn\u2019t that happen, and what might that mean?\u201d But it is precisely this ideal that conflicts with attempts to wrangle the feed in the way press critics have called for. The whole purpose of editorial guidelines and ethics is often to suppress individual instincts in favor of some larger social goal. Facebook finds it very hard to suppress anything that its users\u2019 actions say they want. In some cases, it has been easier for the company to seek out evidence that, in fact, users don\u2019t want these things at all.If a human editor ran News Feed, she would look at the clickbait scourge and make simple, intuitive fixes: Turn down the Upworthy knob. But Facebook approaches the feed as an engineering project rather than an editorial one. When it makes alterations in the code that powers News Feed, it\u2019s often only because it has found some clear signal in its data that users are demanding the change. In this sense, clickbait was a riddle. In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them? Was there something Facebook\u2019s algorithm was missing, some signal that would show that despite the clicks, clickbait was really sickening users?To answer these questions, Cox and his team hired survey panels of more than a thousand paid \u201cprofessional raters\u201d around the world who answer questions about how well News Feed is working. Starting in 2013, Facebook began adding first dozens and then hundreds and then thousands of data points that were meant to teach the artificial-intelligence system that runs News Feed how people were reacting to their feeds. Facebook noticed that people would sometimes click open a clickbaity story but spend very little time on it. In other cases, lots of people would click on a story but few would share or Like it. Headlines on stories that people seemed to reject often contained a set of signature phrases (\u201cyou\u2019ll never believe,\u201d \u201cthis one trick,\u201d etc.) or they came from a set of repeat-offender publishers.This approach \u2014 looking for signs of user dissatisfaction \u2014 could curb stories that constitute the most egregious examples of misinformation. Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s vice president in charge of News Feed, says that Facebook has begun testing an algorithm change that would look at whether people share an article after reading it. If few of the people who click on a story decide to share it, that might suggest people feel misled by it and it would get lower billing in the feed.But the solution to the broader misinformation dilemma \u2014 the pervasive climate of rumor, propaganda and conspiracy theories that Facebook has inadvertently incubated \u2014 may require something that Facebook has never done: ignoring the likes and dislikes of its users. Facebook believes the pope-endorses-Trump type of made-up news stories are only a tiny minority of pieces that appear in News Feed; they account for a fraction of 1 percent of the posts, according to Mosseri. The question the company faces now is whether the misinformation problem resembles clickbait at all, and whether its solutions will align as neatly with Facebook\u2019s worldview. Facebook\u2019s entire project, when it comes to news, rests on the assumption that people\u2019s individual preferences ultimately coincide with the public good, and that if it doesn\u2019t appear that way at first, you\u2019re not delving deeply enough into the data. By contrast, decades of social-science research shows that most of us simply prefer stuff that feels true to our worldview even if it isn\u2019t true at all and that the mining of all those preference signals is likely to lead us deeper into bubbles rather than out of them.\u201cAt some point, if they really want to address this, they have to say, \u2018This is good information\u2019 and \u2018This is bad information,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Emily Bell, the director for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School. \u201cThey have to say, \u2018These are the kinds of information sources that we want to privilege, and these others are not going to be banned from the platform, but they are not going to thrive.\u2019 In other words, they have to create a hierarchy, and they\u2019re going to have to decide how they\u2019re going to transfer wealth into the publishing market.\u201dDuring our first meeting in January, I posed this question to Zuckerberg: \u201cWhen you see various problems in the media, do you say to yourself, \u2018I run Facebook, I can solve that?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cUm,\u201d he started, and then paused, weighing his words as carefully as American presidents once did. \u201cNot usually.\u201d He argued that some of Facebook\u2019s critics\u2019 proposed fixes for news on the service, such as hiring editors, were impractical due to Facebook\u2019s scale and global diversity. Personalization, he said, remained a central tenet. \u201cIt really gets back to, like, what do people want at a deep level,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this oversimplified narrative that a company can get very successful by just scratching a very superficial itch, and I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s right over the long term.\u201dYet by our second meeting, Zuckerberg\u2019s position seemed to have evolved. Facebook had by then announced plans for the Facebook Journalism Project, in which the company would collaborate with news companies on new products. Facebook also created a project to promote \u201cnews literacy\u201d among its users, and it hired the former CNN news anchor Campbell Brown to manage the partnership between it and news companies. Zuckerberg\u2019s tone toward critics of Facebook\u2019s approach to news had also grown far more conciliatory. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to get to the core of the actual problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI also really think that the core social thing that needs to happen is that a common understanding needs to exist. And misinformation I view as one of the things that can possibly erode common understanding. But sensationalism and polarization and other things, I actually think, are probably even stronger and more prolific effects. And we have to work on all these things. I think we need to listen to all the feedback on this.\u201dStill, in both our conversation and his new manifesto, Zuckerberg remained preoccupied with the kind of problems that could be solved by the kind of hyperconnectivity he believed in, not the ones caused by it. \u201cThere\u2019s a social infrastructure that needs to get built for modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving more people oriented not just toward short-term things but toward building the long-term social infrastructure that needs to get built across all these things in order to enable people to come together is going to be a really important thing over the next decades.\u201d By way of example, he pointed to Safety Check, Facebook\u2019s system for letting people tell their friends that they\u2019ve survived some kind of dangerous event, like a natural disaster or terrorist attack.\u201cWe\u2019re getting to a point where the biggest opportunities I think in the world ... problems like preventing pandemics from spreading or ending terrorism, all these things, they require a level of coordination and connection that I don\u2019t think can only be solved by the current systems that we have,\u201d Zuckerberg told me. What\u2019s needed, he argues, is some global superstructure to advance humanity.This is not an especially controversial idea; Zuckerberg is arguing for a kind of digital-era version of the global institution-building that the Western world engaged in after World War II. But because he is a chief executive and not an elected president, there is something frightening about his project. He is positioning Facebook \u2014 and, considering that he commands absolute voting control of the company, he is positioning himself \u2014 as a critical enabler of the next generation of human society. A minor problem with his mission is that it drips with megalomania, albeit of a particularly sincere sort. With his wife, Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg has pledged to give away nearly all of his wealth to a variety of charitable causes, including a long-term medical-research project to cure all disease. His desire to take on global social problems through digital connectivity, and specifically through Facebook, feels like part of the same impulse.Yet Zuckerberg is often blas\u00e9 about the messiness of the transition between the world we\u2019re in and the one he wants to create through software. Building new \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d usually involves tearing older infrastructure down. If you manage the demolition poorly, you might undermine what comes next. In the case of the shattering media landscape, Zuckerberg seems finally to have at least noticed this problem and may yet come up with fixes for it. But in the meantime, Facebook rushes headlong into murky new areas, uncovering new dystopian possibilities at every turn.Just as quickly, though, Zuckerberg then pivoted to Facebook\u2019s next marvel, a system for digitally augmenting your pictures and videos. The technical term for this is \u201caugmented reality.\u201d The name bursts with dystopian possibilities \u2014 fake news on video rather than just text \u2014 but Zuckerberg never mentioned them. The statesman had left the stage; before us stood an engineer.Farhad Manjoo is a technology columnist for The New York Times. He is working on a book about what he calls the Frightful Five: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 the five technology giants that are swallowing up the rest of the economy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With \u2018Tramps,\u2019 Netflix Digs Deeper for Original Films", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byStreaming\u201cTramps\u201d has a few structural similarities to \u201cGimme the Loot\u201d; it also follows a young man and woman, both of them outsiders of a sort, in an adventure that takes them far from their familiar milieus. Danny (Callum Turner), who reluctantly helps his mother run a proxy bookie\u2019s office for her fellow Polish immigrants in their New York kitchen, is wheedled by his incarcerated brother into running a (probably) illegal errand. His contact, Ellie (Grace Van Patten), desperate to escape from Pittsburgh, has taken on a job as the driver on this errand, at the behest of a very ineffectual low-level criminal played by Mike Birbiglia. Danny and Ellie\u2019s initially abrasive relationship is exacerbated by Danny\u2019s ineptitude. Soon the two wind up in a very leafy Westchester County, N.Y., in search of a briefcase. In this case, the viewer just knows the two have to end up together.\u201cFor this movie, I really wanted a kind of classical Hollywood romance in terms of beats and structure but also to do it in a way that felt modern and genuine,\u201d Mr. Leon said. \u201cCertainly I was thinking of \u2018It Happened One Night,\u2019 and also movies where the characters are thrown together for a compressed amount of time \u2014 \u2018Broadway Danny Rose\u2019 and, even though it\u2019s not a romance, \u2018Midnight Run.\u2019\u201dThe project still presented several risks for Mr. Leon, who was determined to bring his characters to life onscreen without even considering making creative trade-offs to get financing.Ultimately, Mr. Leon wanted to make the film his way or not at all.\u201cI did not want the movie to get made via compromises for a production company,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to make a movie that would work for an audience, obviously. But I didn\u2019t want to get involved with things like pre-guarantees relative to ceding casting decisions, which are things that many companies will ask for. There were a lot of distributors, including Netflix, who looked at \u2018Tramps\u2019 in script form. And eventually the decision on our end was to get producers on board who would enable me to make it in an uncompromised way.\u201dAfter a good impression in Toronto in September, the selling began, at which point Mr. Leon got a call from one of the film\u2019s producers.\u201c\u2018Oh, no one\u2019s told you? Netflix is going to buy the movie,\u2019\u201d Mr. Leon remembered being told. \u201cThey had come to the table very enthusiastic, and very aggressive, and they\u2019re able to move with the kind of freedom that a lot of theatrical distributors, even notable independent ones, no longer have.\u201d\u201cI did not want \u2018Tramps\u2019 to be subject to a \u2018Let\u2019s put it in a random theater for a week to placate the filmmaker\u2019 approach,\u201d he continued. \u201cI want Netflix to do what Netflix does, which is to put a film out there in a way that will help you find its audience.\u201dBecause the Netflix rights are worldwide, Mr. Leon is freed from the task of taking his movie on the road. \u201cI don\u2019t get to worry myself and micromanage in my head what to do in Spain, or France. That\u2019s fun to do, once. But it takes a lot of time away from whatever movie you\u2019re supposed to be making next.\u201dThe Netflix deal also means that the movie gets shut out of consideration for certain awards. Movies that play only on a streaming service, whether they\u2019ve been produced specifically for that service or not, don\u2019t get to the Oscars. And less than two weeks ago, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences enacted a new rule in the documentary category banning film that originated as multipart or limited series \u2014 that would have shut out this year\u2019s winner, \u201cO.J.: Made in America.\u201d (This kills Oscar chances for the recent, highly praised Netflix-produced documentary \u201cFive Came Back,\u201d even though Netflix had taken the step of showing that film in theaters, probably with Oscar hopes in mind.)Tensions will no doubt rise as higher-profile filmmakers seek freedom via the Netflix route. Unless they don\u2019t: Executives like Mr. Rothman might well be delighted to be rid of potentially high-stress auteurs. But for filmmakers like Mr. Leon, the flexibility of the Netflix option is an artistic lifesaver.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fyre Festival, a Luxury Music Weekend, Crumbles in the Bahamas", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byFamous models on yachts! Exclusive island once owned by Pablo Escobar! Blink-182!Those were just some of the selling points for Fyre Festival, a supposedly opulent music weekend that was scheduled to begin in the Bahamas on Thursday, with \u201cfirst-class culinary experiences and a luxury atmosphere,\u201d along with performances by G.O.O.D. Music, Major Lazer, Migos and more.Promoted by Instagram influencers including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski as a never-before-seen V.I.P. event, the gathering \u2014 with weekend ticket packages starting around $1,200 and topping six-figures with extras \u2014 was supposed to compete in an increasingly elaborate landscape of boutique music festivals that have sprung up in the wake of Coachella.But when guests arrived on the island of Great Exuma for the inaugural weekend, they found something closer to \u201cSurvivor\u201d: grounds that were woefully lacking in the promised amenities, replaced instead by dirt fields, soggy tents and folding chairs.On social media, where Fyre Festival had been sold as a selfie-taker\u2019s paradise, accounts showed none of the aspirational A-lister excesses, with only sad sandwiches and free alcohol to placate the restless crowds. General disappointment soon turned to near-panic as the festival was canceled and attendees attempted to flee back to the mainland of Florida.\u201cNot one thing that was promised on the website was delivered,\u201d said Shivi Kumar, 33, who works in technology sales in New York, and came with a handful of friends expecting the deluxe \u201clodge\u201d package for which they had paid $3,500: four king size beds and a chic living room lounge. Instead Ms. Kumar and her crew were directed to a tent encampment. Some tents had beds, but some were still unfurnished. Directed by a festival employee to \u201cgrab a tent,\u201d attendees started running, she said.\u201cPeople were stealing beds out of other tents, \u201d she said. \u201cIt was just chaos. Nobody ever came in to check us in to our accommodations, if you can call it that, so they had no idea who was there and who wasn\u2019t.\u201dMs. Kumar, who arrived Thursday evening, couldn\u2019t get much sleep. \u201cThe tents didn\u2019t have any locks, the beds were damp, the blankets were soaked,\u201d from a storm the night before, she said.At one point in the evening, Ms. Kumar said, staff members dumped a bunch of unopened containers \u2014 like \u201cAmazon shipment boxes\u201d \u2014 at the site, and instructed concertgoers to rifle through them for anything that was missing from their tents. \u201cIt was everything from, like, bongos to floaties to sleeping bags,\u201d she said.On Friday, Ms. Kumar and her friends managed to get a room at a hotel, hitching a ride from a local. Taxis were hard to come by, in part because the festival had promoted itself as a cashless event, asking attendees to upload funds to digital wristbands instead. So people were stranded without money.By Friday morning, the festival, founded by the rapper Ja Rule and the tech entrepreneur Billy McFarland, was in damage-control mode. \u201cFyre Festival set out to provide a once-in-a-lifetime musical experience,\u201d the organizers said in a statement. \u201cDue to circumstances out of our control, the physical infrastructure was not in place on time and we are unable to fulfill on that vision safely and enjoyably for our guests.\u201d (A second weekend, planned to start May 5, was also scrapped.)\u201cWe are working to place everyone on complimentary charters back to Miami today,\u201d they added. \u201cWe ask for everyone\u2019s patience and cooperation during this difficult time, as we work as quickly and safely as we can to remedy this unforeseeable situation.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. McFarland, 25, called Friday \u201cthe hardest day of my life.\u201d He said the idea for the event had come to him last summer, after he and Ja Rule were forced to make an emergency landing in the Bahamas during a flying lesson in a \u201csmall, old plane.\u201d A social-media-fueled musical festival there, Mr. McFarland hoped, would combine three of his biggest passions: internet programming, the ocean and rap music.But the pair soon discovered logistical hurdles, including a lack of proper water systems and transportation. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t the infrastructure we needed. We attempted to build a city out of nothing,\u201d Mr. McFarland said. \u201cNeither of us had developed an island or a festival before.\u201dStill, after a few months of planning \u2014 including adding sewage piping and buying an ambulance in New Jersey and shipping it to the island \u2014 the organizers thought they were ready for the crowds until the storm on Thursday morning washed away some of what they had built.All customers for both weekends will be fully refunded, Mr. McFarland added. \u201c I definitely underestimated the challenges and the manpower we needed.\u201dJa Rule, who was performing in Chicago on Thursday night, posted a note to Twitter on Friday emphasizing that he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d about the turn of events and insisting that Fyre Festival was not meant to be \u201ca scam.\u201d He added, \u201cI truly apologize as this is NOT MY FAULT\u2026 but I\u2019m taking responsibility.\u201d (The rapper also deleted a number of posts that hyped the event from his Instagram page.)Attendees were told they could \u201cstart each day with morning yoga and guided meditation on the beach,\u201d while also enjoying \u201cmassages, henna tattooing, sound healing, chill-out sessions and a festive Bahamian junkanoo parade kicking off each weekend.\u201d Descriptions of the food options pledged \u201ca uniquely authentic island cuisine experience,\u201d with \u201clocal seafood, Bahamian-style sushi and even a pig roast.\u201dBut Mr. McFarland is not giving up on his dream of a top-tier, beachfront concert weekend. Fyre Festival, he said, would be reborn next May on a beach in the United States with one key difference: \u201cThe festival will be fully free for everybody who wants to attend.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Murder Posted on Facebook Prompts Outrage and Questions Over Responsibility", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Easter, Steve Stephens drove around downtown Cleveland on what he said was a mission to commit murder \u2014 and soon he had an audience of millions for his shooting of Robert Godwin Sr., 74, which he recorded and posted on Facebook, the police in Cleveland said.On Monday, the authorities nationwide were looking for Mr. Stephens, 37, with the police as far away as Philadelphia saying they had received calls about sightings of him in that area.Now Facebook is facing a backlash over the shooting video, as it grapples with its role in policing content on its global platform.The situation is increasingly fraught for Facebook. Even as it has become a forum for more sensational events, live and otherwise, it has said it does not want to be a media company that overly arbitrates what is posted on its site. But the more reluctant it is to intervene or the slower it is to respond, the more it may open itself to the posting of killings, sexual assaults and other crimes.\u201cAny of these platforms \u2014 especially live ones \u2014 encourages users to perform,\u201d said Elizabeth Joh, a law professor at the University of California, Davis. \u201cShould Facebook have a duty to rescue a crime victim? Should we, or is it O.K. for thousands or millions of people to watch a crime unfold without doing anything except sharing it?\u201d\u201cIt was a horrific crime \u2014 one that has no place on Facebook, and goes against our policies and everything we stand for,\u201d Mr. Osofsky wrote.But the attention is often focused on Facebook because of its nearly two billion users and global influence. It is an issue that is bedeviling Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive. Facebook has encouraged users to post more \u2014 it has spent the last two years emphasizing its push into photographs and video, underpinned by a thesis that cameras have become more important in how people share moments of their lives with their friends.The problems have been compounded by the issue of fake news \u2014 false stories across the social network that some Facebook users have taken as true and that may have swayed thinking in events like elections. Mr. Zuckerberg has had to address the fake news problem several times in recent months, including working more closely with fact-checking organizations and beginning efforts to teach Facebook users how to discern what is or is not a real news story.Initiatives such as Facebook Live have been embraced by Facebook users and advertisers. Video advertising, one of the largest growth areas for Facebook and others, commands a premium compared with traditional photo and text ad formats. The more users acclimate to posting and viewing video content across these platforms, the easier it will be for the companies to sell higher-priced advertisements against them.Yet monitoring the content is imperfect. Because Facebook\u2019s network of users is so vast, the company relies on a combination of artificial intelligence, human moderators and alerts from users to flag objectionable content. If many people report an instance of offensive or harmful content at once, Facebook\u2019s algorithms will show the post to a global team of human content moderators, who will review it and decide if it violates Facebook\u2019s terms of service.\u201cThe more users are posting every aspect of their lives online, including criminally heinous conduct, the more companies have to take a proactive approach to content moderation rather than relying just on users to flag content for review,\u201d said Hemanshu Nigam, founder of SSP Blue, an advisory company for online safety, security and privacy.\u201cFacebook does, however, work well with law enforcement, as is clear from the ongoing investigation and their active support in it,\u201d he said.Mr. Stephens\u2019s video on Facebook, which lasts about a minute, shows a driver pulling up to an older man on a sidewalk. The driver asks the man to say a person\u2019s name, then pulls out a gun and shoots the man. Afterward, the victim can be seen on the sidewalk, with a streak of what appears to be blood near his head.The police originally said that Mr. Stephens had broadcast the shooting on Facebook Live, but Facebook said that while he had posted a live video at some point on Sunday, the shooting itself was not live. By late Sunday afternoon, the video had been removed from Facebook and the account had been deactivated.In a second video that was posted on Facebook, Mr. Stephens explained his actions by saying, \u201cI\u2019m at the point where I snapped.\u201dA warrant was issued for Mr. Stephens on a charge of aggravated murder, and the police asked people in Indiana, Michigan, New York, northeast Ohio and Pennsylvania to be on alert. A $50,000 reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Christopher Mele from New York. Reporting was contributed by Niraj Chokshi and Matt Stevens from New York, Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Wonder Woman,\u2019 \u2018Spider-Man\u2019 and How Trailers Push the Familiar", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byThe summer blockbuster movie season kicks off when \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d hits multiplexes across America on Friday, May 5 \u2014 and it\u2019s a good time to take a look at the rest of the year\u2019s slate of big-screen superhero adventures.At this point, audiences have become familiar with the bright costumes, the computer-generated effects and the in-jokes for comic fans. And, in an added challenge for trailers, the summer films \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d don\u2019t represent their title characters\u2019 debuts on the silver screen \u2014 a trait shared by \u201cJustice League,\u201d which is slated for November.Here\u2019s how these three movies are trying to attract viewers to slightly familiar characters without feeling too formulaic.The new movie, due in June and directed by Patty Jenkins, looks like it will fill in the gaps. The first official trailer opened with a shot of Diana Prince, Wonder Woman\u2019s alter ego, looking at an old black-and-white photograph and reflecting on her past. The most recent preview, released in March, ditches the framing device and dives into her history even further, explicitly positioning the film as a conventional superhero origin story.The signal starts immediately, presenting a young Diana with a challenge she has to conquer. It\u2019s a classic biopic technique to make the chronological scope clear. Diana\u2019s mother tells her she\u2019s not fierce enough to wield a sword from the gods. Over the next two minutes, she proves otherwise.Challenge after challenge unfolds, and Diana rises to meet them, discovering her inner superhero one battle at a time. Piece by piece, the trailer rolls out the classic Wonder Woman symbols: First the indestructible bracelets, then the sword and the shield and, of course, the lasso of truth. By the end of the trailer, Diana strides into battle in full red-and-blue regalia, and her journey is complete.In a crucial moment, Steve steps in front of Diana to protect her from a gunfight. But with the flick of a wrist, she is the one who saves him. The scene makes it instantly clear that Diana is not the typical damsel in distress of past comic-book adaptations. Steve looks suitably impressed; audiences probably will be, too.That may be why the trailer for \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming,\u201d which arrived in March, doesn\u2019t waste time on introductions. In 15 seconds, it establishes that Peter Parker has a high-tech suit and some powers, and that he knows how to use them. Then it skips to establishing a major setback in his heroic journey instead of explaining how he became a web-slinging crime fighter.As a result, the preview feels as if it\u2019s heralding a Spider-Man sequel rather than the first installment of a reboot. When Peter\u2019s in the back of a car with Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man), we don\u2019t get any details of their shared history. (Tony is the one who gave Peter the suit.) The trailer doesn\u2019t give much insight into the film\u2019s villain or elaborate on its occasional references to Avengers movies past.Instead, it sets up a mentor-mentee dynamic for Peter and Tony, one that frays as Peter finds himself in a situation that he can\u2019t handle. Suddenly, the confidence he shows in the trailer\u2019s well-chosen first sequence is destroyed. That, in turn, is what raises the stakes and suspense in the subsequent action footage, which shows Spider-Man trying to restore his former glory and return to the status quo the trailer established so quickly. Unlike with Wonder Woman, whose future has already been glimpsed onscreen, it\u2019s not quite as clear whether Peter Parker will succeed.If introducing or reintroducing a hero who is suddenly headlining his own movie is a challenge, the trailer for \u201cJustice League\u201d has to highlight five of them. The film is both a sequel to \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d and the origin story of the crime-fighting team that lends the new movie its title. Its muddled preview tries to split the difference.Like the trailer for \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming,\u201d the preview for \u201cJustice League\u201d jumps into the familiar, using as a framing device a conversation between Wonder Woman and Batman (that\u2019s Ben Affleck this time, not Christian Bale). They allude to a vague threat, giving the trailer its only real sense of intrigue, before getting right to the point: the other heroes who are joining their superhuman team.One by one, shots of Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and the Flash (Ezra Miller) pop up, accompanied by snippets of bios in voice-overs. These three had cameos in \u201cBatman v Superman,\u201d but audiences were told even less about them than they learned about Wonder Woman. In this case, the trailer for \u201cJustice League\u201d offers glimpses that are a preamble to a group shot of the new team.There\u2019s not much more on display here; what follows are big, sweeping action sequences that take the audience\u2019s familiarity with these characters as a given. All five heroes get to shine in fight scenes as a cover of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cCome Together\u201d blares. But the characters hardly do; shot after shot shows them fighting in isolation, exhibiting their powers and helping what appears to be the movie\u2019s sixth star: C.G.I.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Osage Indians Struck It Rich, Then Paid the Price", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesIf you taught the artificial brains of supercomputers at IBM Research to write nonfiction prose, and if they got very good at it, they might compose a book like David Grann\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.\u201dThis is not entirely a complaint. Grann\u2019s new book, about how dozens of members of the Osage Indian nation in Oklahoma in the 1920s were shot, poisoned or blown to bits by rapacious whites who coveted the oil under their land, is close to impeccable. It\u2019s confident, fluid in its dynamics, light on its feet.That was a book with a personality. It seemed to be written by someone who was, as Charles Lamb said of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, an archangel a little damaged. There was some strange junk in its cupboards.\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d has cleaner lines, and it didn\u2019t set its hooks in me in the same way. But the crime story it tells is appalling, and stocked with authentic heroes and villains. It will make you cringe at man\u2019s inhumanity to man.About America\u2019s native people, Saul Bellow wrote in a 1957 essay, \u201cThey have left their bones, their flints and pots, their place names and tribal names and little besides except a stain, seldom vivid, on the consciousness of their white successors.\u201dThe best thing about Grann\u2019s book is that it stares, hard, at that stain, and makes it vivid indeed.\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d describes how the Osage people were driven from their lands in Kansas onto a rocky portion of northwestern Oklahoma \u2014 out of sight, out of mind. It became apparent within a few decades, however, that immense oil deposits pooled below those Oklahoma rocks.The Osage people became wealthy from leasing their mineral rights; so wealthy that white America, stoked by a racist and sensationalistic press, went into a moral panic, a collective puritanical shudder.\u201cJournalists told stories,\u201d Grann writes, \u201coften wildly embroidered, of Osage who discarded grand pianos on their lawns or replaced old cars with new ones after getting a flat tire.\u201d A reporter from Harper\u2019s Monthly Magazine wrote, ominously: \u201cThe Osage Indians are becoming so rich that something will have to be done about it.\u201dSomething was done about it. The federal government appointed white guardians to monitor many of the Osage members\u2019 spending habits. Even tiny purchases had to be authorized. The chicanery and graft were remarkable. Then things got worse.Tribe members began to be killed. They were, in the evocative words of a reporter at the time, \u201cshot in lonely pastures, bored by steel as they sat in their automobiles, poisoned to die slowly, and dynamited as they slept in their homes.\u201dFew if any of these crimes were solved. Who cared about, Grann writes, using the intolerant lingo of the times, a \u201cdead Injun\u201d?\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d builds to a cinematic court scene filled with outrages and recantations. White gets his man, a local cattleman and a figure of genuine evil. But it is among Grann\u2019s larger points that these murders were hardly the work of one human. It took a village \u2014 a \u201cculture of killing,\u201d in his words \u2014 to eliminate this many people.The government estimated that 24 Osage members were murdered. As Grann pores over the evidence, however, he realizes the number was almost certainly higher, perhaps in the hundreds.He spends time with the descendants of some of those killed, and he pokes through old files and turns up new information. His own outrage, though kept at a simmer, is unmistakable. \u201cWhile researching the murders,\u201d he writes, \u201cI often felt that I was chasing history even as it was slipping away.\u201dThe period photographs in \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d are exceptional in their impact; they bore into you. If the book has a heroine, it is an Osage woman named Mollie Burkhart, whose sisters and other family members are picked off one by one. The beautiful and implacable faces of Mollie and her brown-eyed sisters gaze, as if in accusation, across the ages.This never came to pass. Grann\u2019s book investigates one painful splinter of America\u2019s treatment of its native people, and it snips the question mark off Ross\u2019s title.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With a Hollywood Writers\u2019 Strike Looming, Here\u2019s What to Know", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The threat of a Hollywood strike is getting real.A strike would have serious implications. When writers walked out a decade ago, the impasse cost the Los Angeles economy an estimated $2.5 billion. As production halted, income dried up not only for writers but also for set decorators, caterers, limo drivers and florists. Fans were not thrilled, either, as television schedules became a sea of reruns.Here is what you need to know this time around. How likely is a strike?Longtime Hollywood power players \u2014 agents, studio executives, labor lawyers \u2014 put the chance at roughly 51 percent. But it changes by the day. How would it affect television?Late-night comedy shows would instantly revert to reruns. Summer reality shows, such as \u201cBig Brother,\u201d would arrive \u2014 the writer-producers who work on them have a different contract \u2014 but some scripted series scheduled for the fall would most likely be delayed. A strike could be a death knell for daytime soap operas, which rely on a new episode almost every weekday, unless producers bring in nonunion writers, which happened during the last strike.What about movies?At first, it would be business as usual. Because big-budget event films take years to make, summer movies would continue to arrive on schedule. Films with finished scripts \u2014 and perhaps some with not-so-finished ones \u2014 would continue to go into production. Movie executives really started to sweat the last writers\u2019 strike, which took place in the winter, only when it threatened to derail the Academy Awards, a crucial marketing platform.How long could a strike go on?Anybody\u2019s guess. The Writers Guild walked out for 100 days in 2007-8 and 155 days in 1988. In both cases, the most in-demand writers eventually got tired of losing income and applied pressure to wrap it up. (Thousands of guild members are unemployed in any given year.)Why are writers upset? With the boom in scripted television shows, isn\u2019t there more work than ever?There are definitely more union-made series \u2014 at least 300 last season, or about 40 percent more than two years before that. But networks are ordering fewer episodes per season (10 to 13) than in the past (22 to 24). So a series writing job pays less.At the same time, in a contract provision known as exclusivity, most TV writers can write for only one series at a time, taking them off the market for up to a year. And to top it off, reruns don\u2019t attract very many viewers anymore, limiting residual payments.What does the union want?Negotiators started with a laundry list of requests, including easing that exclusivity rule, but it boils down to raises and bigger payments from studios for the guild\u2019s health plan.Why won\u2019t studios give it to them?Studios are also adamant that writers agree to fundamental changes in how the union health plan functions to avoid future bailout demands.Why is it always the writers who go on strike?As a rule, the directors are well paid and feel valued by entertainment companies, and the actors\u2019 union can be a bag of infighting cats. That leaves the writers.According to historians, the friction between \u201cscribes\u201d and studios dates to the end of the silent film era. Studios suddenly needed writers to provide witty dialogue, so they imported wordsmiths from New York. But they treated writers \u2014 or at least many writers have felt this way ever since \u2014 as expendable stenographers.Put another way, writers see their craft as artistic expression. For the most part, studios see it as commerce.An article on Tuesday about a potential walkout by the Writers Guild of America misstated the year of a previous strike. It was 1988, not 1998.Advertisement"}

Barriers to entry are low, yes, and access to information is at a high, but it is still perilously easy for a small business to remain small.That won\u2019t stop people from making things and hoping they catch on, trying to will a tiny niche into a mass market. But it emphasizes all of the steps in the chain separating the would-bes from the breakthrough successes.Into that maw have stepped a small number of intermediary companies: Big Cartel, Shopify and also Tictail, which appears to be the least utilitarian of the bunch. Tictail\u2019s users tend toward the aesthetically appealing, with a refined approach that is more art gallery than factory. Of these services, Tictail has the most unified sense of self.

On the clothing racks that dominate one side of the store, there were several styles of a desert-rose print by Selva\\Negra, which featured hand-drawn squiggles and plants and a girl wearing a top but no bottom (about $180 to $450); and also some eccentric looks from Victor von Schwarz, a designer interested in oversize and elegantly accented silhouettes. Scattered around the room were various shoes, including sharp ones by LAX, handmade in Tel Aviv, including medium-heel boots in loud black-and-white with assuredly pointed toes, and also stern-looking snakeskin platform loafers ($399) by Reschia, from Stockholm.Smaller items were gathered around the register, like a series of sharp geometric earrings, including squares in gold-plated silver ($36), by Plateaux Jewellry; a couple of books by Lydo Le, including the resilient and surprising \u201cSome Feelings,\u201d a series of anti-gnomic declarations of internet-era confusion ($15); and some eccentric fringe to attach to the top of your shoes, made by Raoulle ($42). Up near the ceiling were a collection of umbrellas with scenes by Tictail-approved artists on the undersides ($48), and underneath them was a display of luminous and humorous silk scarves by Tal Drori and Centinelle.By and large, these items felt like obvious candidates to make the leap from small audience to large, though in some cases the handmade feel of the objects felt like obstacles to scaling a business \u2014 like the lovely oversize hot-pink perfectly knit scarf that had an almost serpentine luxury, or the jewelry by Bagavundas in which thin wisps of silver or brass were wrapped around thread spools ($65 to $115).Tictail is the rare retail intermediary for whom a real-world shop makes sense; it is a middleman for products that benefit from tactile assessment. (SoundCloud and Bandcamp are unlikely to open record stores anytime soon; Netflix will almost certainly not open a movie theater, though Amazon has indicated a growing interest in retail locations.) But even though this store does an admirable job of displaying the range of the company\u2019s offerings, it is unclear whether it can stand on its own, or only makes sense as a loss leader that proselytizes for Tictail\u2019s platform.Whatever the case, this store makes a more aggressive argument for Tictail\u2019s users \u2014 the small creators of the world \u2014 than for its own business. On a wall at the rear of the store, there are tiny fliers with, on one side, loving photographs of the various artisans carried by the store, and descriptions of their wares and their aesthetic intentions on the other. They\u2019re like baseball cards for the various Greenpoint-like neighborhoods all over the world. Collect them all! You never know which rookie will go on to become an all-star.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Google Cashes In on the Space Right Under the Search Bar", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Before Sergey Brin and Larry Page founded Google, they wrote a research paper as doctoral students at Stanford University in which they questioned the appropriateness of ads on search engines.How times change. Two decades later, it\u2019s not unusual for a smartphone user to see only ads on a Google search page before scrolling down to the regular results.When Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, reports earnings this week, the internet giant\u2019s big profits are expected to demonstrate yet again that the billboard space accompanying Google queries is the web\u2019s most valuable real estate for advertisements.In the 17 years since Google introduced text-based advertising above search results, the company has allocated more space to ads and created new forms of them. The ad creep on Google has pushed \u201corganic\u201d (unpaid) search results farther down the screen, an effect even more pronounced on the smaller displays of smartphones.The changes are profound for retailers and brands that rely on leads from Google searches to drive online sales. With limited space available near the top of search results, not advertising on search terms associated with your brand or displaying images of your products is tantamount to telling potential customers to spend their money elsewhere.In recent years, Google has served more product ads and expanded their availability to more general search terms \u2014 for example, showing photo ads on a search for \u201crunning shoes,\u201d not just \u201cNike Air Max.\u201d It has also tinkered with the size, location and number of ads on results pages for both computers and smartphones.Retailers are snapping up product ads. They accounted for 52 percent of all Google search ad spending by retailers in the first quarter of 2017, versus 8 percent in 2011, according to the digital marketing agency Merkle.\u201cP.L.A.s takes the search engine results page to a different level,\u201d said Andy Taylor, Merkle\u2019s associate director of research.A Google spokeswoman said the company\u2019s goal had always been to quickly give people the best search results.\u201cOur goal has always been to deliver results that people find immediately useful, which is even more important on mobile devices with smaller screens,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Chi Hea Cho. \u201cFor most queries, we show no ads, and we recently removed right-hand text ads for all queries. For highly commercial queries, our extensive testing shows that people find relevant ads and offers extremely useful.\u201dOn a search result, Reef is competing with other manufacturers of flip-flops, as well as retail partners selling Reef sandals. On a desktop computer, a Google search for \u201cReef flip-flops\u201d brought back three text ads above the search results \u2014 one from Reef, one from Zappos and one from Amazon \u2014 selling Reef sandals. There were also nine image-based product listing ads displaying different Reef sandals for sale; only three were offered by reef.com while the rest were ads from other retailers.On a mobile phone, Reef is competing with even more retailers. The same search brought back only Reef\u2019s text ad, but below a scrolling carousel featuring more than 20 image ads for different types of Reef flip-flops. Only the first two images linked to reef.com.\u201cWe\u2019re competing against each other,\u201d Jessica Levens, director of e-commerce at Reef, said about the company\u2019s retail partners. \u201cWe need to spend the dollars to defend that real estate.\u201dMs. Levens said the advertising strategy was effective, although she had to convince her chief financial officer about the wisdom of spending more. Those product campaigns helped triple sales that started from online queries, including instances where customers searched without including the Reef brand name.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to rely simply on organic\u201d search, said Caitlin Aylward, a senior associate at L2, a research and advisory firm for consumer brands. \u201cThe winner in all this is Google.\u201dAndreas Reiffen, chief executive of the search engine marketing firm Crealytics, said Google\u2019s revenue from P.L.A.s on smartphones was more than double its revenue from text ads, because it can place three product ads in the same space as a single text ad, and consumers are more likely to click on image-based ads than text-based ones.The rise of product ads is also a reflection of a shift to people doing more searches on mobile phones. Google\u2019s mobile searches surpassed desktop queries for the first time last year. That\u2019s important for product ads, because P.L.A.s take up a larger proportion of phone displays, and Google increased the size of those mobile ads in 2015 to make them stand out even more.Alphabet doesn\u2019t break out revenue from search ads, but growth in paid clicks on Google\u2019s web properties \u2014 search, Gmail and YouTube, among others \u2014 is accelerating. It rose 40 percent last year, after an increase of 33 percent in 2015. At the same time, the average price of Google ads fell 13 percent in 2016, in part because mobile ads and P.L.A.s are less expensive than traditional desktop text ads.While retailers and brands may feel like they have no choice but to spend on search advertising, many do so willingly because it works. Kristi Argyilan, a senior vice president of marketing at Target, said search advertising was accounting for a larger portion of her digital spending because the ads were \u201cbecoming so useful\u201d and more relevant.Traffic from product listing ads accounted for more than 10 percent of sales on Target\u2019s website, while information in the ads, like whether a nearby store has inventory of a popular product, has provided important information to consumers.\u201cThe ads are becoming more purposeful,\u201d Ms. Argyilan said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "From \u2018Zombie Malls\u2019 to Bonobos: What America\u2019s Retail Transformation Looks Like", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Physical temples to commerce remain, but today the online experience is rapidly changing our relationship with shopping.Supported byIn central New Jersey, monuments to retail\u2019s changing fortunes can be found within a short drive of each other, helping document the past, present and the future of shopping.When the Burlington Center Mall opened in Burlington Township in 1982, it meant shoppers did not have to travel to downtown Trenton or even Philadelphia for the latest fashions, children\u2019s high chairs or gas-powered lawn mowers. Thirty-five years later, the edifice still stands, but the mall is barely there. After Macy\u2019s and J. C. Penney closed, it was only a matter of time before smaller stores began shutting their doors for good.About 20 miles to the north, on what was once farmland, there is a beehive of activity. In the predawn light, buses pick up and drop off workers who enter a gigantic low-slung building.At Amazon\u2019s fulfillment center in Robbinsville, N.J., more than 4,000 people and an indeterminate number of robots store, pick, pack and ship the company\u2019s countless inventory, sometimes for same-day delivery. Inside the building, 10 miles of conveyor belts are the veins and arteries of this outpost of the e-commerce giant.Following in Amazon\u2019s giant footsteps, other e-commerce companies are providing a more specialized retail service.In Cranbury, a 15-minute drive from Robbinsville, Wayfair, an online retailer that focuses on home goods, has a warehouse that covers 1.2 million square feet and stands 40 feet tall.The inventory ranges from teakettles to brass beds, all stored on shelves and available for two-day free shipping. The idea is that you can buy your next couch without getting up from your couch.But for all the attention and urgency that online shopping attracts, the vast majority of purchases are still made in person, in places like Kmart in Hamilton Township, before a checkout counter, with a purse or wallet in hand.In the last three months of 2016, Americans spent $102.7 billion in online sales, which was 8.3 percent of the overall total of $1.24 trillion in retail sales. Many of those dollars were spent at strip malls, sometimes known as power centers in the trade.But don\u2019t confuse familiarity with success. Sears, which owns Kmart stores, announced in January it would close 109 Kmart locations. And last month, its parent company said there was \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d that it could continue operating.Stories like these mean that we are increasingly confronted with the carcasses of retail\u2019s past.\u201cZombie malls,\u201d as they are known, are increasingly dotting the suburban landscape. The lights are on, the escalators keep moving, but their purpose in life has gone. Burlington Center has less than 20 tenants \u2014 including a Sears and a Foot Locker \u2014 but once had more than 100. Last Wednesday a woman came to the mall looking for shoes, and left frustrated because the Payless store had just shuttered.Not all Americans, however, have given up on malls, and for a handful of properties around the country, times have never been so good.About an hour north of Burlington Center is the Mall at Short Hills, in Millburn Township, which boasts four big-name anchors \u2014 Bloomingdale\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom \u2014 as well as stores like Tiffany & Co. and Bulgari. Shoppers can arrange for same-day home delivery of purchases; for those wanting to stay longer, the mall helpfully offers a list of nearby hotels and inns.The Mall at Short Hills is part of a rare breed, benefiting from a wealthy demographic (the Millburn, Morristown and Summit areas) and an evolving lineup of tenants and services. Of the more than 1,300 malls analyzed by Green Street Advisors, a research and advisory firm, it is one of only about 35 to attain an A++ rating, based on metrics like sales per square foot, quality of anchor tenants and other factors.The buying experience continues to morph. In just the past decade, cheaper internet access and the arrival of smartphones pushed traditional retailers onto the web. Now, some of these web retailers are beginning to cross back into the brick-and-mortar world. Amazon has opened a handful of bookstores, appealing to those who like to touch and feel (and smell?) their books before buying.Bonobos, an online retailer of men\u2019s clothing, is further blurring these distinctions. Saying \u201cit\u2019s not the perfect fit before you try it on,\u201d Bonobos has opened more than 30 shops around the country where customers can try on clothes and find the best fit.But you don\u2019t walk out of the store with your purchase \u2014 instead, you walk out empty-handed. What you bought is shipped to your door.The atmosphere was hushed in a Bonobos store in Manhattan this past week. Shoppers tend to make appointments, a representative said, and weekends can become especially busy.One reason for the success of some retail operations are property owners who can \u201cpivot to meet market demands,\u201d said DJ Busch, managing director at Green Street Advisors. \u201cThose are the ones that can weather the changes in the marketplace.\u201d This often means more emphasis on dining and entertainment. For failing malls, Mr. Busch said, it could mean sacrificing mall space for office or residential development.An earlier version of this article misstated where an Amazon fulfillment center in Robbinsville, N.J., is, relative to Burlington Center Mall. The Amazon site is north of Burlington Township, not south.Additional production by Whitney RichardsonAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Steve Ballmer Serves Up a Fascinating Data Trove", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byDealBookGuess what Steven A. Ballmer has been up to for the last several years. (No, not just cheering for the basketball team he owns, the Los Angeles Clippers.) It\u2019s a novel project, and he plans to take the wrapping off it Tuesday.But first the back story, which is a valuable prelude to a description of the project itself.When Mr. Ballmer retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014, he was only 57 and quickly realized \u201cI don\u2019t, quote, \u2018have anything to do.\u2019\u201dAs he looked for a new endeavor \u2014 before he decided to buy the Clippers \u2014 his wife, Connie, encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic efforts, an idea he initially rejected.\u201cBut come on, doesn\u2019t the government take care of the poor, the sick, the old?\u201d Mr. Ballmer recalled telling her. After all, he pointed out, he happily paid a lot of taxes, and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net.Her answer: \u201cA, it won\u2019t, because there are things government doesn\u2019t get to, and B, you\u2019re missing it.\u201dMr. Ballmer replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201dThat conversation led Mr. Ballmer to pursue what may be one of the most ambitious private projects undertaken to answer a question that has long vexed the public and politicians alike. He sought to \u201cfigure out what the government really does with the money,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cWhat really happens?\u201dWant to know how many police officers are employed in various parts of the country and compare that against crime rates? Want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking tickets and the cost to collect? Want to know what percentage of Americans suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it? That\u2019s in there. You can slice the numbers in all sorts of ways.Mr. Ballmer calls it \u201cthe equivalent of a 10-K for government,\u201d referring to the kind of annual filing that companies make.\u201cYou know, when I really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing, Amazon or Apple, I\u2019d get their 10-K and read it,\u201d he told me in a recent interview in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s wonky, it\u2019s this, it\u2019s that, but it\u2019s the greatest depth you\u2019re going to get, and it\u2019s accurate.\u201dIn an age of fake news and questions about how politicians and others manipulate data to fit their biases, Mr. Ballmer\u2019s project may serve as a powerful antidote. Using his website, USAFacts.org, a person could look up just about anything: How much revenue do airports take in and spend? What percentage of overall tax revenue is paid by corporations? At the very least, it could settle a lot of bets made during public policy debates at the dinner table.\u201cI would like citizens to be able to use this to form intelligent opinions,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cPeople can disagree about what to do \u2014 I\u2019m not going to tell people what to do.\u201d But, he said, people ought to base their opinions \u201con common data sets that are believable.\u201dSo how exactly does one go about collecting and ordering the nation\u2019s data?Before he started, Mr. Ballmer was convinced someone must have already done this.His first instinct, naturally, was to go to a search engine. \u201cMy favorite one, of course: I go to Bing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, I check it with Google, just to make sure there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m missing.\u201dBut neither option led him to what he was looking for.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at federal, state and local together,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a citizen, I don\u2019t care whether I give my money to A, B or C. I just want to know how it lands, how it impacts what\u2019s going on.\u201dWith an unlimited budget, he went about hiring a team of researchers in Seattle and made a grant to the University of Pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together. Altogether, he has spent more than $10 million between direct funding and grants.\u201cLet\u2019s say it costs three, four, five million a year,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to fund the damn thing.\u201dFor Mr. Ballmer, the experience has been worth every cent simply for the surprises that he has discovered looking at the data.\u201cI love this one!\u201d he said, showing me a slide of information about government employees. \u201cDon\u2019t look, don\u2019t look!\u201d He instructed me to cover my eyes from the number at the bottom of the page.\u201cHow many people work for government in the United States?\u201d he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. \u201cAlmost 24 million. Would you have guessed that?\u201d\u201cThen people say, \u2018Those damn bureaucrats!\u2019\u201d Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. \u201cWell, let\u2019s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education \u2014 they are government employees.\u201d And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows.\u201cAnd you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?\u201d Mr. Ballmer continued. \u201cWell, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201dSuddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we\u2019re very glad to have.\u201cNow people might not think they\u2019re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people \u2014 and most of these people you like,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said.His other big surprises?\u201cMost of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded,\u201d Mr. Ballmer said, referring to various efforts to fight poverty that he has supported. \u201cI mean it\u2019s funny, but I didn\u2019t realize all these not-for-profits were in a sense almost like government contractors.\u201dMr. Ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical. He has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle. But as he speaks, you can tell that some of his findings from the new data \u2014 which rebut his preconceptions \u2014 could change his own politics.At one point, as he showed me the value of certain tax deductions and blurted out, \u201cIf you look at these tax deductions for employer-provided health or for state and local taxes or mortgage-interest deductions, they\u2019re really subsidies to the affluent, which I guess I hadn\u2019t thought about them.\u201d\u201cTake the mortgage deduction,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes. That is worth, to a middle-income family, a hundred bucks a year. I was a little surprised by that. You can have your own reaction; I was a little surprised by that.\u201dOne rule Mr. Ballmer said his team made early on was to use only government data \u2014 no outside providers \u2014 to avoid accusations of bias. But this created its own challenges.For example, Mr. Ballmer, said: \u201cYou know it\u2019s not legal to know how many firearms that are in this country? The government is not allowed to collect the number.\u201dThere is data for the number of firearms manufactured, licenses, inspections, \u201calong with other data, but not a total,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t show it! I\u2019m shocked! But the N.R.A. apparently has lobbied in such a way government can\u2019t report the data.\u201dMr. Ballmer is hoping that the website is just the beginning. He hopes to open it up so that individuals and companies can build on top of it and pull out customized reports.\u201cWe\u2019re making philanthropic donations elsewhere \u2014 I think of this as another,\u201d he said, referring to himself and his wife. \u201cI don\u2019t even deduct this for my taxes. I pay this with after-tax money, no pretax money, because I don\u2019t want anybody being able to think that factors in. But I feel like it\u2019s a civic contribution more than anything else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

O.K. Google, what is the Whopper burger?\u201dPrompted by the phrase \u201cO.K.

{"Headline": "As Zeal for China Dims, Global Companies Complain More Boldly", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 When Amazon announced its entry into the Chinese cloud computing market last year, Chinese state media celebrated it as \u201ca strong signal\u201d that \u201cthere is tremendous room for foreign firms to expand in the Chinese market as long as they comply with local regulations.\u201dToday, cloud computing is the latest area of contention between China and increasingly frustrated global companies.In late March, a group of more than 50 American lawmakers sent a letter to the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, taking direct aim at China\u2019s restrictions on cloud computing. They wrote that current and draft regulations would force the transfer of valuable intellectual property to Chinese companies and effectively bar foreign cloud service providers \u201cfrom operating or competing fairly in China.\u201d\u201cAs we see it,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, \u201cthese restrictions are fundamentally protectionist and anticompetitive.\u201d Many of the lawmakers hail from states where two major cloud computing players, Amazon and Microsoft, have operations.Big global companies, which have long worked to keep from rocking the boat in China, are showing a bit more tolerance for making waves. The business groups that represent them have become more critical of China\u2019s industrial policies and ambitions. Businesses are increasingly complaining to friendly lawmakers, and those lawmakers have become more vocal on their behalf.Profiles in courage are still hard to find, as businesses fear Chinese retaliation if they complain directly or too loudly. For example, among the companies that would benefit most from any shift in China\u2019s cloud computing regulations, Microsoft, through a spokesman, declined to comment, and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.The shift is also a gradual one, taking place in the years since the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, as the promise of a more open China faded. Still, people in business circles in China say the sense of disappointment in China\u2019s business prospects is growing.\u201cThe enthusiasm is gone,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. \u201cForeign businesses here used to be very excited about China and quite enthusiastic. Now, it\u2019s kind of a grind and a battle.\u201dChina remains a lucrative market for foreign-branded cars, iPhones, high-value engineering equipment and other costly items. Still, the growing frustration has muddled the corporate response to President Trump\u2019s tough anti-China rhetoric.\u201cThere are companies, which in prior years have been strong supporters in Washington of the U.S.-China relationship, who are much quieter, and even waiting to see if a tougher approach might get more results with China,\u201d said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council.\u201cIf the United States gives concessions in the trade area so that we don\u2019t push as hard on leveling the playing field in all these different areas,\u201d Mr. Zarit said at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday, \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame.\u201dIn public, businesses work hard to strike a sunny note. Last November, Jay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for global corporate affairs and former White House spokesman, made no mention of his company\u2019s challenges there when speaking at China\u2019s World Internet Conference, according to a Chinese-language transcript of his remarks in state media.That reticence has bred frustration among some United States officials. In 2015, President Barack Obama told the Business Roundtable, a business group, regarding its complaints about China, \u201cDon\u2019t tell us on the side, \u2018We\u2019ve got this problem, you need to look into it, but then \u2014 but leave our names out of it.\u2019\u201dStill, executives say complaining can have an impact. Earlier that same year, Mr. Obama publicly criticized proposed Chinese rules that would require technology companies to turn over encryption keys to Chinese authorities. His administration had also expressed concern about Chinese draft regulations that would require China\u2019s financial sector buy only from \u201csecure and controllable\u201d suppliers, which trade groups said effectively meant Chinese companies. In both cases China relented, temporarily scrapping the banking laws and tempering the language in the antiterrorism law.Some intermediaries between business and China are pushing the government to do even more.\u201cCountries need to be persuaded. Words don\u2019t do it,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former United States ambassador to China, adding that the United States needs to use \u201cproperly targeted\u201d leverage.\u201cI don\u2019t think the United States has done much of that,\u201d Mr. Baucus said. \u201cWe need to have a more strategic economic approach to China.\u201dHe said Mr. Obama had raised the issue of American companies\u2019 unequal access to the Chinese market repeatedly with Beijing, but these appeals were \u201cinsufficient.\u201dOf all the sectors that China has set its sights on, tech has come under the most pressure. Services like Facebook and Twitter have long been blocked. Last November, China passed a cybersecurity law that would impose security checks on companies in industries like finance and communications and mandatory in-country data storage. In 2015, the American chip maker Qualcomm said it would pay $975 million for violating China\u2019s antimonopoly law. In 2016, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. In the same year, China said it would demand answers to new questions about Microsoft\u2019s business practices in the country.In cloud computing, China mandates that foreign companies work with a local partner, and the foreign companies are subject to equity restrictions that prevent them from owning a controlling stake in the cloud company. New draft regulations would make it even more difficult for them to get licenses for operation, block them from using their brands and logos to market their services and require them to \u201cterminate the transmission of\u201d and report any information posted or transmitted by users that \u201cviolates relevant Chinese laws and regulations.\u201dIn China, the cloud computing market is estimated to be worth $20 billion by 2020, up from $1.5 billion in 2013, according to the consulting group Bain. Both Amazon and Microsoft operate in China through partnerships with local companies. In contrast, Aliyun, the cloud services unit of the Chinese web giant Alibaba, has its own data centers in the United States.For decades, Western companies have stood with China even during rocky moments in the Sino-American relationship. When Congress threatened to revoke China\u2019s most-favored-nation trading status in the 1990s because of concerns over human rights, the American Chamber of Commerce in China, or AmCham, headed to Washington to defend Beijing.More recently, the complaints from Western companies have gotten louder, as China\u2019s economic growth slows and unease grows about Beijing\u2019s failure to deliver on its promise to open markets for foreign companies as well as its Made in China 2025 plan to push for greater self-sufficiency in several industries. AmCham\u2019s 2016 survey of its members showed that 81 percent of its companies felt less welcome in China than before, up from 77 percent in 2015. The survey also showed that 31 percent of its members said the investment environment was deteriorating \u2014 the most pessimistic response AmCham has received since it started asking the question in 2011.\u201cChina\u2019s heavy emphasis on building global champions through industrial policies is spiking new levels of concern about China\u2019s commitment to a mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d said Jeremie Waterman, senior director for the Greater China region for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Mr. Zarit, of AmCham, said a \u201cmixed bag\u201d of companies were unhappy about the investment climate in China, adding that \u201cthey are afraid if anything is done, it will upset the apple cart.\u201dMr. Zarit, who led a delegation of eight former AmCham chairmen to meet with the Trump administration officials in Washington in February, said there was a new realization in Washington \u201cthat this asymmetrical commercial relationship needs to be addressed in some way.\u201dMr. McGregor, who was on the trip, said they met Peter Navarro, a strident China critic in charge of trade and industrial policy, and Matthew Pottinger, Mr. Trump\u2019s top Asia policy maker. There, the delegation pushed the concept of reciprocity, meaning that if American companies are bound by restrictions in China, their Chinese counterparts should be subject to the same limits in the United States.Mr. McGregor said the idea got \u201cquite a bit of traction.\u201d He added, \u201cOur attitude is China should be treated as an equal, and an equal needs reciprocity.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Facebook Loses Appeal to Block Bulk Search Warrants", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byNew York State\u2019s highest court dealt a blow to Facebook and other social media companies seeking to expand privacy protections, ruling on Tuesday that Facebook had no right to ask an appellate court to quash search warrants ordering the company to hand over information from hundreds of accounts in a disability fraud case.The state Court of Appeals, in a 5-to-1 decision, with one judge recusing himself, upheld lower court rulings that New York law does not allow a social media company to appeal a judge\u2019s decision to issue search warrants in a criminal case, even if the company believes those warrants violate the constitutional rights of its users.The Facebook case is part of a broader battle between the government and technology companies over the limits on law enforcement requests for data under the federal Stored Communications Act. Much of that fight is playing out in New York.The ruling was a setback for civil libertarians and social media companies hoping the court might create new legal guidelines for search warrants aimed at seizing all the information in electronic accounts, treating them more like civil subpoenas, which can be challenged as overly broad before they are executed.But Judge Leslie E. Stein, writing for the majority, said state courts had held for decades that search warrants issued by judges cannot be appealed to a higher court. Instead, they may be challenged by a defendant only during a pretrial hearing, as illegal searches.\u201cIndeed, to hold otherwise would be to impermissibly and judicially create a right to appeal in a criminal matter that has not been authorized by our Legislature,\u201d Judge Stein wrote in her 25-page decision.She acknowledged that Facebook had presented the court with \u201cnovel and important substantive issues regarding the constitutional rights of privacy and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure\u201d but said the court was \u201cconstrained by law\u201d to dismiss the company\u2019s appeal. Because search warrants cannot be appealed, she said, the court did not need to rule on Facebook\u2019s central contention \u2014 that the warrants were so sweeping they amounted to an unconstitutional search.One judge dissented: Judge Rowan D. Wilson, who argued that the federal law authorizing the warrants \u2014 the Stored Communications Act of 1986 \u2014 did not distinguish between warrants and subpoenas. In his reading, that statute gives service providers a right to appeal all overly broad court orders, including search warrants. \u201cState rules of procedures applicable to garden-variety warrants cannot be used as a device to contravene or frustrate federal law,\u201d he wrote.Judge Wilson noted that the framers of the State Constitution in 1938 had specifically warned against the invasion of privacy in electronic communications. \u201cThe New York Constitution commands us to guard vigilantly against that evil,\u201d he said. He characterized the warrants as \u201cauthorizing the seizure of private information en masse,\u201d including deleted content and content shared by users not under investigation.The case \u2014 known formally as In Re 381 Search Warrants Directed to Facebook Inc. \u2014 had been closely watched as a test as Facebook sought to expand its ability to fight what it sees as fishing expeditions by prosecutors. Several tech giants, including Google, LinkedIn, Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter, filed amicus briefs, as did the New York Civil Liberties Union.The search warrants were signed in 2013 by Justice Melissa C. Jackson on the strength of a 96-page affidavit that has never been made public. In an unusual procedure, Facebook moved to quash the warrants, saying they were too broad and objecting to the judge\u2019s order prohibiting the company from telling its clients about them.Judge Jackson denied the motion, saying Facebook, as a service provider, could not argue the searches were unconstitutional on behalf of its clients, any more than a landlord could stop the police with a warrant from searching a storage facility. She also said there was enough evidence of fraud to justify the mass warrants.The warrants ordered Facebook to turn over all of the information in the accounts of 381 people, including private photos and conversations. That information was used by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to obtain indictments for disability fraud against more than 130 police officers and other former public employees. None of the people indicted challenged the search warrants.Mr. Vance personally argued the case before the court, underscoring its importance to his office, which has used private information in Facebook accounts not only as evidence of the enormous disability fraud scheme but also to help make conspiracy cases against hundreds of members of street gangs in housing projects.One of the concurring judges, Jenny Rivera, wrote a separate opinion, saying she agreed with the majority but on the narrower grounds that Facebook had not made the right arguments under federal law for quashing the warrants: that they would cause an undue burden and harm its business. Judge Rivera said she agreed with Judge Wilson that the federal law permitted Facebook to appeal a judge\u2019s decision on search warrants to a higher court.Jay Nancarrow, a spokesman for Facebook, said the company had yet to decide whether to take its case to the federal courts.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the court\u2019s ruling,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are encouraged to see the thorough dissent that supports Facebook\u2019s position arguing for people\u2019s online privacy.\u201dDonna Leiberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said she was heartened the court ruled only on procedural grounds, leaving the constitutional battle for another day.\u201cThis ruling does not reject our important claim that the state and federal Constitution do not permit district attorneys to rummage around in people\u2019s Facebook accounts like they did here,\u201d Ms. Leiberman said.Vindu Goel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cash Is King No More", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byCultural StudiesI had a strange experience the other day. I tried to pay for something with cash.It was sort of like going back to writing with a pen. My thumbs, made opposable by evolution so that humans could grab things and not just tap on a screen to acquire them, weren\u2019t working the way they were designed to.I had taken my son to our local stationery store to buy him a pack of Pok\u00e9mon cards. The pack was $5, and the store would not accept credit cards for any purchase under $10. It wasn\u2019t set up for Apple Pay either. So I took out my wallet and found that, though packed with plastic, the pouch where cash goes was empty. I plunged into my pockets and emptied them out on the counter in search of change.One penny, a type of coin that I had not thought much about for years, stuck stubbornly on the counter. I tried all sorts of moves, including quickly sliding both my thumbs toward it from opposite sides as if trying to catch it off guard, but it just slid around the surface. The cashier finally scooped it up with a business card. After I separated the coins from the lint in my pocket, I was able to put together $2.34. In the end, I had to buy two packs of cards so that I could pay with Visa.A dime was 10 cents. Two nickels were a dime. Ten dimes were a dollar. A dollar was a buck. A few bucks were dough. No one ever heard \u201cYour PayPal password or your life!\u201d The word was \u201cmoney,\u201d and money was tangible.These days, when the very idea of using a type of payment that is not also a type of investment in the form of points seems unthinkable, cash has become as rarefied as a public phone booth.Purchasing an item or service is no longer a terminus. It\u2019s the beginning, or rather, the continuation of one long transaction. Buying something used to be the goal of labor. Now it is another form of labor. Abstracted from our wallet into a zillion means by which we accrue rewards, our dollars roll up their green sleeves and go to work harvesting points as if they were grapes.This \u201cmoniverse\u201d has had a long gestation. At the dawn of what would become our modern economy, in the 17th century, the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza wrote that \u201cmoney has presented us with the abstract of everything.\u201d What he meant was that money had become the consummate medium for the human desire to possess.Now, 400 years later, everything has become the abstract of money. From the way we read to the way we eat, travel and entertain ourselves, just about every human experience has become monetized. Money itself, earning points in winding fugues of accumulation, has become monetized.Of course, along with all the many conveniences, pleasant surprises (a friend just made over $3,000 in American Express reward points) and brave new perks, the abstraction of money has its dark side. I glimpsed this as a child.My father, a jazz pianist turned real estate agent, was on a draw at his company; he was paid a salary that he would have to repay out of future commissions. This worked for a while, but when the recession hit in the mid-1970s, rising interest rates made the booming housing economy go bust. My father found himself owing his company $50,000 (about $300,000 today). In short order, he lost his job, his marriage to my mother, and his house. He had to declare bankruptcy and live off the few piano lessons he was able to put together.Aside from a love for expensive shoes and the need to lease a new Buick Electra every year, my father was not an extravagant man. The reason he kept taking the draw, even as he knew he was accumulating piles of debt, was that though the salary was real, both the source of it, and the consequences of continuing to accept it, were abstract.You used to want to make enough money to be able to have leisure time in which you could get away from money altogether. Now the very process of spending and buying is part of the experience of leisure. Why eat dinner in a restaurant in some distant corner of the world as a silver moon rises over a platinum sea if you are not paying for it with your platinum card, so that your shiny new points \u2014 filling up your future like stars clustering in the night sky \u2014 can lead you to ever more silver experiences?Perhaps we have become so used to substitutes for money, and to money as a dense forest of obscure processes like the packaging of derivatives, that there is now a high threshold for the counterfeit and the unknowable at the top levels of politics.Maybe the increasing abstraction of money holds the key to our painfully abstract presidency. A derivative is a security, like a stock, that derives its value from an underlying asset, like a mortgage. If mortgages fail, the stocks they supported come crashing down. What if the assets underlying President Trump are phantasmal, or corrupt? Only the I.R.S., tasked with keeping money real, knows for sure.Societies seem to need tangible money the way lovers must touch each other. Since money is the foundation of security, people seem to have a need to feel it with their hands.In retrospect, no one should have been surprised that Britain pulled out of the European Union. As well as being geographically \u201capart,\u201d it refused to give up its own currency. There is a palpable nostalgia for being able to make a physical connection between your country\u2019s historical figures printed on paper bank notes and your personal portion of happiness and security.An article last Sunday about the decline of cash referred incorrectly to the number of European Union members that retain national currencies. There are nine, not one.Advertisement"}

We are definitely not at the level where the average guy quits his job to trade stocks.\u201dThat may be true, but there is no doubt that the explosion in size of these stocks has taken many market participants by surprise, even if it is accepted that their corporate fundamentals are superior.Indeed, the booming returns of these index-heavy stocks has been a cause of intense frustration for portfolio managers and hedge funds who charge their investors steep fees to uncover hidden gems in the stock market.That is because unless they have a large part of their portfolio in fast growing (and richly valued) stocks like Amazon, Facebook and Apple, they are going to lag their benchmarks and lose money to cheaper exchange traded funds that track these indexes and provide maximum exposure to these stocks.\u201cThe mega cap growth stocks in Nasdaq have had a strong start to 2017, and many active managers have been underweight,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, an exchange traded fund specialist at CFRA Research. \u201cPeople underestimate the fact that large companies continue to get larger.

{"Headline": "Changes to Tech Worker Visas Are Cosmetic. For Now.", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byThe announcements came as the government began accepting applications on Monday for H-1B visas that will be issued for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.How do the announcements change the government\u2019s policies toward foreign workers?The changes are more cosmetic than substantive. Visas for entry-level computer jobs have already been getting more scrutiny from immigration officials, and the Justice Department is reminding companies to follow the law.Still, critics of the H-1B program say the Justice Department\u2019s warning to companies not to discriminate against Americans might lead to enforcement action.\u201cIf the Department of Justice concludes that these companies are discriminating against Americans, the entire outsourcing model becomes deeply suspect,\u201d said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, a group that represents American tech workers.Why is the H-1B program important? H-1B visas are commonly used by companies to bring foreign workers to the United States to fill technical positions like software developers. Some tech companies say they need foreign workers because they cannot find enough Americans with the skills for these jobs.How do the new policies affect Microsoft, Facebook and other big American technology companies? The large tech companies are unlikely to be affected much in the near term, immigration lawyers and technology executives said. Technology companies usually apply for H-1B visas when they need to fill a job with higher-skilled workers holding bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees.William Moss, a spokesman for Intel, said the chip maker does not expect any impact from the change. \u201cIntel\u2019s foreign national population in the U.S. is largely comprised of individuals possessing unique and difficult to find skills which can only be acquired through advanced-degree, university-level education,\u201d Mr. Moss said.What about the Indian outsourcing firms? Indian outsourcing firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and Infosys get a large number of H-1B visas, as do outsource companies that are based in America, such as I.B.M. and Cognizant.Although they do hire some entry-level programmers, they have been shifting their hiring to higher-skilled and better paid workers.Benjamin Trounson, a spokesman for Tata Consultancy Services, said the company has cut back on its use of H-1B visas in the past few years, receiving only 1,500 in 2016.Why is this happening now?On Monday, the federal government began accepting applications for next year\u2019s visas. Demand for the H-1B visas so far exceeds the supply that the government is likely to cut off applications within a week, and visas will be awarded by lottery. Congress allows for 65,000 H-1Bs each year, with an additional 20,000 for workers possessing a master\u2019s degree or higher.The Trump administration may be using the moment to discourage what its views as abuse of the work visa.\u201cThe timing is not coincidental,\u201d said Ted Ruthizer, an immigration lawyer with Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to show a mastery of the situation, that they know what companies are up to with H-1Bs and they\u2019re not going to let them get away with any shenanigans.\u201dAre more changes coming that could affect the technology sector?

{"Headline": "The \u2018Fix\u2019 for Net Neutrality That Consumers Don\u2019t Need", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byNetflix and Amazon have been nominated for hundreds of Emmys and Golden Globe awards in recent years, and that is a testament to both the quality of those companies and the transformation of television. But some of the credit is also due to \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d the legal regime that nurtured and protected the open internet and streaming TV in the first place.Streaming, after all, is a cheaper and better form of television. For that reason, it is something the cable industry would not have allowed to thrive had it been left to its own devices. Fortunately, net neutrality rules prevented cable companies from killing or interfering with streaming television during its infancy.In analyzing the attack on net neutrality, one looks in vain for the problem that needs to be fixed. Net neutrality refers to rules intended to ensure that broadband providers cannot block content or provide faster delivery to companies that pay more. The policy was put in place in the George W. Bush administration, where it enjoyed bipartisan support. In the years since, it has sheltered bloggers, nonprofit organizations like Wikipedia, smaller tech companies, TV and music streamers, and entrepreneurs from being throttled by providers like AT&T and Verizon that own the \u201cpipes.\u201dThe policy\u2019s contributions are not just cultural but also economic: Television has been revitalized, and waves of successful internet start-ups have returned America\u2019s high-tech industry to unquestioned global leadership. Net neutrality has been among the most effective economic policies of the 21st century.Make no mistake: While killing net neutrality may be rolled out with specious promises of \u201cfree video,\u201d there is nothing here for ordinary people. Lowering prices is just not something that cable or phone companies will do except under pressure. Instead, the repeal of net neutrality will simply create ways for cable and phone companies to tax the web and increase your broadband bill. Raise your hand if that sounds enticing.The more convincing explanations for this change are more straightforward \u2014 and darker \u2014 than Mr. Pai\u2019s. Much of Silicon Valley and Hollywood have supported both net neutrality and the Democratic Party, making an attack on the policy a kind of punishment. If Mr. Pai\u2019s reasoning sounds forced and unconvincing, it is because this proposal comes right from the swamp, and can be attractive only to those who have lived there long enough to no longer notice the stench.The proposal to kill net neutrality is terrible economic policy and bad politics. It is starkly inconsistent with any populist mandate. There is a reason that net neutrality is called the third rail of internet politics, and Mr. Pai has now grabbed it.Tim Wu, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads,\u201d is a professor at Columbia Law School and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lesson in Moscow About Trump-Style \u2018Alternative Truth\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-16", "News": "Supported byMediatorMOSCOW \u2014 I wanted to better understand President Trump\u2019s America, a place where truth is being ripped from its moorings as he brands those tasked with lashing it back into place \u2014 journalists \u2014 as dishonest enemies of the people.So I went to Russia.It was like a visit to the land of Alternative Truth Yet to Come. But it also gave me a glimpse into how our new national look is playing in the global information war, where competing narratives are clashing along a sliding scale of fact and fiction.I had picked a ghoulishly perfect week to swing through President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Moscow, where spring was struggling to break out over the low-slung, slate-gray cityscape.Mr. Trump had just ordered a Tomahawk strike against Syria\u2019s Shayrat air base, from which, the United States said, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria had launched the chemical weapons attack that killed more than 80 and sickened hundreds.As soon as I turned on a television here I wondered if I had arrived through an alt-right wormhole.Here in Russia, it was the dominant theme throughout the overwhelmingly state-controlled mainstream media.One of Mr. Kiselyov\u2019s correspondents on the scene mocked \u201cWestern propagandists\u201d for believing the Trump line, saying munitions at the air base had \u201cas much to do with chemical weapons as the test tube in the hands of Colin Powell had to do with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\u201dAs the pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia put it, \u201cApparently it was for good reason Donald Trump called unverified information in the mass media one of the main problems in the U.S.\u201dIt was the best evidence I\u2019ve seen of the folly of Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-press approach. You can\u2019t spend more than a year attacking the credibility of the \u201cdishonest media\u201d and then expect to use its journalism as support for your position during an international crisis \u2014 at least not with any success.While Mr. Trump and his supporters may think that undermining the news media serves their larger interests, in this great information war it serves Mr. Putin\u2019s interests more. It means playing on his turf, where he excels.Integral to Mr. Putin\u2019s governing style has been a pliant press that makes his government the main arbiter of truth.While talking to the beaten but unbowed members of the real journalism community here, I heard eerie hints of Trumpian proclamations in their war stories.That same day, I met with one of the former RBC editors, Roman Badanin. We chatted at his new place of employment, TV Rain, in the Flacon warehouse complex here, populated by young people with beards, tattoos, piercings and colored hair. (Brooklyn hipster imperialism knows no bounds.)TV Rain has its own hard-luck tale. It was Russia\u2019s only independent television station. Carried mainly on cable, it regularly covered anti-Putin protests and aired voices excluded from the rest of television.When I asked Mr. Badanin what would be different if Russia had full press freedoms, he looked at me wearily and said: \u201cEverything. Sorry for that common answer, but everything.\u201dDespite steep challenges, people like Mr. Badanin are still battling on. Their journalistic spirit couldn\u2019t be killed, even after some of their friends and colleagues had been.With the gallows humor of a seasoned journalist, Mr. Muratov was in a jovial mood and told me that he was getting a great kick out of state media\u2019s hard turn against Mr. Trump.Initially, Mr. Muratov said of the president, \u201che was treated as warmly as McDonald\u2019s; he entered every home like he was our national Santa Claus.\u201d Mr. Muratov had no doubt the sentiment toward Mr. Trump would reverse again, perhaps soon. (To borrow from \u201c1984\u201d: \u201cOceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.\u201d)Novaya Gazeta had the toughest coverage on the chemical weapons attack that I saw here, challenging the government narrative with reporting from the ground indicating the chemical weapons were dropped from the air. (The anti-Assad forces do not have airplanes.)There\u2019s a lot of speculation in Russian media circles about why the Kremlin allows Novaya Gazeta to continue to operate.That, and a loyal subscriber base of more than 240,000, help insulate it from outside pressure, if not the violence.The very day of my visit, Mr. Muratov received a threat against his entire staff from religious leaders in Chechnya, angry over articles about anti-gay violence in the region.The Novaya Gazeta offices are scattered with reminders to take such threats seriously, like the case that holds the dusty desktop computer of Anna Politkovskaya. She was shot dead in her apartment building in 2006 after exposing human rights abuses in Chechnya and writing unflinchingly about Mr. Putin.I wondered aloud whether it scared any of Mr. Muratov\u2019s reporters away from certain stories. He turned serious, looked straight at me and said, \u201cI really wish it could.\u201dMr. Muratov follows the American news media closely. I asked him what he thought about the American press corps\u2019 quandary when it comes to covering a president, like Mr. Trump, who trades in falsehoods and demonizes journalists.He seemed put off by the question; the answer, to him, was so obvious.\u201cInformation from the Kremlin or from the White House, it\u2019s not for us verified information,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t place our trust just on their word.\u201dIt\u2019s a lesson American reporters should have learned long before Mr. Trump came along, especially after Iraq.Journalists in Russia like Mr. Muratov haven\u2019t lost sight of that lesson because they can\u2019t afford to. Neither can we.Alexandra Odynova contributed research.Advertisement"}

Disney\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d chugged along in third place, generating roughly $10 million in ticket sales.All of those movies share a common DNA. They are glossy, big-budget extravaganzas stuffed with elements to hook global audiences: extreme stunts, Alec Baldwin as a talking infant, boundary-pushing visual effects, song and dance.On the other hand, the five new films vying for attention seemed shipped in from another era. They included a modestly budgeted, star-driven thriller; a nature documentary; and a period drama with romantic overtones. But consumers continued to send a message with their feet: These are the kinds of movies we now watch at home, either on streaming services like Netflix, HBO Go and Amazon Prime or through the vast on-demand platforms operated by cable and satellite providers.Warner Bros., for instance, put forward the suspense film \u201cUnforgettable\u201d in 2,417 domestic theaters over the weekend, backing its release with tens of millions of dollars worth of billboards, television ads and posters at shopping malls \u2014 tried and true marketing tools that used to be able to compel crowds into theaters. But \u201cUnforgettable,\u201d which cost $12 million to produce, only managed about $4.8 million in ticket sales. (Memo to studios: Perhaps retire the title \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d There have now been three films and a television series with that name over the last two decades.

But they nonetheless have drained the studio of resources, particularly in marketing.The other weekend arrivals included \u201cThe Promise\u201d (Open Road), a period drama that cost nearly $100 million to make; it collected a catastrophic $4.1 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. The nature documentary \u201cBorn in China\u201d (Disney) had about $5.1 million in ticket sales. A low-budget horror film, \u201cPhoenix Forgotten\u201d (Cinelou), took in roughly $2 million, while the art-house action picture \u201cFree Fire\u201d (A24) played to mostly empty theaters, generating about $1 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Has Something Hotter Than Cars to Sell: Its Story", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseBy \u201cthe past,\u201d he presumably means old-fashioned valuation measures like price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratios, the traditional benchmarks for evaluating stock prices. By those measures, Tesla \u2014 a company that lost $773 million last year \u2014 is indeed off the charts.Tesla\u2019s market value of nearly $49 billion is not only higher than that of Ford, which earned nearly $11 billion in profit last year, but is within easy striking distance of General Motors, which earned $9.4 billion.In contrast to Tesla, Ford and G.M. shares have dropped recently on fears that auto sales have hit a cyclical peak. Ford and G.M. executives wouldn\u2019t comment on Tesla\u2019s stock surge, but it\u2019s easy to imagine they\u2019d be tearing their hair out in frustration.\u201cIt\u2019s nuts,\u201d Bruce Greenwald, a professor at Columbia Business School and an expert in value investing, said of Tesla\u2019s stock price. \u201cInvestors believe it\u2019s going to dominate a market that no company has ever dominated before.\u201dBut Tesla is not a stock, or a company, that is measured by the past, as Mr. Musk is well aware. He also wrote on Twitter that stock prices represent \u201crisk-adjusted future cash flows\u201d \u2014 and Tesla is about nothing if not a utopian future of safe, reliable, powerful, self-driving electric vehicles powered by solar-fed batteries that are easy on the environment.In that regard, Tesla has ascended into a rarefied realm of so-called story stocks \u2014 companies that have so bewitched investors that their stock prices are impervious to any traditional valuation measures because their stories are simply too good not to be true.And to the dismay of short-sellers, who believe they have ample rational reasons to bet against such stocks, their share prices can stay in the stratosphere for years, even decades.These story stocks \u2014 the term was coined by James Montier, a value investor and a member of the asset allocation team at the investment management firm GMO \u2014 are relatively rare, but hardly new. Amazon\u2019s stock surged for decades even without any meaningful profits. A more recent example is Snapchat\u2019s parent, Snap, which is racking up large losses while its stock trades at an astronomical price-to-sales ratio of nearly 50, far higher than Tesla\u2019s 7. (Ford\u2019s, by comparison, is 0.3.)Amazon and Snap both have stories that are compelling for many investors: Amazon has transformed retailing and is destined to dominate it. Snap is reinventing communication, at least for millennials and those even younger.Early investors in Uber and Airbnb, though they remain private companies, have valued them at stratospheric multiples based largely on the notion that Uber will transform and dominate local transportation and Airbnb will revolutionize the hotel industry.For story stocks, any development that lends credence to the story can cause a surge in already high valuations. This week Tesla reported quarterly sales that were modestly above expectations, and the stock surged 7 percent in a day. Tesla shares are up nearly 40 percent this year, even though many investors considered them overvalued in January.Ron Baron, the billionaire investor and founder of Baron Capital, disclosed last year that he owned about 1.6 million Tesla shares. He predicted on CNBC in February that Tesla shares would quadruple by 2020 and triple again by 2025. By then he expects Tesla to become the largest company in the world as measured by market capitalization.For all the excitement and promise surrounding such companies, there are many cautionary tales.\u201cStories are great before bed, but are disastrous as a stock-selection technique,\u201d Mr. Montier wrote in his 2009 book \u201cValue Investing: Tools and Techniques for Intelligent Investment.\u201d If something is expensive based on traditional valuation metrics, he said, \u201cyou had better believe its story, as that is all you have.\u201d(A Tesla spokeswoman said Mr. Musk could not be reached for comment.)Various studies have shown that stocks with high price-to-sales ratios, on average, significantly underperform market averages. For every Tesla or Uber, there\u2019s a Valeant Pharmaceuticals or Theranos \u2014 two story stocks that seduced an astounding array of prominent investors and supporters based on stories that did turn out to be too good to be true.And while many investors\u2019 memories tend to be short, the so-called dot-com bubble in the late 1990s spawned scores of story stocks, nearly all of them now worthless and forgotten.Still, Mr. Montier acknowledged, \u201cStories are compelling.\u201d They appeal to intuition rather than reason. \u201cBut perhaps investors would be well advised to follow Odysseus\u2019s example of putting beeswax in his crew\u2019s ears and tying himself to the mast in order to avoid the disastrous, but oh so desirable, call of the Siren song.\u201dWill Tesla be one of the rare exceptions and, as Mr. Baron has predicted, emerge as the world\u2019s most valuable company?The company has won over many skeptics with its near-flawless execution, so far, and the high quality of its vehicles and high levels of consumer satisfaction. It is no longer a start-up: It delivered 25,000 vehicles in the last quarter. It is on track to achieve economies of scale, and the company says the gross margin on each vehicle is above 20 percent, far higher than the industry average. That could drive enormous future profits.But that\u2019s not the Tesla story \u2014 or stories \u2014 investors are betting on.Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley automotive analyst who is hardly a starry-eyed optimist about the industry, upgraded Tesla shares to overweight in January. He singles out the company\u2019s new autonomous driving technology as a compelling safety feature that will significantly reduce occupant and pedestrian injuries and fatalities. This week he said he expected \u201cvehicle safety to be the primary differentiator in Tesla\u2019s upcoming product offensive,\u201d referring to the eagerly anticipated introduction of Tesla\u2019s new, lower-price Model 3, which will be equipped with the new technology.That Tesla is an all-electric, environmentally friendly, nonfossil-fuel vehicle \u2014 the story that once excited investors \u2014 is barely mentioned anymore.Even more futuristic is the idea that Tesla cars will be entirely self-driving, able to cruise streets nearly full time (except when they are being charged at Tesla\u2019s high-speed battery-charging stations). In this vision, Tesla owners will share their vehicles with Tesla when not using them, and during that time they will ferry other passengers, serving as Tesla\u2019s version of Uber. Thus Tesla will disrupt Uber\u2019s nascent market dominance.And Tesla is no longer seen just as a vehicle manufacturer. With its solar and battery technologies, it is in a position to dominate two other enormous industry segments. Tesla \u201cis reinventing the electric grid,\u201d as Mr. Baron said on CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s a bigger opportunity than cars.\u201dEven if all that comes to pass, it may not be enough to justify Tesla\u2019s valuation unless it can sustain a competitive advantage over time, as Mr. Greenwald, the value investing expert, put it. Tesla is spending heavily on research and development, and perhaps its technology will be difficult or impossible for others to replicate. The established automakers have had years to catch up to or overtake Tesla\u2019s Model S, with a conspicuous lack of success.But for committed value investors, the writing is on the wall: \u201cIs Tesla going to dominate its industry? That\u2019s the key question,\u201d Mr. Greenwald said. \u201cWhen it comes to the global auto industry, no one ever has, and in all likelihood, no one ever will.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Technology Is Built on a \u2018Stack.\u2019 Is That the Best Way to Understand Everything Else, Too?", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsNearly three decades later, now that computing has become truly ubiquitous, its metaphors are deployed without a moment\u2019s thought. We don\u2019t just talk intuitively about the ways in which people are \u201cprogrammed\u201d \u2014 we talk about our emotional \u201cbandwidth\u201d and look for clever ways to \u201chack\u201d our daily routines. These metaphors have developed right alongside the technology from which they\u2019re derived, starting with hardware and then moving to software, apps and networks. Now we\u2019ve arrived at a tempting concept that promises to contain all of this: the stack. These days, corporate managers talk about their solution stacks and idealize \u201cfull stack\u201d companies; athletes share their recovery stacks and muscle-building stacks; devotees of so-called smart drugs obsessively modify their brain-enhancement stacks to address a seemingly infinite range of flaws and desires.\u201cStack,\u201d in technological terms, can mean a few different things, but the most relevant usage grew from the start-up world: A stack is a collection of different pieces of software that are being used together to accomplish a task. A smartphone\u2019s software stack, for instance, could be described as a layered structure: There\u2019s the low-level code that controls the device\u2019s hardware, and then, higher up, its basic operating system, and then, even higher, the software you use to message a friend or play a game. An individual application\u2019s stack might include the programming languages used to build it, the services used to connect it to other apps or the service that hosts it online; a \u201cfull stack\u201d developer would be someone proficient at working with each layer of that system, from bottom to top.The stack isn\u2019t just a handy concept for visualizing how technology works. For many companies, the organizing logic of the software stack becomes inseparable from the logic of the business itself. The system that powers Snapchat, for instance, sits on top of App Engine, a service owned by Google; to the extent that Snapchat even exists as a service, it is as a stack of different elements. \u201cWhat you end up with is entire companies being built on a set of software tools and services,\u201d says Yonas Beshawred, whose own company, StackShare, lets tech professionals publish their companies\u2019 stacks and see what others are using, comparing technology the way hobbyists might compare gear. \u201cYou can think of them as Lego blocks.\u201d A healthy stack, or a clever one, is tantamount (the thinking goes) to a well-structured company.Other attempts to elaborate on the stack have been more rigorous and comprehensive, less personal and more global. In a 2016 book, \u201cThe Stack: On Software and Sovereignty,\u201d the professor and design theorist Benjamin Bratton sets out to, in his words, propose a \u201cspecific model for the design of political geography tuned to this era of planetary-scale computation,\u201d by drawing on the \u201cmultilayered structure of software, hardware and network \u2018stacks\u2019 that arrange different technologies vertically within a modular, interdependent order.\u201d In other words, Bratton sees the world around us as one big emerging technological stack. In his telling, the six-layer stack we inhabit is complex, fluid and vertigo-inducing: Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface and User. It is also, he suggests, extremely powerful, with the potential to undermine and replace our current conceptions of, among other things, the sovereign state \u2014 ushering us into a world blown apart and reassembled by software. This might sound extreme, but such is the intoxicating logic of the stack.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Too Clean for Our Children\u2019s Good?", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byThe CheckupWhen a toddler\u2019s pacifier falls out of his mouth and onto the ground, does it get confiscated and boiled by anxious parents or just licked off and reinserted by the more casually inclined?When we talk about the hygiene hypothesis, the collection of theories that address the possible problems that can be associated with growing up less exposed to germs and dirt, we are essentially talking about growing up indoors. We\u2019re talking about living in a world of relatively clean and controlled surfaces, where even small children who are constantly picking things up and putting them in their mouths are not going to come into contact with a very wide variety of exposures.For the last century and a half, he said, since understanding that microbes cause disease, human beings have tried as hard as possible to wall off their bodies from the microbial world of bacteria, viruses and fungi. \u201cWe\u2019ve deliberately separated ourselves for reasons of comfort and reasons of fear of disease.\u201dAnd it\u2019s worked; there\u2019s no question that increasing hygiene has saved many children from sickness and death. Scrupulously separating children from the microbes that can be found in impure water, for example, or unpasteurized milk has played a major role in reducing infant and child mortality, enabling millions of children to live and thrive. But we\u2019ve also come to ask, in recent years, whether children who are too completely walled off from the microbial surroundings in which our species evolved may grow up with some negative consequences of our ever-cleaner homes.That separation actually starts even before a baby is brought into its clean home environment. \u201cAll mammals are born heavily inoculated with bacteria from the maternal birth canal,\u201d said Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, an ecologist who is associate professor in the Human Microbiome Program at New York University School of Medicine. For breast-fed babies, the nursing period is generally one of lower environmental exposure but intense maternal exposure, she said, and then, after weaning, babies enter a period of much more interaction with the microbes around them.\u201cThe end of the strict lactation period is the beginning of a very intensive environmental exploration,\u201d Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. \u201cThat happens to all mammals including our kids that lick everything they find \u2014 by the time the lactation period ends, the last half of it has been of mixed feeding milk and solids, and then we are supposed to be ready to face the world.\u201dAs houses become more enclosed and more subdivided, she said, spaces are increasingly separated by areas of use, and the speed at which outside air replaces inside air is decreased. \u201cWhat happens is, we reduce the exposure to external environmental bacteria, so we become the main source of bacteria, our skin, our mouth, we shed bacteria, and the house becomes highly humanized, most of the bacteria in a house in a city will be human,\u201d she said.Walls, she said, are the best bystanders, revealing what is going on in a house, because they are not usually cleaned. After many years, she said, \u201cyou find highly oral bacteria near the sink,\u201d fecal and vaginal bacteria \u201cnear the toilet,\u201d and skin bacteria \u201cin the rest of the house.\u201dSo we need to study the health consequences of the built environment, even the more modern and more \u201chygienic\u201d built environment, which is a complicated place, and by no means sterile.\u201cWe used to live in much dustier environments,\u201d said Marsha Wills-Karp, a professor of environmental health and engineering at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. Still, she said, though houses are cleaner, the built environment contains many components, including chemicals and airborne particles, not just microbes.\u201cStudies have shown that priming or seeding of the microbiome in the child is absolutely critical,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile you don\u2019t want to go out and expose your child to aggressive infections, you don\u2019t want to create such a sterile environment that their immune system doesn\u2019t develop normally; it puts them at risk of developing immune diseases.\u201dAnd what we have learned, Dr. Gilbert said, is that early life exposure to microbes can shape not only the immune system, affecting a child\u2019s likelihood of developing autoimmune conditions like eczema and asthma, but also the endocrine system, and even the child\u2019s neurodevelopment.\u201cDifferent bacteria and fungi affect different diseases differently, and affect different children differently,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand the interactions between the immune system, the genome, and all the other components of the body as well as we could.\u201d\u201cThere are definitive ways to embrace the controlled exposure or uncontrolled defined exposure to that rich microbial world early in life,\u201d Dr. Gilbert said.Advertisement"}

In the Amazon TV series \u201cAlpha House\u201d (disclosure: I was a producer), Garry Trudeau makes sport of a fictional Republican senator carefully hanging his treasured bathtub-feet \u201cBush\u201d as if it were a masterpiece. This while former President Jimmy Carter was selling one of his paintings at a Carter Center charity auction for $750,000.In the introduction to his new coffee-table book of oil paintings, Bush readily \u2014 perhaps pre-emptively \u2014 admits that he\u2019s a \u201cnovice.\u201d Three years after leaving the White House, he set out to adopt the pastime of Winston Churchill, who painted to relieve the \u201cBlack Dog\u201d of depression. But age 66 is awfully late to achieve proficiency, especially for a man with a famously short attention span. Bush recalls playfully informing his first art instructor, Gail Norfleet, of his objectives. \u201cGail, there\u2019s a Rembrandt trapped in this body,\u201d he told her. \u201cYour job is to liberate him.\u201dNorfleet and Bush\u2019s other talented tutors fell short of that ideal, but they did liberate an inner Bush we \u2014 and maybe he \u2014 never knew existed: An evocative and surprisingly adept artist who has dramatically improved his technique while also doing penance for one of the greatest disasters in American history.After staring at the haunting close-up portraits of wounded warriors and reading the searing accounts of their suffering, I\u2019m beginning to understand why this beautifully published book went to No. 1 on The Times\u2019s nonfiction best-seller list. It\u2019s not that people are suddenly nostalgic for Bush; historians consistently rank him near the bottom in their lists of American presidents and \u2014 despite lasting achievements on treating AIDS globally and a prescription drug benefit for Medicare \u2014 he will very likely remain there, even if he rises past President Trump some day. (Trump hasn\u2019t gotten us into a $1 trillion war or presided over an economic meltdown \u2014 so far.) And it\u2019s not just that Trump has set the bar of character and decency so low that Bush barely needs to lift his cowboy boot to step over it. His charming family, warm relationship with the Obamas, and welcome defense of the press and other threatened democratic institutions aren\u2019t sufficient explanations, either.A better answer might lie in the words of Marine Corps Sgt. Andy Hatcher, who enlisted a month before 9/11 and was ambushed on Thanksgiving Day 2004 in the Second Battle of Falluja. Hatcher lost his right foot and most of the hearing in his right ear. He also suffered traumatic brain injury, though a less severe form of that signature wound of the Iraq War than afflicted other veterans. \u201cMy father is a Vietnam vet,\u201d Hatcher said. \u201cHe was treated incredibly differently than I was.\u201dThe success of \u201cPortraits of Courage\u201d (with the proceeds to help vets) is something more than just another \u201cThank you for your service.\u201d It testifies to our genuine, bipartisan determination to do it better this time \u2014 to support healing in all of its forms, even from the president who most made that healing necessary. It reflects our fascination with how leaders process pain and regret. And whether or not we backed Bush\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq (as I wrongly did), commemorating the more than 40,000 brave Americans who left a piece of themselves behind in Iraq and Afghanistan seems a fitting if tiny step toward bridging the civilian-military divide. Bush writes of the veterans he met that \u201clooking them in the eye and saluting them as their commander in chief\u201d was the greatest honor of his presidency and that he will continue to actively honor them for the rest of his life. This was not something that Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon did much of with Vietnam veterans after leaving office.Presidents who send soldiers into battle cannot easily confess that it was in vain. In his memoir \u201cDecision Points,\u201d Bush concedes that American forces were withdrawn too quickly but not that responding to 9/11 by attacking a dictator who had nothing to do with it was a colossal error. He can\u2019t admit that he has little to show for his dream of democratizing the Middle East, beyond continuing chaos.And yet, bearing unflinching witness to the horrific consequences of historic folly should always be welcome. Atonement is not accountability, much less redemption, but it\u2019s a start. Bush mostly avoids Veterans Day-style platitudes and sugarcoats nothing, not even stories about a veteran who wounded a fellow soldier with friendly fire and one shot by an Afghan security guard who was supposed to be an ally.The former president met the 96 men and two women he painted in military hospitals and at the Warrior 100K mountain bike rides and Warrior Open golf outings sponsored by the Bush Institute. Their inspiring stories of recovery \u2014 most would not have survived in earlier wars \u2014 cannot soften the horrors they endured. Bush\u2019s colorful brush strokes (he painted from photographs) capture the faces of soldiers like Army Capt. Jae Barclay, who underwent 30 surgeries after his vehicle struck an I.E.D. in Afghanistan; Lt. Col. Kent Solheim, whose right leg was amputated amid 34 surgeries, after which he returned for two more deployments; and Master Sgt. Israel del Toro Jr., \u201cDT,\u201d whom Bush first met when he was in a medically induced coma after his Humvee was hit by a bomb that severed his fingers and nose and severely burned 80 percent of his body. He was given little chance of survival, and when he beat those odds, doctors told him he would never walk or breathe on his own. After more than 100 surgeries, DT represented the United States in cycling and powerlifting at the 2016 Invictus Games and won the gold medal in the shot put.The wounded warriors who don\u2019t like Bush and haven\u2019t recovered well were unlikely to have become friendly enough with him to have their portraits painted. But most of his subjects suffered nightmares, depression and \u201cPTS.\u201d (He leaves \u201cdisorder\u201d off the end of post-traumatic stress, presumably because the clinical distinction between PTS and PTSD can be fuzzy.) The stories are gruesome but also occasionally amusing. Lt. Col. Ken Dwyer told Bush and the golf legend Lee Trevino how he took his prosthetic eye out of its socket and presented it to an umpire at his son\u2019s baseball game with the comment: \u201cHere, you seem to need this a lot more than I do.\u201dThe only weak part of this book is the ingratiating foreword by Gen. Peter Pace, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \u201cPresident Bush asked tough questions \u2014 and continued to ask them until he had all the information he needed,\u201d Pace writes. This is precisely what Bush did not do \u2014 on incomplete plans for the postwar occupation, insufficient American troop levels, the disbanding of the Iraqi Army (one of the factors that led to ISIS) and many other matters. \u201cOnce he made a decision, he would resource it properly,\u201d Pace claims. Tell that to the men who were killed or wounded because of unconscionable delays in obtaining proper body armor. Pace is right about one thing: The book is a \u201cmessage of love\u201d from a former president to the troops. In 2003, I argued that Iraq was the right war with the wrong commander in chief. I had it nearly backward. It was the wrong war \u2014 for which history will forever blame Bush \u2014 but with the right commander in chief, at least for the noble if narrow purpose of creatively honoring veterans through art. Contra Ike, these portraits \u2014 an unexpected asterisk to the Bush legacy \u2014 would not have been burned, even if the artist had never been president.Jonathan Alter, a former columnist for Newsweek who has written books on Franklin D. Roosevelt and Barack Obama, is working on a biography of Jimmy Carter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chat With a Live Streamer Is Yours, for a Price", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byAndre Rebelo, a 24-year-old YouTube streamer from Vancouver, British Columbia, live-streamed himself playing the game Grand Theft Auto V on his YouTube channel, Typical Gamer, in mid-January. This time, he added something different for his audience.As Mr. Rebelo broadcast his gameplay, he used a new YouTube feature called Super Chat to invite his more than 4.5 million subscribers to send him comments. For those viewers willing to pay him a sum of their choice \u2014 from $1 to $500 \u2014 Mr. Rebelo would more prominently feature their comments.One viewer quickly wrote, \u201cHey you, your videos are so cool I love you,\u201d and offered Mr. Rebelo $10 through Super Chat. Another wrote, \u201cWhat's up TG, watching live from the NYC,\u201d and gave $5. Someone even donated the largest amount possible, $500.By the end of the 90-minute live stream, Mr. Rebelo had received 250 Super Chat messages and netted $4,000 from them.YouTube began a test of Super Chat on Jan. 12 and followed with a wide rollout of the feature on Feb. 7. Now any YouTube streamer with more than 1,000 subscribers who is registered with YouTube\u2019s Partner Program \u2014 which allows users to earn money from videos through advertising \u2014 can enable Super Chat during a live stream.\u201cFor creators, Super Chat does double duty: keeping their conversations and connections with (super) fans meaningful and lively while also giving them a new way to make money,\u201d said Barbara Macdonald, a product manager at YouTube who worked on Super Chat.Twitch has a feature similar to Super Chat called Cheering, begun in June 2016, which lets viewers \u201ctip\u201d streamers during a live stream. Viewers \u201ccheer\u201d by using \u201cBits,\u201d virtual goods that come in the form of animated gem-shaped emoticons. Viewers can buy Bits directly from the chat window; there are different colors and sizes starting at $1.40 for 100 Bits. Streamers receive one cent for every Bit used in their chat.\u201cTwitch viewers are very savvy and in tune with their favorite casters, so they are aware that their support is what enables their favorite streamers to broadcast full time,\u201d said Matt McCloskey, the vice president for commerce at Twitch.Super Chat and Cheering are more than about money \u2014 they also offer another way for streamers and their audiences to bond and converse. T. L. Taylor, a professor of comparative media studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said real-time interaction with audiences in live streaming \u2014 particularly in the genre of video game live streaming \u2014 was increasingly becoming a crucial part of the experience.\u201cGame live-streaming taps into the longstanding pleasure of spectating other people\u2019s play,\u201d Dr. Taylor said. \u201cLive streamers are adept at connecting with the folks watching them, drawing them out and into the play experience.\u201dOn Twitch, while all channels are free, subscribing to a channel gives viewers perks like subscriber-only chat, subscriber-only emoticons and discounts on merchandise. Subscriptions on Twitch are generally around $4.99 a month.But features like Super Chat and Cheering feel more personal.\u201cSome people just like to let me know that my videos make their day, what video is their favorite, suggestions for future live streams and over all just to increase the odds of their comments being seen and for me to say their name,\u201d Mr. Rebelo said.There may be a downside to the new features, said Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst. He said it was hard to predict how audiences would react once they were asked to pay for interactions with live streamers.\u201cSuper Chat is probably destined to fail,\u201d Mr. Pachter said. \u201cI think that the business model is flawed, and I think the ability to \u2018buy\u2019 a spot in the queue is going to turn off a lot of fans.\u201dA YouTube spokeswoman said there had already been \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Super Chat purchases since the product launched. \u201cWhile anyone could make predictions, we\u2019ve been really encouraged by the early adoption and engagement on Super Chat,\u201d the spokeswoman said.Yet some internet commentators are not impressed. In February, We the Unicorns, a news site about YouTube personalities, called Super Chat \u201cthe weirdest YouTube feature yet,\u201d arguing, \u201cWe\u2019re all for fans of YouTubers supporting their faves financially however they want, especially if they get something in return; but should the payoff really be a few extra seconds of attention in a chat room?\u201dDigby Lewis, the former director for brand strategy at BuzzFeed, also publicly expressed concern in an opinion piece for The Drum, a magazine focused on the marketing industry. He said paid comments fomented self-promotion by creators and could raise ethical questions about whether comments are for the creator or the community of viewers.\u201cA positive contribution deserves to rise to the top because of its value to the community, not because someone has a financial advantage,\u201d he said in the op-ed essay.For now, live streamers seem to have embraced Super Chat and Cheering. Mr. Rebelo said no one seemed put off by Super Chat during his Grand Theft Auto V live stream \u2014 though a few people did wonder whether he was getting the money from the stream, or if YouTube was.And while the top streamers can earn in the millions of dollars from advertising and other sources, for everyone else, ads may simply not be enough to survive on.Clintus McGintus, 35, a YouTube video blogger from Phoenix, used Super Chat in January for his channel, Clintus.tv. During a 30-minute live stream of him walking around his local Target store, he made almost $900 through Super Chat.\u201cThis is my business and how I pay the bills,\u201d Mr. McGintus said. \u201cSuper Chat is the next level. Tipping on stream and getting a shout-out or having your comment read by the content creator is a great feeling.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The current effort is in some ways an outgrowth of the first, featuring the same players.The first time, there were big promises that were never fulfilled. It was a typical Silicon Valley story, in other words, which makes it a bit of a cautionary tale even as everyone assumes that this time will be different.The story began more than a decade ago when a billionaire entrepreneur came here to visit and, like so many others, fell in love with the majestic mountains and sweeping vistas. New Zealand is where Peter Jackson filmed \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d a beloved text for many techies. It is the real Middle-earth, a fantasy come to life.Fantasies are rarely free. People applying for citizenship here are required to have spent 70 percent of the previous five years living in the country, and to commit to living in it afterward. Even humanitarian exceptions are rare.Peter Thiel, the contrarian investor who made his fortune with PayPal and Facebook, made an irresistible financial proposal to New Zealand in early 2011. He would bring the local economy \u2014 whose biggest exports were concentrated milk and the meat from sheep and goats \u2014 into the high-tech era. Mr. Thiel would serve as the country\u2019s roving tech ambassador, opening doors around the world that are closed to mere government officials.Even before applying, he set up Valar Ventures, an investment fund named after the gods in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d Valar put about $3 million into Xero, an online accounting software firm, and was part of a $4 million infusion of cash into Pacific Fibre, which proposed a trans-Pacific undersea cable.And that, Mr. Thiel signaled, would be just the beginning.\u201cI intend to devote a significant amount of my time and resources to the people and businesses of New Zealand,\u201d he wrote in his citizenship application. He donated about $750,000 to earthquake relief after the city of Christchurch was struck in February 2011.\u201cWe were so blown away that Peter Thiel was interested,\u201d said Rod Drury, the chief executive of Xero. \u201cHim getting a passport wasn\u2019t a big deal at the time. No one really thought about it.\u201dWhen the secret was revealed, it created a small uproar.\u201cSomeone being able to invest and get citizenship goes against that important New Zealand value of equality,\u201d Mr. Drury explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why it has played so much in the media here.\u201dMr. Drury is the biggest name in New Zealand\u2019s tech scene, a local version of Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg. He recommended Mr. Thiel for citizenship, and Xero was held up as a model of what, with the investor\u2019s help, all the new start-ups could become.The New Zealand government was so enthusiastic about Mr. Thiel\u2019s investing prowess that it became a partner with him in early 2012, putting about $7 million into a Valar fund. The fund did well, primarily because of its big position in Xero.Valar is now based in New York, where it has been investing in European and Brazilian companies. Mr. Thiel declined to comment.\u201cIt\u2019s sad for New Zealand that Thiel and Valar didn\u2019t follow on with more investments,\u201d Lance Wiggs, a local investor, said. \u201cWe are starved for cash.\u201dXero, which has 1,400 employees and customers in 180 countries, took a different path. Its goal is to turn accountants into \u201cgrowth consultants,\u201d becoming a platform that soars above national borders.\u201cGay marriage, cultural tolerance, refugees, active strategies to address diversity \u2014 more than ever our leadership here is important,\u201d Mr. Drury wrote in an email to his staff immediately after the election. He proposed setting a moral example by bringing \u201csome refugee groups into our Wellington office.\u201dA postelection arrival at Xero from the United States is Nick Piesco, 40, who was writing code for a start-up in Austin, Tex. \u201cI\u2019d say the timing is coincidental but fortuitous,\u201d the programmer said of his move 7,437 miles west. Already he and his wife, Reneau Skinner, 39, are talking about becoming citizens.\u201cOne of the things that attracted me to Xero was the culture \u2014 how they make people feel welcome,\u201d Mr. Piesco said.That means those barred from the United States under the new administration\u2019s policies, or who think they might be, are ripe for recruitment, Mr. Drury said.\u201cEspecially in the U.S. technology industry, where something like 50 percent of the billion-dollar companies have been built by immigrants, it\u2019s nuts that you make it difficult for engineers to come in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy for us not to exploit that.\u201dThe LookSee Wellington initiative to bring in 100 software engineers was initially focused on Americans. Then word began to spread. By the time the contest was finally cut off on March 30, India had overtaken the United States in applications.\u201cWe\u2019re in a global talent war,\u201d said Chris Whelan, chief executive of the Economic Development Agency in Wellington.Mr. Drury is already looking to make LookSee an annual affair. After all, it takes the expensive problem of recruitment off Xero\u2019s hands and lets the government do it.\u201cIt\u2019s boom time for the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Drury said. The more immigrants, the better. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a lot. We\u2019ll take hundreds.\u201dAn article last Friday about New Zealand\u2019s efforts to court technology workers misstated the surname of a local investor. He is Lance Wiggs, not Biggs. Because of an editing error, the article also attributed incorrectly a quotation about immigration and tech labor. It was Rod Drury, the chief executive of the accounting software firm Xero \u2014 not Nick Piesco, a Xero employee \u2014 who said, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy for us not to exploit that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
