{"Headline": "Does a Son Need a Male Role Model?", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported bySocial Q\u2019sMy husband and I divorced when our son was a baby. It was messy, and my son has no contact with him \u2014 which is sort of the problem. I am an only child, my father is dead, and my close friends are women. So, my 12-year-old boy is without an adult male role model. I would like him to have one. A close friend has a wonderful son in college who will soon be coming home for the summer. Would it be crazy if I asked my friend (or her son) if he would be willing to hang out with my son?ANN MARIE, NEW YORKCrazy? No. But awkward and unlikely to achieve your goal? Most definitely. Twenty-year-olds and preteenagers are not natural playmates \u2014 unless you are living in the world of early Judd Apatow films. (And you probably don\u2019t want your son hanging out with that version of Seth Rogen.) Even if you shared your motives with your friend, it seems unlikely to me that you will squeeze more than an outing or two from a kindhearted Joe College.So, bring out the Benjamins. Be honest with your friend and her son, and offer to hire him to watch your young man once or twice a week. Depending on their interests (and your budget), they can play tennis in the park or go to dinner and a movie. Meanwhile, you can join a book club or catch up on your me-time. Win-win, right?My lovely 27-year-old daughter has intellectual deficits and a seizure disorder. Unfortunately, the seizures cannot be predicted or prevented, and they are disruptive. Even more unfortunately, my brother and sister-in-law used the seizures as their explicit reason for not inviting her to her cousin\u2019s bar mitzvah. (They said they were afraid she would distract their son during his speech.)I made my displeasure known, and soon we were both invited without another word. The problem: I\u2019m still so angry that I\u2019d like to punch my brother in the face. What should I do?ANNIEIt is not uncommon for people to make mistakes, give way to bad impulses or even be unkind \u2014 especially when their \u201cbig days\u201d are involved. Your brother and sister-in-law erred. But they also corrected their error, though silently, as soon as you pointed it out. Hold your tongue (for now), attend the bar mitzvah with your daughter and try to have a good time.When you can speak to your brother and his wife without threat of screaming, tell them their behavior hurt your feelings. They will probably apologize. When they do, remind yourself that their mistake grew out of the same protective impulse for their son that offended your vigilance on behalf of your daughter. Then accept the apology and move on.A close friend and his wife had twins three weeks ago. My friend and I Skyped frequently during the pregnancy, discussing his excitement and fears. (I live 3,000 miles away.) When his wife went into labor, I got text updates from him every few hours. But when the babies were born, one had serious health issues that kept him in the NICU. Understandably, the updates stopped.Since then, a guy who lives close to them has been designated point person and sends updates every few days. But I want to know much more than these emails contain. I\u2019m desperate to speak with my friend. I don\u2019t want to make him feel bad, but it\u2019s hard for me to know so little of what\u2019s going on, and I feel that I deserve to be more in the loop. What should I do?ANNAYou are clearly suffering from a small loss of perspective. This situation is not about you \u2014 or your desires \u2014 at all. Your dear friend is under great stress right now. Unless otherwise requested, your sole job, at a distance of 3,000 miles, is to shower him and his family with love and support. This excludes calls or messages that seek to guilt him into replying to you.To be clear, under no circumstances should your texts include the phrases \u201cdying to hear from you,\u201d \u201ctell me how you\u2019re doing\u201d or \u201cI miss speaking with you.\u201d Your sole message is: \u201cYou are not alone. I am here for you if you need anything, day or night. Pick up the phone whenever you want to talk.\u201d Trying to wheedle your way into more than that would be selfish \u2014 which I\u2019m pretty sure you don\u2019t mean to be.

Ryan for his committee chairmanship.Last year, Mr. Chaffetz publicly weighed running for governor of Utah in 2020, when his committee chairmanship would expire.He did not rule out that possibility Wednesday during an interview with KSL Newsradio in Utah, telling host Doug Wright that he \u201cmaybe\u201d would run for governor.Even Mr. Chaffetz\u2019s announcement left open the possibility of his return.\u201cI may run again for public office,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not in 2018.\u201dWhile his announcement was abrupt, he had sent private signals in recent weeks. Mr. Chaffetz recently told some contributors that he was considering quitting to pursue a television contract, according to a Republican official briefed on the conversation. A spokeswoman for Mr. Chaffetz did not immediately respond when asked whether he planned to accept such a contract.Instead, as much as perhaps any member of Congress, his fortunes turned with Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.During his time heading the committee, Mr. Chaffetz has focused often on two pet issues: criticizing the Secret Service for security lapses and holding Mrs. Clinton to account.Five days after the announcement, Mr. Chaffetz asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Mrs. Clinton had lied in her testimony before Congress about the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. Mr. Chaffetz had been one of the first lawmakers to raise questions about the Obama administration\u2019s role in Benghazi, traveling to Libya less than a month after the attacks to evaluate security standards.\u201cIt\u2019s the nature of being the committee chairman to conduct oversight of the administration,\u201d he said last year, describing his role as a pursuit of facts, not a political agenda.But with Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory in November, Mr. Chaffetz found himself in an uncomfortable position: a watchdog who often sounded disinclined to watch over a fellow Republican.\u201cI think that situation has taken care of itself,\u201d he said.A spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee was critical of Mr. Chaffetz\u2019s treatment of Mr. Trump.\u201cChaffetz refused to hold Trump and his family accountable for using the presidency to pad their bank accounts at the expense of Americans,\u201d the spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson, said in a statement Wednesday.Other disputes had nothing to do with oversight.Opposition has met Mr. Chaffetz in the capital as well. His tightfisted control of the District of Columbia\u2019s laws, which fall under his committee\u2019s purview, has been rewarded with a Washington-born, anti-Chaffetz political action committee.First elected in 2008, Mr. Chaffetz, who was a kicker on the Brigham Young University football team, has taken pride in sleeping in his office to save money.Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s France\u2019s Turn to Worry About Election Meddling by Russia", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe Return of Fillon to the Head of Opinion Polls,\u201d declared the bold headline, contradicting other French polls suggesting that the onetime favorite had fallen to third or even fourth place as he battled corruption charges.As it happens, Mr. Fillon\u2019s lead in the polls existed only in a world of alternative facts shared by the French-language service of Sputnik, a state-funded Russian news operation with the motto \u201cTelling the Untold.\u201dIs Moscow meddling covertly, as American intelligence agencies say it did before Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory? Or is it just benefiting from a network of politicians, journalists and others in France who share the Kremlin\u2019s views on politics there, and much else besides?Whatever the answer, squalls of fake news reports and a barrage of hacking attacks on the computers of Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign have left many in France \u2014 and Washington \u2014 with an unnerving sense of familiarity.It all looks so recognizable that Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, recently said, \u201cI think it\u2019s safe by everybody\u2019s judgment that the Russians are actively involved in the French elections.\u201dIt is also clear, however, that Russia often does not so much intrude as amplify existing voices with which it agrees, notably on Syria, the perils of American power and the futility of economic sanctions on Moscow.Nataliya Novikova, who leads Sputnik in Paris, said that its operations there, while eager to present Russia\u2019s take on events, did not serve Moscow but rather a French audience eager for a \u201cdifferent angle.\u201dComplaining that Mr. Macron and members of his staff had repeatedly ignored interview requests, she said that Sputnik tried to represent all points of view and had been unfairly branded a Russian bullhorn.\u201cThere are many different truths,\u201d Ms. Novikova said. \u201cThere has to be a pluralism of truth.\u201dRussia, or at least its state-controlled news media, has been backing two horses in the French race. One is Mr. Fillon, who, while prime minister from 2007 to 2012, struck up a friendship with Vladimir V. Putin, who is said to have sent the French politician a bottle of wine after the death of his mother.Among the accusations of financial impropriety engulfing Mr. Fillon\u2019s campaign is that he received $50,000 from a Lebanese businessman in return for arranging a meeting with Mr. Putin.The Kremlin dismissed the report as \u201cfake news.\u201dLately, Mr. Fillon has seen a bump in real opinion polls. They still put Mr. Macron in the lead, but the race is tight enough now that the final result, like those of the British referendum on leaving the European Union and the American presidential election, may defy the forecasts of pollsters.Mr. Macron, on the other hand, is the most enthusiastically pro-European Union candidate in the race, and Russia has been seeking to undermine and divide the union.Unlike in America, where attitudes toward Moscow formed during the Cold War often continue to hobble Russian efforts at public outreach, France has numerous individuals and organizations that speak out for views that mirror Russia\u2019s \u2014 and its preferences for the French election.Russia\u2019s influence machine, said Ms. Vaissi\u00e9, the Rennes professor, has been fueled in large part by \u201cthe paradox at the heart of our political discourse: a fascination with the United States and a permanent rejection of it that provides absolutely fertile ground for the Russians.\u201dAnti-Americanism in France has seeped deep into the center-right, encouraging an infatuation among some politicians with Russia and Mr. Putin that has provided Russian news outlets in France with some of their most bombastic pro-Russia and anti-Macron voices.It was Mr. Dhuicq who told Sputnik in February that Mr. Macron was a closet homosexual supported by a \u201cvery rich gay lobby.\u201d The claim, which set off a firestorm on social media, put Mr. Macron briefly on the defensive.The furor quickly fizzled, however, after the allegation was ridiculed by the candidate and the mainstream news media as a transparent exercise in the dark Russian art of \u201ckompromat,\u201d or using compromising information to embarrass or hinder.Mr. Dhuicq also contributed to a Sputnik article that derided Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, as a \u201cU.S. agent lobbying banks\u2019 interests.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Dhuicq stood by his claim that Mr. Macron had a secret double life and scoffed at allegations of Russian meddling as fantasy driven by paranoia imported from America.\u201cI trained as a psychiatrist and know what paranoia looks like,\u201d he said.The Russians \u201care clever enough to know their influence is close to zero on French voters,\u201d he added. \u201cMost people don\u2019t even know what Sputnik is.\u201d\u201cThe American phenomenon is being repeated here in France,\u201d said Pierre Haski, a founder of the liberal news site Rue89. \u201cA large section of the population has broken with the mainstream media and gets its information from parallel sources. This is the world in which RT and Sputnik have found their place.\u201dMounir Mahjoubi, digital director of the Macron campaign, said the principal goals of the state-funded Russian media outlets were to spread chaos and uncertainty and to undermine Mr. Macron while diverting attention from Mr. Fillon\u2019s legal troubles.\u201cAssange will pour oil on the fire of the French election campaign,\u201d RT reported.But a spokesman for WikiLeaks said that Mr. Assange had never given such an interview and had merely sent a short email responding to a question from an Izvestia reporter.Murkier still are the thousands of cyberstrikes against the Macron campaign\u2019s website and hundreds of attempts to gain access to its email accounts through so-called phishing attacks. The same tactic was used to gain entry to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers last year.The government has nonetheless taken the danger seriously, with Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault warning Moscow that \u201cthis kind of interference in French political life is unacceptable,\u201d and the country\u2019s equivalent of the National Security Council in Washington holding a special meeting to discuss cyberthreats.Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris said he doubted that any Russian efforts, whatever their nature, would have much impact on the election. While at times highly skilled at planting false information and creating confusion, \u201cthey often burn themselves while trying to burn down the house,\u201d he said.Beno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byTO THE EDITOR:I was fascinated by Lesley Stahl\u2019s reference (By the Book, April 16), while discussing Robert Caro\u2019s books about Lyndon Johnson, to \u201cthe loneliness of the isolated hill country of central Texas\u201d and to \u201cthose lonely Texas hills.\u201d I\u2019m curious as to whether these were Caro\u2019s representations or Stahl\u2019s interpretation of Caro\u2019s prose. The Hill Country is, for most of its residents, a state of mind, and its inhabitants relish its solitude and silence, finding the area to be not only enchanting but spiritually nourishing. Non-Texans are too often possessed of a romantic notion of our state as a desolate and lonely territory, forlorn in its isolation, but the Hill Country is no more lonely or forlorn than the Adirondacks or the Atlantic shoreline of New England.My father, like L.B.J., grew up there and longed to return after his sojourns in the capitals of the world. He died there and was buried in its rocky shallow soil, at rest in a region that fit him like a custom boot. I suspect Johnson, a proximate contemporary of my father\u2019s, felt the same way about \u201cthose lonely Texas hills.\u201d The Johnson family buried him there after all, not in Washington, which is a huge tell.\u2666TO THE EDITOR:Writers, book reviewers, editors, publishers and, above all, readers need to frame the last paragraph of Seth Mnookin\u2019s review of \u201cHigh Anxiety,\u201d by Sharon Begley (March 12) as a reminder of what we have lost and are losing. \u201cFor some inexplicable reason,\u201d Mnookin wrote, \u201cshe neglected to include source notes, a bibliography or any supporting material whatsoever. \u2026 With \u201cmore and more people swayed by fantasy, it\u2019s crucial that those of us who still believe in facts show why it is that we\u2019re trustworthy.\u201dI share Mnookin\u2019s \u201ccompulsive need to know why writers are confident their conclusions are correct\u201d and bemoan the increasing number of nonfiction works that do not have adequate footnote or endnote citations or bibliographies. The first step on this slippery slope was when footnotes became endnotes. The decline continued when footnotes were no longer numbered, and instead the reader, if she was lucky, would find in the back of the book a page number and a shortened quotation \u2014 too often not the controversial or incomplete assertion she hoped to trace. Now even nonfiction history is published without any notes (because it is \u201cpopular\u201d?). When educators are attempting to teach students to \u201cgo to the source,\u201d writers, reviewers, editors and publishers need to be sure that these sources can be located. It is their duty to the reader. Readers have a responsibility to demand this.\u2666TO THE EDITOR:Tom Carson\u2019s review of \u201cLetterman: The Last Giant of Late Night,\u201d by Jason Zinoman (April 16), mentions that in middle school Dave staged mock talk shows in a friend\u2019s basement. That may reflect the influence of Ruth Lyons, whose talk show, \u201cRuth Lyons 50-50 Club\u201d was broadcast on TV in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky at noon. Lyons, a pioneer of radio and TV, held court with a bouquet-covered microphone, leading discussions with her regulars, introducing the singers and chatting with her band leader. Visiting stars to the area stopped by. Lyons did not suffer fools gladly and she was never shy with her opinions. The regulars called her \u201cMother.\u201dI have read before that Dave, home from elementary school for lunch, watched this show with his mother. Steve Allen and Jack Paar, and probably Arthur Godfrey, all played in his boy\u2019s brain as he developed his brand. But my money for the strongest influence is likely to have been Ruth Lyons, a grilled cheese sandwich and some chicken noodle soup. That combo, while sitting by his mother in front of the TV in the 1950s, set him on his successful path.\u2666TO THE EDITOR:The distinction between elitist and popular art (Bookends, April 16) is another academic polarity like classical versus romantic and modern versus postmodern. All of the arts were originally forms of popular culture. In ancient Greece the theater was for everyone. Later, the novel was leisure reading for the middle class. Then the arts were co-opted by intellectual elites who further distinguished between high and low culture, resulting in such dichotomies as cinema versus film, ballet versus dance, literary versus popular fiction, poetry versus verse and theater versus Broadway.The writer is a professor emeritus of communication and English at Fairleigh Dickinson University.\u2666TO THE EDITOR:Another incredibly prescient dystopian work was E. M. Forster\u2019s story \u201cThe Machine Stops\u201d (1909), which depicts a world where people can communicate only via screens and are uncomfortable with interpersonal interactions.Letters may be edited for length and clarity.

It is filled with the people who help make our smartphones, our favorite games, the apps we download.But many have also come to make something else, perhaps \u2014 a new life in America.Often, they hope to call the United States home.\u201cWhat I have loved about the U.S. is that it didn\u2019t matter where you came from,\u201d Mr Gopal said. \u201cYour past, your color or religion didn\u2019t matter. If you did good work, there was a place for you here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always on guard because there is a chance that suddenly I\u2019ll get the news that I\u2019m no longer welcome,\u201d said Mr. Gopal, 32, who first came to the United States in 2012.Like many of Silicon Valley\u2019s workers who are here as part of the H-1B visa program, which is aimed at highly skilled workers, Mr. Gopal was born in India, attended university in the United States and got a job at a tech company. He said the Bay Area attracts the smartest engineers from all over the world because it is known as \u201ca magnet for technical skill.\u201dWhile growing up in India, Mr. Gopal was a fan of American television shows and cartoons. After he graduated from Carnegie Mellon University, he was excited to take his parents to Disneyland.H-1B visa holders account for about 15 percent of the American work forces at Facebook and Qualcomm, according to the most recent documents the companies have filed with the Labor Department. Silicon Valley start-ups, which often drive tech innovation, employ many engineers on student and work visas, as do tech giants like Google and Apple.Some visa holders, like Sujay Jaladi, have been in America for so long that they cannot imagine living elsewhere. Mr. Jaladi, 35, has lived here for 15 years, first on a student visa and then on a series of H-1B visas. He applied for a green card in 2012 and is waiting for the application to be approved. His wife, Priya, also holds an H-1B visa and works at a tech company.\u201cMy family lives in India and I love that country,\u201d said Mr. Jaladi, \u201cbut I have spent my adult life in the United States and it definitely feels like more of a home to me.\u201dMr. Jaladi commutes an hour each day to work as the head of information security at Gusto, a company that provides human resources services to small businesses. He enjoys meals at home and weekend shopping trips to Costco. He and his wife love to cook.But visas are always on his mind, along with the possibility that he may have to return to India.\u201cOur ability to stay in the U.S., with good standing, depends on the visa process,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking hard is just one factor. If the financial markets are hit and your job lays people off, H-1B visa holders have a limited time to find another job and get into good standing before we have to leave the country. If the market is down and jobs numbers are low, there will be more H-1Bs in the market looking for jobs.\u201dMr. Jaladi isn\u2019t the only one who has found himself in immigration limbo at Gusto. Shub Jain, a 26-year-old software engineer there, graduated from the University of California, San Diego, in 2014, worked at Microsoft and last fall moved to San Francisco for a job at the H.R. start-up. He has been working on an extended student visa and has lost out on the H-1B visa lottery three times. This is the last year he will be eligible to apply. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave the country.\u201dMr. Jain\u2019s life is like that of many 20-something professionals. He loves cars and driving around California, as well as exploring new restaurants with friends. But the feeling of welcome he has always experienced in the United States has shifted as politicians have changed their views on immigration.\u201cMy conversations with friends have changed,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to look at the news every morning, but now I don\u2019t because I don\u2019t want it to impact my work. I look at night. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll read.\u201dLike many tech employees, Mr. Jain took a gamble on a smaller start-up. But his decision came with extra risk. At Microsoft, he could deal with visa issues by relocating to one of the company\u2019s many global offices. He does not have that option at Gusto.Mr. Jain talks about his anxieties with teammates like Nicholas Gervasi, 32, a Canadian who is working at Gusto on an H-1B visa. Thanks to provisions under the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Gervasi has had an easier time living and working in the United States than his colleagues from India, and he expects his green card application to be approved soon.Mr. Jain\u2019s sister attended the University of Illinois, worked on a trading floor in Chicago and left the country after she was unable to get an H1-B visa. She has since started her own company and talks to Mr. Jain almost every day as he prepares himself for the possibility that he will have to leave.Because of his uncertain situation, Mr. Jain\u2019s best friend from college recently visited for a month to play video games, go on drives and spend as much time together as they could.Some critics of the H-1B visa program say there are more than enough Americans with technology degrees to fill all the technical jobs in the United States. Others say that Silicon Valley companies do not cast a wide enough net for American job candidates. But tech executives have long said that there are not enough Americans with the advanced math and science skills necessary to succeed at their companies.Mr. Gervasi said that companies \u201cshould be empowered to hire the best people.\u201d Joshua Reeves, the chief executive and founder of Gusto, agreed, noting that 8 percent of his work force is on a visa or green card. Gusto\u2019s hiring policy has never taken a candidate\u2019s citizenship into account, and Mr. Reeves said the company was \u201ccommitted to sticking to that mind-set.\u201dThat commitment could be tested over the next few years, given that the White House is continuously looking for ways to curb immigration as it seeks to enact America-first policies.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like living under this \u2014 maybe not fear \u2014 but a worry about what\u2019s next and what will happen,\u201d Mr. Jain said. \u201cThis feeling of being unwelcome in the country.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Shift on Russia Brings Geopolitical Whiplash", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisEven in a presidency marked by unpredictability, the head-spinning shift from coziness to confrontation has left Washington and other capitals with a case of geopolitical whiplash. The prospects of improving Russian-American relations were already slim given the atmosphere of suspicion stemming from Kremlin meddling in last year\u2019s election, but the d\u00e9tente once envisioned by Mr. Trump has instead deteriorated into the latest cold war.For some critics, it seemed to be a cynical way of distracting attention from the multiple investigations into possible contacts between associates of Mr. Trump and Russia even as Moscow was trying to help Mr. Trump win the presidency.Either way, it suggested that the relationship between the two powers could be volatile in the months to come, subject to the impulsive reactions of a president with no prior experience in foreign policy, the often strident responses of a Russian leader given to his own moments of pique and the clashing national interests of both countries in key areas around the world.\u201cI was skeptical from the beginning that it would be possible for the United States and Russia, after all that happened in the last few years, to engage in a successful reset,\u201d said Angela Stent, a former national intelligence officer on Russia now at Georgetown University. \u201cWhat\u2019s surprising is how quickly we returned to the status quo ante we had at the end of the Obama administration.\u201dJohn R. Beyrle, a former ambassador to Moscow, said the extremes of the relationship were being exaggerated and it would probably settle back into the middle. \u201cLevels of trust have deteriorated so much that these initial meetings will produce little in the way of agreements and the investigations into likely Russian interference in the election cast a huge shadow that both sides need to acknowledge,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump is the fourth president in a row who came into office determined to reboot the relationship with Moscow, an ambition that often eluded the other three. The difference is that the hacking of Democratic email during last year\u2019s election, for which intelligence agencies blamed Russia, made Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of Mr. Putin politically problematic.The Russians have responded with harsh language of their own. On Tuesday, Mr. Putin compared Mr. Trump\u2019s action in Syria to President George W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq in 2003. And Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev suggested that Mr. Trump has turned out not to be what he presented himself to be during last year\u2019s campaign.Mr. Morell said on Tuesday that despite calling Mr. Trump a virtual Russian agent, he always believed Russian behavior would lead to a parting of the ways. \u201cThis seems to be happening now,\u201d he said. But he noted that Mr. Trump has left it to Mr. Tillerson and others rather than speaking out himself.\u201cHe needs to do that, and he needs to be critical of the large number of other aggressive actions that Putin has undertaken over the past two years,\u201d Mr. Morell said.Either way, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that it changes anything I think happened in the election or that Democrats should back off investigations. And moreover, it\u2019s really weird that he himself hasn\u2019t said anything.\u201dMr. Trump will have the opportunity on Wednesday when he hosts NATO\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. European leaders will be listening to what Mr. Trump has to say, given that during the campaign he criticized NATO even as he praised Mr. Putin.Aides to Mr. Trump have been frustrated at the focus on the Russia investigations and the assumptions that the president\u2019s associates did something wrong even though several officials have said no evidence has emerged that proves collusion with Russia. They blame the media for creating a false narrative that they see as now disproved. How, they ask, could Mr. Trump\u2019s team have made secret deals with Russia if his own secretary of state cannot even get a meeting?\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that we went from all of these direct links to Russia to now are we disappointed that we can\u2019t even get a meeting with him,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. \u201cThere is a bit of irony in the question.\u201dEven though some question the president\u2019s approach to Russia, Eric Trump said his father would not be \u201cpushed around\u201d by Mr. Putin. \u201cHe is not a guy who gets intimidated,\u201d he said.The back-and-forth over Russia left lawmakers trying to make sense of it.\u201cIt speaks to the broader incoherence of this administration\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d said Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cThe change in rhetoric on Russia is head-spinning. I\u2019m glad to see it and I hope it continues, but so far the only thing we know about this administration\u2019s foreign policy is that it will probably change in a week or two.\u201dBut Mr. Murphy said the congressional intelligence committees still need to investigate what happened in last year\u2019s election. If the shift in tone from the administration happened two months ago, he said, it might have undercut that determination. But since then, he said, more evidence has emerged.\u201cThere\u2019s now some pretty important meat on the bones of this story,\u201d he said. \u201cThe imperative remains to get to the bottom of it.\u201dA news analysis article on Wednesday about President Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia misspelled the surname of a former acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

{"Headline": "DNA Tests, and Sometimes Surprising Results", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Supported byFor the last decade, I have invited hundreds of people to be part of ancestry DNA tests. But first I ask people how they identify themselves racially. It has been very interesting to explore their feelings about the differences between how they define themselves and what their DNA makeup shows when the test results come in.Biologically, our ancestral differences reflect only a 0.1 percent difference in DNA. Yet we often cling to those differences \u2014 both in unity with our fellow people of origin and, at times, in divisiveness.Over all, the experiment has provided a special opportunity to explore the lines of race.\u00a0I found that as human beings, our strategies for survival are the same, and our similarities far outweigh our differences.But inside each comment was a longing to find out more. And a long-term, ever-deepening conversation began. Keep in mind that analyzing a person\u2019s ancestry through DNA, means looking back\u00a0hundreds of years. People receive only half of their DNA from each parent, and therefore the race or identity of either parent may be too diluted to show up in these tests.\u00a0As a black girl growing up in the 1960s, I often felt race undermined me. I was expected to love Motown, but not ballet. I was praised for speaking standard English, but my interest in the sciences was never appreciated and certainly not cultivated.\u00a0Random doors opened; others closed.It took me 10 years before I tested myself. What I found both confirmed and shook my perspective. My background included African heritage from the Gold Coast, including Nigeria and Ghana, intermingled with British and Scandinavian. I suspect this reflects the impact of the brutal Viking Age and later the English in the slave trade.However, my grandfather shared with me years ago that in his birthplace of Mobile, Ala., his earliest memories were of Chinese merchants living alongside poor black folks like him. So who knows?Today I look at faces, even my own, with new recognition. I see that people regularly share narratives that miss something their physical features suggest, and sometimes we find ancestry that we would not have imagined. It is a new twist on an old narrative made possible by cutting-edge science. The conversation is complicated and jagged, and it mercifully undermines neat, simplistic stories. Thoughts about her ancestry results: When I questioned my Aunt Morra when there was no Native American in my profile, she said, \u201cOh honey, we just thought that was a nice story to tell, especially since we have such nice high cheekbone structure.\u201dThoughts about his ancestry results: Since coming to college I have seen so many new people, had new experiences. Finding some Middle Eastern in my background was one of them. That fact caught my mother off guard.Thoughts about his ancestry results: What are you trying to do to me? You have caused a lot of problems in my family. I know my nose is sharp and my skin is light, but my politics are as black as night. Today, I don\u2019t identify as mixed. I reject my white privilege in a racist America. There is no way that I or my kids will identify as anything other than black.Thoughts about his ancestry results: I believe that we can all trace our roots back to Africa. I believe in being a citizen of the world, and we humans are all connected by flesh and blood. Know anyone else who might like to subscribe to Race/Related?

Two others \u2014 Jada Foxworth, 16, and Destiny Dones, 20 \u2014 were sisters and were cousins of the boys.Rashawn was the son of Dajuana Green, who owned the house and was away when the fire broke out, the police said. Chayce was Ms. Green\u2019s grandson. Melody was a friend.\u201cCan you imagine that? My 17-year-old daughter? A mother isn\u2019t supposed to bury her baby!\u201d Melody\u2019s mother, Rosezetta Edwards, said on Sunday evening as she stood outside Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens. A few hours earlier, the bodies of her daughter and the sisters had been taken there.Melody went to the house, on 208th Street in Queens Village, to print out papers for school and to see Ms. Green\u2019s nephew, whom she had been dating, her mother said. She was a star volleyball player at Queens High School of Teaching, Liberal Arts and the Sciences, and had planned to study law at State University of New York at Purchase, where she had been accepted, her mother said.A quick wit and a natural joker, Melody used her traits to defuse family disputes so that any spat ended with laughter. She was also excitedly planning her graduation party \u2014 a celebration made more special because she would be sharing the day with one of her sisters, who is graduating from a master\u2019s program in the spring.As Melody headed out, she said goodbye to her mother, who was planting flowers in the garden.Soon, fire trucks began to stream by while Ms. Edwards was in her yard. \u201cAnd then I found out it was my girl!\u201d Ms. Edwards said.\u201cWho thinks they are going to wake up on such a beautiful Sunday,\u201d she said, her voice trailing off as she leaned against the brick hospital wall for support. \u201cAnd if I should\u2019ve, could\u2019ve, would\u2019ve \u2014 I would have stopped her, said she should stay.\u201d She began to sob. \u201cBut who could ever have known?\u201dPhotographs of Rashawn on his mother\u2019s Facebook page show him in smart outfits, with bow ties and suspenders.

Nigro, the commissioner of the Fire Department. Sheener Bailey Briggs, Ms. Green\u2019s sister, identified the man as Maurice Matthews. Before retreating out the window, she said, Mr. Matthews tried to save one child while another cried for help from another part of the house, but the fire forced him out entirely. He is now in stable condition, the police said.While firefighters fought the blaze, the police removed Mr. Matthews from the scene for his own safety, according to a law-enforcement official. As people had arrived in the area, some had begun to attack him, screaming and asking why he had left the children inside, the official said.\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very sad day for the people of our city when five young lives are taken from us, five promising young lives,\u201d Mr. Nigro said at a news conference on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m very sad for that community, for that family and the members of this department who had to deal with that.\u201dA Fire Department official said on Sunday that it was highly unusual for so many people to die in a fire in the middle of the day, when people are typically awake and able to escape.The four-alarm fire is still under investigation. It swiftly consumed the nearly century-old wooden house; 168 firefighters and 39 vehicles were called to the scene.Four firefighters sustained minor injuries, according to the Fire Department. \u201cThey made a very daring and valiant push into that building to try to save the residents,\u201d Mr. Nigro said. \u201cThey knew there were people inside.\u201dFamily members and friends grappled with the enormity of the fire. In the hours immediately afterward, many arrived at the hospital in Jamaica to a scene of grief, punctuated by the anguished screams of each new visitor who arrived to learn that the news was true.

{"Headline": "How Sicily Cemented an Unlikely Friendship", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byThe Love IssueBut over the four years that passed since we met, Viola became more than that. Even though we communicated only via the internet, having long, funny, intimate chats, she became a confidante (and, more recently, with my latest book, my Italian translator). I\u2019ve read and loved her novels, which revolve around young, unconventional women who have complicated relationships with reality, and are often otherworldly. My favorite, \u201cHollow Heart,\u201d is written from the perspective of a ghost, a suicide victim who is haunting the living.Viola is, predictably, wise beyond her years; emotionally, I am permanently trapped in my early 30s, so together we make a good friend match. I knew someday we would meet again; it was just a question of when and where.Then, last fall, my Italian publisher arranged a tour for me for my most recent book, starting in Milan and ending at my favorite Italian bookstore, Modusvivendi Libreria, in Palermo in Sicily. Viola is from Catania, on the opposite side of the island, about two and half hours away by bus. She agreed to meet me for two days, with two nights of readings at the store \u2014 a long time to spend with someone you have met only for a few minutes. Still, I loved the idea of an emotional adventure, taking a risk. We would see if our brief meeting four years before was a fluke or if our May-December friendship was built to last.I\u2019d been to Palermo before, in 2014, to visit the same bookstore. My time there had been limited to one night and one day, and most of my exploring had involved hunting for street food along its back alleys. Palermo is a highly walkable city, with cobblestone streets that seem eternally damp, and, at least by daylight, safe. A day\u2019s amble there seemed like a fine waste of time at that moment, though I didn\u2019t leave Palermo knowing much more about it than when I had arrived. But now was my chance to get to know the city better.And we were off to a fine start as the bookstore had generously arranged for our lodgings in a literary-inspired Airbnb. Bed and Book is a sunny, bright, two-story building with bookshelves full of first editions, and an outdoor seating area where readings and book club discussions are held. Marco, the cool, young proprietor, has a Ph.D. in cultural studies and semiotics, and was writing a book about street and urban art. He even took us on a brief tour of Palermo street art.But Viola was to be my true guide. And Viola had opinions about Palermo, not to mention Italy in general. For me, the best way to get to know a city is the same as with a human being: learn both the flaws and the charms. I cannot fully love something until I know both. To my eye Palermo had seemed like a pretty, crumbling city, perhaps careless in its beauty. Viola saw something else.\u201cIt\u2019s a Jackson Pollock painting in city form,\u201d she said over coffee the next morning, before we set out on our adventure for the day. \u201cThere is an abstract quality in the structure of its everyday life, in the way cars and people and everything interact, and it\u2019s very violent and unpredictable. Like, you never know, a car could hit you while you\u2019re walking on the sidewalk.\u201dI found this thrilling \u2014 not the getting hit by a car part, but the unpredictability. Anything could happen. After 18 years in New York City, I long always for a surprise.Until that point, everything had been tall and spacious, a testament, as I always feel in so many European cities, to masculinity. But as we veered up Via Cappuccini toward the catacombs, the streets grew more cluttered, the buildings more humble, the sidewalks more narrow and crowded with garbage and oddly parked vehicles, until we were dodging speeding scooters. Viola was annoyed by the tumult, but I think slightly pleased, too, that her point was proved.And then we arrived at the catacombs, their exterior a plain, graying building with a small plaza and parking lot. Nothing seemed suspect. Heretofore my main understanding of catacombs had been from \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d in a scene where the von Trapps seek shelter from the Nazis; it was a place where dead bodies were hidden away from innocent eyes. The Palermo catacombs, however, were not made for Technicolor. We entered, and walked down to the depths of the building.The catacombs, first founded in the 16th century as a place to house deceased friars, were the most haunted place I\u2019ve ever been. I sensed a specific energy in the particles in the air; there was a thickness to it, as if they were parting and allowing us in as we moved through the space, pushing us along. Practically every inch of wall space was decorated with a dead body. There was no downtime for the mind. We were fully present with death.Just when I had gotten over the shock and had grown accustomed to the atmosphere, we approached the cavallo di battaglia, a small child encased in a glass coffin.\u201cThis was what I wanted to see,\u201d Viola said excitedly. It was Rosalia Lombardo, the last person to be embalmed in the catacombs. She had died at the age of 2 in 1920. Viola explained that because the child had been embalmed much later than the friars and the rest of the townspeople, a different method had been used on her, which helped to preserve her better. I looked closely. She looked perfectly human, but her skin was purple. There was a small bow in her hair. \u201cThat is \u2026 no joke,\u201d I said, and held myself steady. A hundred stories blossomed in my head about a purple child sleeping in a glass case forever.There could be no more surprises left, I was certain, but oh, no, there was one more delight waiting for us. For around the corner was a nook of female forms hanging high on the wall, with words painted next to them. Viola translated: \u201cThey are virgins, they follow the lamb\u201d \u2014 they had kept themselves pure for God. We both smirked. \u201cWhy is it the women always have to be the virgins?\u201d I said. \u201cStuck sexless for eternity, that doesn\u2019t seem fair at all.\u201d Outside I bought a postcard of the virgins, so I could remember them forever. As if there was any chance of forgetting them.We sat outside and ate a slice of setteveli, a seven-layer chocolate hazelnut cake (veli means veils), reportedly invented at the pasticceria. As we ate, Viola told me the most salacious story about the Italian publishing industry \u2014 one final surprise \u2014 thus sealing our friendship forever. Surprise me and then feed me, that\u2019s all I desire.Cars zoomed by us, precariously close, and we stared at the crooked, gritty facades of buildings in the distance. Yes, there was the chaos of a Pollock painting, but those paintings are gorgeous in their disorder. And Palermo will always be perfect to me no matter what, because that is where I got to spend time with my friend.Jami Attenberg is the author of six books of fiction, including, most recently, \u201cAll Grown Up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In fact, they don\u2019t mention McDonald\u2019s at all \u2014 though they do mention Coca-Cola and Google.The ads, which started running last week, are meant to play on how teens and twentysomethings use their phones while watching TV, while also acknowledging \u201chow they\u2019re discovering information\u201d they trust, said Deborah Wahl, chief marketing officer of McDonald\u2019s for the United States. \u201cThey are very influenced by word of mouth and what their peers say,\u201d she said.Ms. Kaling posted to Twitter on Friday that she recently \u201cpartnered with a brand without being able to say the name of the brand,\u201d and jokingly asked to be paid in fries.\u201cGoogle didn\u2019t give us any tricks on search or anything,\u201d Ms. Wahl said, adding that gaming the system would have gone against the whole idea of the campaign. \u201cWhat they\u2019re helping us do is understand if people are really searching as a result of this, and offering close feedback and collaboration in terms of what\u2019s happening with this with real behavior.\u201dMs. Wahl said the company is prepared for people to try to interfere with the results, which is by now a hallmark of ad campaigns that involve social media. But, she said, it was anticipating a positive reaction given the conversations about Coke and McDonald\u2019s that were already out there. (Burger King, which relied on the Wikipedia entry for one of its burgers as part of its stunt, saw several mischievous revisions of that page last week.)Selecting Ms. Kaling as a pitchwoman for this campaign was also a deliberate choice, Ms. Wahl said, noting that she has been a vocal fan of the brand for years.

{"Headline": "What I Wish I\u2019d Known Before Moving in Together", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byWhen my boyfriend, Mike DiPasquale, asked me to move in with him after two years of dating, I was thrilled. Even though I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what I was signing up for.Just the prospect of no longer needing to keep two bottles of contact lens solution, two toothbrushes and two sticks of deodorant in two separate homes was enough to have me jumping for joy. Visions of plush rugs, soft lighting and cuddling in front of a fireplace filled my head.Friends and family didn\u2019t give me much practical advice before I moved into Mike\u2019s condo, a third-floor studio inside a former South Philadelphia Catholic elementary school. His mother attended school here in the early 1960s; we boil pasta, play video games and take showers in what was once her seventh-grade classroom.My mother gave us a $100 gift certificate to Crate and Barrel, but she didn\u2019t tell me what to anticipate.I Googled \u201cMoving in with your boyfriend,\u201d but the search results landed with a thud. The advice was dry and didn\u2019t speak to my concerns: How do I know if I\u2019m picking a compatible person to move in with? What if he\u2019s annoyed by my hourlong phone calls with my sister, the sweatpants I wear around the house, or the insane amount of hair I shed on every available surface?It\u2019s clear why couples find cohabitation so appealing. Aside from the convenience it affords, the prospect of splitting rent and utility bills is too seductive to pass up. Add in a desire to shed roommates and a reluctance to renew a pricey lease, and you can see why plenty of couples choose cohabitation, even if they aren\u2019t exactly sure what comes next.I was so focused on the elation of moving in with Mike that I didn\u2019t even consider what would happen if our relationship went down in flames. We had never discussed who would stay in the condo, who would take possession of the Passat we leased together, or which one of us would get to keep our three-legged cat, Eleanor.Turns out we\u2019re not alone. Most couples don\u2019t take the time to walk through the financial and legal implications of cohabitation beforehand. According to leading legal and financial experts, that\u2019s a major mistake and a missed opportunity.If you are renting or own a home, figure out who will stay in the event of a breakup. Nail down who will pay any pesky fees or taxes. Come up with a plan.In light of this practical advice, I pushed Mike to discuss what would happen if we should break up.Initially, he was reluctant to discuss the possibility. He said he\u2019d be so devastated that he would start a new life from scratch. While I appreciated the drama of his response, we still needed to develop a road map.Since Mike had owned his condo before we started dating, we agreed he should continue to live in it. I volunteered to move in with my parents until I found a more permanent place. I\u2019d keep the Passat and pay the remaining payments on the lease. And Eleanor would stay with me. (I was thrilled I could keep the cat, but I didn\u2019t want to cheer too loudly.)After we settled on the details of our dissolution, we gave each other a long hug.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to think five steps ahead,\u201d Ms. Friedman said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no fun at first. Then it becomes a project you can work on together.\u201dApart from thorny financial and legal concerns, cohabitation creates a new set of emotional constraints for couples as well.\u201cWhen you live together,\u201d Dr. Rhoades explained, \u201cyou face all the issues dating couples face \u2014 time together, managing friends, jealousy, ex-partners \u2014 but you also face all the issues married couples face, like household contributions, managing money together and planning for future expenditures.\u201dIt can be an especially risky undertaking if the couple immediately goes from a long-distance relationship to cohabitation. Katie Leggett and Allen Hotchkiss did just that. The couple dated for over a year while Ms. Leggett lived in the West Village and Mr. Hotchkiss lived in Chicago. Then they moved into an apartment together in Park Slope, Brooklyn.\u201cWe knew we could get more bang for our buck if we just took the plunge and moved in together when my lease was up, versus getting separate studios, or dealing with roommates for another year in our late 20s,\u201d Ms. Leggett said. \u201cIt was definitely an adjustment.\u201d\u201cThere were very few surprises upon moving in with each other,\u201d Mr. Hotchkiss recalled. \u201cTalking about all of the possible \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios is the only way to make sure living together is the right move.\u201dA self-confessed Type A germophobe, Ms. Leggett follows a strict set of rules: No shoes in the house and no clothes that have been worn on the subways on the bed. She showers twice a day.Mr. Hotchkiss is more laid back. \u201cFor me, it was about picking the right battles and respecting Katie\u2019s key points of contention, like taking my shoes off at the door or not wearing my \u2018subway clothes\u2019 on the bed,\u201d Mr. Hotchkiss said. This willingness to meet in the middle eased the transition considerably.Mike and I slid into certain habits when it came to chores. I\u2019m happiest food shopping, cooking meals and emptying the dishwasher. Mike prefers washing the dishes, doing the laundry, making the bed and taking out the trash.We were happy to assign chores based on whoever expressed more enthusiasm. However it quickly became evident that our cleanliness standards are wildly different.Mike can spot a sesame seed five yards away, and he folds his T-shirts into precise, flat squares. I leave a trail of crumbs in my wake, and my clothes are not so much folded as herded into a vague rectangle. We had to adjust our standards. I\u2019m learning to sweep up my errant crumbs, and he\u2019s learning to live with a little chaos.And I knew Mike detested clutter, but we didn\u2019t have any discussions about how we would adjust his 874-square-foot space to fit both our physical needs. Apparently, this lack of conversation around design is also very common.After a year of dating, Armando Morales and Annie Simeone decided it was silly for them both to be paying New York City rents, especially since hers was twice what he paid. Last June they figured they could make it work in Mr. Morales\u2019s apartment in Ridgewood, Queens, pending a drastic reworking of the space.Fortunately, Ms. Simeone works as a production designer for film and television. She created a rendering of the apartment and its furniture layout using a three-dimensional modeling program, which allowed her to envision various floor plans. Mr. Morales crafted custom shelving so they could save even more space.\u201cWe have a classic New York railroad, with a kitchen on one end and the bedroom on the other. In between is an office and a living room,\u201d Mr. Morales said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for a couple in that you can be together but also have separate space when you need it.\u201dAnother reason couples choose to cohabitate is to spend more time together. It\u2019s been interesting to see how Mike and I use that time.Like most modern couples, we are never far away from our cellphones. We\u2019re quick to browse social media at the slightest lull in conversation. I prefer to scroll through Facebook while he\u2019s more of a Twitter guy. Over time, I sensed that our willingness to plug in (and ignore each other) was affecting the quality of our interactions.If you\u2019re doing something mindless with your partner, like watching TV, just focus on that. Don\u2019t also check your work email, play Candy Crush or do anything else to draw your attention away from each other.\u201cYour partner can be a source of deep and lasting joy, connection, meaning, fulfillment,\u201d Dr. Carter said. \u201cYour phone cannot.\u201dIn the end, some of my initial concerns proved silly. Mike doesn\u2019t mind that I shed like Mr. Snuffleupagus in August. When I conduct marathon phone calls with my sister, he catches up on his social media apps. He\u2019s happy to scrub the toilet, as long as I clean the shower.We are stronger for taking this step and navigating our sandwich phase \u2014 this premarriage, postdating bubble \u2014 with clear eyes.Having those difficult talks about our finances and being more mindful of the space we share, the chores we perform and the habits we cultivate, we\u2019re well on our way to creating a happy home.After living together for two years \u2014 and after countless loads of laundry and a dizzying number of dishwasher cycles \u2014 Mike and I tied the knot on April 21, 2017. Eleanor is thrilled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cellphones in Hand, Saudi Women Challenge Notions of Male Control", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byLately a lot of women in Saudi Arabia have been loudly speaking out against male control over their lives, but as several have recently found, it is still the men who have the last word.The three cases are part of a campaign by Saudi women, who have been broadcasting daring videos with their cellphones, using Facebook to organize street protests and posting Twitter messages to challenge the very idea of male supremacy in their famously patriarchal society.What use is the right to drive, the young activists ask, if a woman still needs a man\u2019s permission to leave the house?Even among some of the activists themselves, there has been surprise at the response. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed; a few years ago I thought I was the only one who thought this way,\u201d said Moudi al-Johani, 26, a Saudi woman who said she was locked up by her family when she returned from Florida during a college vacation.The online Saudi activists have at times been provocative, with a number of women apparently within Saudi Arabia posting photographs and videos of themselves online after removing their head scarves, often in public. While that would not earn more than a glance in most Muslim societies, in Saudi Arabia these women risk arrest by the religious police, who enforce the kingdom\u2019s ultrastrict, Wahhabi version of Islam.\u201cCases like Dina\u2019s case are the direct result of a system that keeps women in a perpetual state of being a minor,\u201d said Ahmed Benchemsi, a researcher for Human Rights Watch.One of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms was to rein in the religious police, sharply curtailing their powers in recent months, which is one of the reasons women are starting to speak up more now.Moreover, women who campaigned for greater rights in the 1990s did not have the sort of internet tools now so widely available to activists, said a Saudi historian and women\u2019s activist, Hatoon al-Fassi. \u201cWe are witnessing a different phenomenon today where more young women are becoming outspoken about deciding their own fates, and going public with it,\u201d Ms. Fassi said.But activists are quick to note that the social media uprising does not necessarily represent what all Saudi women are feeling. \u201cThere are a lot of indicators on both sides,\u201d Mr. Benchemsi said. \u201cYou also have religious preachers with millions of followers on social media, so you see some signs of a loosening, but you also see signs of the opposite.\u201dMs. Johani said that since fleeing last year, her activism has attracted many other young women who want to free themselves from their male relatives. \u201cI get tens of messages every day from Saudi women trying to seek help,\u201d she said, \u201cand every day they literally ask me, \u2018How did you manage, how can we get help?\u2019\u201dBut she also gets plenty of hate mail and death threats, she said, from both men and women.Ben Hubbard contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Growth in Pizza, Paint and Credit-Card Companies", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byGrowth stocks \u2014 those whose earnings are expected to grow faster than average \u2014 surged in the first quarter. They carried with them the managers of several of the quarter\u2019s top-performing stock funds.Those managers grabbed onto that growth in expected sorts of companies, like Alphabet and Facebook, and in more surprising and mature ones like MasterCard, Domino\u2019s and Sherwin-Williams.The funds are also unified by a philosophy, Mr. Lynch said.\u201cWhat we do is try to buy good growth companies and own them for many years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look very different from any benchmark. We have differentiated holdings, and we take concentrated positions. And with that, comes some volatility.\u201d Shares of Amazon and Facebook, for example, each accounted for about 9 percent of the Growth fund\u2019s assets at the end of February.Morningstar\u2019s numbers bear out Mr. Lynch\u2019s points. The three funds\u2019 turnover ratios, indicating the percentage of holdings sold annually, are below average, while their risk ratings are above. Put differently, the funds tend to trade less than average, but their returns tend to roller-coaster more than the indexes they\u2019re benchmarked against.A characteristic shared by many of the funds\u2019 holdings is that they can be tough to pigeonhole in a conventional investment sector, like technology or health care, Mr. Lynch said. \u201cIf there\u2019s not an easy category or comparison, then the company is more likely unique,\u201d he said.Take Alphabet, the holding company for Google. Many people call it a tech company, but it makes its money from advertising, which would traditionally point to media. \u201cThey used the internet to create a large audience and then disrupted the advertising world,\u201d he said.The largest and, in the most recent quarter, best performing of the three Morgan Stanley funds was the Growth fund. The fund, whose A shares carry an expense ratio of 0.96 percent, returned 16.25 percent for the quarter, compared with 5.5 percent for the S.&P. 500-stock index.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to identify two to three dozen high-growth companies whose stocks have little to do with one another,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then let that growth germinate. We\u2019re trying to invest in companies for three or four years.\u201dAnother point of emphasis is ensuring the returns of the fund\u2019s investments are not correlated with one another. The managers do that by using both statistical screens and fundamental analyses of how businesses may interact in unexpected ways, Mr. Galvin said. It is also one of the reasons they limit the portfolio\u2019s size. After about 35 stocks, he said, correlations in stock prices start to rise. \u201cEither the companies are competing with each other, or they\u2019re impacted by the same macroeconomic trends,\u201d he said.One of the qualities that drew Mr. Galvin and his colleagues to Domino\u2019s, the pizza delivery chain, was that its size and strong financials have enabled it to invest heavily in technology. And that has differentiated it from independent pizza peddlers, he said.\u201cThe digital divide is finally separating them from the mom-and-pop operators,\u201d he said. \u201cWith digital, you tap the app and have a pizza delivered, along with other menu items. Local operators don\u2019t have the financial wherewithal to invest in that kind of technology.\u201dMr. Galvin and his team divide their holdings into two groups: established companies, like Domino\u2019s, and emerging ones, like biotechnology outfits. The former \u201cprovide ballast to the portfolio,\u201d and the latter, opportunities for outsized returns, he said.\u201cWhen you have about half the portfolio in each of those, it blends out at an 18 to 22 percent level\u201d of average earnings growth, he said.The Columbia fund, whose A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.08 percent, returned 15.6 percent in the first quarter.\u201cI was just trading too much, and I didn\u2019t think I was that good at trading,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m doing good work, I should recognize mistakes, but I should also let the ideas develop.\u201d That means selling when he\u2019s sure an investment has gone bad but also hanging on through down periods if he is confident in a company\u2019s plans and prospects.Like any growth manager, Mr. Weiner hunts for strong, sustainable earnings growth. That has led him to put more than a third of the portfolio in technology stocks, like Facebook and Amazon. But it can also lead him into less obvious plays like the paint company Sherwin-Williams.\u201cThe paint-store business is huge and consistent and grows nicely year in and year out,\u201d he said. Sherwin-Williams caters to professional painters, and they\u2019re loyal in return. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go to Home Depot,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want 30-day terms.\u201d That is, they want to finance purchases for a month, rather than paying upfront.The business has pricing power, too, he said. The actual paint is a small enough portion of the cost of most paint jobs that the final consumer is not that sensitive to changes in price. \u201cPeople hire a painter and get a quote and have no idea what the cost of paint is in the quote,\u201d Mr. Weiner said.The Growth Discovery Fund, with an expense ratio of 0.78 percent, returned 12.15 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Syrian Refugees Laud U.S. Strike and, in \u2018New Emotion,\u2019 Trump", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byLess than two months after arriving in the United States as a refugee from Syria, Rashid Mahmoud rejoiced at the news of American missiles pummeling a Syrian air base Thursday night, and struggled with an unexpected sentiment: praise for President Trump, who has more often seemed like an antagonist than an ally.\u201cIt was good to protect people, and I think it\u2019s human \u2014 it\u2019s required by humanity,\u201d Mr. Mahmoud, 24, said in an interview on Friday in his new home city, Lowell, Mass. As for the president, he said, \u201cI\u2019m just supportive for yesterday, not all the time.\u201dMr. Trump had spoken out repeatedly against taking action against the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, while praising the actions of Russia, Mr. Assad\u2019s biggest backer in Syria\u2019s long-running civil war, and arguing that the United States should make common cause with Russia and Syria in fighting the Islamic State.During the campaign, Mr. Trump called for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration, and as president he has tried to halt entry from Syria and a handful of other Muslim-majority countries, contending that some of the refugees and other migrants could be terrorists trying to slip into the United States under false colors.Mr. Mahmoud and his family left their hometown, northwest of Aleppo, and lived for years in Turkey, before getting permission to go to the United States. Just as they were about to leave, in late January, Mr. Trump\u2019s first pass at an immigration order put their plans on hold; when courts struck down the order, they were finally able to enter the country, on Feb. 9.He heard about the president\u2019s action on Thursday night, while in the middle of a work sheet on English verb tenses. The jubilation he felt about an action by the president was, he said, \u201ca new emotion.\u201dMohamad Chaghlil, 35, a woodworker from Damascus, said he hoped the missile attack \u2014 far too limited in his view to change the course of the war \u2014 would be the start of a major course correction by Mr. Trump. But he said he doubted it.\u201cI don\u2019t have full idea why he did that now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lose hundreds of Syrian people every day, we lost more than half a million people in Syria. So why chemical attack is worse? Dead is dead. I can\u2019t understand, and the Syrians can\u2019t understand.\u201dMr. Chaghlil and his parents left Syria for Jordan four years ago, then began the laborious process of gaining refugee status. After his father died last July, his mother had to revise her paperwork, he said, delaying her case, so while Mr. Chaghlil came to the United States in December, she remains in Jordan.\u201cI talk with her every morning,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is old. She needs me, and I need her. I\u2019m alone here and she is alone there.\u201dHe said he worries about where American immigration policy will leave her, and still sees the president as anti-Muslim.\u201cI think he doesn\u2019t care about who needs the support, and who is the murderer and who is the good person,\u201d said Mr. Chaghlil, who was admitted to the country in December and lives in New Haven. \u201cMaybe he felt he has to do something for politics.\u201dAyham al-Asmi , who had been upset by Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to bar refugees, was so enthusiastic in his support for the airstrikes that he said he would vote for Mr. Trump if he could. He said more than 150 members of his extended family have died in the violence in Syria.\u201cHe\u2019s a national hero now,\u201d he said of the president, adding, \u201c100 percent.\u201dMr. Asmi, 34, who arrived in Worcester, Mass., about 18 months ago, said he had stayed up all night after seeing news of the raid on Facebook, contacting elated friends and family around the world.\u201cThe Syrian people just gave up on anyone coming to their rescue,\u201d he said through an interpreter, Amjad Bahnassi, who is the chairman of the board that runs his mosque. The attack, Mr. Asmi said, was \u201clight at the end of the tunnel.\u201dFor Zelekha Mahmoud, 31, news of the American missile attack allowed her to hope that the war could come to an end, and that she, her husband, and their four small children, could return home.They settled in October in Chicago, and are adjusting to their new life. They pray and socialize at an Islamic center, the children go to school, and her husband has found work at a food packaging company. But she longs for Syria.The Times is withholding her family name \u2014 Mahmoud is her middle name \u2014 because she fears for the safety of the children and four siblings still in Syria. She says she is grateful that the United States has sheltered her and her family, but she remains wary of the welcome here; Mr. Trump\u2019s travel orders at first made her fear they would be expelled.When her husband joyfully told her of the strike, \u201cI was so happy,\u201d she said, sitting in their apartment on Chicago\u2019s North Side.\u201cI feel that maybe now they will get rid of Assad so that Syria will be secure again, so we can return,\u201d she said.Mohamad Haidar, 47, who settled with his family in San Diego a year ago, said he feared that limited American strikes might escalate the war rather than tamp it down.\u201cIf the U.S. wanted to interfere with military action it would be more beneficial to strike the presidential palace in Damascus,\u201d said Mr. Haidar, who, with his wife and three children, fled their town southwest of Aleppo in 2012, moving at first to Indonesia. \u201cThe United States is capable of stopping the conflict in one month if they are taking it seriously.\u201dUnlike some others, he said he was not angered by Mr. Trump\u2019s travel orders.\u201cI thought as the president, it is up to him to decide to decide what is beneficial to his own country,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I wish they took into consideration in the decision how many innocent people are suffering and hurting in Syria.\u201dRichard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a reported from New York, and Jess Bidgood from Worcester, Mass.

{"Headline": "How a Mural of Michelle Obama Became a Lesson on Exploitation", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCHICAGO \u2014 Art is as much about labor as it is about interpretation. It is about who created it and why as well as how we understand the end product. When we forget this, we strip art of its truest power.Last Friday, the artist and urban planner Chris Devins completed a mural in Chicago of the former first lady Michelle Obama. The project was funded in part by a GoFundMe campaign that collected more than $11,000. \u201cThe purpose of this mural is to give today\u2019s children someone they can literally look up to and to celebrate Mrs. Obama\u2019s life and accomplishments during the last 8 years as first lady of the United States,\u201d Mr. Devins wrote on the GoFundMe page.It soon emerged that Mr. Devins had copied the image of Mrs. Obama, without acknowledgment, from the Instagram account of an artist named Gelila Mesfin. On Friday night, Ms. Mesfin criticized Mr. Devins on her Instagram for failing to ask her permission to copy the image, writing, \u201cthis is so disheartening and so disrespectful on so many levels.\u201d The original photo of Mrs. Obama used in Ms. Mesfin\u2019s image was taken by the photographer Collier Schorr for The New York Times (Ms. Mesfin credited Ms. Schorr for the image in her original Instagram post).Later, he said, \u201cWe were blown away by a wonderful image we stumbled on and only found out after the fact who the source of our inspiration was.\u201d He also called his use of Ms. Mesfin\u2019s image \u201csloppy\u201d and reached out to the artist to offer a licensing fee.Mr. Devins\u2019s apology fails to address why his method of finding, reclaiming and editing images was so problematic in the first place.Users of social platforms like Tumblr, Instagram and Facebook regularly act as \u201ccurators,\u201d picking and choosing images to create a particular narrative and online presence. They are often unconcerned about the intent or identity of the images\u2019 creators. Instead, users care about how the images fit into their personal aesthetics, helping them make a statement or tell a story.Mr. Devins took this already troubling online habit and transferred it to a real-world setting. He repurposed an image found online, put it on a wall and claimed it as his own.The term \u201cfound images\u201d often refers to work from the distant past; the term connotes excavation, the discovery of artifacts. But Ms. Mesfin\u2019s image was a recent work. Mr. Devins should have asked for permission to use and reinterpret the original work, not merely apologized after negative social media attention. To feign ignorance over the matter of image appropriation and artistic credit seems misguided at best, and malicious or selfish at worst.The story of Ms. Mesfin\u2019s image is a story of the labor of black women. Work, largely for other people, is inherent to black women\u2019s existence. Our lives are fueled by effort: the effort to rise above, the effort to get ahead and the effort to gain respect.That is part of the reason we love Michelle Obama. She is intelligent and classy and beautiful and graceful. But we also know she worked very hard to get where she is. As the first lady and a black woman, she had to fulfill the duties of her very public role while existing in a systemically racist society. She could never stray from the path; she could never truly rest. Black women in particular can recognize this. I imagine Ms. Mesfin recognized it. That Mrs. Obama appeared like a Nubian queen is probably no accident. Grace under fire is a royal accomplishment.Stealing the image ignores the labor it took to make the work and the labor of its subject. To ignore this in a work meant to praise a black woman is to ignore what led to black women\u2019s greatness in the first place.Britt Julious is a journalist and essayist based in Chicago.Advertisement"}

Excelsior would fill in the gaps of costs not covered by financial aid, Mr. Chen said. It would need to be added on top of other scholarships and grants to make college free.For students who are not receiving any other financial aid \u2014 those who are making too much money to qualify for need-based support \u2014 Excelsior would help even more.How much would a family pay after the scholarship?How does one qualify for the scholarship?Families must earn an annual income of $100,000 or less during the first year of participation in the plan.New and existing students may apply, and you don\u2019t need to be a native of New York State (or even a current New York resident) to do so.It\u2019s unclear whether there will be a grade-point-average requirement, but applicants must continue to college from high school with no interruptions.

Are there any additional requirements for those who qualify?Yes. Recipients should plan to live and work in New York after graduation, for as many years as they received help with the tuition.

{"Headline": "Twitter Sues the Government to Block the Unmasking of an Account Critical of Trump", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twitter sued the federal government on Thursday to block the unmasking of an anonymous account that has posted messages critical of the Trump administration and has claimed to have ties to a government agency.The suit sets up a potential confrontation between the Trump administration and Twitter over digital privacy, a thorny issue that has driven a wedge between the technology industry and government in the past.Twitter said in its filing that it could not be compelled to disclose the identity or identities of whoever is behind the account. The company argued that the government\u2019s directive and reasoning were unlawful, and that complying would have \u201ca grave chilling effect\u201d on the speech of alt-accounts that voice resistance to government policies.\u201cA time-honored tradition of pseudonymous free speech on matters of public moment runs deep in the political life of America,\u201d Twitter said in its filing. \u201cThese First Amendment interests are at their zenith when, as here, the speech at issue touches on matters of public political life.\u201dJenny Burke, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security Department, which, with Customs and Border Protection had issued the summons, declined to comment.Even before this episode, previous presidential administrations have sought access the valuable digital information held by Facebook, Google, Twitter and other internet companies, in what some of the companies have said is an overreach of government power. Federal officials have typically said in such cases that they need the data at issue for national security or other reasons.Last year, for example, Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company, squared off against the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a contentious case involving issues of privacy and national security.The new case involving Twitter is more straightforward than Apple\u2019s standoff with the F.B.I., which required the creation of new technology to circumvent the iPhone\u2019s encryption. The Twitter case is centered instead on the protection of free speech, which is critical to the social media company\u2019s platform.The company is seeking to block the Trump administration from forcing it to reveal the identity of a user who has been critical of the Homeland Security Department.On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union said it planned to represent the anonymous user or users behind @ALT_USCIS.\u201cTo unmask an anonymous speaker online, the government must have a strong justification,\u201d said Nathan Freed Wessler, an A.C.L.U. attorney involved in the case. \u201cBut in this case the government has given no reason at all, leading to concerns that it is simply trying to stifle dissent.\u201dThe case stems from a wave of alternative government agency accounts that sprouted on Twitter after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Upon being sworn into office, the president began to silence federal agencies from speaking out on the social media platform after the National Park Service\u2019s official Twitter account posted side-by-side images comparing the size of the crowds at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration \u201cto the apparently larger crowd size at President Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration,\u201d according to Twitter\u2019s court filing.In response, alternative accounts began to pop up, with many professing to be written by current or former employees of federal agencies. Accounts with handles like @Alt_Labor, @BadlandsNPS and @RogueEPAstaff had attracted tens of thousands of followers less than a week after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.The @ALT_USCIS account, which was created in January, has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies, among other topics. Messages posted by the account have referred to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order restricting travel to the United States by people from several mostly Muslim countries as the \u201c#MuslimBan.\u201dThe account has also described itself as \u201cofficial inside resistance\u201d and has said several times that the person or people using it to post messages is a current federal employee of Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Homeland Security Department. Twitter said in its court filing that about 19,000 employees and contractors work for Citizenship and Immigration Services.In March, Customs and Border Protection sent Twitter a summons that ordered the company to hand over information about the @ALT_USCIS account, including the names, phone numbers, mailing addresses and internet protocol addresses of the account holder or holders.The summons cited 19 U.S. Code 1509, a federal law that authorizes Customs and Border Protection to \u201cobtain documents only for investigations and inquiries relating to the importation of merchandise.\u201dTwitter said the law was not relevant to the agency\u2019s request and also that the summons violated the Stored Communications Act, which protects individuals\u2019 privacy and proprietary interests.As for @ALT_USCIS, the account was particularly active on Thursday, posting more than a dozen messages after Twitter\u2019s suit against the government became public. The account, which added 32,000 followers within two months of being started, had ballooned to more than 77,000 followers by early in the evening.Highlighted at the top of the account: a message featuring a screenshot of the Constitution and the First Amendment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Beaujolais, but Not Nouveau", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byWines of The TimesThis region, which in the last quarter of the 20th century largely devoted itself to the mass production of fruity, treacly Beaujolais Nouveau, had been left moribund by a steep decline in demand. By the late \u201990s, the area was in crisis. Unsold wine was distilled into industrial alcohol, and whole vineyards went unharvested as some farmers cut their losses by letting the fruit rot rather than turn it into wine.Since then, the evolution of Beaujolais has been astounding. A small group of growers, who clung to the notion of making fine wine despite the Nouveau craze, served as a model for others. They demonstrated that by emphasizing quality over quantity, they could sell their wines for higher prices and achieve greater profit margins than they could with Nouveau.This approach required meticulous farming. Winemakers skipped the manipulations that characterized so much of Beaujolais Nouveau production. It proved that the region, which even in the days before the Nouveau craze was known for simple, thirst-quenching wines, could make complex wines as well.This new Beaujolais earned a devoted following among people who recognized the value in wines that could combine the juicy joy inherent in gamay, the grape of red Beaujolais, with a clear sense of place.Almost all the attention paid to the Beaujolais revival has focused on the so-called crus, the 10 appellations in the hilly northern part of the region that are not only regarded as capable of making the best wines, but also offer the most distinctive terroirs. Their names alone \u2014 Brouilly, C\u00f4te de Brouilly, Ch\u00e9nas, Chiroubles, Fleurie, Juli\u00e9nas, Morgon, Moulin-\u00e0-Vent, R\u00e9gni\u00e9 and St.-Amour \u2014 inspire mouthwatering thirst.But the crus account for only a small amount of the region\u2019s production. What of the two appellations, Beaujolais and Beaujolais-Villages, that are considered lower on the region\u2019s quality ladder but supply most of its production? Have they been bypassed by the revolution that has lifted the crus?Although we lumped together Beaujolais and Beaujolais-Villages, they are in fact quite different. The entire region comprises a narrow, approximate rectangle stretching about 34 miles from northwest of the city of Lyon on its southern end to the M\u00e2connais in the north.The flatter southern half of the region, roughly up to the town of Villefranche-sur-Sa\u00f4ne and made up largely of sandstone and clay soils with a bit of limestone, is the province of plain Beaujolais. It is also the source of much of the Beaujolais Nouveau still produced. Beaujolais-Villages comes from the granite soils of the north, outside the 10 crus that have been deemed superior.In an effort to distance themselves from any negative associations that remain with the term \u201cBeaujolais,\u201d many of the cru producers have chosen to eliminate the word from their labels. But as our tasting demonstrated, Beaujolais and Beaujolais-Villages can be delightful wines, generally not as refined as the best crus, but delicious and satisfying.Much of the production of both appellations comes from large merchants who buy grapes or even wines and sell it under their own labels. Some, like Louis Jadot, can be quite good. We focused mostly on wines from vignerons, small producers who both grow the grapes and make the wines. Some make a range of cru wines as well, or come from families that do.The 2015 vintage produced a ripe, fruity, substantial style of wine that will please a lot of people, though many Beaujolais aficionados may prefer more nuanced wines. Still, these were good.\u201cRipe vintages raise all boats,\u201d Michael said. \u201cFruit is very consumer-friendly, but these were expressive.\u201dSome of the wines seemed so rich and full that they could be mistaken for southern Rh\u00f4nes. \u201cJuicy and friendly is very accessible,\u201d Kimberly said, \u201cbut the vintage is obvious.\u201dMany of the wines were delicious and most were good values, though some crept up into the mid-$20s, cru Beaujolais territory, largely because of the small production. Our No. 1 bottle was a bright, earthy, lip-smacking, slightly rustic straight Beaujolais from Ch\u00e2teau Cambon, the kind of wine that you simply don\u2019t want to stop drinking.It seems that much of Cambon\u2019s 2015 production is now sold out, but the importer says the 2016s will be arriving in stores soon. The \u201916s will most likely not be as ripe and fruity as the \u201915s, but the quality of the producer is almost always more important than the character of the vintage. So even if you cannot find the exact wine that we liked so much, or any of the other \u201915s, I would not pass up the 2016s.The inexpensive end of our spectrum included two very good $14 bottles: the juicy, earthy Beaujolais Les Grandes Coasses from Paul Durdilly and the zesty, vibrant Beaujolais Beau from Barbet.It was clear from our tasting that the Beaujolais revolution has not been entirely restricted to the crus. These are simpler wines, as would be expected from lesser terroirs. But they are delicious in their own right, and ample evidence that Beaujolais and Beaujolais-Villages have a lot to offer when the wines are made simply and conscientiously from grapes grown with care.Bright and earthy, with lip-smacking flavors of tart red fruits, herbs and a touch of funk. (Savio Soares Selections, Brooklyn)BEST VALUELively and refreshing, with savory flavors of crunchy red fruits, minerals and licorice.

(Skurnik Wines)Zesty and vibrant, with rich, bright flavors of dark fruit. (David Bowler Wine, New York)Taut yet juicy, with bright, earthy flavors of red fruits. (Massanois, New York)The everyday Beaujolais wines in our tasting were proof that the gamay grape, under the right winemaker, creates pleasurable, food-friendly wines. The lively acidity and structure in these bottles, as well as whispers of tannin here and there, reinforced the well-trodden point that you can drink Beaujolais with any food. A cool bottle of garnet Beaujolais like the Ch\u00e2teau Cambon, with its dark fruit and hint of smoke, makes a fine partner for a salad built around quinoa and mixed with saut\u00e9ed Swiss chard, meaty little mushrooms and a garnish of goat cheese. Serve the salad warm or hot alongside grilled meat, seafood or poultry, or let it stand on its own at room temperature as a first course, for lunch or in a picnic basket. Letting it sit a bit improves the texture. FLORENCE FABRICANTcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cloud Produces Sunny Earnings at Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 The moneymaking machines at the core of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, are notably different. But the respective kings of online retailing, software and internet search should all credit a relatively new line of business for lifting their financial results.In their quarterly earnings reports on Thursday, the three said cloud computing \u2014 through which they rent computing services and online access to software hosted in their data centers \u2014 was growing faster than their larger, older businesses.For the first quarter, which ended March 31, Amazon said its total net income rose to $724 million, or $1.48 a share, from $513 million, or $1.07 a share, a year ago. The company said the $890 million in operating income from its cloud business, called Amazon Web Services or A.W.S., accounted for most of its overall profits.The worry, however, is that this cannot last forever, not with Microsoft and Google making big investments in their own cloud businesses while trying to undercut Amazon with lower prices.That has not happened \u2014 at least not yet. While A.W.S. revenue grew at a slower pace than in the past, it still rose a healthy 43 percent to $3.66 billion. The company\u2019s shares rose 1 percent in after-hours trading.\u201cThere\u2019s always this moment when people think, \u2018Is the magic going to run out?\u2019\u201d said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t panned out.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s Azure cloud hosting business grew by 93 percent from the year-earlier quarter. And the cloud version of its productivity software Office 365, sold to companies as an online service, grew by 45 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing continued strong demand for our commercial cloud-based services,\u201d Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview.Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts that the Google cloud platform was one of the company\u2019s \u201cfastest-growing businesses,\u201d though she offered no details.Still, nearly all of Alphabet\u2019s business comes from advertising on the Google sites and services, which is still expanding despite tough competition from Facebook.First-quarter earnings increased to $7.73 a share while revenue jumped 22 percent to $24.75 billion. Average estimates from Thomson Reuters had been for $7.39 a share in earnings with revenue of $24.19 billion.The stock rose 4 percent in after-hours trading on the news.Alphabet\u2019s speculative ventures, including its home electronics division, Nest, and its autonomous car division, Waymo, are listed as \u201cother bets.\u201d In the first quarter, the other-bets revenue rose 48 percent to $244 million. But losses increased 10 percent to $855 million.Google\u2019s total digital ad revenue has doubled since 2012. But for all the success that demonstrates, so much of advertising is becoming digital that Google\u2019s share of the online portion is actually slipping, according eMarketer. Five years ago, Google had a 35.9 percent share of global digital ad revenue, the data firm said. In 2016, it was 32.8 percent.The pots of money Alphabet is making could provide some consolation after major brands, including AT&T and Verizon, recently learned that their ads were appearing alongside inflammatory YouTube videos that promoted hate speech. Some advertisers vowed to drop YouTube, a Google property, until the problem was fixed.For its part, Microsoft\u2019s overall revenue rose 8 percent in the quarter, to $22.09 billion. That was enhanced by $975 million in revenue from LinkedIn, the professional networking site that Microsoft bought for $26 billion in a deal that closed in December.Microsoft\u2019s total operating revenue, which includes the deferred accounting for sales of its Windows 10 personal computer operating system, was higher, at $23.56 billion. That figure is the focus of Wall Street analysts, and the result was slightly below their consensus estimate of $23.62 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.The modest shortfall was attributable to weaker-than-expected sales of Microsoft\u2019s Surface tablet computers during the quarter, which were down 26 percent. The company\u2019s share price fell about 1 percent in after-hours trading.Microsoft\u2019s net income rose 28 percent to $4.80 billion. Its operating earnings per share, which excludes one-time gains, increased 16 percent to 73 cents a share, ahead of the average analyst estimate of 70 cents a share.The company\u2019s results also added to evidence that the personal computer industry is stabilizing and even growing, at least among corporate customers.Sales of Windows operating systems to PC makers rose 5 percent in the quarter. The market research firm IDC recently reported that PC shipments grew slightly during the first quarter of 2017, the first gain in five years.Microsoft\u2019s Windows sales to PC makers are advancing by more than the rate of PC shipments, because of a shift to higher-priced versions as corporate customers upgrade to Windows 10.Overall revenue at Amazon rose 23 percent to $35.71 billion from $29.13 billion in the same period a year ago. The company\u2019s results were well ahead of the $1.12-a-share average earnings estimate and $35.3 billion revenue estimate of analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters.In a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company was still heavily investing in the creation of new devices, video content and fulfillment centers to bring orders to customers more quickly.\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to look for things customers love, can grow to be large and provide strong financial returns in the long run and can last for decades,\u201d he said.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, David Streitfeld from San Francisco and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Professor and the Jihadi", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "FeatureWhen a terrorist made a death threat against Gilles Kepel, France\u2019s most famous scholar of Islam, it deepened his embroilment in a national debate over Muslim assimilation and extremism.Supported byThe Paris terrorist attacks of January 2015 made Kepel\u2019s emphasis look not alarmist but prophetic. In their aftermath, he quickly completed \u201cTerror in France,\u201d which outlines three generations of jihadism, starting in the 1980s and culminating in the newly decentralized attacks associated with ISIS across Europe. It was on the verge of publication when the second and far more deadly Paris attacks took place, on Nov. 13 of that year, helping to turn it into a best seller.About a week later, Olivier Roy, who teaches at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, wrote an essay for Le Monde that challenged one of Kepel\u2019s core ideas. Roy argued that the issue was not the radicalization of Islam but \u201cthe Islamization of radicalism\u201d \u2014 a phrase that quickly caught on. For Roy, the terrorists, mostly second-generation immigrants, were caught between the tradition-bound world of their parents and the secularism of their French contemporaries. Unable to find a place, they adopted a nihilistic rejection of society, expressing it not in the Marxist language of the 1960s and \u201970s but in its current equivalent: Islam. The same logic could explain why so many white Catholic French kids had become jihadis.Kepel responded quickly and forcefully, accusing Roy, who does not speak Arabic, of cooking up a thesis that suited his own ignorance: If Islam is incidental, no need to listen to the Friday sermons or read the theological debates online. Roy\u2019s argument was also a salve to the liberal conscience, Kepel added, allowing people to believe that the state of contemporary Islam had little or nothing to do with the violence. Roy, clearly stung, responded, and the argument went on for months, fueled by frequent stories in the French press. Other intellectuals joined in, notably the academic Fran\u00e7ois Burgat, who argued that both Roy and Kepel failed to adequately recognize the role of France\u2019s colonial history and current foreign policies in shaping the younger generation\u2019s anger. But it remained primarily a two-man fight.When I met Roy in November, he told me over a lunch of Breton oysters and Muscadet that he had not wanted a feud. \u201cHe attacked me \u2014 I had to respond,\u201d Roy said, squeezing his lips out in a Gallic expression of disdain. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who needs enemies. He\u2019s like an academic version of Sarkozy.\u201d Roy made clear that he respects Kepel\u2019s erudition but believes he is projecting his own obsession with jihadism onto the more nuanced political realities of a hybrid France. The two men form a striking contrast. Roy is a bit paunchy and disheveled, with an amiable, jowly face; he has the air of a college professor who likes taking students out for a drink. Kepel teaches class in elegantly tailored suits, and his manners are more formal. He has a volatile streak; he has feuded in public with several peers and former students. He is also more visibly interested in power. He makes no secret of his membership in the Si\u00e8cle club, a quintessentially French institution that gathers much of the nation\u2019s political and social elite for a formal dinner on the last Wednesday of every month, in an 18th-century mansion near the presidential palace. In an article last year, Roy referred to Kepel cuttingly as a \u201cprofessional Rastignac,\u201d an allusion to a socially ambitious character in the novels of Balzac.The first person I met in Val-Fourr\u00e9 was a burly man in Afghan-style dress, with the scraggly beard favored by Salafi Muslims. He preferred not to give his name. After chatting for a few minutes, I brought up Abballa and the killings in June. \u201cThat was just a matter of revenge,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cIt had nothing to do with Islam.\u201d I asked what Abballa was taking revenge for, and he gave me an incredulous look. \u201cWhy? The cops had probably beat him up,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stop you, they harass you, they come to your house. It\u2019s the same for all of us.\u201d A few minutes later I asked him about the word \u201cradicalization.\u201d He said: \u201cWhat does \u2018radicalization\u2019 mean? What does \u2018fundamentalism\u2019 mean? It means what\u2019s fundamental, the basis of the religion. This is what they don\u2019t like. They keep pressuring us, but we will not give up our religion. And if it leads to a clash. ... \u201dOne after another, the young men I met that afternoon said the same thing, in almost exactly the same words: It had nothing to do with Islam, and revenge against the police is perfectly natural. None of them admitted to having known Abballa, though some insisted that he was an \u201cordinary guy.\u201dAbballa\u2019s life, at least early on, seems to bear out some of the arguments Olivier Roy makes about the second-generation immigrant\u2019s sense of dislocation, and the hunger for an identity. His father was a laborer from southern Morocco who arrived in France five years before Larossi was born, the last child in a family of five. Abballa spent his early life in Les Mureaux, a town 12 miles away from Mantes with a very similar mix of poor immigrants and a reputation for riots. Abballa knew little about Islam \u2014 at least at first, according to the co-conspirators in his first terror plot, in 2011. At the same time, he told them he was \u201cthirsty for blood,\u201d court documents show. He was first arrested at 18 on theft charges, and seems to have fallen into jihad the same way he fell into petty delinquency.But it was the next phase that turned Abballa into a real jihadist, and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that his path conforms closely to the stages Kepel identifies with the third generation of European jihadism. Abballa spent almost three years behind bars, and was moved among jails several times because he was proselytizing for jihad. Later, he made direct contact with a member of ISIS in Syria who had helped direct terrorist attacks in France. By the time Abballa died, his religious devotion was unmistakable. The final video he made is a long sermon about Islam, and it includes a citation from a relatively obscure 11th century Islamic jurist. He was anything but a nihilist \u2014 the word Roy often uses to describe these young men.After his release from prison, Abballa maintained a facade of normalcy, starting a one-man business delivering sandwiches and burgers. His Facebook feed is full of images of fast food and happy clients. Even the girlfriend he saw for years before his prison term claims she had no idea he had become radical. \u201cAfter me, there was religion,\u201d she said, in a short interview she gave on French radio just after the murders. \u201cAll he said was that he\u2019d like it if one day I became like him, and wore a veil. But not once did he judge me or refuse to talk to me because I wasn\u2019t veiled, or was wearing ripped jeans or leather. Not once.\u201d Abballa\u2019s family appears to have been the one group from whom he could not hide his new allegiances. On the night of Nov. 13, 2015, after the news of the Paris terrorist attacks spread, one of his sisters became terrified that he was among the attackers, according to an article in Le Monde. She called the house and asked another member of the family to pull up Abballa\u2019s duvet and make sure he was safely in bed.Exactly seven months later, on a balmy June evening, Abballa drove the 10 minutes to Magnanville, where Jean-Baptiste Salvaing lived. It is still not clear how he chose Salvaing, a midlevel career police officer who focused on local delinquency. What is clear, according to local news stories sourced to the police, is that Abballa had planned his attack carefully. He knew when Salvaing would be returning from work and hid behind a gate, where he sprang out and stabbed Salvaing repeatedly, piercing his heart. He then went into the house and cut the throat of Salvaing\u2019s companion, Jessica Schneider, and used his cellphone to conduct the broadcast on Facebook Live.Watching the video is a profoundly unnerving experience. Abballa is seen from below, his long face distorted and lengthened by the angle. A patch of colored cloth can be seen hanging on the wall by his head, conveying an eerie hint of private domesticity; this room was clearly a place of comfort and happiness to the two people he had just murdered. Abballa does not look angry or upset. He sniffles frequently during his speech \u2014 a cold \u2014 and at one point says, \u201cPardon me.\u201d Every now and then you can see and hear the shuffling of the paper from which he is reading. Abballa speaks for 12 minutes, mixing his French with bits of Quranic Arabic, pledging his allegiance to the leader of ISIS, calling for mass murder and predicting a new age of Islamic conquest. After the police SWAT team burst into the apartment and killed him, they found the couple\u2019s 3-year-old child unharmed, in a state of shock.The day before Salvaing was murdered, according to the Le Monde article, he attended a training session at his Police Headquarters, which abuts a mosque. The subject of the session was \u201cradicalization.\u201dThese are generous sentiments, and no doubt many French Muslims appreciate them. Kepel would say they seem less aimed at truth than tact, the idea that hurting Muslim feelings will poison the atmosphere further. At its extreme, this view risks its own form of condescension: Be nice to Muslims or they will turn into suicide bombers.Last summer, Muhammad gained new prominence by helping to shape public perceptions of the Burkini affair. It happened in August, when a number of French seaside towns enacted bans on the full-body swimsuit, designed to respect Muslim modesty codes for women. The French police then began forcing women in Burkinis to take them off, pay a fine or face arrest. The story became a global sensation, with the French government coming off in most accounts as petty, Islamophobic and hypocritical. The Burkini, the garment\u2019s supporters said, was an instrument not of repression but of liberation: a way for conservative women, who might otherwise be trapped inside, to enjoy themselves. All this took place just a month after the terrorist carnage in Nice, where a man plowed a truck through a crowd of pedestrians on a seaside boulevard, killing 86 and wounding many more. For some observers, the Burkini affair may have suggested an unspoken corollary: Perhaps the French are helping to bring this terrorist hatred on themselves.For Kepel, the lesson of the Burkini was entirely different. He did not deny that arresting the women was an appallingly clumsy (and self-defeating) thing to do. But he also saw yet another effort by Islamists \u2014 and their left-wing fellow-travelers \u2014 to turn France from the victim of terrorist atrocity into the aggressor. He pointed out that the international press coverage mostly ignored the rise of Salafist-style Islam as a context for the Burkini. In other words, many Frenchwomen in Burkinis might have been wearing bikinis a few years ago. The Burkini episode helped furnish what has become a dominant theme of his ongoing public dispute with the left. His new book, published in France in November, includes his most ferocious polemic yet against the \u201cdelusion\u201d of Islamophobia. It also features an acidic portrayal of Marwan Muhammad, whom he portrays as an opportunist serving the interests of jihadis.\u201cEveryone is groping \u2014 no one knows what to do,\u201d I was told by Adeline Hazan, who leads a government watchdog agency for the nation\u2019s prisons. It does not help that about half of France\u2019s prisoners are Muslim (though Muslims make up less than 10 percent of the French population). In some overcrowded jails, the percentage is much higher. Hazan\u2019s group released a report last summer excoriating the government\u2019s new effort to segregate jihadi prisoners, saying the plan threatened to make matters worse. The segregation scheme originated just after the Paris attacks in January 2015, when public attention was focused on the prison system\u2019s reputation as a factory for terrorists. But the proposed remedy may have been worse than the disease. The newly isolated jihadis were in a better position to reinforce one another\u2019s beliefs; and the government\u2019s plans for de-radicalization \u2014 which included \u201ctherapeutic fencing\u201d classes \u2014 seemed little more than a joke. In September, an inmate in one of the segregated units stabbed a guard and almost killed him. A month later, France\u2019s justice minister, Jean-Jacques Urvoas, canceled the segregation scheme. When I met Urvoas at the ministry, I asked him what the word \u201cradicalization\u201d meant. He replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. And I am going to stop using it.\u201dThe discussion ranged widely, but returned again and again to the question of \u201chow one lives as a Muslim in France while integrating.\u201d One participant said, \u201cI find him to be a psychopath,\u201d prompting a burst of laughter; another said he found M. \u201ctypical in many ways.\u201dAt 9 o\u2019clock, the prosecutor brought the discussion to a close, and her assistants poured Champagne and provided a round of amuse-bouches and pastries. I asked the prosecutor if she had found the session useful, despite the disagreements. She said it had shed light on the most difficult questions she must assess: the convict\u2019s \u201ccapacity for dissimulation\u201d and his degree of dangerousness.The number of people who require this kind of exhausting scrutiny is daunting: Some 700 French citizens are with ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and as the terrorist group loses ground, more of them will return home. I watched three of these returnees standing in the defendant\u2019s dock during their trial in Paris in December. One of them had been transferred from jail, and appeared in a box to the side of the courtroom, flanked by guards. The others, who were at liberty, stood next to their lawyers, facing a panel of judges. The three men started out as friends in Roubaix, a town in northern France that has gained some notoriety as an Islamist stronghold. All of them ended up in Syria fighting for Islamist militias and eventually found their way back to France. The president of the judicial panel, a balding man with a scholarly mien, questioned them closely about their mind-set and beliefs and returned again and again to the question of Islam. \u201cToday, would you say you\u2019re a republican Muslim?\u201d he asked one of them. The accused, a white convert to Islam identified as Pierre T., mumbled \u201cAh, that\u2019s a tough one,\u201d and added that he preferred \u201cnormal Muslim.\u201d Later, the judge asked if he could practice his form of Islam and continue to work.Another defendant, identified as Mehdi K., who had served in the French military before deserting and traveling to Syria, was pressed to describe his future plans. \u201cI see myself living in France with my wife and children,\u201d he replied. \u201cI am still Muslim, rigorous toward myself.\u201d The judge seemed unsatisfied with the response, and at one point he said something about the danger of Islam\u2019s being turned into a political ideology. As the session ended, the prosecutor demanded the maximum penalty for Mehdi K., saying that his radical convictions were deep-rooted and that he posed a \u201cmanifest danger.\u201d Mehdi K.\u2019s lawyer protested, saying the prosecutor was asking the judge to determine the sentence \u201cnot for what he has done, but for the potential risk that he poses.\u201d It struck me as an odd objection to make. The judge had made very clear that he was far more worried about Mehdi K.\u2019s future than his past.With all this attention focused on them, many jihadis are now adapting, and have become far better at disguising their beliefs. Farhad Khosrokhavar, a sociologist who has spent many years researching Muslims in the French prison system, told me it has become almost impossible to get honest testimony out of the inmates. Many of them shave their beards, Khosrokhavar said, and adopt a mild demeanor, and sometimes they even stop praying and fasting during Ramadan, all so as to deceive the authorities and, presumably, get out of prison faster.Emerging from his car, Kepel was greeted by the prison administrator, a dark-haired woman in her 40s, and escorted inside, where two inmates were waiting in a spare room near the prison library. One was a thief, a svelte man with long hair and a beard; the other was a thickset North African who was in for nine years. The two inmates \u2014 who asked not to have their names disclosed \u2014 met Kepel on a previous visit and seemed delighted to see him again. Both were Muslim, and both were vehemently opposed to ISIS. By their account, Kepel\u2019s first visit to the prison, in which he delivered a lecture on Islam and jihadism, had humiliated the prison\u2019s tight-knit group of unrepentant ISIS members by knocking down their arguments with deft quotes from the Quran. \u201cGod is sovereign in his orders,\u201d he recited in Arabic at the close of a tense, angry debate, \u201cbut most people do not know it.\u201dJust before we left, I asked the North African whether he expected the recent wave of terrorist attacks in France to continue. This was just after the arrest of several terrorist cells, and two months before a machete-wielding jihadist attacked guards near the Louvre. He gave me a somber look. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d he said.I recently spoke with a young, highly trained French Muslim doctor, who wears a head scarf and who was deeply frustrated that she could not do so at the public hospital where she worked in France. She told me she went to Oubrou to seek his advice. He asked her about the nature of her work in the hospital, and she described it to him. He then gave her his counsel: Her work in the hospital appeared to be saving lives, which was far more important \u2014 and indeed, more Islamic \u2014 than anything she might want to wear on her head. I found this answer impressive, but the doctor was not convinced. She decided soon afterward to move to Britain, where she now works in a hospital that allows her to wear the head scarf wherever she likes.When I last saw Kepel in his office, I asked him about the accusation that he had become a kind of neo-Gaullist defender of French traditions. He scoffed a bit, saying it was the circumstances that had changed, not him. \u201cThe big issue is to think about what has happened to the country \u2014 239 dead in 18 months,\u201d he said, using his own count. \u201cIt is unprecedented on French soil.\u201d He said he saw his role as offering facts about what led to those tragedies, not offering solutions. Some of those facts were uncomfortable, and some people \u2014 including officials in places like Mantes-la-Jolie and Trappes, with their hard-core Islamist enclaves \u2014 were unwilling to face them. It was up to other people, he said, to find ways to heal France\u2019s wounds. Kepel reminded me that his career was mostly behind him and that he had nothing to lose. \u201cIt may be that I\u2019m influenced by my background as the grandson of an assimilated Frenchman,\u201d he added. \u201cBut basically, I\u2019m just an Orientalist with cold blood and thick skin.\u201dRobert F.

{"Headline": "Lambrusco Shakes Off Its Cloying Reputation", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byWine SchoolNo, it was not an April Fools\u2019 trick, and it most definitely was not a joke.Contrary to the suspicions of some readers, our focus on Lambrusco was absolutely, joyously serious.You know how Wine School works. Each month, we focus on a particular genre of wine. I suggest three examples, which you drink at home in a relaxed setting with family, friends and food. Then we discuss the wines.What has been true for several years now bears repeating: Real Lambrusco is back. These wines have little to do with the sickly sweet beverages that dominated the market in the 1980s. Real Lambrusco is a fresh, dry, earthy, effervescent red, with a slight bitterness that goes beautifully with the rich cuisine of Emilia-Romagna, its home region in north-central Italy.Even though we are well into the 21st century, the wisdom of the past \u2014 that aspirational wine drinkers should avoid Lambrusco as they would ros\u00e9s and Sicilian wines, to cite two other shibboleths \u2014 still has a hold on people. Fortunately, even the skeptics approached the wines with open minds.I am glad so many readers seemed to like the wines. Even so, I must offer an apology: One of the three wines I chose turned out to have been an impostor. Let me explain.I noticed this, and alerted the shop. I then left New York for a vacation in Brazil. When I returned to New York and arranged for the correct bottles to be sent to me, the wrong bottles were delivered yet again. The wrong Chiarli was also photographed by The Times, although we had double-checked to make sure the photographer would receive the correct bottle from the shop.It turned out that because of a cataloging error by the wine\u2019s wholesaler, all computerized references to the Grasparossa di Castelvetro in the New York area led instead to the Dry VS. After the shop discovered the problem, it concluded that the Grasparossa di Castelvetro was unavailable in New York. In the end, I drank the Dry VS, as did some readers.But Mr. Barron, while allowing that the Chiarli was \u201caccessible, candied and a bit oversweet,\u201d had a surprising experience when he paired it with white asparagus served with a \u201cblack-truffle fondue.\u201d\u201cIt was the night\u2019s best pairing,\u201d he said, \u201clovely with the creamy, lightly tangy sauce.\u201dThat\u2019s an open mind. I found both the sense of sweetness and the wine\u2019s one-dimensionality an obstacle to pleasure with either pizza or saut\u00e9ed pork chops.\u201cIt gave me a \u2018This Planet is a beautiful place to live\u2019 moment, surrounded by green trees and singing birds,\u201d he said. \u201cMy best slice of pizza so far.\u201dDespite the Chiarli mixup, it was the third bottle, the Camillo Donati, that was the most polarizing of the group. On opening the Donati, most readers noted what might politely be called a barnyard, animal smell. It was the most powerful note in a complex set of aromas that also included flowers, dark fruits and savory meats.In Mr. Barron\u2019s group, the wine was likened to both a barnyard and horse sweat. Still, the members enjoyed it with pappardelle and braised duck.\u201cBarnyardy and sophisticated?\u201d Mr. Barron asked. \u201cDefinitely fun.\u201d On another night, though, Mr. Barron said the wine fell flat.Mr. Erdle described the Donati as \u201cnot pleasant, despite its good body and offerings of dark fruit.\u201d Yet, with ravioli, prosciutto and ramps, his group found it likable.\u201cThis was not a finesse wine,\u201d he concluded, \u201cbut it was our second favorite.\u201dBut the Donati is a natural Lambrusco. Its proprietor does not use sulfur dioxide, which means there is the possibility of brettanomyces or some other sort of microbiological incursion.I have had different vintages of the Donati with little trace of brettanomyces. I am not sure what happened this time. As I said, a touch as an accent can add interest to a wine, but this example was too much.Aside from sharing a natural approach, the Saetti and Donati have another characteristic in common. They are both small-production wines, and both achieve their effervescence in a traditional manner, with fermentation completed in the bottle. The byproduct of this fermentation is carbon dioxide, which, unable to escape the sealed bottle, carbonates the wine.By contrast, the Chiarli is produced in far greater quantity and, like most Lambruscos, is carbonated in bulk in pressurized tanks. It is a different sort of wine, and while mass-produced Lambruscos can be very good, they are rarely as distinctive as the artisanal versions.Lambrusco can be made from about a half-dozen grapes, and indeed, each of these three bottles was made with a different one. The Chiarli was made of the grasparossa (as was the Chiarli I had intended to drink). The Donati was made of the maestri, and the Saetti of the salamino.The notion of sparkling red wines strikes some wine drinkers as a bit weird. But in Italy, they are not uncommon. Lambrusco is just one of a handful of reds in Italy that are called vivace, or lightly sparkling. Wine School readers had no problem with it.If this was your first exposure to good Lambrusco, I hope you will take it as an invitation to find your own favorites among the many different styles and characteristics.Inadvertently, these Lambruscos offered two lessons. First, natural wines are like any other genre of wine: Some are really good, and some are not for everybody, or anybody, really.Second, and this is true whether you are buying wines retail or in a restaurant, always read the label and make sure you are getting what you ordered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Legend of King Solomon and the Passover Feast", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byThe walls of the Paradesi Synagogue in Kochi, India, are adorned with the history of the country\u2019s Jews. On a recent trip there, I read an inscription suggesting that Jewish traders might have reached India from Judea, crossing the ocean during the reign of King Solomon \u2014 a journey of thousands of miles.Unable to jump into a time machine, I did the next best thing: I visited Chendamangalam, a village about 20 miles north of Kochi resplendent with coconut, mango and cinnamon trees. As I walked toward the Periyar River, I imagined ancient Hebrew adventurers and traders arriving on the shores and marveling at the lushness of the terrain. Although there is little evidence as to the exact date, they may have traveled to this area in southwest India in search of spices, precious stones, timber and ivory tusks as early as the 10th century B.C., around the time the Bible tells us Solomon was seeking treasures to build his temple.Little is known about King Solomon \u2014 and some scholars even doubt his existence \u2014 but his story offers an image of a ruler presiding over a diversity of cultures, with an abundance of food. Solomon is said to have ruled for 40 years, amassing enormous wealth. With a ravenous appetite for all aspects of life, he had 700 wives and 300-some mistresses.The biblical Book of Kings tells us that some of his wives came from Egypt, Moab, Ammon, Edom (present-day Jordan), Sidon (Lebanon) and Anatolia (Turkey); these women would most likely have brought with them pomegranates, dates, olives and a variety of other foods and methods for preparing them. According to tradition, the 12 tribes of Israel brought even more; each tribe presented the king and his family with jewels, minerals, exotic materials and new foods and spices.I became fascinated with Solomon, traveling to many parts of the globe to track the legends of the king. I also sought to discover what makes Jewish cooking unique. It is unlike the cuisines of empires, influenced by the cultures they vanquish, or national cuisines that have a homeland or stable center with defined boundaries. As a wandering people, Jews have influenced many cuisines as they carried their foods to new lands while fleeing prejudice or migrating in search of opportunities.Yet regional and global influences on the food that Jews ate remained circumscribed by allegiance (no matter how strict) to the laws of kashrut and by the rituals for Passover and other holidays. These traditions have held Jews together for more than 2,000 years as they have journeyed throughout the world.Take haroseth, the sweet blend of fruits and nuts symbolizing the mortar used to construct buildings when the Jews were slaves in Egypt. Served at Passover Seders since Roman times, if not earlier, the dish bears footprints from distant lands. I\u2019ve encountered haroseth from Maine made with blueberries; one with cashews, dates and other fruits from Brazil; and, a favorite of mine, a version from Italy with chestnuts, pine nuts, raisins and pears.Or think of mandelbrot, a variation on biscotti, the twice-baked cookie that originated in the late Middle Ages. Adapted by the Jewish communities in Italy, it traveled to Germany and then to Eastern Europe, taking on its Yiddish name, which means almond bread. Immigrants fleeing the pogroms took their versions to America.I imagine that King Solomon\u2019s springtime feast, the ancestor of today\u2019s Passover, included some kind of unleavened bread; bitter new greens like mallow and chard; roast lamb and goat seasoned with wild thyme; perhaps a blend of dried apricots, raisins, prunes and almonds dunked in wine and flavored with cinnamon and cardamom; and other delicacies that the king\u2019s emissaries found in the ancient world. His love of food and spices lives on for his descendants, who will set their tables for their own springtime feast next Monday to celebrate the first night of Passover.This article is excerpted from \u201cKing Solomon\u2019s Table: A Culinary Exploration of Jewish Cooking From Around the World,\u201d by Joan Nathan (Knopf, 2017).cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Ouster Will Test Loyalties of Fox Viewers", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byMediatorNo two people did more to build Fox News Channel into a powerful cultural-political force than Roger Ailes and Bill O\u2019Reilly.Mr. Ailes, the founding chairman of Fox News, envisioned a news network that would speak for those forgotten Americans who thought the rest of the media was talking down to them while abetting a liberal takeover of their country.He found one of those concerned citizens in the person of a midcareer, midlevel broadcaster named Bill O\u2019Reilly, of Levittown, Long Island. With a white working-class background, and a perfectly perched chip on his shoulder, Mr. O\u2019Reilly was the ideal personality for Mr. Ailes to build his network around.Mr. O\u2019Reilly quickly climbed to the top of the cable ratings, then pulled the rest of the network along with him as he became one of the biggest stars in television news history.In so doing, he empowered Mr. Ailes to build Fox News into more than America\u2019s No. 1 cable news network. Much more significantly, Mr. O\u2019Reilly helped Mr. Ailes turn it into the beating heart of a new, populist conservative movement, one that reshaped the political landscape while making its parent company, 21st Century Fox, billions.And, finally, it became an important vehicle in the conservative convoy that delivered their mutual friend Donald J. Trump to the White House.The network remains stalled there. And Fox, along with 21st Century Fox, remains vulnerable to treacherous traffic flows that pose the most serious threats to its standing since it became the No. 1 cable news network some 15 years ago and claimed its \u201cMost Powerful Name in News\u201d mantle.His fans told interviewers they doubted the allegations against him, describing him as an \u201ceasy target\u201d for liberal groups and the same mainstream media he has made a career of lambasting.Now here was Fox News, the network they trust above all others, refusing on Wednesday to stand behind Mr. O\u2019Reilly in the face of what he called \u201cunfounded claims\u201d in the same way that they do.\u201cGenerally, the Fox audience is not going to be happy the network fired him,\u201d said Chris Ruddy, chief executive of a smaller Fox News rival, Newsmax Media. \u201cThey\u2019re going to think it was unfair.\u201dBut, really, where will Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s viewers go in his absence? There simply aren\u2019t any real alternatives, on TV at least. Mr. Ruddy\u2019s network reaches about 10 million television homes; Fox News is in 90 million.CNN? Not likely. The network is a main media whipping post for Trump supporters who sit so squarely in Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s demographic. And MSNBC provides liberal counterprogramming to Fox News in prime time, and is, in effect, enemy territory.But there are new alternatives to Fox News online, and even on cable, that play to different parts of the conservative movement. Foremost is Breitbart News, which throughout last year took pot shots at Fox News when it viewed it as being anti-Trump, especially its former host Megyn Kelly.Breitbart\u2019s coverage showed that new alternatives were emerging as the conservative media moved into more complicated territory, along with its adherents. Breitbart, for instance, positioned itself as a purer \u201cantiglobalist\u201d alternative to Fox, where Mr. O\u2019Reilly was as unpredictable as he was conservative-leaning and various contributors were solidly in the \u201cNever Trump\u201d camp. (On Wednesday Breitbart treated Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s firing as a capitulation to the opposition, with a headline reading \u201cActivist Left Gets Monster Scalp.\u201d)None of that is to diminish the dominance of Fox News, given its full cable distribution and the way its shows pepper the top ratings slots. That includes Sean Hannity, whose 10 p.m. program has become a central clearinghouse for pro-Trump talking points in a way Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s never did.Still, Mr. O\u2019Reilly was in no small way responsible for the success of the rest of the prime-time schedule; he held what is known as a \u201ctentpole\u201d position at 8 p.m., where his ratings could feed into later shows.Whether the new, hastily made schedule that Fox announced on Wednesday \u2014 with Tucker Carlson succeeding Mr. O\u2019Reilly; the ensemble talk show \u201cThe Five\u201d moving to 9 p.m.; and Mr. Hannity remaining at 10 p.m. \u2014 winds up being more permanent than temporary remains to be seen.And while executives have been heartened by Mr. Carlson\u2019s strong ratings since replacing Ms. Kelly, who has left to join NBC, he no longer has what was the best lead-in in cable news. (Last week, for instance, Mr. O\u2019Reilly had an average weekday audience of nearly four million people.)Even if Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s fans won\u2019t switch to a competitor, there\u2019s no way to know yet if they will decide to do something else altogether with their time, like post pictures of their grandchildren on Facebook.And his exit from the Fox prime-time lineup creates the biggest jump ball in cable news in more than 16 years.In large part thanks to Mr. Ailes and Mr. O\u2019Reilly, the media world is far different than the one they decided to upend when they started at Fox in the mid-1990s. The audience\u2019s sense of alienation from the mainstream media is no less intense \u2014 maybe it\u2019s even more so. But its sense that it has too few places to turn has abated. The conservative media is now as robust and diverse as the prevailing, and increasingly competing, strains of conservatism.The emergence of those strains explained why Fox News occasionally appeared to be at war with itself over the past year. Those who were in the more traditional conservative and neoconservative camps lined up against Mr. Trump \u2014 or, at least, were not enthusiastically behind him \u2014 and those who were more aligned with Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of nationalism lined up behind him.Will Fox News embrace the more traditional conservatism represented by Dana Perino, the former Bush press secretary and co-host of \u201cThe Five,\u201d who has won high marks as a substitute for Mr. O\u2019Reilly over the past few days? Or will it do more to highlight the more populist, antiglobalist brand of her \u201cFive\u201d co-host Eric Bolling, who will take over the 5 p.m. time slot and won\u2019t join Ms. Perino and his other co-hosts in prime time?The family that will ultimately decide, the Murdochs, has its own funhouse-mirror version of those competing strands. There is the founding executive chairman and family patriarch, Rupert Murdoch, who after being suspicious of Mr. Trump, has swung solidly \u2014 but not blindly \u2014 behind him. Then there are his successors-in-waiting, James Murdoch, said to be the most liberal-leaning of the three, and Lachlan Murdoch, said to be somewhere in between them, according to those who know them.People briefed on the internal discussions said it was James Murdoch \u2014 whose wife, Kathryn, once worked at the Clinton Climate Initiative \u2014 who first saw Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s removal as essential, followed by Lachlan and finally Rupert, who despite his own promotion of women in his companies showed the most willingness to stand behind Mr. Ailes and then Mr. O\u2019Reilly as the allegations piled up.But Fox\u2019s ultimate look in the post-Ailes, post-O\u2019Reilly era \u2014 and therefore, its place in the conservative media movement \u2014 will come down to the two things all three of them always agree on: ratings and revenue.Advertisement"}

Cant\u00fa Murgu\u00eda, wrote, adding: \u201cEverything in life has a beginning and an end, a price to pay. If this is what life is like, I am not ready for one more of my collaborators to pay for it and I am not either.\u201dNorte, which has been publishing for 27 years in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, a border city across from El Paso, Tex., had a circulation of about 30,000 daily and 35,000 on Sundays.Mr. Murgu\u00eda wrote that he worked to promote a free press for decades and tried at Norte to \u201cinform with veracity, objectivity, honesty and transparency.\u201d The deaths of the journalists \u201chave become evidence of things that keep us from freely continuing to work on our jobs,\u201d he wrote.There may have been other factors in play, as well. The Mexican newspaper industry faces broad financial pressure, and Jes\u00fas Salas, a reporter at Norte, said in an interview on Monday that its top editors informed the staff several weeks ago that the print edition would close.Mr. Murgu\u00eda told the newsroom on Monday that there were several reasons for the shutdown, Mr. Salas said, including financial troubles, a strained relationship with local officials and the wave of violence against journalists. Mr. Murgu\u00eda could not be reached for comment on Monday.A commenter on the newspaper\u2019s Facebook page, Erick Hernandez, wrote that the announcement, \u201churts in my soul.\u201d\u201cThe memory of your fight will not be erased,\u201d he added. \u201cThe citizens will always be grateful for your bravery and effort in making the world a better place for our children.\u201d\u201cThere is a climate of pervasive violence and a terrible record of impunity, which is creating a climate where journalists are terrified to go to work,\u201d he said.Organized crime is one source of the violence, but it sometimes colludes with public officials, so pinpointing responsibility is often difficult, Mr. Laur\u00eda said.Mr. Laur\u00eda said the closing of Norte sent \u201ca terrible signal,\u201d but added: \u201cThey are left without any options. You cannot blame them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the location of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, in relation to El Paso, Tex. While parts of the two cities are 10 miles apart, they do share a border; they are not totally separated.Liam Stack and Paulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Border Is All Around Us, and It\u2019s Growing", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsThe Border Patrol agent watched our Prius approach, then signaled for us to stop. Behind him stood several others in green uniforms, hands resting on holsters, eyes hidden behind sunglasses. German shepherds panted in the heat. \u201cAre you all U.S. citizens?\u201d the agent asked, leaning against the driver\u2019s-side window and glancing around our car. \u201cYes,\u201d said one of my companions, an artist from Iowa. \u201cYes,\u201d echoed the other, a poet from Connecticut. Then it was my turn. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. The agent\u2019s gaze lingered on me for a moment. Then he stood up and waved us through the border.Except this was not a border: This was the middle of Interstate 10 between El Paso and Marfa, Tex. No matter. At the Sierra Blanca checkpoint, agents can make arrests for drugs or weapons, share information with federal agencies and turn undocumented immigrants over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. There are many such checkpoints scattered throughout the continental United States \u2014 borders within borders.Borders mark the contours of nations, states, even cities, defining them by separating them from all others. A border can be natural \u2014 an ocean, a river, a chain of mountains \u2014 or it can be artificial, splitting a homogeneous landscape into two. Often it is highly literal, announcing itself in the shape of a concrete wall, a sand berm, a tall fence topped with barbed wire. But whatever form it takes, a border always conveys meaning. Hours before my encounter with the Border Patrol, as the airplane I was on began its descent, I saw from my window seat the wall that separates El Paso from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. On one side were gleaming towers, giant freeways and sprawling parks; on the other, homes huddling together in the afternoon light, winding streets and patches of dry grass. Here you will find safety and prosperity, the wall seemed to say, but over there lie danger and poverty. It\u2019s a message that ignores the cities\u2019 joint history, language and cultures. But it is simple \u2014 one might say simplistic \u2014 and that is what gives it power.For much of the United States\u2019 history, national frontiers were fluid, expanding through territorial conquest and purchases. But at the start of the 20th century, as Arizona and New Mexico approached statehood and the country\u2019s continental borders became stable, so did the desire to secure them and police them \u2014 first through congressional acts that prohibited immigration from certain countries and later through the building of fences and walls. During his campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump often promised to extend a wall along the Southern border and have Mexico pay for it. At his rallies, this promise was met with cheers and chants of \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d When Vicente Fox, a former president of Mexico, declared that his nation had no intention of paying for any such wall, Trump\u2019s response was, \u201cThe wall just got 10 feet higher.\u201d The more it was challenged, the higher it became, as if literalizing the border could make all debate about it disappear.Whether the administration can find the money to construct an immense border wall remains to be seen. In the meantime, the legal apparatus around it is already being built. This month, speaking to Customs and Border Protection officers in Nogales, Ariz., Attorney General Jeff Sessions promised them \u201cmore tools in your fight against criminal aliens\u201d \u2014 including charging immigrants who repeatedly cross into the United States illegally with felonies and, when possible, with document fraud and aggravated identity theft, which can carry mandatory prison time. His language was the language of war: Nogales, Sessions said, was \u201cground zero\u201d in the fight to secure the border, a place where \u201cranchers work each day to make an honest living\u201d while under threat from \u201ccriminal organizations that turn cities and suburbs into war zones, that rape and kill innocent civilians.\u201d Under the new administration, he said, his Justice Department was prepared for the fight: \u201cIt is here, on this sliver of land, on this border, where we first take our stand.\u201dIn this kind of rhetoric, the border separates not just nationals from foreigners, rich from poor and north from south, but also order from chaos, civilization from barbarians, decent people from criminals. Location becomes character, with everything that designation entails. A person is either American and an honest worker, or she is not American and is a criminal alien. The two categories are seen as inherent and inflexible.In January, Trump signed an executive order temporarily barring nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, even if they were green-card holders or refugees who had already been cleared for resettlement. But as reports emerged of families separated by the order, passengers stranded thousands of miles from home, even an infant being denied scheduled surgery, the full effect of this virtual wall revealed itself. By the time the ban was lifted by federal courts, the experience had already brought to the national consciousness a renewed awareness of what happens at the border. In this in-between space, rights we take for granted disappear. At points of entry to the United States, nobody \u2014 not even American citizens or permanent residents \u2014 is fully protected by the Fourth Amendment, which safeguards against unreasonable searches and seizures. Customs and Border Protection officers can search luggage as well as phones, tablets and laptops. Occasionally they ask for online browsing histories and passwords to social-media accounts. A poorly phrased joke on Twitter, a compromising picture on a private Instagram account, a Facebook argument with a crazy uncle \u2014 all these could be readable by C.B.P. officers, entirely at their discretion. Again, the border sends a message: Watch what you say.The border\u2019s messages always carry with them hints of violence. In the 19th century, the American frontier was a place of conquest, a place where laws did not apply and deadly clashes could happen at any moment. That aura of risk and brutality still hangs over airports, the closest thing we have to frontier outposts and the gateways to cross-border travel. When travelers step into the secure area of an airport, they leave behind bottles of water, take off their shoes and expose their bodies to X-rays, all for the sake of protecting themselves from the potential violence of terrorists. But this system can perpetrate violence by itself. This month, a ticketed passenger who refused to give up his seat on a United Airlines flight from O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago was brutally dragged away by the police. David Dao\u2019s injuries, according to his lawyer, Thomas Demetrio, include a concussion, a broken nose, two lost teeth and sinus damage that could require surgery. Demetrio went on to ask, \u201cAre we going to just continue to be treated like cattle?\u201dThis dehumanization is a common feature of the border. Some years ago, returning home from a holiday in Morocco, my husband and I passed through immigration at Kennedy Airport. The border agent glanced at my passport, which lists Morocco as my place of birth. Then she looked at my husband\u2019s and, with a chuckle, asked him how many camels he had traded for me. Even in my shock, I understood that what the agent was trying to assert was her own authority, her superiority over me. If I had dared to challenge her, I might have ended up subject to a secondary search and further questioning. My silence was the price that the border demanded.Border walls are literal expressions of our worst fears. Terrorists, rapists, drug dealers and various \u201cbad hombres\u201d are all said to come from somewhere else; drawing lines, we are told, will keep us safe from them. But the lines keep multiplying. What formally counts as the border, according to the United States government, is not just the lines separating the United States from Canada and Mexico, but any American territory within 100 miles of the country\u2019s perimeter, whether along land borders, ocean coasts or Great Lakes shores. That 100-mile strip of land encompasses almost entirely the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont \u2014 along with the most populated parts of many others, including California and Illinois. In total, the 100-mile-wide border zone is home to two-thirds of the nation\u2019s population.This is such a staggering fact that it bears repeating: The vast majority of Americans, roughly 200 million, are effectively living in the border zone. Any of these people could one day face checkpoints like the one I went through in Sierra Blanca, Tex. They can be asked about their citizenship and, if they fail to persuade the agent \u2014 because of how they look, act or sound \u2014 they can be detained. The Justice Department established these regulations in 1953 and, though they periodically attract attention, they have never been changed. As we move to erect and enforce more borders, this is another message worth apprehending: Borders do not simply keep others out. They also wall us in.Laila Lalami is the author of \u201cThe Moor\u2019s Account,\u201d a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tunisia\u2019s Truth-Telling Renews a Revolution\u2019s Promise, Painfully", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byBut to his surprise, he stirred up a storm.Thousands of letters and messages poured in from rapt Tunisians. He spent two weeks replying to them all. They are still coming. The next day, two of his torturers walked in to the commission and owned up to their crimes.In eight hearings over five months, the commission has opened a Pandora\u2019s box of emotions for Tunisians. After long averting their gaze from past horrors, Tunisians are now digging deep into the dirt. Even former President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali has been watching the proceedings from exile in Saudi Arabia, according to his lawyer.Tunisia\u2019s effort, wrenching as it is, may stand as the one bright spot in a region where the promise of the Arab Spring \u2014 for democracy and accountability \u2014 has been blunted in country after country: new authoritarianism in Egypt, civil war in Syria, chaos in Libya.Tunisia itself still faces serious problems. Thousands of young people have left to join the Islamic State \u2014 and may now return \u2014 amid rumbling protests over rising unemployment and corruption, prominent terrorist attacks and a lingering insurgency.The commission\u2019s effort to confront past horrors and bring some perpetrators to justice, even while pushing reconciliation, has been painful in more ways than one. Opponents have been vociferous and have undermined public confidence in the process.Nevertheless, hundreds of thousands remain transfixed by the hearings, and the victims\u2019 humanity is winning through, quelling some of the loudest critics. And there are the first signs that the truth-telling is changing attitudes and opening a path to reconciliation. If nothing else it has opened a national debate.Since then, victims have continued to talk long into the night, describing a litany of killings, forced disappearances, torture and oppression from the nearly 60 years of authoritarian rule. Their testimony has shredded long-accepted official narratives and has exposed abuse, a topic that was taboo until the country\u2019s 2010-11 revolution ousted Mr. Ben Ali.Mr. Brahim, an academic researcher at Ceres, the Center for Economic and Social Studies and Research in Tunis, became a superstar overnight after his articulate account of his arrest as a student 20 years ago and the sexual torture he suffered during eight years of incarceration.Imprisoned for suspected Islamist sympathies, he touched the nation, secularists and Islamists alike, with his description of his dashed dreams and the toll the ordeal took on his family.He named one of his torturers, the chief warden of one prison, who he said had overseen a brutal regime of sexual abuse of prisoners that was worse than anything that occurred in the notorious Abu Ghraib prison during the Iraq war.Even after the prominence he gained with his testimony, Mr. Brahim remains unassuming. \u201cPersonally, I felt reassured because no one refuted my account,\u201d he said by telephone. \u201cThe director of the prison, whom I named, did not deny it.\u201dBut he did not expect the wider ripples, such as when a police official stood up at a conference and apologized to him for the harm done. And the process has healed a decades-long rift in his family, who were driven apart under the strain of the oppression and opposed his testifying in public.The two torturers who came forward, both retired officers, have offered to publicly confirm his account, including a shocking description of sexual abuse. \u201cThey were involved in his case,\u201d Seif Soudani, a spokesman for the commission, said. \u201cThey are ready to appear.\u201dMr. Brahim says if they tell the truth he is prepared to forgive them. \u201cI am not denouncing people but the system,\u201d he said. \u201cI want them to unveil the truth and unveil this system of torturers.\u201dThat is the main aim of the commission \u2014 to uncover the truth of human rights abuses, preserve the memory for the nation and help reform the system.Crucially, the commission can also pass cases for prosecution to special chambers for transitional justice, and may do so for about 100 of the most egregious or symbolic cases of the 65,000 lodged.Drawing on the experiences of transitional justice processes in South Africa, Latin America, Poland and other places, the commission decided against bringing victims face to face with their former torturers, since it can make them relive their trauma.But it is preparing a hearing in coming months specifically for the perpetrators with the intention of further exposing the mechanics of authoritarianism.President B\u00e9ji Ca\u00efd Essebsi, who served in prominent positions under both dictatorships, and his government\u2019s officials have declined to attend the hearings.The presidency has tried to push through a new reconciliation law to reduce the commission\u2019s mandate, although it has met energetic resistance from pro-democracy activists.Officials who worked for the previous governments complain that the hearings are one-sided and have given voice only to the victims. \u201cThat gives the idea of injustice and lack of transparency,\u201d said Mohamed Ghariani, who was the head of the R.C.D. ruling party under President Ben Ali and who spent 28 months in prison after the revolution.\u201cYou know the former regime people are in the hundreds of thousands,\u201d he added. \u201cYou cannot condemn the people of the old regime or put them in a corner.\u201dMr. Ghariani is one of the few former officials who support the idea of transitional justice for what he says were essentially \u201cpolitical crimes\u201d and has offered to cooperate with the commission. He remains accused of charges of abuse of power and is prohibited from traveling abroad.Yet many former officials still feel threatened by the process and continue to intimidate their victims, commissioners say. Victims remain scared to come forward, said Leyla Rabbi, president of the commission\u2019s regional office in the marginalized northwestern town of Kasserine. No perpetrators there had come forward, either.\u201cThe police in Kasserine are against the process of transitional justice,\u201d she said.Hamida Ajengui, who gave a dramatic account in December of her torture and near rape at the hands of the Tunisian police in the 1990s, says her phone has not been silent since. Her Facebook friends exploded from 200 to 3,000 overnight, as messages flooded in from supporters and total strangers.\u201cThey were all saying the same thing: They were in solidarity, they were proud of me, and were encouraging me,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a kind of shivering, an explosion within society.\u201dIn the end she told everything, weeping as she spoke. \u201cThe tears always come. I cannot stop them,\u201d Ms. Ajengui said. \u201cThank God everything comes out with the pain.\u201dIn March, she was invited to a mainstream television talk show \u2014 unheard-of just a few months ago for a veiled Islamist activist \u2014 and found a new television audience, mainly young viewers, writing to her.The biggest change was when she went to renew her identity papers at her local police station several weeks ago. The chief recognized her and invited her to his office. She feared a reprimand after her accusations about torture.Instead, he only wanted to assure her of his readiness to assist.\u201cThat was a surprise,\u201d Ms. Ajengui said, flashing the smile that has endeared her to many across the country. \u201cI thought he was going to be angry.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a woman who gave an account of her torture by the Tunisian police. She is Hamida Ajengui, not Ajenguis.Lilia Blaise contributed reporting from Tunis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Attacks Show ISIS\u2019 New Plan: Divide Egypt by Killing Christians", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byRouted from its stronghold on the coast of Libya, besieged in Iraq and wilting under intense pressure in Syria, the militant extremist group urgently needs to find a new battleground where it can start to proclaim victory again. The devastating suicide attacks on Sunday in the heart of the Middle East\u2019s largest Christian community suggested it has found a solution: the cities of mainland Egypt.\u201cThere\u2019s a significant propaganda factor to this,\u201d said Mokhtar Awad, a militancy expert at George Washington University. \u201cISIS wants to show that it can attack one of the Arab world\u2019s most populous countries.\u201dFew believe it can succeed. The sheer demographics of Egypt mitigate any Iraq-type success, in which the Islamic State fed off deep tensions between Sunnis and Shiites. Christians make up just 10 percent of Egypt\u2019s people, who are mostly Sunni Muslims, and despite deep-rooted prejudices, there is no popular support for a bloody pogrom.Yet for now, unless the Egyptian government can bridge its wide security gaps, Egypt\u2019s Christians seem likely to bear the brunt of the Islamic State\u2019s ambitions \u2014 and the fight could have broader consequences for civil liberties and political freedoms in a country where both are already in short supply.A line of wooden coffins borne by Boy Scouts, and marked with the word \u201cmartyr,\u201d filed through the doors of an ancient monastery on the outskirts of Alexandria on Monday. A mournful drumbeat accompanied the procession. The coffins held the remains of some of the 17 people killed on Sunday in a blast at the gates of St. Mark\u2019s Cathedral, the historic seat of Christendom in Egypt. It was perhaps the most ambitious of the two attacks because the Coptic patriarch, Tawadros II, had been inside the church at the time.The scene also stepped up pressure on Mr. Sisi, who counts Christian leaders among his staunchest allies.This state of emergency, due to be approved by the rubber-stamp Parliament on Tuesday, will probably entrench his autocratic tendencies. Under the emergency law, suspected terrorists will be channeled through special courts with a low evidence threshold and no appeals process, and which operate entirely under Mr. Sisi\u2019s control.Additionally, the president will have the power to censor newspapers and intercept electronic communication, a provision that his supporters have suggested could be used to crack down on critics on social media, one of the last arenas of relatively unrestricted speech in Egypt.\u201cWe\u2019re likely to see people who tweet or use Facebook for political purposes, or to call for protests, being tried in these courts,\u201d said Mai El-Sadany, a nonresident fellow for legal and judicial analysis at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.Apparently foreshadowing such a crackdown, the government on Monday blocked distribution of Al Bawaba, a normally pro-state newspaper that blamed the Interior Ministry for security lapses in the church bombings in Alexandria and Tanta, a city in the Nile Delta. Parliament approved a law tightening the criminal code, while the speaker, Ali Abdel Aal, told lawmakers that the emergency laws would be applied to media outlets and social media.Mr. Awad, the militancy expert, said he had found evidence that Egyptian militants in the upper echelons of the central Islamic State leadership had established the network of cells in Egypt\u2019s main cities. \u201cWe have seen an infrastructure of cells with connections\u201d to the Islamic State\u2019s strongholds in Raqqa, Syria, and Mosul, Iraq, he said.Some cells are based in Cairo, he said, but many others have fled to the relative safety of the Nile Delta, where they can more easily hide and store weapons in Egypt\u2019s sprawling, lush agricultural heartland.\u201cI think it was a calculated escalation,\u201d Mr. Awad said.The Christian minority has long suffered from casual bigotry that, its members say, hinders their access to jobs and universities and has frequently erupted into mob violence in some rural areas. But concerted violence of the kind perpetrated by the Islamic State on Sunday was unknown.Mr. Sisi has tried to reassure jittery Christians with the new emergency laws and by stepping up security at churches across the country. In a rare move, soldiers have been deployed to help the police, and armored vehicles lined the streets of Alexandria on Monday.He also needs to move fast to prop up a modest upswing in Egypt\u2019s battered tourist industry this year and to reassure Catholics before a planned visit by Pope Francis on April 28. On Monday, Israel closed a border crossing with Egypt, warning of an \u201cimminent\u201d attack by militants based in Sinai.Yet experts say that Mr. Sisi\u2019s greatest problem may lie in reforming his own security agencies, which have ruthlessly stifled Egypt\u2019s political opposition in recent years yet had limited success in penetrating the new Islamist cells that threaten Egypt\u2019s cities \u2014 or, at least, in stopping them from carrying out coordinated attacks on churches. In Tanta, the scene of one of the two attacks on Sunday, worshipers said a bomb had been found and disabled only a week earlier.Mr. Sisi, a former general, knows how tough such work can be: One of his last jobs before coming to power in 2013 was as the country\u2019s military intelligence chief.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Our Tangled World of Hair", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byNatural. Curly. Straight. Processed. Silkener. Dreads. Good hair. Nappy hair. Wigs. Today we\u2019re exploring the world of hair, a billion-dollar industry. What inspired you to create \u201cThis Land\u201d?The inspiration came from the phrase \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d O.K., so we\u2019re going to make America great\u2026 When was it great? Who made it great? Who was it great for? When you answer these questions, you\u2019ll have a slew of answers. When I think about this nation as a whole, it wouldn\u2019t be what it is now without the contributions of enslaved Africans. I wanted to explore how I could convey the story of slaves in a way that hasn\u2019t been done before. Without much thought, the image of the American flag came to mind. And then I thought: \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to make the American flag with black hair.\u201d And then I wanted to replace the stars with cotton.Describe the creative process.The hair I used was synthetic braiding hair in different shades (black, dark brown, brown, gray) that I purchased online. There were times that I was exhausted, because I work 9 to 5. She was definitely a task as she is 5 feet by 3 feet. I thought to myself that I could have walked away at any given point because no one knows she is in existence, but \u201cno\u201d kept resounding in my head, because my ancestors didn\u2019t give up. And their pain was nowhere near my pain. So if I\u2019m going to pay homage to my ancestors, I need to do right by them and complete this task. I reference her, Justice, as my blessed burden to carry. When you\u2019re speaking truth that people don\u2019t want to hear, that can be burdensome.I used a braiding technique of elongating the braid without creating a new braid. It was a technique that I had watched for years of getting my own hair braided in African hair shops. Once I was done with all the strands, some 15 feet long, I then stitched them to chicken wire.The final touch was sewing on the balls of cotton instead of stars. I wanted every element of that flag to have some type of representation: The brown stripes speak to the varying spectrum of color we are (light-skinned slaves were in the house and darker slaves were in the field); and we are all interwoven in that trauma of skin tone; the gray represents the years of oppression and it\u2019s ongoing; the black box represents the black experience exclusive to this country. There is something very unique about the experience of black people in America. Cotton is really what spearheaded slavery in the first place.What is the takeaway?I want people to recognize and acknowledge the unquestionable contributions of my \u2014 better yet \u2014 our ancestors to this country. I want people to delve into the trauma of being unrepresented, ignored and invisible. I want people to feel pride, shame, loss, gratitude, remorse, respect and everything else there is to feel. I want people to see the resilient nature of the ancestors and their descendants because we are still slaves, just in a different rite. I want people to see the amount of labor and the level of commitment that is needed when striving for justice. And there are so many more layers to explore because she speaks to many facets of our existence and exploitation.What does hair mean in the African-American community, and how do you think other communities view our hair?My answer for this one is far too long to condense the layers into a few sentences. I can say this for now: after people kept asking me why I chose hair, it made me realize how black people propel the hair industry. Either we subscribe to the European aesthetic and spend all our money there, or we try to buy African hair and products from shops in our communities, but owned by people outside of our race. Either way, the money never funnels back into the black community. There is also the issue of cultural misappropriation. One word...Kardashians.Last year I met a wigmaker at a wedding. As we nibbled on crudit\u00e9 after the ceremony, Merria Dearman told me about her profession.Her stories were instantly captivating. Did you know, she asked, that it takes at least four or five heads of human hair to make a single wig? The original bundles dwindle when you remove the short and broken hairs, she said, and wigs have to be thick enough to conceal the little knots at the roots.And did you know, she asked, that those knots are made by hand?Or that ramshackle hair factories have sprouted up all over Southeast Asia, all powered by the demand for extensions, weaves and wigs? Ms. Dearman, who\u2019s 40, told me she once rented a motorcycle in Indonesia to see where some of the hair came from: The wigmaking version of \u201cEat, Pray, Love.\u201d We laughed.In a garage on Staten Island, I marveled at 600 pounds of hair collected by one of these wigmakers, and learned a surprising story about the Cold War. Hint: After it was over, Russian hair flooded the market.In Brooklyn, I had my hair examined by a wigmaker who survived the Holocaust.She told me I have a right part, which is rare; nine in 10 people have left parts.

Far from being welcomed as a favored son, Mr. Macron was jeered and booed by a hostile crowd as tires burned, while Ms. Le Pen paid a surprise visit and was greeted with hugs and selfies as activists with her National Front party distributed croissants.Their separate visits, covered live on French television, showed how Ms. Le Pen\u2019s anti-globalization message resonates in regions struggling with factory closings and the loss of jobs, as well as the hostility that many workers feel for Mr. Macron, a centrist former investment banker who wants to loosen labor rules.The contrasting styles, policy approaches and loyalties of the candidates, who face each other in a runoff election on May 7, were on full display in Amiens, sometimes painfully so.Mr. Macron met first with a few union representatives from the factory at the local chamber of commerce; Ms. Le Pen beat him to the plant itself.Mr. Macron said that he could not stop companies from firing workers, but that he would fight to find a buyer for the plant or to retrain workers. Ms. Le Pen promised to save the plant and the nearly 300 jobs there that are supposed to be shifted to Poland next year, and said she would discourage companies from moving jobs abroad with a 35 percent tax on any products imported from plants that are outsourced from France.\u201cThe president of the Republic isn\u2019t here to fix every individual case,\u201d Mr. Attali said.Of course, it was no detail to the people who work there, and campaign officials for Mr. Macron, who has sometimes been criticized as lacking empathy for working people, had to scramble to distance themselves from the comments.It was just one example of how Mr. Macron, 39, who has never held elected office and is running against a political veteran, was on the back foot all day.Ms. Le Pen, 48, praised the Whirlpool workers for \u201cresisting this wild globalization,\u201d and, taking a page out of the populist playbook of President Trump, she promised that the plant would not close if she were elected.\u201cWhen I heard that Emmanuel Macron was coming here and that he didn\u2019t plan to meet the workers, that he didn\u2019t plan to come to the picket line, but that he was going to shelter in some room at the chamber of commerce to meet two or three handpicked people, I considered that it was such a sign of contempt for what the Whirlpool workers are going through that I decided to leave my strategic council and come see you,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said at the site.Mr. Macron, speaking at a news conference after meeting with the union representatives, shot back that Ms. Le Pen would fix \u201cnothing\u201d if elected, arguing that her protectionist proposals would destroy more jobs and that she was \u201cmaking a political use\u201d of the Whirlpool workers. Still, he announced quickly that he would visit the plant, too.He arrived at the site surrounded by a giant, jostling scrum of journalists with cameras and microphones as he tried to talk with the crowd of workers around him.Black smoke from burned tires lingered in the air, and some of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s supporters cried out, \u201cMarine for president!\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come before?\u201d one worker shouted at Mr. Macron. \u201cYou are in favor of globalization,\u201d another said, critically.\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to promise the moon,\u201d Mr. Macron replied. \u201cWhen Marine Le Pen comes here to tell you that we have to leave globalization, she is lying to you.\u201dBut his emphasis on going along with globalization, not trying to stop it, was clearly a hard sell.But his campaign for the runoff has gotten off to a shaky start, with critics saying he celebrated too early and returned to the campaign trail too late.One such call came on Wednesday from former President Nicolas Sarkozy, who ran unsuccessfully in right-wing presidential primary contests last year.\u201cIt is a choice of responsibility, which should in no case be taken as support for his project,\u201d said Mr. Sarkozy, who noted that France would still have the opportunity to vote for his party, the center-right Republicans, in upcoming legislative elections.Instead, his France Unbowed movement is organizing an online \u201cconsultation\u201d asking supporters whether they plan to vote for Mr. Macron, abstain or vote with a blank ballot.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s first-round voters skew younger and more working-class than Mr. Macron\u2019s. Some worry that left-wing voters who supported Mr. M\u00e9lenchon will hurt Mr. Macron\u2019s prospects of winning the runoff by abstaining in large numbers.That is especially true in regions like the one around Amiens, where Ms. Le Pen came in first during voting on Sunday.At a news conference in Paris on Wednesday, Alexis Corbi\u00e8re, a spokesman for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, said \u201cnot one vote must go to the National Front.\u201d But he rejected criticism that Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s attitude was helping Ms. Le Pen.\u201cIt isn\u2019t with absurd admonitions that you are going to suddenly lead people to rally behind Mr. Macron,\u201d Mr. Corbi\u00e8re said. \u201cYou have to discuss things, and convince that the National Front vote is not an option.\u201dPam\u00e9la Rougerie contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Buys a Lot of Ads, and He\u2019s Frustrated With Digital", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingLOS ANGELES \u2014 Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble, has become the face of marketers\u2019 frustrations with digital advertising this year. His message to the industry: Grow up.The New York Times talked with Mr. Pritchard during the conference in Los Angeles about the challenges in today\u2019s advertising marketplace. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.What is the biggest problem here?The entire murky, nontransparent and in some cases fraudulent supply chain is the problem. It\u2019s a bigger problem than just any one thing. There\u2019s too much we don\u2019t know and we don\u2019t have validated.Ads showing up on objectionable sites, that\u2019s bad. Ads showing up to bots, through searching, that\u2019s bad. Ads that you place that don\u2019t really get measured by a third party that validates what\u2019s right \u2014 that\u2019s not so good, either. There\u2019s a number of things in the digital media supply chain \u2014 even ads that aren\u2019t viewable or close to viewable.What will cleaning this up do for you?What that will enable us all to do is make logical, data-based, reasonable decisions and, most importantly, spend time on what\u2019s really important, which is great creativity to drive growth.At the basis of this whole point is we\u2019re not growing enough as an industry and the markets aren\u2019t growing enough, so we need to spend time on products and packaging and shopping experiences and advertising to drive growth, and yet we have all this time spent in this opaque media environment. That\u2019s the basis for why we, at least, are poking at this so hard.How have technology companies, in particular, responded? There are a lot of people that have come up to us and said thanks for calling this stuff out because we\u2019ve been feeling the same way. It\u2019s a lot of players out there saying we really need to make sure that we know what we\u2019re getting, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s a business. All we\u2019re really asking for is here\u2019s what we\u2019re paying for, validate that we\u2019re getting it, so we can then evaluate whether it\u2019s a good deal. And if it\u2019s two seconds, and it costs X, and lifts the business, we\u2019ll do that. We just need to know that it really was two seconds, and how much it cost and then we can do that.How does the recent controversy around brands\u2019 ads showing up next to offensive content on YouTube fit into this?Right now, obviously, a big thing is if it\u2019s showing up in content we want to be associated with. That\u2019s one piece of it, but the other piece of it is, is it showing up in a place where people are actually viewing it? So, is it a bot or is it a person? Is it showing up in a place where there\u2019s enough traffic for it to be worth it?Those are really the kinds of questions everybody\u2019s asking, because what you\u2019re really trying to figure out is, where do you want to focus your money to be able to get the most awareness, the most effectiveness, and with the greatest level of efficiency.The issues around brands running on offensive websites and YouTube videos seems like a big departure from the days of P & G funding soap operas and family-oriented shows.The interesting thing about the TV model was that it was free programming paid for by advertisers. I mean, that was it, and radio was the same way. So you get this service for free, but the only price you have to pay is advertising, and that funded it, and that\u2019s essentially what has happened in the digital world.The digital advertising world brought with it user-generated content, and that\u2019s really the big shift, because before, the programs were created by content producers, and then they were bought by media companies who then put programming together, and then advertisers bought advertising on those programs.Are marketers looking for metrics beyond impressions to measure online ads? (Impressions are generally counted each time an ad is shown.)If you think about reach, frequency, impressions \u2014 those are proxies for what the real outcome is that you\u2019d like, which is sales. Where we can get a more direct link to sales, that\u2019s actually preferable if we can possibly do that. There are some ways you can do it with data, but the other ways are if you link up with e-commerce, because then you can get much more of a direct outcome. That\u2019s been around for a while but that\u2019s clearly an area I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see growing.Do the issues around brand safety online make television more appealing to you?We\u2019ll certainly tell our brands to look at all alternatives, and it remains to be seen then whether TV will provide the right value, the right measurement, the right proof and evidence that it\u2019s a good buy, it\u2019s a good value.It\u2019ll all be based on consumer behavior. On TV, people are accustomed to having a commercial interruption. The better networks find ways to make it less interruptive so it\u2019s a better viewing experience. We\u2019re certainly looking for sites where you may have an ad, but it\u2019s not annoying, because you\u2019ve seen this, on some of the ads, pop-ups come, load time takes forever \u2014 it\u2019s all that kind of stuff. We\u2019d rather have a better viewing experience and look for those that can do that.But then there\u2019s some, like the Hulus and Netflix, where they don\u2019t have advertising but we\u2019re still working with them to figure out how we can get at least our brand impressions there. So I think there will be innovations in how advertising is done.Even if you think about the news feed that occurs with Facebook and even a lot of the YouTube videos, you\u2019re talking two or three seconds. So that has created innovation in how we do advertising \u2026 There\u2019s just clever ways where you can do things and get your brand top of mind in a few seconds.I\u2019m not ready to go there yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Work-Life Balance Suffers (Even) in Victorian England", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In an era when Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, encourages young women to lean in to paid work and Damien Chazelle uses his film \u201cLa La Land\u201d to portray the sacrifices lovers must make to pursue their artistic goals, the British writer Sarah Moss shows how little the concerns that rise from the intersection of work and love have changed over the last century. Her latest novel, \u201cSigns for Lost Children,\u201d offers a vivid psychological portrait of a woman doctor, Ally Moberly, whose efforts to help those struggling with mental illness in Victorian England are complicated by her own neuroses. In depicting Ally\u2019s marriage to an architect and engineer named Tom Cavendish, Moss raises significant questions about our modern sensibilities, our attitudes toward the competing pulls of work and love among husbands and wives.Moss\u2019s novel returns readers to a character from an earlier book, \u201cBodies of Light.\u201d There we came to know Ally Moberly, whose father is a successful painter and whose mother is a religious zealot devoted to the poor of Manchester yet haunted by the death of Ally\u2019s sister May. As this new novel opens, it is the late 1870s and Ally, a pioneer in the male-dominated medical profession, has just met ginger-haired Tom, who has risen from a working-class background to work for a company building lighthouses throughout the world. After she graduates and becomes a doctor, they are married, but six weeks later his employer sends him to far-off Japan.In chapters that move back and forth between them, we follow Tom on his Asian travels and Ally in Cornwall, where she works in an insane asylum whose female patients are treated with horrifyingly primitive methods. Tom\u2019s experiences in an alien culture and Ally\u2019s travails in England are juxtaposed, allowing the reader to join them on their separate quests even as their nascent marriage is shaped by their separate concerns.As a stylist, Moss deploys an arresting third-person stream-of-consciousness perspective to great effect, affording the reader a better understanding of her characters, particularly the very private Ally. \u201cYou chose the asylum,\u201d she tells herself, \u201cbecause you indulge yourself in feeblemindedness. Because despite all your training and all your so-called qualifications, you are still crazed.\u201d By employing brief chapters and a vibrant present tense \u2014 \u201cRain scrabbles on the roof and the fire hisses and shifts. In the kitchen, cups and bowls chime as water pours and the maids\u2019 voices rise and fall\u201d \u2014 Moss makes a novel rooted in the past feel contemporary.Ally and Tom are highly educated people who are fortunate enough to follow their callings. Yet Moss shows how they must recognize that their work inevitably changes them. As Ally attempts to study the treatment of mental illness in an era when the allegedly insane are left to molder in abusive institutions, she begins to regress herself, recalling harsh memories of life with her relentlessly ascetic mother and neglectful father and the tragic loss of her sister. In contrast, Tom\u2019s mission abroad \u2014 to bring Western engineering to a nation attempting to modernize while also fulfilling a lucrative commission to buy exotic wares for a buccaneering businessman \u2014 transforms him from a provincial Englishman who spurns \u201cslimy\u201d Japanese sweets to a wanderlust-afflicted vagabond obsessed with \u201cfox possession\u201d myths who \u201cdoes not want to go home.\u201dIn this fine exploration of marriage and the complex minds of \u201clost children\u201d \u2014 that is, all of us \u2014 Moss mines and assesses a union of gifted individuals who follow their paths with great determination, unaware that their hearts will surely be changed in the process.Min Jin Lee is the author of the novels \u201cFree Food for Millionaires\u201d and \u201cPachinko.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stockholm Suspect Was Denied Asylum and Told to Leave in \u201916", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byThe suspect, 39, had shown \u201csympathy for extremist organizations,\u201d the police said. He applied for permanent residency in 2014, and the Swedish Migration Agency denied his application in June 2016, officials said.The police tried to find him in February of this year to execute the exit order, but he had gone underground, becoming a wanted man, Jonas Hysing, the national strategic commander, said at a news conference on Sunday at the Stockholm police headquarters.\u201cWe know that he has shown sympathy for extremist organizations like I.S.,\u201d Mr. Hysing said, referring to the Islamic State terrorist group.On Friday, the man was arrested on suspicion of driving a stolen beer truck that was used to mow down a crowd of people, killing four and injuring 15 others.On Sunday, the police released more information about the victims after informing their next of kin. The dead included two Swedish citizens, one Briton and one Belgian, said Jan Evensson, the strategic commander of the Stockholm police.The father of the British victim told the Swedish newspaper Expressen that his son, Chris Bevington, 41, a senior manager at the streaming music service Spotify, died in the attack.\u201cWe are devastated that our talented and thoughtful son Chris is dead,\u201d said the father, John Bevington, according to Expressen.\u201cThere are no words for how missed he will be or for how sad we all are to have lost him like this,\u201d Mr. Ek wrote, adding, \u201cI am as deeply saddened and upset as all of you that something like this could happen in Sweden.\u201dThe police have not provided any more information about the victims. A police spokesman, Kjell Lindgren, said a second person was being held on suspicion of participating in the attack.The assault, in a city known for its tolerance and openness, came after the Swedish Security Service, or Sapo, warned in March in its annual security report that a terrorist acting alone was likely to attack somewhere in the country within a year.Hans Brun, a security expert with the Swedish Defence University, said the police had worried about the possibility of such an assault.\u201cUnfortunately, this type of low-tech attack is something we have been discussing for years,\u201d he said, adding that the police, Sapo and other government agencies had long been preparing, resulting in a well-coordinated response on Friday.\u201cThey put Stockholm under lockdown quite quickly,\u201d Mr. Brun said in a phone interview. \u201cThey shut down the subway. They found the perpetrator quickly and, obviously, had some reliable intelligence quite early on.\u201dThe danger is not only that this type of attack is hard to prevent, he said, but also that there are so many people who are willing to do it.\u201cGiven the information that the Swedish Security Service has been providing in recent years, there are a couple of hundred people in Sweden who have the capability and the will to carry out these type of attacks,\u201d he said.Magnus Ranstorp, the head of terrorism research at the Swedish Defence University, said that while it was nearly impossible to deter these types of attacks, more could be done to deter potential terrorists.\u201cYou need legislation that bites and is effective,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that may be solved by criminalizing associating with a terrorist organization.\u201dSweden has tightened its laws in recent years to prevent terrorism, and more changes are planned, said Anders Ygeman, the nation\u2019s interior minister.\u201cWe have taken the first step, criminalizing traveling to and fighting with a terrorist organization in another country or receiving terrorist training,\u201d Mr. Ygeman said. \u201cThe next step is criminalizing participation that is not linked to killing \u2014 for example, being a chef for or supporting a terrorist organization in another way other than being a part of killing or making bombs.\u201dMr. Ygeman said there was broad support in Sweden for this kind of law.As many as 300 people have gone from Sweden to Syria or Iraq to fight with the Islamic State, according to Sapo, and about half that number have returned. So far, there is nothing to indicate that the man in custody had been fighting alongside extremists, Mr. Ygeman said.But the Stockholm police said the man had been able to elude the authorities\u2019 attempts to deport him by giving them an incorrect address.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Facebook Keeps Beating Every Rival: It\u2019s the Network, of Course", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThe tech world just witnessed a robbery. The heist was so brazen you kind of had to admire it, even if it was pulled off with all the grace of a gas station stickup.His speech had a lot of corny jokes, but that was just Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s way of hiding the shiv. In reality it was a performance that made plain Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ruthlessness as a businessman. It also shows that he understands Facebook\u2019s most important assets. Mr. Zuckerberg realized early on that the most important thing in his business was not necessarily creating the best new features. It doesn\u2019t matter who invents digital mustaches. What matters is owning the biggest and most engaged network. And because he has the network, he always wins.For years now, the world has been doubting Mr. Zuckerberg. Facebook, they said, would never beat Myspace. Then Facebook was going to get a run for its money from every other social network \u2014 Twitter, Pinterest and more. Hey, could it survive Google\u2019s onslaught? Could it survive its own initial public offering? How would Facebook adjust to mobile? What about live video? And then there was Snapchat. By turning the smartphone camera into a communications platform, Snapchat created a novel and compelling social experience. Teenagers couldn\u2019t get enough of it. And teenagers are the future. If Facebook lost teenagers, game over.Hahaha. In the big picture none of these things really made a dent in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s expanding kingdom.Five years ago, after more or less cementing Facebook\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest social network, he began to buy up and build future networks. He bought Instagram, which now has 600 million users. Then he bought WhatsApp, which has more than a billion users. Then he turned Facebook\u2019s baked-in chat feature into its own chat app, Messenger, and now that, too, has a billion users.He offered Evan Spiegel, Snapchat\u2019s co-founder, $3 billion to buy that app. Mr. Spiegel refused \u2014 but perhaps he should have taken a closer look at the networks Mr. Zuckerberg was assembling.Do you know what happens when you control four of the biggest social networks in the world? You get to stop worrying about competitors beating you on features.Mr. Zuckerberg didn\u2019t win all of this stuff; sometimes the features turned out to be less important than initially thought, but that didn\u2019t matter. At the very least he would neutralize his enemy\u2019s growth, cutting it off before it became an existential threat to Facebook.And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve just seen with Snapchat. There is a debate in the tech press about whether Facebook\u2019s shrewd copying has killed Snap, Snapchat\u2019s parent company, or simply wounded it. After all, last week Instagram said that 200 million people a day were using its Stories feature, which is more users than all of Snapchat (160 million at last count).What\u2019s important is that Facebook has forced this coexistence. Facebook\u2019s billions of users will now be introduced to Snapchat\u2019s best features on Facebook\u2019s own platform, eliminating, for a lot of them, any reason to switch. There is essentially no chance now that Snapchat will eclipse Facebook anytime soon, if ever. In other words, Mr. Zuckerberg has done it again; he has neutralized yet another rival.But there is another aspect to the power of large networks: They make other people\u2019s features better.\u201cEven if we were slow to add cameras to all our apps, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re going to be the ones who push this technology forward,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Let\u2019s end with a note on the ethics of all this. Some of you may find it upsetting that a big company can just lift an innovation from a small company and run with it. If it\u2019s not illegal, isn\u2019t it at least something we should discourage?To which I say: Meh. There are lots of different kinds of innovation in the tech industry. Coming up with something first is not the only kind.There is a rich history in this industry of taking someone else\u2019s idea and adding your own spin on it to improve tech for everyone. Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs and the team behind the original Mac were inspired by a bunch of ideas floating around tech research circles, including at Xerox PARC. Then Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, saw the Mac\u2019s success and \u2014 by creating a new business model for the PC industry \u2014 he ushered in an even bigger deal: graphical computers that could get cheap enough for most people to own.Or look at the smartphone. Apple created the iPhone, but if the tech industry had stopped there, smartphones wouldn\u2019t have swept the world very quickly. Instead, Google more or less copied Apple\u2019s software ideas in early versions of Android, and Samsung essentially copied Apple\u2019s hardware. Economics kicked in, smartphones got really cheap, and they flooded the globe. And everyone did better: In time, Samsung hit on its own big idea \u2014 huge phones \u2014 that Apple copied, and Apple then made a bundle.So let\u2019s not get too hung up on copying. All\u2019s fair in love and rainbow vomit.Advertisement"}

He was a stocky blond with numerous tattoos \u2014 a dark blue Polynesian design across one shoulder, English phrases up both forearms and burst of color on his right wrist.His left arm read \u201cBetter to reign,\u201d while the right said, \u201cStep by Step.\u201dHe had called in the morning to say he would be there around 3 p.m., and when he did not appear, his colleagues began making a series of frantic telephone calls to try to find him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to believe that he had died,\u201d one told the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets.Kirill Mikhailov, the father of one of the children he coached, wrote on Mr. Petrov\u2019s Vkontakte page, \u201cMy son\u2019s wrestling coach and simply a good person Denis Romanovich Petrov died in the terrorist attack in the Petersburg metro, he was all of 25 years old!!! He will remain in our memories forever!\u201dDilbara S. Aliyeva was one of the students killed. She was in her third year at Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University. On its website, the university announced the death and reported that 12 more of its students were injured.Ms. Aliyeva \u2014 whose pictures show a woman with long black hair \u2014 was studying at the faculty of economics and management. She wanted to become a psychologist, the statement said.\u201cLike any girl, she had friends, was making big plans, loved life,\u201d it said. Ms. Aliyeva was originally from Baku, Azerbaijan, but had moved to St. Petersburg with her family and completed high school there.She posted a picture from a hipster cafe on her Instagram account in late January saying, \u201cYou can take the girl out of Petersburg but you can never take Petersburg out of the girl.\u201dAnother student, Maksim Aryshev, 19, a native of Kazakhstan, was so close to the blast that at first there were reports \u2014 given the fears about suicide attackers from Central Asia \u2014 that he had been the bomber.Mr. Aryshev, a third-year student at St. Petersburg State University of Economics, wanted to be a programmer. A classmate described him to the Meduza news website as cheerful and sociable, a man who loved to joke and the life of any party.There was at least one mystery among the dead. Angelina Svistunova, 27, described as the wife of a military man, was said to have spent most days at home. Her family was mystified as to why she was on the metro in the middle of the day, according to Moskovsky Komsomolets.He blossomed into a car mechanic. About the only signs of radicalization were a few links to Islamist websites on his social media pages, and one source told Interfax that he seemed to have returned from a rare visit home in February a changed man \u2014 sullen and withdrawn.How he became radicalized \u2014 yet another in a line of lone wolves that have left a bloody trail around the globe \u2014 is part of the investigation. His father and mother arrived in St. Petersburg on Wednesday to identify the body and to speak with investigators. \u201cI do not believe it,\u201d was all the mother told reporters upon arrival, according to Interfax.Mr. Veprentsev, lying under a blanket at City Hospital No. 26 in St. Petersburg, answered a steady stream of telephone calls from friends inquiring about his health.The young man was injured after he decided at the last minute to skip an afternoon class and go back home, dashing across the platform to the fateful train.He was in an adjacent car when the door blew in on him. \u201cI was shocked. I threw the door away from me and began to crawl through this whole mess,\u201d he said. The dead around him had screws sticking out of their heads, he said, apparently part of the shrapnel in the bomb.At first he went home, but, feeling ill, he was taken to the hospital by a friend. Doctors determined he had a concussion, multiple injuries, trauma inside his chest and glass injuries across his back.Opposite him in the same tiny room, also under a blanket, lay Konstantin Y. Kolodkin, 40, a well-built man with a dark mustache who installs car alarms for a living. He had been on the way home from work and said he did not remember which car he had entered when suddenly there was a blast.\u201cI jumped out of the car like the cork out of bottle,\u201d he said, then walked around dazed for while before going to the hospital, where he was found to have a concussion and multiple injuries.\u201cThe car was full. I would say about 70 percent full for sure, students going home or going to classes,\u201d said Mr. Kolodkin, who repeatedly criticized the government security measures that let a bomber slip through. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how I will be able to go down to use the metro again.\u201dSophia Kishkovsky and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

Maybe you\u2019ve even considered putting your name on the ballot. If so, you\u2019re not alone.\u201cThere\u2019s been an enormous uptick in interest in running for office,\u201d said Sarah K. Steiner, an election lawyer, referring to city government.Here\u2019s a primer on what it takes to run for office on the City Council.What are the basics?Not as much as you might think.The city\u2019s public financing program will match, in a ratio of six to one, donations of up to $175 given by a city resident to a candidate. So if a person gives a candidate $100, the city matches that amount with $600, for a total of $700. If you take matching funds, your spending limit is capped at $364,000.\u201cWhich means you don\u2019t have to go begging to deep-pocketed special interests,\u201d said Matt Sollars, the director of public relations for the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board.First, you\u2019ll need thick skin.\u201cAnd it\u2019s a slog,\u201d Mr. Connor added. \u201cStudies show that the most effective way to earn a vote is person-to-person contact, so it\u2019s a lot of knocking on doors and doing mailings and talking to people at subway stops and street fairs.\u201dWhat\u2019s the secret of success?\u201cCandidates who are successful have a community of some sort behind them,\u201d Ms. Steiner said.\u201cIn an ideal world,\u201d she added, \u201cthe candidate should be raising money and talking to voters. That\u2019s pretty much it.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Sleepy.But then, a streak of flawless, springy weather. Think sunshine, blue skies and warmer temperatures stretching through the weekend and into next week.SaturdaySunday On Monday evening, much of the New York area\u2019s Jewish population \u2014 the largest outside Israel \u2014 will begin observing Passover, a holiday commemorating liberation from slavery in Egypt.The plagues are, traditionally: blood, frogs, lice, flies, pestilence, boils, hail, locusts, darkness, and the killing of a firstborn.But perhaps in 2017, there are more modern interpretations of plagues \u2014 evils that resonate in our everyday lives. (These could include, for example, cyberbullying and terrorism.)Use your imagination and encourage your friends and family members \u2014 children, parents, grandparents and acquaintances, Jewish or not \u2014 to submit answers.The New York Today team may contact you for possible inclusion in an upcoming column.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Tries to Turn Its A.I. Ideas Into Dollars", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byTORONTO \u2014 Long before Google started working on cars that drive themselves and Amazon was creating home appliances that talk, a handful of researchers in Canada \u2014 backed by the Canadian government and universities \u2014 were laying the groundwork for today\u2019s boom in artificial intelligence.But the center of the commercial gold rush has been a long way away, in Silicon Valley. In recent years, many of Canada\u2019s young A.I. scientists, lured by lucrative paydays from Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies, have departed. Canada is producing a growing number of A.I start-ups, but they often head to California, where venture capital, business skills and optimism are abundant.Now bringing A.I. home is a priority for the Canadian government, companies, universities and technologists. The goal, they say, is to build a business environment around the country\u2019s expertise and to keep the experts its universities create in the country.There are encouraging signs, including new government funding, big company investments, programs to nurture start-ups, and the changing habits of homegrown entrepreneurs and American venture capitalists.Mr. Hinton, who was hired by Google in 2013 but remains a professor at the University of Toronto, will serve as its chief scientific adviser. The new institute will be in the Mars Discovery District, a cluster of buildings in downtown Toronto, run by a public-private partnership, that is home to many tech start-ups including A.I. companies..Major technology companies, like Google, Microsoft and IBM, are adding to their A.I. research teams in Canada. So are companies in other industries.Last year, General Motors said it was going to locate one of its research and engineering hubs for self-driving cars in the Toronto suburb of Markham. And Thomson Reuters announced it would open a center for \u201ccognitive computing\u201d in Toronto for research into new ways professionals will use information and technologies to assist decision making.Building businesses that use A.I. is an economic imperative for Canada. The Canadian tech industry has stalled in recent years. Nortel, Canada\u2019s big telecommunications equipment maker, declared bankruptcy in 2009, and was wound down over the next several years. And BlackBerry, once a leader, has faded in the smartphone market.The experience of two start-ups applying A.I. technology to drug discovery illustrate the challenges \u2014 and the opportunities \u2014 facing Canadian start-ups.When Mr. Heifets sought funding, he recalled, one potential Canadian investor said people had tried the same thing 20 years ago. \u201cWhat could possibly be new?\u201d Mr. Heifets said the investor had asked, and turned him down.Later, Mr. Heifets went to the Bay Area and met with Timothy Draper, founder of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Mr. Draper observed that he had invested in a couple of companies trying a similar approach 20 years ago. That didn\u2019t deter him from trying again.\u201cThat\u2019s a cultural issue, a different appetite for risk and willingness to accept failure,\u201d Mr. Heifets said.Atomwise moved to San Francisco to be close to its investors and the region\u2019s enormous talent pool.Brendan Frey, the chief executive, studied under Mr. Hinton at the University of Toronto, and he has spent years on research that combines deep-learning A.I. and cell biology. When he hires software engineers, he asks them to make multiyear commitments.\u201cThere are a lot of distractions in the Bay Area,\u201d said Mr. Frey, who is also a professor at the University of Toronto and a co-founder of the new Vector institute. \u201cThe hype is a little too hot down there. Besides, we have some of the best talent in the world here.\u201dIn 2015, the program tilted toward A.I. start-ups, with 25 companies admitted. Last year, 50 A.I. start-ups were admitted, and this year will likely have 75, Mr. Agrawal said.The program lasts nine months, with fall and spring terms, much like a school year. The participants gather every eight weeks in Toronto for two days to make presentations, listen to advice and set goals for the next eight weeks.At every gathering, at least one and sometimes several companies are voted out. The voters are a growing group of tech entrepreneurs and investors whom Mr. Agrawal has recruited.One of the X factors in Canada\u2019s drive to develop an A.I. industry is the Trump administration. Canadian A.I. scientists say they have received a stream of inquiries from researchers in the United States, concerned about the new administration\u2019s stance on immigration and other policies.Should there be a northward migration it wouldn\u2019t the first time. Mr. Hinton settled in Canada in 1987 in part because of America\u2019s clandestine support for the Contra guerrillas who sought to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.Mr. Hinton, who is from Britain, was at Carnegie Mellon University at the time, and he realized that continuing his research in America would have meant accepting funding from the Reagan administration. \u201cI preferred Canada,\u201d Mr. Hinton recalled.Mr. Sutton left the United States to become a professor at the University of Alberta in 2003, after American troops landed in Baghdad. \u201cGeorge Bush was invading Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good time to leave.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: The Allure of the Los Angeles Car Chase", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Almost daily in California, the giddy updates ripple across social media: Another car chase is tearing through the streets of Los Angeles and video is being streamed live.But lately, the introduction of online streaming services like Facebook Live has been an adrenaline shot to the genre.The Los Angeles Police Department is involved in hundreds of chases each year, more than enough to keep full-time helicopter teams busy at each of the major local news stations.The chases are often short, said Tim Lynn, a pilot-reporter for KTLA\u2019s Sky 5. And thankfully for those put in danger, the conclusions are usually anti-climactic, with a suspect cornered and then handcuffed.Yet the online streams often draw hundreds of thousands of views.The action was at times heart-pounding, as a suspect wove through residential streets and accelerated to more than 100 miles an hour. A reporter called the play-by-play: \u201cIn and out of lanes, in and out of lanes!\u201d \u201cUh oh, be careful. Guy on the bike, guy on the bike! Careful, careful!\u201dAfter about an hour, the driver spun out and was promptly captured.So what attracts so many to this?\u201cA lot of them said, \u2018It\u2019s because I know the area and it\u2019s fun to watch it and anticipate their moves,\u2019\u201d she said.And then there\u2019s morbid curiosity.\u201cIt\u2019s a fascination with the unknown,\u201d said Mr. Lynn, who is also a former police officer. \u201cIt\u2019s live. It\u2019s raw. You don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to end. Is he going to pull over? Is there going to be a big crash?\u201dOne ending you are unlikely to see, however, is a successful getaway.Once a helicopter has locked onto a pursuit, it\u2019s rare for suspects to evade capture. In 12 years, Mr. Lynn said he has seen it happen maybe three times.Is there a secret to getting away? Yes, he said.Asked what is it, Mr. Lynn reminded me of his law enforcement background.

But let\u2019s flash back to the fall.It read: \u201cMother dear, although I know you are in legitimate mourning right now, I must ask if there\u2019s any way I can get my computer from you today.\u201dI was stunned. The sang-froid! Rather than hurl herself off a precipice, she wanted to Skype with her boyfriend, David. In Ohio! One of the swing states I\u2019d vowed never to visit again, whose cursed name I would never again utter. (Pennsylvania. Michigan. Wisconsin \u2014 even thou, gentle Wisconsin?)\u201cI can\u2019t go on being this upset!\u201d I told my friend Amy, a therapist who had also confessed to a crippling postelection gloom. \u201cThe Facebook alerts alone! I think I have to turn them off.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what they said in Germany,\u201d Amy murmured, ominously.\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d\u201c\u2018I\u2019m too upset! I\u2019m getting off Facebook!\u2019\u2019\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t have Facebook in Germany.\u201dShe shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s what they said.\u201d\u201c\u2018That\u2019s what they said in Germany\u2019 is what they said in Germany?\u201dI realized that my malaise wasn\u2019t just circumstantial. It was deeper. Sure, I could blame an out-of-control 24/7 news cycle. My iPhone\u2019s constant alerts seemed able to bypass my brain and send stressful electrical signals directly to my spleen, kidney, sphincter. (The election\u2019s very language had been of war, and dental surgery: \u201cBattleground states!\u201d \u201cCrumbling firewall!\u201d \u201cRazor\u2019s edge!\u201d)I had no inner life, in short. I had to find some spirituality. So the Sunday after the election, I decided to go to church.I was raised a Lutheran (German mother). I had also sent my girls to Lutheran Sunday school. This was, admittedly, for convenience: The local Lutherans were known for their excellent day care; the looser Unitarian Universalists favored marches into tick-filled woods and drumming.Now a middle-aged Whole Foods Democrat, my Sunday mornings had drifted to coffee in bed while cheating my way through the crossword puzzle. (Strong in clues related to Yma Sumac or Leon Uris, I unapologetically check the internet for baseball teams, Lithuanian estuaries, rappers.) After that I might go to the farmers\u2019 market to buy organic vegetables I will not cook, then fake my way through the easiest yoga class I can find.But that Sunday, I set off for All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena, Calif.: long-established, famously liberal, robustly attended. Its stunning architecture, from the late 1800s, is Gothic Revival. (I immediately thought: \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d without the blood! Another vice? Too much HBO?)And here was the surprise. Like those people sculpting mashed potatoes in \u201cClose Encounters,\u201d it seemed other Whole Foods Democrats had been struck by the same idea. Shocked by the election, we thought we would all try the same daring new thing. Church! The incoming crowd soon became standing-room triple overflow, causing the initially smiling ushers to show concern, then almost irritation. Many of us newbies didn\u2019t know what to do. We were practically asking: \u201cShoes or no shoes?\u201d \u201cDo you take Visa?\u201d \u201cCan you validate my parking?\u201dMy particular group packed into a side chamber and the entry procession began. To grand pipe-organ music, here was a satisfying pageant of colorful robes, golden staffs, vigorously waving flags. I glanced at the program and noticed that today\u2019s Children\u2019s Chorus song began:Let us turn our thoughts today to Martin Luther King \u2014There was a thunderous standing ovation. Now the Rev. Mike Kinman opened his sermon, with a Boomer-friendly reference: \u201cJohn Lennon sang, \u2018Nobody told me there would be days like these.\u2019 But our Gospel does. \u2018Strange days indeed.\u2019\u201dBecause Episcopal liturgies are planned in a three-year cycle, it was by coincidence that the day\u2019s reading was from Luke: \u201cThe Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times.\u201d How prophetic! Mr. Kinman described Christ as \u201ca dark-skinned refugee who died for love with his hands up because he challenged the authority of a police state.\u201d He denounced the president-elect by name. He thanked God for the election\u2019s \u201cmission clarification.\u201d Another standing O, from God\u2019s love army.Since that first Sunday, the \u201cmission clarification\u201d of these times has only intensified. I am stunned by every turn in the Trump administration in so many realms: health care, the protection of the environment, L.G.B.T. rights and the ever-burbling geopolitical turmoil. End Times? Who can know?But I am comforted by thinking maybe a Really Yuge Man is in charge. As in, God.So as President Trump\u2019s 100th day approacheth, we celebrate Easter. I light a candle of forgiveness for Ohio. Hope rises from the dead, and our spring bonnets are sprouting jaunty pink knit ears.

What I managed to hit was the fast-forward button. What ensued onscreen might be described as high-speed porn.The daughters laughed, mostly at their father, but there was a lesson to be learned: Develop a better trigger finger. Also, the media is a minefield. You have to watch your step.Parents of young children know this; parents of adopted and foster kids know it even better. It\u2019s a lesson I was reminded when \u201cThe Boss Baby\u201d became an unexpected hit, and some adoptive and foster parents found themselves dealing with messages their children find painful.A few years after the \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d debacle, my gift for gracelessness was tested again when my younger daughter and I were watching \u201cDespicable Me,\u201d and we arrived at the sequence in which Gru, not yet a good guy, returns the adorable orphans Agnes, Edith and Margo to Miss Hattie\u2019s Home for Girls because he can\u2019t be bothered with them anymore.This time, I was frozen in place: What was the girl beside me \u2014 who was adopted from an orphanage \u2014 going to think?She, too, survived. But adopted kids have to. So do their cousins in what can be the precarious circumstances of foster care. And mainstream entertainment doesn\u2019t always help. Awareness has certainly grown among film and TV executives in recent years: Not everyone in their audience is part of the proverbial ideal 2.5-child nuclear family. But there\u2019s no escaping the fact that rooted in our culture\u2019s literary DNA is a proclivity for treating the disrupted family unit as a conveniently poignant narrative device. The parentless child \u2014 one whose mother or father has been killed, kidnapped, lost or just left \u2014 is a mainstay of our fiction. Evil stepmothers predate the Grimms. Fagin was a truly bad surrogate father. Tarzan probably got the best of it, being raised by apes.It may be true that the best way to watch a kids\u2019 movie is by sitting next to a kid. It\u2019s equally true how easily and often one can be shocked at how insensitive the movies can be about childhood impermanence, while sitting next to a kid in foster care. (I know one pretty well.) The 2014 remake \u201cAnnie\u201d is often cited as being among the weakest recent portrayals of foster care or adoption, with its nightmare foster parents, incompetent social-services system and an adoptive parent who comes and goes.The \u201cDespicable Me\u201d series, on the other hand, is pretty good for adopted and foster children; the orphans transform Gru into a decent animated human being, and they all form a fast familial bond. Similarly, the \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d franchise is concerned with recognizing and accepting differences between members of a nontraditional family, and a child\u2019s need to know where he came from. By Chapter 3, there\u2019s even coexistence between adopted and bio families.The infant-like character of the title, voiced by Alec Baldwin \u2014 dressed and talking like a chief executive \u2014 disrupts his older brother\u2019s previously idyllic existence, pushing him aside, telling him he\u2019s pass\u00e9 and implying that his parents don\u2019t have enough love to go around. It\u2019s a story line that could kindle insecurity in any child getting a new sibling, but more so for one who is caught between biological and foster parents, has been shuttled from home to home or has joined an existing family.Admittedly, we parents can wax more indignant about this stuff than the kids ever would. I used to worry, once in a while, about \u201cModern Family,\u201d in which the adopted daughter is Vietnamese, like my daughter. The show is not above making Asian jokes. \u201cWill she be able to pronounce it?\u201d someone asked in an early episode, when told the child would be named Lily. My daughter didn\u2019t get it. The bad-driver jokes, too, roll off her back. She loves \u201cModern Family,\u201d probably because it\u2019s funny. That\u2019s basically it.What does bug her are movies and shows in which adoptees are other than normal kids. She cited \u201cParenthood,\u201d which before its demise had been the target of some withering criticism on adoption blogs. \u201cThey always make adoption a big problem,\u201d she said, speaking generally.Sitting through a Chipmunks movie, of course, is a lot to ask of parents, adoptive or otherwise, and you hate to admit you have done it. But at least you weren\u2019t sandbagged by some antediluvian notion of how family is supposed to work.I\u2019m no expert. Arguably, anyone incapable of operating a remote control shouldn\u2019t be entrusted with children. But I have some. They possess a variety of origin stories and, some might even say, issues. And it would be nice if, when they watched a movie, they always felt at home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canadian VW Dealers Move Diesels Out of Storage and Into Showrooms", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 Volkswagen dealers in Canada have quietly resumed selling diesel cars that they had been holding in inventory since the company\u2019s emissions-cheating scandal erupted in 2015.The Vancouver dealer and others did not respond to requests for comment.Higher fuel prices in Canada, largely because of taxes, had made diesel engines relatively popular in the country. Before the emissions scandal, diesels once accounted for about a quarter of the sales of some Volkswagen models in Canada, particularly the Golf.In September 2015, in what it said was a voluntary move, Volkswagen Canada halted sales of new and used vehicles that used the emissions-cheating software and said the matter was being investigated by Environment Canada, the federal regulator. That investigation is continuing.The combination of the scandal surrounding the carmaker\u2019s diesel vehicles and the subsequent improvements to some models, particularly the Golf, means that the cars that had been kept off dealership floors are being heavily discounted. The dealer in Vancouver was offering discounts of 9,500 Canadian dollars (about $7,000) for cash sales and 7,500 Canadian dollars, plus zero percent interest rates, for customers seeking financing.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely taking a risk, no question,\u201d said Jake Fisher, the director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, about buying a Volkswagen diesel today. \u201cThe question is: How are these cars performing after the fix?\u201dHowever, it added that it did \u201cnot expect any significant changes in fuel consumption or driving characteristics.\u201dMr. Fisher said that cars with the emissions-control fix would need to be tested to determine whether Volkswagen\u2019s assessment was correct. But he said he was sure there would be differences after the repairs, and perhaps not for the better. The new equipment and software could also reduce the longevity of engines, he said.\u201cIf they had the ability through software to make these engines comply with emissions rules, they would have done that in the first place, so obviously there will be differences,\u201d Mr. Fisher said.Volkswagen settled class-action lawsuits in Ontario and Quebec on Friday, involving owners nationwide, affecting about 105,000 Volkswagens and Audis with the 2.0-liter diesel engine made from 2009 to 2015; the company also said it would offer owners cash payments and other remedies, including repair or repurchase. Earlier, lawyers involved in the litigation estimated the cost of the settlement at 2.1 billion Canadian dollars.In a statement, the company said that the settlement \u201cis not an admission of liability by Volkswagen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With more than 2,000 exhibitors along with legions of outsiders showing throughout the city, it was the most exciting in a while. You would hardly guess from the crackling ideas and deep pools of beauty that we are in anxious times here and abroad.\u201cWhat can I tell you? Italians are optimists,\u201d said Ferruccio Laviani, a founder of the 1980s Memphis group who designs products and exhibition booths for Fratelli Boffi, Kartell and others.His colorful booth for Kartell this year was boldly called Contamination. As Claudio Luti, the chief executive of Kartell and newly reinstated president of the Salone, noted, the word in Italian means not just polluting but also cross-fertilizing. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice thing when you put two things together, they are completely different, but they grow together,\u201d he said.This year\u2019s potent energy pushed design tropes into new territory. Marble, popular for years, morphed into richly patterned stones like onyx. Copper and brass should have run their course, but instead exploded, leaving steel and aluminum in the dust.Designers were finally taking leave of the pink-and-jagged 1980s and welcoming back the Mary Tyler Moore \u201970s. It felt oddly fresh. And then there was the abundance of green, a color that design companies seemed to appreciate for its own sake, not for any forced association with nature.But nothing surpassed expectations like Euroluce, the fair\u2019s biennial lighting show.Two years ago, light was married in dazzling ways to materials. Ceiling fixtures had swirling fabric skirts. Table lamps were coated with diaphanous layers of gold. This time, light was also treated as a material in its own right, stretched thin across a room like a laundry line, split into rainbows, twisted into letters and poured like liquid into jars.As LED technology advances, lighting remains at the edge of a frontier, astonishing us with its versatility while promising greater surprises ahead. This year\u2019s wonders included portable, rechargeable and even collapsible table lamps; ceiling lights moved and dimmed by smartphone; and fixtures unabashedly marketed as jewelry. The collection by Flos was a particular standout, with products by leading international designers stamping their unique personalities onto this gossamer medium.The Chita armchair evolved from a collaboration between the Brazilian designer S\u00e9rgio Matos and Filipino furniture designer and producer Kenneth Cobonpue. Usa@kennethcobonpue.com.Apparatus Studio, which is based in New York and has a Milanese showroom, has made brass a trademark. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy metal to experiment with, unlike a lot of metals that you need to lacquer or powder-coat or polish,\u201d said Nick Grinder, the company\u2019s vice president for sales. \u201cBrass is something that can take on a lot of life and character without degrading as a metal. That\u2019s why they use it in boats.\u201dA possible drawback with Edra\u2019s Pack sofa is that it invites hibernation. But visitors who succeeded in rising from its velvety depths found many other big, fanciful couches to try out. The unusual shapes and configurations testify to the infinite ways we lounge.

{"Headline": "In Connecticut Murder Case, a Fitbit Is a Silent Witness", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byThe woman shot dead in the basement of her suburban Connecticut home had struggled with an intruder, her husband told the police just before Christmas in 2015. But over time, the story fell apart as investigators began to rely on a silent witness \u2014 a Fitbit exercise tracker that recorded the woman\u2019s last movements and may be the key to solving her murder.The case that began at the house of Richard and Connie Dabate in Ellington, a town of about 15,000 people north of Hartford, and unfolded over the last year highlights the latest example of how exercise devices have become increasingly part of investigators\u2019 tool kits.The devices are incorporated alongside the more conventional use of searches of sniffer dogs and gunshot residue tests, both of which came up inconclusive in the Dabate case.When Connecticut police arrived at the home on the morning of Dec. 23, 2015, Mr. Dabate spoke of a violent struggle with a masked intruder who zip-tied him to a chair, demanded his wallet and credit cards, cut him with a knife and then fatally shot his wife in the basement, according to an arrest warrant.But over time, the narrative that Mr. Dabate told investigators started to unravel when compared with a timeline pieced together using digital data from the family home, the warrant said. Most importantly, a Fitbit on Ms. Dabate\u2019s waistband recorded that she had walked 1,217 feet around the house during the time her husband said they were being attacked.The Fitbit showed her last living movement was at 10:05 a.m.Mr. Dabate, 40, was charged in Superior Court in Rockville on April 14 with murder, tampering with evidence and providing false statements, court documents showed, partly based on information from the Fitbit device.\u201cIt is definitely something we are going to see more of in the future,\u201d said Detective Christopher Jones of the East Lampeter Township Police Department in Pennsylvania in a telephone interview on Thursday. \u201cAs people continue to provide more and more personal information through technology, they have to understand we are obligated to find the best evidence, and this technology has become a part of that.\u201d\u201cBy itself it is not going to be that useful, but in collaboration with everything else, it can be a very useful tool,\u201d he said.Detective Jones worked on a case in 2015 in which a 43-year old woman said she was sexually assaulted during a break-in. But her Fitbit showed she was walking around at the time she had told investigators she had been sleeping, he said.He added, \u201cWe had other evidence that we were looking at, we were suspicious, but the Fitbit made all the difference.\u201dHeather Pierce, a spokeswoman for Fitbit, declined to comment on the Connecticut case. But she quoted company policy as saying it only provides content and data from the devices when there is a warrant. Otherwise, she said settings and data from the trackers or their online apps are not shared.\u201cIt is the user\u2019s choice when and where and with whom they share their data,\u201d she said in an emailed message quoting Jen Ralls, Fitbit\u2019s vice president of public relations.In this month\u2019s Connecticut murder case, the amount of walking recorded by Ms. Dabate\u2019s Fitbit exceeded the 125 feet that she would have been limited to in her husband\u2019s account that she went from the garage of their house to the basement, investigators concluded.The warrant said questions arose about the timing as investigators dug through a slew of fully wired activity at the house that morning, involving text messages, door movements, alarm settings and Facebook postings, the warrant said.It said Ms. Dabate, who was 39, was shot dead in the basement with a revolver owned by her husband and had gunshot wounds in her head and stomach.The warrant said Mr. Dabate had a pregnant girlfriend, and had tried to make a claim for Ms. Dabate\u2019s $475,000 life insurance policy five days after her murder.Mr. Stedman, the Pennsylvania prosecutor, said in an interview on Thursday that the Fitbit case has now been incorporated in prosecutors\u2019 training sessions. \u201cIt is a whole different aspect of law enforcement,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is far more data out there than we can keep up with.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Three Ways to Let Fresh Asparagus Shine", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byCity KitchenHow much new information can I offer about asparagus, a vegetable with which I am somewhat obsessed? Or what can I find to say that hasn\u2019t been said before, or that bears repeating?Shall I tap into my own collection of asparagus nostalgia? Should I remind people how good asparagus is for health and well-being?I\u2019ll never forget the happy day someone showed me the patch of wild green asparagus popping through the moist earth along a fence line by the irrigation ditch on a California ranch. It was the best introduction to fresh asparagus one could ever wish for. During a few springtime weeks, that patch gave us seven or eight glorious spears a day, sometimes a dozen, in all sizes. All they needed were a couple of minutes in boiling water, and some butter, salt and pepper. I\u2019m told that the patch is still producing.Though we call it wild asparagus, it would be more accurate to call it feral or invasive, something originally cultivated that has learned to thrive in the wild. Asparagus is not indigenous to the Americas \u2014 it was brought over by Europeans \u2014 so wherever it is found in the wild here, it has been scattered by the four winds from the seeds in some early settlers\u2019 gardens.It has the same look, taste and texture as cultivated green asparagus. The green stems and shoots (the part we eat) grow very quickly; any asparagus farmer will tell you a stalk can grow a foot or more in a day. They are in a hurry to do what they are programmed to do, which is to grow masses of fernlike feathery branches and go to seed. They also produce bright red berries, but don\u2019t eat those \u2014 they are toxic to humans.You may find some white asparagus at farmers\u2019 markets, and supermarkets now are stocking small white asparagus from Peru, but white asparagus needs longer cooking to become tender. For most people in North America, the quick-cooking green type is what you\u2019ll find consistently, in all sizes \u2014 skinny pencil-thin green asparagus, medium-size spears or fat jumbo stalks. For any of these, smooth shiny skin and tightly closed tips are the ideal.You may accessorize to your heart\u2019s content, and choose your cooking method. Here are three more options to add to your repertoire: thinly sliced for a raw asparagus salad; steamed and splashed with a pistachio-brown butter sauce; and charred briskly and slathered with a garlicky (preferably green garlic) chimichurri sauce. After a week of eating almost nothing but asparagus while I tested these, I can assure you that each one is a winner.But sometimes, at least at the beginning of the season, I think the best way is the plainest: simmered in salted water, drained at the right moment, and served warm. Then the only decision that needs to be made is whether to anoint with good butter or good olive oil. In either case, the sweet taste of juicy fresh-picked asparagus will shine.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mutual Funds Buy Hot Stocks Like Snap Ahead of I.P.O.s", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported bySnap acquired loads of new investors when it went public last month, including people who own mutual funds that bought shares. But while the stock had just been listed for trading, those new owners were not the first fund investors with a stake in the image messaging service.They were beaten to it by shareholders of about two dozen mutual funds, including several run by Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, that held pieces of Snap going back at least to last June, according to Morningstar. The practice of purchasing privately traded equities is fairly common among large fund companies, albeit usually in small amounts relative to their assets.With positions so modest, private-firm equity purchases may hardly be worth talking about, except that the companies that funds invest in are often the sort that get talked about: buzz-worthy tech stocks with highly anticipated initial public offerings, such as Facebook in 2012, Twitter the year after that and Snap most recently.The next crop of next big things to go public may include the ride service Uber, the biggest object of private-firm equity investment cited in the Morningstar study, and the service Airbnb.Buying ahead of the crowd carries great reward potential but also significant risks, analysts and fund managers say. It\u2019s a useful way to gain access to tomorrow\u2019s hot stocks today, as long as it\u2019s done in amounts that are small enough to keep participants from getting burned if something goes awry and the crowd fails to show up.\u201cBeing early to the table can benefit fund owners,\u201d said Katie Reichart, associate director of equity strategies research at Morningstar and the study\u2019s author. \u201cFunds can buy into a company at a much lower valuation.\u201d Highlighting the main drawback, she added, \u201cIt might not go public or fizzle out.\u201dWith no liquid market to continually set prices, it\u2019s hard for funds or their shareholders to know what a private company is worth at any moment. This can result in stale pricing, or a valuation based on a stock\u2019s last trade that occurred so long ago that it can no longer be considered an accurate gauge of its worth. At times when investors are dumping stocks across the board, there could be no one to take a privately held stock off a portfolio manager\u2019s hands, ultimately leading to a total write-off.Even if a stock goes public eventually, owning it can create difficulties, Ms. Reichart said. If a fund must sell stocks to meet redemption requests, for example, there may be no choice but to sell publicly traded issues that the manager would rather keep, causing private-firm equity to become an undesirably large proportion of total assets.A successful public offering and further gains thereafter, on the other hand, can produce returns many times as great as a fund\u2019s initial investment. The prospect of getting a piece of such a stock early and making a huge score explains why private companies are sometimes called unicorns.To try to strike the right risk/reward balance, funds generally invest after a company has established a history of generating solid and growing revenues. Once a position appears to be meeting a manager\u2019s expectations, further capital is likely to be invested, before or after the hoped-for public stock sale.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find something we can continue to buy and make a bigger portion of our funds,\u201d said Andy Boyd, the head of global equity capital markets at Fidelity, the largest private-firm equity investor by far, with stakes totaling roughly $5 billion across several funds, according to Morningstar.While noting that \u201cevery great investment starts small,\u201d Mr. Boyd stressed that Fidelity will not invest in anything too small. The company will buy into private businesses \u201cif they\u2019re at a size and scale that makes sense for us, not two guys in a garage.\u201d That typically means \u201cat the very end of their private life, before they become public.\u201dHe declined to offer specific return figures, but he said that \u201cas a group these have been highly profitable for our shareholders\u201d and \u201coverall we outperform the market.\u201dThe private companies in which Fidelity holds large stakes include Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and WeWork. It had owned Facebook and Snap privately, but not Twitter.Nine Fidelity funds and 11 Price funds were among the 23 in the Morningstar study that had stakes in Snap. The other three funds were Optimum Large Cap Growth, Principal LargeCap Growth and Valic Company I Science & Technology.These investments produced annualized returns of 59.5 percent from September 2009 through 2016, Mr. Ellenbogen said. The rest of the private holdings have returned 5.1 percent a year.Owning private-firm equity can produce other, less immediately tangible rewards, advocates contend. Investing in a private company allows a firm \u201cto know a management longer,\u201d Mr. Boyd said. \u201cWe want to get to know companies and understand their businesses.\u201dMs. Reichart at Morningstar cited other advantages, including an opportunity to own companies that are not components of benchmark indexes. That gives managers a chance to beat the returns of index funds, something that has been difficult in recent years.Private companies can also protect against disruptive changes in an industry, she said. Owning the next big thing is a useful hedge if you also own the current big thing that the upstart is trying to displace.Some large portfolio managers are not persuaded by such arguments and hold little or no private-firm equity. Massachusetts Financial Services, for example, has \u201cno explicit policy against investing privately on behalf of our funds,\u201d said Daniel Flaherty, a company spokesman, \u201cbut we have generally avoided private investments due to their higher risk profile.\u201dJPMorgan Chase, another of the 10 largest asset managers, does not invest in private companies, either, but a representative declined to offer reasons.Ed Sweeney, a spokesman for BlackRock, said his firm was a somewhat active owner of private companies three or four years ago, especially through its Global Allocation Fund, but lately managers have found valuations high, relative to those of public companies.\u201cWe were dabbling in this space across several funds, but over the last 18 months to two years, if not zero, it\u2019s very scaled back,\u201d he said.Dabbling in private-firm equity may be getting more difficult, according to one longtime practitioner. When unlisted companies sell shares, they are more likely to require the buyers not to trade them, said Kevin Landis, a Silicon Valley investment veteran and manager of the Firsthand Technology Value Fund, a closed-end vehicle for holding solely private companies.\u201cSince the Facebook I.P.O., the game has changed,\u201d Mr. Landis said. \u201cPrivate companies have gone back to the drawing board and instituted some changes that give them a lot more control over the movement of their stock. Companies like Uber have locked down trading and changed their shareholder agreements to make it virtually impossible to buy shares. We would have loved to buy shares of Uber, Airbnb or Snap two years ago, but they just weren\u2019t available.\u201dMs. Reichart reports \u201ca slight uptick\u201d in private-firm investment since mid-2016 but \u201cnot a major spike in the number of companies or average stakes.\u201dThe continued modest level of investment is good and bad news for shareholders. It gives them less to get excited about but less to get nervous about.If you\u2019re shopping around for a stock fund, \u201cit\u2019s important to understand if a fund is doing this in terms of your risk tolerance,\u201d Ms. Reichart said. \u201cAre you comfortable with that idea? In most cases funds are diversified and the positions are small. It\u2019s probably not worth panicking about, and you\u2019re probably not going to get blockbuster returns.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside Turkey\u2019s Purge", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "FeatureAs the ruling party expands the ranks of its enemies, life in a fragile democracy becomes stranger and stranger.Supported byThe doctor couldn\u2019t help it; he laughed. \u201cReally? I did that?\u201dThe police officers smiled, too. \u201cYes. Also for attempting to destroy Turkey and for being a member of a terrorist organization.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d He looked at them. They carried pistols. \u201cCan I have a cigarette then?\u201dThe police seemed surprised. They didn\u2019t expect a Gulenist to smoke. I\u2019m not a Gulenist, the doctor insisted. That didn\u2019t help him. He would soon be one of the many thousands of people in Turkey caught in the machinery of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s purge.The police searched the doctor\u2019s house and his books and overturned his things, looking for evidence that he was a Gulenist, or a supporter of Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric who began preaching in Turkey in the 1960s and whose followers number as many as five million. Gulen has been living in exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, which partly explains why the police were looking for American $1 bills whose serial numbers start with \u201cF\u201d \u2014 the Turkish government claims that these were used in some mysterious way by something it has branded the Fethullah Gulen Terrorist Organization, or FETO, which it blames for the attempted coup in Turkey on July 15, 2016.At present, several pieces of evidence can suggest that you may be a member of FETO, including having had an account at Bank Asya, which was founded by Gulenists; running the ByLock encrypted communication app on your phone (thought to have facilitated planning for the coup attempt); possessing those F-series dollar bills; sending your children to a school associated with Gulen; working at a Gulen-affiliated institution (a university, say, or a hospital); having subscribed to the Gulen newspaper Zaman; or having Gulen\u2019s books in your house. One action implicated the doctor: When he returned to Turkey after living abroad for three years and moved into a new house with his wife and children, he opened an account at the nearest bank up the street: Bank Asya.The police officers \u2014 in the doctor\u2019s recollection there were as many as 10 of them \u2014 seemed to regard him curiously. \u201cWho are you?\u201dThe doctor described his background, his education, his professional accomplishments, his travels, none of which I can include here. But I can confirm that his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is impressive. Like many doctors, he possesses the confidence of someone who has always placed first.\u201cI haven\u2019t met a criminal like you ever,\u201d one officer told him.They took the doctor to police headquarters in Fatih, where he spent a couple of days in the basement. The Fatih station is on a wide avenue in the heart of Istanbul and has the tinny, sinister ambience of many bureaucratic buildings. Detainees have been kept in the basement holding cells, in darkness and without space to move, for as many as five days, without being allowed to see a lawyer; post-coup-attempt \u201cstate of emergency\u201d laws also permitted them to be held for 30 days without a hearing. It is here, in detention centers like Fatih, where the torture of prisoners, which was mostly discontinued in the early 2000s, is happening anew.The doctor was not tortured, but he met a fellow detainee who told him: \u201cThey took me into a dark room and made me spend three days sitting in a chair with my hands bound behind me. They only fed me water with sugar. Do you have any food?\u201dWhen the doctor appeared in court, the prosecutor said, \u201cBesides putting money in Bank Asya, there\u2019s nothing else here on you.\u201d And then the prosecutor asked, \u201cWho told you to put this money in the bank?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who owns this bank,\u201d the doctor replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know who owns any bank. There are 30 banks in Istanbul. I chose the one closest to my house.\u201dThe prosecutor asked for the doctor to be arrested. The judge asked the doctor what he had to say for himself.\u201cI am not going to respond to anything about the accusation, because the accusations are that I tried to kill President Erdogan, that I am trying to destroy Turkey and that I am a member of a terrorist organization, and that is ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I am just going to tell you who I am.\u201d He described his career achievements, his modest origins. The judge denied the request for a formal arrest. But once the doctor was back at home, he was unable to fall asleep before 6 a.m. For weeks, he slept one hour a night.The doctor happened to have a visa for a foreign country, so he decided to escape Turkey. At the airport, though, he was stopped. This has become a ritual repeated all over the country. People become aware of their imminent detention or arrest and try to catch a foreign flight, only to have their passports seized or canceled before they can board the plane. Even those who have not been labeled members of a terrorist organization or been accused of trying to kill Erdogan have arrived at the passport line and been made to wait while a clerk calls someone and reads their Turkish ID number over the phone to confirm that they are allowed to leave the country.The doctor had by then heard the reports of the torture, of endless imprisonment with no legal recourse; he knew he had to flee, even if it meant leaving his family. He found a smuggler online \u2014 in this, the Turks have followed the lead of the Syrian refugees in their country by searching through Syrian Facebook groups \u2014 and went to the coastal city Marmaris, where he paid the \u201cV.I.P.\u201d rate to board a speedboat into international waters. For the Turkish exiles, many of whom are wealthy, the smugglers have raised the price of a getaway to as much as 20,000 euros. Now the doctor is one of the estimated thousands of Turks living in exile, in places like Germany, Sweden, Greece, Britain and the United States.The doctor is hiding in a European city, full of 19th-century buildings and arched arcades and grand squares; it can, like a lot of old cities, even look like Istanbul sometimes if you squint. Every day here, Gulenists, Kurds, journalists, academics and people like the doctor \u2014 a cross section of Turkish society that has been demonized by Erdogan or simply refuses to support him \u2014 pass by one another on the street, unaware of the presence of their fellow countrymen. They have lost their livelihoods and their citizenship; they have been separated from their husbands and wives and children. Many of the traumatized men and women I met abroad \u2014 I interviewed more than a dozen exiles living in different European cities, in addition to many people inside Turkey \u2014 believe that families are being deliberately destroyed, as if the aim is to end lineages. As one of the purged \u2014 a young engineer with delicate features, pale skin and wire-rimmed glasses, who wept as we sat in a high-ceilinged restaurant reminiscent of some cosmopolitan past \u2014 said to me, \u201cThis is a kind of genocide.\u201dThe terror probably set in fully when they saw video of the army firing on civilians protesting in the streets. No one was used to seeing that in western Turkey, in Istanbul. The huge booms of fighter jets breaking the sound barrier echoed throughout the city. Tanks and soldiers moved into Taksim Square, where thousands of protesters had challenged the government\u2019s construction plans for Gezi Park just a few years ago.Amid the chaos, the Ministry of Religious Affairs texted the country\u2019s imams and muezzins and instructed them to sing a special prayer from mosque loudspeakers to exhort Erdogan\u2019s conservative supporters to take to the streets. In neighborhoods throughout Istanbul, men flooded the avenues. Some of those with guns shot wildly at the helicopters overhead.And then it was over. The coup had failed. The death toll would reach 276, with an additional 3,000 injured, according to Turkish officials. Successful civilian mobilization against a coup attempt was unprecedented in Turkey. For Turks, it was a defense of democracy.The government immediately condemned Gulenist military officers as responsible for the attempted coup, before eventually spreading the blame to all of Gulen\u2019s followers. Over the last two decades, four main factions have been particularly prominent in Turkish politics: the Islamic conservative A.K. Party; the military and its secularist supporters; the Kurdish militant group P.K.K. and various Kurdish political movements; and, finally, the Gulenists, the most inscrutable group of all. Gulen and his followers have advocated a conservative Islamic lifestyle mixed with Turkish nationalism, high education standards and \u2014 unlike many Muslim brotherhoods \u2014 a selectively pro-Western worldview. Their proselytizing efforts, as well as the promise of education and career opportunities, enticed many Turks and Kurds among both the underprivileged and the elite to join the movement. Gulenists built schools abroad, including in the United States, in which followers worked as teachers. They also founded banks, nonprofit organizations, publishing houses, universities, newspapers, television stations and a profitable chain of tutoring centers that prepare students for the college entrance exam. Education, Gulenists said, was their priority.In contrast to the Gulenists\u2019 international business and political ties and their technocratic expertise, the A.K. Party\u2019s strength was its deep social and electoral networks within the working and middle classes. When it came to power in 2002, the A.K. Party and its Gulenist allies \u2014 by now employed throughout the judiciary and the national police force, as well as the news media \u2014 together began subjecting military officers and other opponents, including journalists, Kurds and secularists, to sham trials and imprisonment. Humiliating details about personal lives ended up in court documents and on mysterious websites; careers were ruined; officers were rounded up without legal justification; wiretapping was rampant. People had been worrying that the Gulenists were running their own parallel state; now the fight was apparent.Over time, the Gulenists and the A.K. Party were rived by policy disputes \u2014 the peace process with the P.K.K., for example, and above all the financial-corruption cases that Gulenist prosecutors brought against Erdogan. By 2014, each side was trying to destroy the other. Most Turks found it entirely plausible when Erdogan pinned the blame for last July\u2019s attempted coup on the Gulenists: Some 65 percent of the population, according to one opinion poll taken just after the event, believed the claim; many well-regarded foreign and domestic experts believe it was possible, too. (Gulen himself has denied any connection to the coup attempt.) Turks also remain furious at the Gulenists for their secretive and oppressive tactics while in power.In the A.K. Party\u2019s view, anyone devoted to Gulen, the man accused of being behind the coup attempt, is assumed to do whatever he says, and so all Gulenists, even teachers and tradesmen who couldn\u2019t possibly have been involved, can also legally be considered terrorists, or members of FETO. In defining his enemies so broadly, Erdogan is also grabbing an opportunity: He is finishing off not only the Gulenists but all opposition, including journalists, academics, liberals and Kurdish activists. The result is a state that seems to be eating itself \u2014 entire institutions, as well as the bonds and structures that once held Turkish society together. When that happens, citizens suddenly lacking the protections of law or even loyalty will do whatever they can to escape from the house collapsing upon them.On April 16, Turks will vote on a referendum that would give the president vast powers, including the ability to dismiss Parliament at will. Erdogan would be able to run for president again and potentially extend his 14 years in power to 26, or until 2029, an outcome that his supporters believe will bring stability and that the opposition talks about as \u201cthe end\u201d \u2014 the triumph of authoritarian rule in Turkey. Erdogan evidently worries about this being a possible end for him, too, because in the months leading up to the referendum he has waged a campaign of overt intimidation. \u201cNo\u201d voters are terrorist supporters, he has declared. Organizers of \u201cNo\u201d campaigns have been detained. The government\u2019s distribution of antismoking leaflets was stopped, as if the presence of the word \u201cNo\u201d might exert subliminal influence on voters. Female activists urging \u201cNo\u201d votes have been beaten by thugs. For the people of Turkey, this referendum is about survival.The lists aren\u2019t just of people. Entire organizations, however innocuous seeming, show up on them: the Holistic and Alternative Medical Foundation, the Love Trees Protect Forests Live Humanely Foundation, the Gastrointestinal Oncology Foundation, to name just a few. Many of these are not Gulenist but Kurdish or leftist. If it seems as though Turkey\u2019s purge lists are touching every part of its society, that\u2019s because they are.The purge worked its way through the country slowly, the intentions behind its advance at times difficult to discern. I started hearing stories from friends: One was taking his mother for a checkup and arrived to find that the physicians had all been arrested. A clinic specializing in in vitro fertilization was suddenly shut down, before any women could reclaim their stored eggs. The arrests became more bizarre: members of the family that owns the Gulluoglu chain, the oldest and most beloved baklava makers in the country, and Barbaros Sansal, a fashion designer, who was jailed for \u201cinsulting the Turkish nation\u201d on social media. Entire universities have been closed and their graduates\u2019 diplomas canceled. One private university was so decimated that its website showed a picture of the same man as rector, professor of Islamic theology, dean of the tourism department and more. Policemen have been known to wait outside delivery rooms to arrest new mothers. Some purged academics can no longer travel, or take posts, abroad.So far, some 140,000 people in Turkey have had their passports canceled, according to a recent report by the main opposition party. More than 100,000 people have been suspected of being part of the coup attempt; 71,000 people have been detained, and 41,000 have been arrested. About 35,000 have been detained and then released. Six thousand people in academia have lost their jobs, as have 4,000 judges and prosecutors, 24,000 policemen and security personnel and 200 governors and their staff members. Seven thousand military personnel have been relieved of their posts. Fifteen universities, 1,000 schools, 28 TV channels, 66 newspapers, 19 magazines, 36 radio stations, 26 publishing houses and five news agencies have been shut down. The moderate Kurdish politician Selahattin Demirtas is in jail, accused of inciting violence with words, and as of February, a total of 5,471 people from Demirtas\u2019s political party, H.D.P., had been detained and 1,482 had been arrested. Kurdish activists live in fear of the knock on the door \u2014 many no longer sleep at home \u2014 because once you go to jail, you may never get out.The military has declared states of emergency several times in Turkey\u2019s history, though usually after actual coups, not failed ones. Even if the aftermaths of earlier coups saw greater violence \u2014 more torture, more hangings \u2014 there was the promise of an end. Martial law could be expected to come to a close; free elections would be held.There is \u201cno rationality or reason\u201d behind the prosecutors\u2019 cases, Piskin told me. \u201cFor example, Selahattin Demirtas has 102 cases against him, and all of them are about his speech. He\u2019s a member of Parliament, and Parliament members have immunity, so he can say what he wants to say, except for hate speech.\u201d Demirtas\u2019s public statements mostly urged an end to the war in southeast Turkey, where government forces are battling the P.K.K. \u201cBut if you speak about peace in Turkey, you are considered a supporter of P.K.K.\u201dThe judiciary in Turkey has never been independent of ideological or political pressure, but neither has it been a broken system. The European Union and the Council of Europe spent millions of dollars training Turkish judges to follow European human rights standards. But the purge has swept out some 4,000 judges and prosecutors, including many of the trainees and at least two judges from the Constitutional Court, the highest court in Turkey. Many new, younger judges have been fast-tracked as replacements for the purged ones \u2014 and they have no idea what they are doing, according to lawyers who have dealt with them. Defense lawyers try to uphold legal standards and procedures, while judges and prosecutors operate in an absurd alternative reality.\u201cWe act as if the law exists,\u201d Piskin said. \u201cBut the prosecutors and judges are not going by the law. They really don\u2019t even know the law.\u201d Don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care, he said. \u201cJudith Butler said insolence is fascism \u2014 they are really insolent.\u201dAs part of the state of emergency, the government also has the ability to introduce laws without parliamentary debate. The Constitutional Court has ruled that it does not have any power over these executive orders. According to the European Court of Human Rights, to which Turkey is a signatory, a country has the right to deviate from the law during a state of emergency \u2014 but there are limits. A country cannot, for example, reinstate the death penalty, but it can change course on laws that guarantee, say, the speediness of a trial. In Turkey, the conditions have been extreme: Some of the accused can see their lawyers only one hour a week. There is no confidentiality in the relationship. Visits are recorded on video, and copies of all documents must be given to a prison minder who stands in the room during every conversation.The Committee to Protect Journalists has reported that 81 Turkish journalists were in prison as of last December, which was more than in China, Egypt, Iran, Russia and Syria combined. In total, about 150 people working in the media are locked up. For a time, the manager of the cafeteria at one of Turkey\u2019s oldest newspapers, Cumhuriyet, was detained for saying he would not serve tea to Erdogan.\u201cThis is about hijacking the system,\u201d says Tobias Garnett, a British lawyer working for P24, a press-freedom organization based in Istanbul that represents many of the jailed journalists, including Mehmet and Ahmet Altan and Sahin Alpay, who have been jailed without trial since shortly after the attempted coup. \u201cIt\u2019s not like in some countries, where they sideline the legal system entirely and just start assassinating people extrajudicially. What is happening here is getting rid of your opponents by using a system many people actually respect.\u201dAnother impediment to justice in Turkey is its Constitutional Court. The court has received some 100,000 cases (on behalf of people in jail and those who have lost their jobs) since the failed coup \u2014 an unmanageable number for a court that usually processes 20,000 cases a year. Since purge cases began to reach the court about seven months ago, the court has not ruled on a single application. And this means that technically none of the Turks can appeal to the European Court of Human Rights, which requires you to exhaust every legal remedy in your home country first. If Turkey\u2019s Constitutional Court refuses to hear cases, there is no way to exhaust anything. And yet Turks are not giving up: Thousands of people file their cases over and again, sometimes monthly, at home and in Europe.The respectability of the justice system is deteriorating for an even darker reason: torture in its prisons and detention centers, which the government denies is taking place. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented many instances in two recent reports: keeping detainees cuffed and forcing them to kneel for 48 hours; letting them go hungry; beating and punching their heads and bodies; threatening rape with a baton; and threatening to rape one\u2019s wife. There have also been reports of the sick dying of neglect, and of suicide as well.The worst abuses have fallen on soldiers, Gulenists and Kurds, in part because they have been publicly and legally branded as terrorists. \u201cThere is a lot of serious torture,\u201d Piskin told me. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t hide it. You see the photographs in the papers.\u201d But there are many more acts of violence, Piskin said, that no one sees. \u201cThere is a forest, I don\u2019t know where it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took some of my clients there and sexually abused them. I have to go to court today for one of these men.\u201dCevheri grew up in a Kurdish family in the northeastern city Erzurum, and Tuba in a Turkish family in Anatolian Eskisehir. He is slight, with a shy demeanor; Tuba is open and charismatic. Cevheri had worked in Gulenist-affiliated media outlets, and Tuba was a reporter at TRT, the state-run broadcasting agency. In 2015, before the coup attempt, Cevheri, the editor of the magazine Nokta, was jailed for publishing two controversial magazine covers: a doctored photo of Erdogan taking a selfie at a soldier\u2019s funeral, and another predicting a possible civil war in Turkey. After the failed coup, Cevheri was detained again \u2014 this time on suspicion of belonging to a terrorist organization and making propaganda for the attempted coup.\u201cIn the media, we were seeing that there was a lot of torture, so I didn\u2019t want to get arrested again,\u201d he told me. Cevheri said that detainees being taken to prison were made to listen to recordings of poems read by Erdogan \u2014 as if to give the message that he personally was arresting them. It was clear that no one accused of participation in the attempted coup would have access to a fair trial. \u201cI started to hide myself somewhere secure,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter I left, the police came to my house three times, and I knew that the next time they might take Tuba instead\u201d \u2014 the arrest of a wife being a common concern \u2014 \u201cso she started hiding herself too.\u201dOn TV, Cevheri said, Erdogan had been urging Turks to turn in FETO members, even offering rewards. For 55 days, Cevheri never left the house. A friend brought him food.\u201cThen the kids had to go to school, and I had to earn money,\u201d he said. Mostly he feared imprisonment and torture; six legal cases had been brought against him. Cevheri began researching Syrian refugee sites and found a smuggler. \u201cThis was not a sustainable life. We had to leave.\u201dEventually the family landed in a refugee camp abroad \u2014 with other Turks, as well as P.K.K. fighters. I heard multiple stories of such Turkish-Kurdish encounters in detention, which fascinated me, because Gulenists are virulently anti-P.K.K. But the P.K.K. fighters, according to people I spoke to, often welcomed their fellow Turkish citizens, with mixed results. One P.K.K. fighter was friendly to Cevheri. One policeman, a tough man, told me with a red face that he was afraid to tell the P.K.K. fighters that he was a police officer. One Turk told me his wife refused to drink tea a Kurdish fighter brought her. Outside Turkey, former enemies sleep side by side, exiled by the same force but at times still afraid of one another.In Turkey, group identity is important. As the journalist Mustafa Akyol has written, the Turkish state has been a \u201cLeviathan\u201d that controlled everything, and it was for a long time dominated by Kemalists, the secular and nationalist elite. Other groups \u2014 Kurds, Islamists, communists \u2014 existed outside this state, and some dreamed of controlling it. The P.K.K. arose in response to the Turkish state\u2019s attacks on Kurds and their culture. The Gulen movement emerged at a time when it was dangerous to deviate from the Turkish state\u2019s official version of Islam. In the context of Turkish history, the reasons to join either the P.K.K. or the Gulen movement seem understandable, as is, to some degree, an elected government\u2019s fear of such groups. But in circumstances like these, a cycle of collective revenge continues unabated, and Turkish society\u2019s root problem \u2014 the inability to share power with all citizens \u2014 will never be solved.I met the sociologist Nese Ozgen at a smoke-filled cafe in a European city. She is in her 50s and has dyed magenta hair and a confident, warm smile. \u201cI worked 31 years as a sociologist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I always had problems.\u201d Her focus is border studies, the way communities are shaped by living almost between nations. After the military coup in 1980, she was barred from academia because of her participation in leftist activities, though she eventually found university employment. Later on, it was the Gulenists\u2019 turn to bully her.\u201cAfter the \u201980s, the Gulenists came, and they had their lists, too,\u201d she said. \u201cThey forced me to get my retirement because of my work.\u201d Border studies was controversial because the areas she focused on were often militarized. \u201cThen I was rehired as an adjunct some years later. And then I was dismissed again by Gulenists for participating in the Gezi protests.\u201dShe added: \u201cI am a socialist, and a supporter of gender rights and human rights, and generally an opposition person. When you are always an outsider in Turkey, you cannot really succeed.\u201dOzgen was also one of many academics who were harassed or lost their jobs for signing a peace petition that called on Turkey to stop the fight against the Kurds in the country\u2019s southeast. For people like Ozgen, the war \u2014 in which thousands have died and whole cities have been leveled \u2014 is the real tragedy of the Erdogan era. Professors who oppose the conflict have had X\u2019s spray-painted on their doors or have gone to jail. Often, Ozgen said, they cannot return to their offices to retrieve their belongings or step foot on campus, and they are threatened on social media with violence.\u201cThere is a moral decay,\u201d she said. Shortly after such threats, and the loss of her academic freedom, she decided to find work abroad.Erdogan once offered great hope. He improved the lives of millions in Turkey, and that is why many people will vote \u201cYes\u201d for him in the April 16 referendum. They remember what it was like when a family member was dying of cancer and they had to pay every last cent for substandard care; they remember what it was like to be looked down upon for being religious, for being poor and unsophisticated. Erdogan could very well win his referendum fairly; Turkish elections are normally efficient and monitored. Few Turks are entirely convinced that he could simply steal the vote after the fact. Instead, the state seems to be trying to do so in advance, through intimidation.Such attempted coercion raises a question: How popular is Erdogan really? After all, this pre-referendum bullying is only a more intense version of what daily life in Turkey is like, with Erdogan on TV and the radio, all day every day, demanding that his people love him. His proclamations about his popularity \u2014 amplified by a media he dominates \u2014 are drowning out the genuine opposition to him: not just the so-called secular elite, but Alevis, Kurds, Armenians, atheists, the pious, feminists, leftists, independents \u2014 all sorts of ordinary people who simply do not want to have to worship this man. New hospitals, free health care and clean streets are little good to a Turk or a Kurd who is not free to go to work or live in a house that won\u2019t be shelled by the government. Do the choices in this referendum \u2014 \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 offer the real prospect of a better nation for the Turks?There are, after all, less visible ways in which the country seems to be breaking apart, no matter how its citizens vote. The all-encompassing fury over the attempted coup has meant that some Turks have no sympathy for the victims of the purge; some are afraid of being tainted by them, and some snitch on them to save themselves. Such distrust is a disease for a society, and it has spread to anyone who dares to criticize the A.K. Party. As the referendum has grown nearer, what you hear from opposition Turks at home is unimaginable stress, a smothering weight, the panic of the unknown. What you hear from Turks abroad is their loneliness and loss, that strange, tender feeling of being exposed and unprotected, of having no legal or human rights, and of having perhaps forever lost their country.\u201cMost friends don\u2019t get in touch out of fear,\u201d Tuba said. On the last day I saw them, their young son had begun to rebel comically against these long days of talking with a foreign stranger, and Tuba sat snuggling and kissing him repeatedly to quiet him. \u201cThey don\u2019t say anything on Instagram, and sometimes I call them on WhatsApp, and they don\u2019t answer me. It\u2019s very painful. I erased my old history. I have no friends.\u201dShe laughed a little and then her voice got stronger. \u201cSometimes even mothers or fathers refuse to speak to their children because they blame them for being FETO\u201d \u2014 for staging the coup attempt. \u201cCome on, your daughter or your son. Can you imagine it? Because of this, I blame them \u2014 you know the truth. Everybody knows the truth. They know me; they know their son or daughter. Choose! Who will you believe? Me or Erdogan?

It\u2019s very sensory and you experience your organs in a totally different way.\u201dPerforming on stage as many as eight times a day, Ms. Hochendoner slides larger and larger swords down her throat, often letting them drop a few inches before catching them with her teeth, throat and stomach muscles.To achieve this she tilts her head back and relaxes her throat while suppressing the gag reflex. She navigates the blade down the esophagus, past the epiglottis and into the chest, where it\u2019s separated from her heart by about an eighth of an inch of tissue. From there, the sword is guided past the sternum, through the diaphragm and past the liver and kidneys until it reaches the bottom of her stomach.Is it dangerous? You bet.\u201cOnce there was a sword in me and it nicked the back side of my stomach,\u201d Ms. Hochendoner said, calling it her only injury in the decade she has spent swallowing swords.\u201cLike any loving relationship, you have to listen and ask your body, and sometimes it\u2019s not the right time to go all the way.\u201dBut the risk, Ms. Hochendoner said, is worth it.\u201cI want an honest reaction,\u201d from the audience, she said, and she usually gets it. \u201cWhether it\u2019s extraordinarily surprised or extraordinarily disgusted or happy. Whatever their reaction is, it\u2019s always extraordinary.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Today will be wet. Be on guard for showers and thunderstorms, with a high of 62.We\u2019ll be flip-flopping between clear and cloudy, dry and drizzly all weekend.Oh well.Saturday Sunday Newspaper racks in the city are in need of a serious makeover.The council is seeking designs for newspaper racks that can withstand life on the mean streets of New York. Namely, dispensers that can survive graffiti, vandalism and bad weather; can be placed on crowded sidewalks without being knocked over; and won\u2019t impede pedestrians.Think you can design a more dapper dispenser? You can win up to $2,500.Submissions are being accepted until July 31.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "My Vancouver: An Ever-Unfolding Story", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Where I LiveFor the author, this gleaming, complex city in British Columbia is \u201ca rolling, improvisatory work in progress.\u201dSupported byVancouver has what you might call an improvisational air. The city makes itself up as it goes along because we are all really complete newbies here, excepting, of course, the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh peoples on whose unceded territory the whole Vancouver project has been and continues to be built.I make this observation with the blend of affection and impatience one tends to acquire after decades in a place. But I say it also knowing that\u2019s how I got here.Vancouver was my father\u2019s idea. The son of an Irish blacksmith, made good with a degree in engineering, he had lived all over the world \u2014 a restless young man who had ended up in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where he met my mother, a holocaust survivor whose family had washed up on those unlikely shores. A dozen years later \u2014 having lived in Brooklyn Heights and in Jackson, Mich. \u2014 the family found itself in San Tom\u00e9, Venezuela, where (in my imagination, at least) my father counted five kids at the table one morning and decided maybe it was time to settle down. I see his finger tracing its way westward across a map of Canada, the names of cities and towns becoming less and less familiar. When he ran out of continent, he had found his spot. I\u2019m quite sure my mother had never heard of Vancouver.Terminal City, they used to say. The end of the line because the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway ended here. But it was a last stop in other senses as well, carved out of a rain forest that seemed ready to overwhelm it. You can still see it that way, nature leaning in around the city. To the north: the snow-capped Garibaldi Highlands, their timbered slopes plunging into a cobalt ocean, gulls crying above the still fish-filled waves. Viewed from the pebbly sand of Kitsilano Beach, the skyline of Vancouver, the actual built substance of the place, can seem on occasion like a glimmering mirage, a seam of mirrored glass suspended between what lies above and below, a recent and provisional thing, reflecting what is permanent around it: the sky and mountains, the endless sea.But if that is our contact with what is established and certain, then the rest of the Vancouver experience lives in the contrast. I recently conducted an informal Facebook poll on Vancouver that ended up proving this point. Citing Peter Ustinov\u2019s long-ago quip that Toronto was \u201cNew York run by the Swiss,\u201d I asked what parallel statement might be made about Vancouver.Still, for me, West Coast wackiness doesn\u2019t capture it entirely. Sure, Vancouver can be seen as culturally contiguous to other coastal urban zones that celebrate individual expression: the Castro district in San Francisco, Echo Park in Los Angeles, Portlandia, etc. But what really defines it is a relative lack of assumptions. I travel a lot and I love urban life generally. And what strikes me about where I live is that local residents cannot resort to a unifying clich\u00e9. Parisians and Romans, Shanghainese and Chicagoans seem always to know the essential civic myths. In Vancouver, ask a random citizen and you\u2019re liable to get anything.In fairness, it has to be noted that this exact improvisational quality is also a real source of vulnerability. What\u2019s fresh about this place, a kind of cultural and economic tabula rasa, has provided for some highly unstable outcomes. It\u2019s noteworthy that on only two occasions has the city found itself on the brink of a sports championship: Game 7 of the Stanley Cup playoffs in both cases, in 1994 against the New York Rangers and in 2011 against the Boston Bruins. Both times, on losing, Vancouver descended into manic violence with stores looted and cars burned. There\u2019s a troublingly adolescent quality to these disturbances, which I theorize are less likely to occur in cities that are soberly aware of their own capacity for self-harm. In Vancouver \u2014 where cyclists wear helmets and nobody carries a concealed weapon \u2014 I\u2019ve often wondered if in our youthfulness we also lack the maturity to see our own hypocrisies. A city smugly in the downward facing dog.But don\u2019t bet on us trying. We choose freedom in this town, including all of its attendant complications. In the end, that will remain the beautiful problem that Vancouver will have, mayoral daydreaming notwithstanding. People will continue to come here and make up their stories as they go along. And if the sense of impermanence gets to us on occasion \u2014 which it will as we age, as we see ourselves ever more clearly, more soberly, more compassionately aware of all that we still do not do well \u2014 then we Vancouverites can take a moment to raise our eyes out of the city to those towering highlands, to the crisp lattice of snow. We\u2019ll picture the cougars still prowling there, the swaying trees. We will see ourselves as if from a pebbly shore, a mirage trapped between what is above and below: a rolling, improvisatory work in progress.Advertisement"}

The cleanest.Our city generates a lot of trash. The Department of Sanitation collected 3,196,200 tons of residential trash (excluding recyclables) last year. That\u2019s around 749 pounds per New Yorker, or just over two pounds per resident per day.Inevitably, some of it ends up on the street.It\u2019s not hard to find a street strewn with garbage, whether it\u2019s on the shores of Brooklyn or on the blocks of the Upper East Side.We examined calls made last year to the 311 complaint line to find the blocks with the most reports of dirty conditions, which include things like messy streets and sidewalks, litter and dog waste.(Full disclosure: A small number of people, or one really annoyed person, can generate many complaints on a single instance of litter, so the \u201cmost\u201d superlative is not exactly scientific.)In 2016, the four corners on the intersection of Watson Avenue and Boynton Avenue in the Bronx were the subject of the most complaints to 311 about dirty conditions: 470, of the 865 complaints logged for the Top 10 most griped-about streets.As we walked those blocks in the Bronx this week, a plastic bag danced in the wind alongside a Linden\u2019s Butter Crunchers cookie bag. A bottle of Montebello Long Island Iced Tea lay half-empty in the gutter. Dogs did their business, and there was no cleanup afterward. Someone threw a spent firecracker out a window.\u201cI love the Bronx, but look, here\u2019s the thing: We\u2019re a little bit piggy,\u201d Wilson Ciprian, 41, a taxi driver who lives three blocks from the intersection, said in Spanish.\u201cIf I\u2019m driving and I don\u2019t want this bottle in my car, bam, I throw it out the window,\u201d he said in trying to explain why some may find it easy to litter. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity.\u201dWhen we met Kayla Santos, 23, who lives nearby, she was sipping from a bottle of Sprite.\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, like, when I\u2019m done with this I would have just dropped it on the floor,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, O.K., I\u2019m done.\u201dBut, she said, she had seen dirtier streets elsewhere.And she\u2019s right. Other top complained-about blocks in 2016 were in Queens and on Staten Island.Residents need to do their part in the cleanup effort, Ms. Santos said, \u201cincluding myself.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Meh.April is National Poetry Month.We know many of you are poets: We\u2019ve seen it in the comments you submit and in the emails you send.

{"Headline": "Weddings at the Pizza Parlor? That\u2019s Amore", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byVowsOn a recent chilly evening in Washington\u2019s Chinatown district, two young brides, one in baby pink and the other in white sequins, passed each other on the street outside a pizzeria.\u201cAre you guys getting married?\u201d the sequined bride, Rachel Wynn, called out to the other. \u201cI just did. It was great.\u201dThis particular promotion, to honor Pi Day and perhaps gin up some community good will, offered a free 60 minutes of cake, booze and pizza to couples impulsive enough to make the leap. But several of the couples who married there that day did not see it as a gimmick. They saw it as a way to get married without adding to their debt load. And the free pizza? Definitely a bonus.When a relative forwarded the pizzeria\u2019s email promotion to Ms. Wynn and Mr. Poms as a joke, the couple laughed. Then they quickly began to reconsider the expensive affair they had been hoping to hold for more than 200 friends and relatives, who live across the Washington area, and in Florida and Vermont. For a free wedding, they would need to cede control to the will of a pizza parlor, and their guest list would need to be drastically whittled to around 40 people. They crunched some numbers, and practicality eventually began to win them over.\u201cWe\u2019re millennials with student debt,\u201d said Mr. Poms, 29, who is a graduate student studying public health at the University of Maryland. \u201cWe treated it as a joke.\u201dHe paused. \u201cThen we treated it not so much as a joke.\u201d\u201cThere was just a lot of jerks right in a row,\u201d she said, recalling a particularly rough winter on the Washington dating scene. \u201cIf I had deleted my account properly I never would\u2019ve connected with him.\u201dThe date led to instant romance, with Mr. Poms admitting that he had a longstanding crush on Ms. Wynn. They were officially engaged on Jan. 8, after staging a series of engagement photos \u2014 one in front of a waterfall, one underwater, one while kayaking \u2014 during a vacation in Puerto Rico.Trusting the internet had worked out so far, they reasoned. So how bad could an online promotion for a free wedding be?The couple saw the promotion and thought they could have an unconventional ceremony while still keeping some traditional elements, Ms. Wynn said.They married in the upstairs event room of the pizzeria at 6:30 p.m., with the maximum allowed 40 guests. The couple did keep one or two traditional touches: They exchanged rings \u2014 a white gold band for Mr. Poms, and a white gold band with a cubic zirconia for Ms. Wynn. And Mr. Poms did not see Ms. Wynn until she walked into the room arm-in-arm with her parents, who are divorced but who supported the unconventional wedding plan, including the short guest list. As it turns out, getting married in between East Coast blizzards has its benefits.\u201cEvery time somebody\u2019s plane got canceled, she\u2019d move someone up the list,\u201d the bride\u2019s mother, Sandy Turman, said.Ms. Turman had knitted a black bolero that her daughter wore over her white sequined Badgley Mischka dress, a borrowed purchase from Rent the Runway. This was another testament to the couple\u2019s flexibility: Ms. Wynn\u2019s first choice, a strapless, floaty rental from Allison Parris, fell through at the last minute. Going with the flow felt a bit unnatural to Ms. Wynn, who is such a planner that, shortly after beginning to date Mr. Poms, she plugged his phone number into her younger brother\u2019s phone. \u201cDavid P. Future Brother-in-Law,\u201d the listing read.\u201cThis is just, for the record, not my personality,\u201d Ms. Wynn said of the rushed affair.During the short ceremony, the restaurant\u2019s sound system, which had been blasting Fetty Wap, was silenced. The couple read their own vows: \u201cI realize that my love is like Pi,\u201d Mr. Poms said to his bride at one point, \u201cbecause it goes on indefinitely.\u201dMarrying on Pi Day did not hold a particular significance to this couple, but earlier in the day, Rafael Hernandez, a 30-year-old law student, and Nyasha Hamilton, a 28-year-old database analyst for the District of Columbia Public Schools, pushed back their ceremony start so they could get married in front of their 20 guests at 3:14 p.m. on the dot. Ms. Hamilton is both a math major and an instructor for the local chapter of Women Who Code.During the six-minute wedding, Ms. Hamilton thanked her husband for always supporting her crazy ideas, \u201clike getting married at &pizza.\u201dThe pair, who grew up in Atlanta, did not always know they would end up getting married \u2014 especially here, in a pizza place, among displays of black-and-white calla lilies, custom-made pizzas and sprinkle-speckled Momofuku cakes, all provided gratis. The road to this ceremony took compromise, with Mr. Hernandez putting in for a transfer at his job as a project manager at a fabrication business to join Ms. Hamilton in Louisiana, where she finished a master\u2019s degree program in statistics at Louisiana State University.They are also high school sweethearts \u2014 their first date was at a pizzeria in Atlanta \u2014 but, wanting to be sure about each other, they took a short break from their romance along the way.\u201cIt didn\u2019t last very long,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said. \u201cAfter she finished her master\u2019s degree she said, \u2018You\u2019ve always wanted to be a lawyer. Go for it.\u2019\u201dThe couple moved to Washington together, and were engaged in mid-February. This meant their guests were mostly friends, including Mr. Hernandez\u2019s classmates from American University\u2019s law school, who could make it to the ceremony on short notice. But Latisha Hamilton, the bride\u2019s younger sister, traveled from Georgia for the occasion.\u201cI\u2019ve known him since I was 6 years old,\u201d the bride\u2019s sister said. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for them to get married for the longest time.\u201dColin Salazar, a friend of the couple\u2019s, met Ms. Hamilton while at Georgia State University and said he never thought he would see her after college. But Washington has a way of throwing all types of people from all kinds of places together again. He supported the couple\u2019s decision to have a weekday, midday wedding.\u201c\u2018Impulsive\u2019 has kind of a negative connotation to it,\u201d Mr. Salazar said. \u201cBut they just live their lives in the way that everybody should.\u201dPushing back an hourlong ceremony and reception by 14 minutes to honor Pi Day crunched their reception time. As their 3 p.m. slot ended, Ms. Hamilton, a calm bride who wore a Calvin Klein dress she found on a rack at Marshall\u2019s, was hastily cutting slices of cake for her guests with seven minutes left on the clock. The next stop, Ms. Hamilton said, was to go to a nearby tapas restaurant, La Tasca, \u201cand keep on celebrating\u201d over a few bottles of wine. For a honeymoon, the couple, who live in the Takoma section of Washington, said they were thinking about getting a hotel room somewhere downtown.As the couple left, passing another couple and their wedding party waiting in the hall, Ms. Hamilton said something about her husband and noticed how strange the word sounded on her tongue. Mr. Hernandez, standing amid gifts wrapped in polka-dot paper, did the same thing a few seconds later.\u201cThat was my first time saying it,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said of the W-word. \u201cI need a drink.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve probably eaten a whole pie today,\u201d Mr. Crytzer said.By the end of the day, as Mr. Crytzer was in what he called the \u201chomeward stretch,\u201d he prepared to greet Brandi Crawford, the bride in pink whom Ms. Wynn had greeted outside. Ms. Crawford, a 29-year-old social worker, had traveled to Washington from Chicago to marry her fianc\u00e9, Cody Jarrett, an opera singer. Their wedding was set for the last slot, scheduled for 8 p.m. The bride stood in the lobby of the pizza parlor, waiting for the rest of her guests to arrive and clutching a white ring pillow. The free ceremony had been a no-brainer for the couple, who, like the others, are grappling with student debt.\u201cWe\u2019ve been together for seven years and we\u2019ve been trying to plan,\u201d Ms. Crawford said. \u201cGod makes a way.\u201dShe made her way upstairs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Adventure (Try a Goat\u2019s Head?) Is Still on the Menu at Babbo", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.This was around 1999, a year after it had opened, when Babbo had few peers among Italian restaurants, serving unusual meats with a side of light decadence. In this classically simple Greenwich Village townhouse, an energetic and pleasure-seeking chef named Mario Batali wanted New Yorkers to try something new: a salad of truffled lamb\u2019s tongue; melting pink windowpanes of head cheese; triangles of beef-cheek-filled pasta in a sauce thickened by crushed squab livers. The strategy was to tempt us and dare us at the same time.Back then, Babbo funneled you toward giving up all restraint, right down to the wine pours, which were sold by thirds of a bottle instead of fifths. So when the chance to eat a goat\u2019s head was dangled before me, I saw it as the natural outgrowth of an entire philosophy of eating and drinking that I wanted to adopt as my own, at least for as long as it took to find out which parts of the face were good to eat (the sides) and which weren\u2019t (the eyes).From the restaurant\u2019s beginning, overbooking has been an issue. Even now, when reservations are not as much in demand, the bar is often crowded with people waiting to be seated.This narrow area is less a waiting room than an exercise studio. One recent night, three guests and I ducked and bobbed and turned every minute or so as somebody tried to squeeze through with a hot plate of food, or an empty chair, or an armful of coats. This lasted 30 minutes. We never got an apology, but we did get to work on our balance and core strength.What bothered me more than not hearing \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d was that nobody acted as though half an hour was an unusually long time to keep customers waiting.At the table, the style of service I got seemed to depend on whether I was there for the first or second seating. An early-evening dinner rolled along like a skateboard on new concrete, and the check came with the coffee. A meal that began after 8 p.m. was slow, even draggy, and at times it seemed we had dropped out of sight. Our sommelier was smart and engaging as he talked about a Sardinian red we were curious about (as ever, the all-Italian wine list is a mix of blue chips and underrated discoveries), but after decanting it, he was nowhere to be seen and our glasses stood empty.On another night, four people ordered appetizers, but only three of us got them.Mr. Batali discusses changes to the menu every week with Frank Langello, Babbo\u2019s executive chef since 2003. Mr. Langello\u2019s kitchen is run by professionals who seem to know by instinct when to take meat off the flame; even tricky ingredients like rabbit were faultlessly done. Given how many classic dishes are on the menu, the cooks could probably make half of them with their eyes closed. Sometimes you wonder if they do.I suspected that the salt had been left out of the soupy polenta served under Babbo\u2019s long-running (and still terrific) beef braised in red wine, the brasato al Barolo.A salad of lamb\u2019s tongue and browned beech mushrooms topped with a soft-cooked egg was nice. But the salad was warm and the egg was cold, so it was not as nice as it could have been. I felt the same way about a grilled guinea hen leg; it would have been easier to love if the skin hadn\u2019t been rubbery and damp.And a banana crostata could have been exceptional if its crust hadn\u2019t been soft and its flavors melded together, as if it had been made too early in the day.These glitches were far from catastrophic, but they were frustrating because I could usually imagine, or remember, just how good the dish was supposed to be.And with some recipes, there was no need to imagine. Babbo\u2019s pasta station can still turn out the hit singles with plenty of the old shimmy-shimmy-shake, like the beef-cheek ravioli or the \u201cmint love letters,\u201d parcels of minty lamb sausage under a bright tomato sauce.Some of Babbo\u2019s most exciting pastas stand on more delicate flavors. Goat cheese tortelloni, like little folded paper hats, were slithery with warm butter that was seasoned by dried orange peel and fennel pollen: lovely and transporting. And when the calendar said spring was here, the kitchen was ready with asparagus tossed with tender, slick fettuccine and brittle crinkles of saut\u00e9ed pancetta.Rebecca DeAngelis\u2019s desserts are memorable, too; that glum banana crostata was an outlier. The saffron panna cotta is seductively musky, its perfume offset by dried apricots soaked in passion fruit pur\u00e9e. And the friends with whom I shared the olive oil cake \u2014 a simple drum with a crisp top and a tender middle, splashed with a bright-green squiggle of peppery olive oil \u2014 still text me about once a day to ask if I remember how wonderful it was. I do.To say that Babbo\u2019s long suits are its pasta and desserts is just to praise those courses, not to diminish the others. Antipasti, like the steamed mussels poured with their garlic-laden juices over thick toast, or the octopus and just-tender borlotti beans in a fantastic, citrus-packed, lightly spicy limoncello vinaigrette, manage to be very active without seeming frantic.Mr. Batali and Mr. Langello work hard to chase boredom away, but they know when to stop, and you can see that in such main courses as the pork chop, so plump it could pass for a baby ham, with cherry peppers, or the lamb chops you could pick up by the bone if you didn\u2019t mind getting broccoli rabe pesto on your fingers.Still, I keep thinking about goat\u2019s head. In those early days, I knew Babbo could ace the weird stuff. I\u2019m not sure I trust the restaurant the same way today. Then again, I\u2019m not sure I want another goat\u2019s head, either.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}

Internet Policy Research Initiative, who was a technology policy official in the Obama administration.Broadband companies, privacy experts said, occupy a different position than internet companies. Google and Facebook, they noted, are corporate giants with plenty of market clout. But they are not a fundamental pathway to the internet the way the broadband providers are. And, privacy experts said, there is little or no competition for broadband service in many markets.\u201cYou can live without Google or Facebook,\u201d said Dallas Harris, a legal and policy fellow at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit consumer group. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty difficult to walk away from internet service altogether.\u201dThe privacy practices of internet companies are overseen by the Federal Trade Commission, while broadband providers fall under the F.C.C. Since the 1990s, the trade commission has policed the privacy practices of internet companies under its mandate to protect consumers from \u201cunfair and deceptive practices.\u201dThe F.T.C. requires internet companies to have privacy policies that the agency finds acceptable, and it conducts investigations into violations. Privacy advocates have criticized the trade commission for giving the companies too much freedom.\u201cIt is lightweight regulation, but there is a real enforcement backstop as well,\u201d Mr. Weitzner said.Broadband carriers all have privacy policies. They can be sued by private plaintiffs and investigated by Congress, as they were about a decade ago, when an intrusive surveillance technique of personal data trails, known as deep packet inspection, came to light.Yet Google and Facebook account for two-thirds of online ad revenue, and their share of the market is growing. \u201cThe challenge is that Google and Facebook dominate this market,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen & Company.The broadband suppliers have \u201cvaluable, anonymized profiles of users,\u201d Mr. Gallant said, adding, \u201cBut it\u2019s not clear what the size of the market for the raw data is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Light Noodles, Deep Flavor", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byCity KitchenIn Vietnam, the breakfast choice for many is a steaming bowl of brothy pho, purchased from early-morning vendors who dispense the beloved spicy noodle soup until their supply is sold out, then close up shop for the day.For lunch, it may well be noodles again, prepared in a different way. A bowl of room-temperature rice vermicelli, called bun, may be served with various cooked-to-order toppings and bright add-ons for a satisfying, simple meal. Festooned with lemongrass-scented shrimp, beef, pork or chicken, the noodles are flavored with nuoc cham (the classic sweet-and-spicy dipping sauce), pickled vegetables and crushed peanuts.The vital accompaniment to this rice noodle bowl, and many other Vietnamese dishes, is a platter of lettuce leaves and tender, fragrant fresh herbs.The herb mixture usually includes Thai basil, mint, cilantro, sawtooth culantro, Vietnamese coriander, fish herb, red perilla and dill, among other lemony, peppery, freshly picked and highly aromatic leaves.The lettuce leaves are often used as wrappers: One may fill a leaf with herbs, noodles and a bit of meat, roll it into a tight bundle and give it a quick dip in nuoc cham before conveying it mouthward.A less formal alternative is to incorporate the lettuce and herbs from the beginning. For example, start with a pile of torn lettuce leaves and herbs in the bottom of each bowl. Add the room-temperature noodles and toppings, then let guests give it a toss with their chopsticks. This gives it a bit more of a saladlike feel.As far as the cooking of the rice noodles is concerned, choose the technique you like best. I prefer letting them steep in a pot of boiling-hot water for five to eight minutes, until just done. Others recommend soaking them in hot tap water, which works, too, but takes a little longer. And then there are the cooks who prefer to boil them like pasta. In any case, for best results, they must be rinsed in cold water once drained to keep them from becoming mushy or sticky.Healthy, light and packed with mouthwatering flavor, a rice noodle bowl like this one is easy to love.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Says China Will Get Better Trade Deal if It Solves \u2018North Korean Problem\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, frustrated by China\u2019s inaction on North Korea, opened the door on Tuesday to concessions on his trade agenda with Beijing in exchange for greater Chinese support in pressuring Pyongyang. In doing so, he lashed together two sharply different issues in an already complex relationship.Mr. Trump\u2019s threat rattled nerves in South Korea, where the government reassured the public that the United States would not launch an attack without first consulting Seoul. But the American president\u2019s suggestion of a grand bargain with Beijing crystallized his quandary in dealing with North Korea.Only China, with its vast economic leverage over its reclusive neighbor, can realistically force a change in the behavior of North Korea\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong-un. Yet despite its own rising frustration with Mr. Kim, the Chinese government has so far been unwilling to tighten the vise on him.President Xi Jinping of China did not offer Mr. Trump any public commitments on North Korea or trade when they held their first meeting last week at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s club in Palm Beach, Fla. Even in private conversations, officials said, the Chinese leader was noncommittal.\u201cHe\u2019s clearly groping for leverage over China,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a former top China adviser to President Barack Obama who is now head of Asia research at Eurasia Group.But Mr. Medeiros added: \u201cLinking such distinct issues seldom works because each involves different actors and different interests in each system. Linkage can also be counterproductive by reinforcing China\u2019s worst instincts.\u201d\u201cThe last thing we want to see is a nuclear North Korea that threatens the coast of the United States, or, for that matter, any other country,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said Tuesday. \u201cWe need stability in that region, and I think he has put them on notice.\u201dWith anxiety and rumormongering rife among South Koreans, officials in Seoul said the United States would never attack the North without first consulting the South Korean government.\u201cThe United States makes it clear that it will not take a new policy or measure without consultations with us,\u201d Cho June-hyuck, a spokesman of the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said Tuesday.Moon Jae-in, a leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, issued his own warning against the possibility of an American pre-emptive strike carried out unilaterally. \u201cThe safety of South Korea is as important as that of the United States,\u201d he said in a Facebook post. \u201cThere should never be a pre-emptive strike without South Korean consent.\u201dMr. Moon is a leading contender, vying with another opposition leader, Ahn Cheol-soo, for the May 9 election to choose the successor to former President Park Geun-hye.\u201cNeighboring countries are taking advantage of the absence of a president in South Korea to try to exclude us and handle issues on the Korean Peninsula according to their own understanding,\u201d Mr. Moon said, without blaming the Trump administration by name.In his first concrete move on trade with China, Mr. Trump is preparing an executive order in coming weeks targeting countries that dump steel into the American market, a measure that would be aimed mainly at Beijing.But it is not yet clear which side has the initiative in the evolving debate over trade. During his meeting with Mr. Xi, administration officials said, Mr. Trump warned that China needed to address its yawning trade imbalance with the United States immediately. But the Chinese did not bring any trade-related gestures to the meeting, as many experts expected.Instead, they countered with the 100-day plan. While Mr. Trump embraced the idea, the commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross, noted that the plan would have \u201cway stations\u201d to measure progress, suggesting the White House was not willing to wait the full 100 days for results.Mr. Spicer said that deploying a carrier strike force to the region would act as a deterrent, as well as give the president more options. For Mr. Trump, however, an attack on North Korea would be a far riskier undertaking than the strike on Syria, given the North\u2019s nuclear arsenal, fleet of missiles and proximity to huge population centers in South Korea.It is also clear that North Korea has no intention of forsaking nuclear arms. Top officials gathered in Pyongyang on Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of Mr. Kim\u2019s election as leader of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, and vowed to uphold his policy of strengthening the North\u2019s nuclear arsenal.Also on Tuesday, Ri Su-yong, a Politburo member, former foreign minister and adviser and childhood mentor to Mr. Kim, was given another powerful position in Parliament. Last year, Mr. Ri, 82, told Chinese officials that North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons expansion was \u201cpermanent.\u201dChoe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wine Industry Finds a Companion in a Competitor: Marijuana", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byThe PourLegal intoxication is big business and getting bigger. More states have legalized marijuana, leading some in the alcohol industry to regard it as a threat to their profit margin.The fine wine industry, however, has not panicked. Despite occasional efforts to pit wine and weed against each other, many in the wine business exude an air of mellow acceptance that the two substances can coexist in harmony.\u201cWe haven\u2019t actually seen anybody who\u2019s laying down their glass of wine to pick up a bong,\u201d Ms. Caputo said. \u201cThere\u2019s room in people\u2019s lives for both.\u201dWhat brings consumers of cannabis (the marijuana industry\u2019s preferred term) together with lovers of wine, craft beer and artisanal spirits is a sense of connoisseurship.The idea that alcohol and marijuana are in competition comes from those whose primary reason for drinking is inebriation. These are the people who are more likely to trade one intoxicant for another.This is not to dismiss the buzz factor of wine. Many people begin to explore wine, beer and spirits out of curiosity about alcohol, and for some, the reason to drink will mostly be the chemical effect.For others, different considerations take precedence as they explore beer, spirits and wine. How does it smell and taste? How does it go with food? What were the grapes? Where did they come from? Who made the wine and what is their history? How does it express culture?This sort of curiosity leads eventually to discourse, by which I emphatically do not mean stuffy snobbery and phony mastery,but rather discernment: the ability to notice differences and express preferences.Marijuana inspires a similar conversation.\u201cI can tell you just as the side effect of wine is the high, so too is it with weed, although the experience is different,\u201d he said in an email recently.\u201cThere are different flavors and bouquets to good weed, and different strains that elicit different effects,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are real body highs, and real stony highs, and there are highs that are cerebral and ethereal. There are levels of socializing that can be enhanced or inhibited, depending on the strength and the amount you smoke.\u201dHimself a bridge between the two worlds, Mr. Coturri sees marijuana as a complement to wine rather than a competitor. Many in the wine industry are ardent fans.\u201cOur world revolves around intoxicants, but it also revolves around flavor,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as we look at wine, we might look at a bud and dissect its aroma and characteristics.\u201dLike wine, marijuana is an agricultural product, and where it is grown can determine its character.\u201cHow you grow it really affects the flavor and the high of the pot,\u201d Mr. Coturri said. \u201cIf it\u2019s grown in a greenhouse, it\u2019ll be a lot different than if it\u2019s grown in the hills. It thrives in certain soils and with a long growing season.\u201dJust as with wine, the marijuana industry is diverging, Mr. Coturri said, between inexpensive plants grown in quantity indoors or hydroponically, and marijuana that, like good wine, has a sense of place.\u201cThere is going to be a high-end marijuana industry, with distinctive strains and distinctive effects,\u201d Mr. Coturri said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll have your \u2018Walmart pot,\u2019 your \u2018Yellow Tail of pot\u2019 that will be insipid.\u201dHe sees artisanal cannabis as a growth industry, evolving as craft beer did, with new strains and hybrids developed by visionary farmers.Marijuana, like wine, has the ability to articulate its terroir, Mr. Coturri said, adding that cannabis growers have already inquired about creating the equivalent of American Viticultural Areas, a system of appellations for wine-growing regions with common characteristics.Mr. Coturri spoke of the many similarities between wine lovers and marijuana lovers, who may discuss the differences between the indica and sativa species of pot. Indica tends to have more exotic aromas and is more relaxing, almost like a sedative, while sativa, with its greener, almost piney flavor, offers a more active, productive high. Some prefer marijuana that is young and fresh, while others like it aged, or cured, storing it in humidors.As for competition, Mr. Coturri said he had not experienced it, except possibly in the hiring of seasonal workers for harvests. He attributed the labor shortage more to fears among immigrants stoked by the Trump administration than to the marijuana industry, which he says is hiring roughly the same number of workers for harvest that it has for years, regardless of legalization.\u201cI see marijuana growing as something underground that is coming to the forefront,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a companion piece. I don\u2019t see competition with the wine industry at all.\u201dI\u2019m not a marijuana enthusiast, and I\u2019ve never tried CannaWine. But I have tried several winemakers\u2019 weed wines, and I can attest that the high is indeed gentle, and the flavor herbal.Advertisement"}

But lately, as with most any gathering place around here since late January \u2014 the checkout line, the liquor store, the park nearby where losing lottery numbers are pressed into the mulch \u2014 patrons have found occasion to project their angst outward, second-guessing a November wager.\u201cJust like any other damn president,\u201d sighed Theresa Remington, 44, a home-care worker and the mother of two active-duty Marines, scraping at an unlit cigarette. She had voted for Donald J. Trump because she expected him to improve conditions for veterans and overhaul the health care system. Now?\u201cPolitical bluster,\u201d Ms. Remington said, before making another run at the quarter slots. She wondered aloud how Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont might have fared in the job.But it is here, among voters in one of the nation\u2019s few true tossup districts, where any lasting strain may be felt most acutely.In consecutive presidential elections, Pennsylvania\u2019s Eighth District, which includes Bucks County and pockets of Montgomery County, has delivered Republican nominees their narrowest margins of victory in a congressional district. Mitt Romney won it by one-tenth of a point in 2012. Mr. Trump prevailed by two-tenths, attracting many of the relatively affluent and educated white suburban voters who were expected to lift Hillary Clinton, last year\u2019s Democratic candidate.The result is a patch of purple political terrain \u2014 specked with tree-lined blocks, sprawling estates and multiplying recovery houses \u2014 that looks much like the rest of a bitterly divided country, sorting itself generally into three camps: those with regrets about supporting Mr. Trump, those without them and those who cannot believe anyone supported him in the first place.\u201cNo one wants to be wrong,\u201d said Brian Mock, 33, a tattoo artist in Levittown, Pa., and a Trump skeptic. \u201cIt\u2019s seeing a house on fire and saying, \u2018That house isn\u2019t on fire.\u2019 It is very clearly on fire.\u201dYet interviews with voters across the district suggest a nuanced view of a president getting his sea legs. Many still trust him, but wonder why his deal-making instincts do not seem to be translating. They admire his zeal, but are occasionally baffled by his tweets. They insist he will be fine, but suggest gently that maybe Vice President Mike Pence should assume a more expansive role.Perhaps most forcefully, they question when they will begin to see more of that word they were promised, the outcome that voters were supposed to be \u201csick and tired of\u201d by now, in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign estimation.Winning.\u201cIt\u2019s not what he\u2019s done, it\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to do,\u201d said Bill Yokobosky IV, 33, a train engineer from Langhorne, Pa., who was waiting for a haircut at a strip mall. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t succeeded, really.\u201dLike many colleagues from his rail union, Mr. Yokobosky defied leadership wishes in voting for Mr. Trump. He does not regret it, and he is eager to defend the president against the \u201cnit-picking\u201d of opponents, particularly over any links to Russia. But he has come to consider the perils of a commander in chief plainly \u201ctrying to learn on the fly.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s fighting himself and he\u2019s fighting Washington,\u201d Mr. Yokobosky said. \u201cThey\u2019re just trying to get settled in there.\u201dMr. Trump is not the only newcomer getting acclimated. The district\u2019s congressman is Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a former F.B.I. agent whose brother Mike won, lost and reclaimed the seat over the past dozen years before stepping aside in January.But Mr. Fitzpatrick has gained little traction, at least so far, on a pet issue: redistricting reform. \u201cWe need more districts like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bellwether.\u201dSome critics of the president seem to hope so, describing a change in at least a handful of Trump-supporting neighbors recently: a humbling in the face of his stumbles, among voters who used to gloat.\u201cThey\u2019ve quieted down,\u201d said Doug Meginley, the manager at Positively Records in Levittown, perched beside an Elvis mask, a Vanilla Fudge drumhead and a Monkees-themed tambourine. \u201cThe Trump supporters know.\u201dAt the same time, many in the area have made a point of reinforcing their loyalty, letting bumper stickers linger and Facebook posts bloom.In December, some traveled west to Hershey, Pa., for a stop on Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cthank you\u201d tour.Patricia Poprik, the chairwoman of the Bucks County Republican Committee, brought her two granddaughters, one of whom had requested a meeting with Mr. Trump as a Christmas gift.\u201cHe goes, \u2018Girls, you gotta do better than that,\u2019\u201d Ms. Poprik recalled of the presidential greeting backstage.Holding forth last week at the committee\u2019s stately headquarters in Doylestown, Ms. Poprik said many residents who initially feared publicly identifying as Trump voters had unmasked themselves since the election.She acknowledged some \u201cglitches\u201d early on, including Mr. Trump\u2019s halting progress on key campaign promises. But she remained broadly supportive.\u201cHe thought he could go faster. I knew he couldn\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Poprik said from her office, which includes a talking George W. Bush doll; two Trump-branded water bottles; and several hundred elephant-themed trinkets. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get your rhythm.\u201dMany seem inclined to give him the space. Last month, hundreds gathered in frigid temperatures at a park in Bensalem for an event without the president, or any marquee speakers, simply to say they had his back.\u201cIt\u2019s really disheartening what they\u2019re putting him through,\u201d said Jeanne Maher, 66, from Langhorne, whose husband, a bonsai artist, affixed a \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d sticker to his motorcycle during the campaign.That message is gone now, but they have not removed a campaign lawn sign. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take it down.\u201dOther local displays have been maintained less happily.Mike Mallon, 42, who owns a custom printing company in Bensalem, has kept a sign in front of his home since shortly before the election, positioning it now beside two small American flags and beneath a porch that includes two headless mannequins.\u201cWORRY,\u201d the poster reads simply. He had hoped to take it down in November.Then there is the rendering Mr. Mallon created himself, a canvas depicting the outlines of Mr. Trump\u2019s face, barbed wire, a border wall and a pile of ironic trophies.

Intrepid, the decommissioned aircraft carrier on the West Side of Manhattan, according to Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. There he will meet with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia to commemorate the 75th anniversary of a naval battle the countries fought alongside one another during World War II.And the city, where protests against Trump policies have erupted in parks, airports, schools, churches, synagogues, mosques, museums, restaurants and streets, to name just a few locations, is girding for what, in the inflamed atmosphere, may be a battle of its own.\u201cThe mayor embraces this as an opportunity to remind the president that New York is the greatest city in the world because of, not in spite of, our diversity and inclusiveness,\u201d said Eric Phillips, a mayoral spokesman.

Let the whole entire city stand up against him! I think he would go right down the middle of the street just as normal.\u201dThe township is still waiting to be reimbursed by the federal government for those earlier stays, when it spent $300,000, drafting some of its 16-member police force to help protect Mr. Trump, according to Bedminster\u2019s part-time mayor, Steven E. Parker, a Republican who owns a local airport.The 500-acre golf course sits behind an iron gate on winding Lamington Road, surrounded by horse farms. And while Mr. Trump won the township by a slim margin of about 40 votes, the mayor does not expect the same sort of demonstrations for which the city is bracing. \u201cI am sure there will be a lot of curiosity seekers, but as I look at the lay of the land in Bedminster, we are not like New York City,\u201d Mr. Parker said.Over the iron gates of the golf club, there is little to see, and few but neighboring horses to pay a demonstrator much attention. \u201cIf you want to protest, you want to be seen,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong, but I don\u2019t see a great venue that would be effective if you were somebody who wanted to put up signs that either you love him or don\u2019t love him.\u201dIn Manhattan, some merchants said Mr. Trump had already been bad for business, even without setting foot in Trump Tower.At Il Tinello, a restaurant just south of Trump Tower, sales dropped by 30 percent when Mr. Trump was in residence as president-elect, with customers turned off by crowds and congestion, said the owner, John Go\u00e7i.

He has donated to the museum, and landed his helicopter on the flight deck during an episode of his reality television show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d said Bill White, a former president of the museum. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to hear he\u2019s visiting and bringing awareness to the Intrepid yet again,\u201d Mr. White, who is a major Democratic Party fund-raiser, said in an email. \u201cThere\u2019s no bigger honor than having the president of the United States come to visit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everything You Need to Know About the Met Gala 2017", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayUnofficially, the night\u2019s festivities have been called many things, including \u201cthe party of the year,\u201d \u201cthe Oscars of the East Coast\u201d (mostly because of the star quotient and the elaborate red carpet, in which guests pose on the grand entrance stairs to the museum) and, somewhat pointedly, \u201can A.T.M. for the Met,\u201d the last by the publicist Paul Wilmot.85 PhotosWhy is it called the party of the year?Ms. Wintour, the editor of American Vogue and the artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast, took over as chairwoman of the gala in 1999. Since then, she has been instrumental in transforming a local philanthropic event into the ultimate global celebrity/power cocktail: Take a jigger of famous names from fashion, add film, politics and business, and mix. It\u2019s such a heady combo that President Trump proposed to his wife, Melania, during the gala in 2004. (In case you are wondering: No, they are not expected this year.) It is among the hardest party tickets of the year to get \u2014 and thus, intensely coveted.What\u2019s so important about Rei Kawakubo? Who is she?Besides, know this: She also runs a multimillion-dollar international business full of lots of wearable stuff, and collaborates regularly with Nike and Speedo. If you ever see someone in a blue and white striped T-shirt with a google-eyed heart logo on the breast, that is one of hers. So are all the Dover Street Markets around the world.25 PhotosHow much does the gala cost?Tickets this year are $30,000 apiece, and tables are about $275,000. The party and exhibition are sponsored, so all of the money from ticket sales goes to the Costume Institute. Last year, approximately $13.5 million was raised. In past years, there was one main corporate underwriter per show, alongside Ms. Wintour\u2019s employer, Cond\u00e9 Nast. Last year it was Apple, but this year the burden is being divided among Apple, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Farfetch, H & M and Maison Valentino.Of course, not everyone pays for a ticket. Brands often invite celebrities to sit at their table, and Ms. Wintour also often invites up-and-coming designers who may not be able to afford a ticket and scatters them around the event.How many people attend?Last year, about 600. This year, a spokeswoman for the museum said it wanted to keep it more \u201cintimate\u201d and \u201cprivate,\u201d so the number will be slightly lower.So if I can afford a ticket, can I go?Dream on. Unlike other cultural fund-raisers, like the New York City Ballet gala or the Frick Collection Young Fellows Ball, the Met gala is invitation-only, and there is a waiting list to get on the list. Qualifications for inclusion have to do with buzz and achievement (and beauty) more than money. Ms. Wintour has final say over every invitation and attendee, which means that even if a company buys a table, it cannot choose everyone who sits at its table: It must clear the guest with her and Vogue.43 PhotosO.K., you\u2019re saying I can\u2019t go. So why should I care?Speaking of outfits, do attendees have to dress in theme?All of that may pale, however, compared with what we will see this year. Why? Because, in honor of Ms. Kawakubo\u2019s own desire to push boundaries \u2014 this has resulted in dresses that sprouted lumps and bumps on odd parts off the body, dresses that turned women into flat-packed paper dolls and dresses that turned wedding dresses into cages \u2014 guests are being encouraged to think \u201cavant-garde.\u201d Just ruminate on that for a moment.Generally, it is advisable to play it safe and get really, really dressed up. Ms. Kawakubo herself almost always wears a long pleated skirt, white shirt and leather motorcycle jacket. It\u2019s unclear if even this black-tie event will be any different.What about celebrities?Ms. Kawakubo is famous for not playing the celebrity game, but Lady Gaga and Ms. Perry have both worn her clothes in the past. This year, you can also expect a fair amount of Valentino, given that the company is an underwriter. For the last few years, Beyonc\u00e9 has made the final entrance, but since she is about to have twins, she may well be sitting this one out. Which means the race to take her place in that power position will be something to see.How long has this been going on?The publicist Eleanor Lambert started the gala in 1948 as a typical philanthropic endeavor for the great and good of New York society. Pat Buckley, the wife of the conservative pundit William F. Buckley Jr., took over as chairwoman in 1979, but it has morphed into its current form only since the turn of the millennium. Ms. Wintour now oversees every detail, down to timed entrances for guests.What happens when guests get inside?It\u2019s a secret! For the past two years, posting on social media has been banned after the red carpet. What I can tell you is this: There is a receiving line inside with the hosts, and guests have to file by and air-kiss them. Then they tour the exhibition on their way to the cocktail party, so they are at least theoretically forced to see the culture. After cocktails, they are called in to dinner, and there is always some form of entertainment. (Last year, it was the Weeknd.) This is good, because as the red carpet part of the evening has become a giant marketing event \u2014 live streamed on a variety of sites and shown on E!, just like the Oscars \u2014 the fact that the main part of the event is private allows guests to relax and have fun.Or so they tell me.This article is an update of a column that appeared in 2016.Advertisement"}

Mr. Pai said that he agreed with the broad principles of net neutrality but that the rules, created by the commission in 2015, went too far in restricting broadband providers.\u201cI think they were appreciative,\u201d Mr. Pai said of the tech companies. \u201cI have been soliciting thoughts on online protections.\u201dMr. Pai said on Thursday that he wanted to overturn the declaration of broadband as a utility-like service, which puts stricter rules on broadband providers, akin to what phone services face today.Facebook and Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Pai\u2019s remarks. The Internet Association, a trade group that represents Facebook, Google and Netflix, recently met with Mr. Pai and urged him to keep the rules intact.A Cisco spokeswoman said Mr. Pai had asked the company\u2019s chief executive, Chuck Robbins, to gather some Silicon Valley leaders to discuss the future of net neutrality. The informal discussion was held at Cisco\u2019s campus in San Jose, Calif., the spokeswoman said.In a statement, Oracle said its discussion with Mr. Pai this week was broad and did not address any specific policy proposals currently under consideration. Oracle has previously said it supports Mr. Pai\u2019s agenda, and its meetings with him have included one with the company\u2019s chief executive, Safra Catz, who was on Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team.The commission\u2019s direction under Mr. Pai has alarmed consumer groups.

{"Headline": "Hunt for Facebook Killer Ends With McDonald\u2019s Sighting and a Suicide", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byThe search for Steve W. Stephens had spread across a wide area of the country, with apparently false sightings reported in eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, Indiana, Michigan and even Texas. But he ended his life near Erie, Pa., about 100 miles from Cleveland, where on Sunday he walked up to a stranger, Robert Godwin Sr., fatally shot him, and then posted the video for the world to see.Driving a white Ford Fusion sedan, Mr. Stephens, 37, pulled into the drive-through lane of a McDonald\u2019s on Buffalo Road around 11 a.m. and bought a 20-piece order of Chicken McNuggets and a large order of French fries for $5.35, Henry Sayers, the restaurant manager, said in an interview. After a worker recognized Mr. Stephens, the restaurant staff tried to stall him by holding on to his fries while calling the police.\u201cBut he just took his nuggets and said, \u2018I have to go,\u2019 and he drove off,\u201d Mr. Sayers said, adding that Mr. Stephens did not speed away but left the restaurant at a normal clip.The suicide of the gunman, who had no criminal record, left investigators with no ready explanation for the story. In his video, he said he was looking for someone to kill and settled on Mr. Godwin apparently at random. He demanded that his victim say the name of Mr. Stephens\u2019s girlfriend and added, \u201cShe\u2019s the reason this is about to happen to you.\u201dIn another video he posted, he said that he had killed multiple people, but the police said there was only one known victim. He later spoke with the police by phone, although officials have not revealed what was said.\u201cWe would like to have brought Steve in peacefully, and really talk to him and find out exactly why this happened, because there might be other people out there in similar situations that we can help,\u201d said Calvin D. Williams, the Cleveland police chief.The killing, and Mr. Stephens\u2019s flight, set off intense news coverage, widespread fear and a vast hunt involving the F.B.I., the United States Marshals Service, and several state and local police agencies. Investigators had picked up a \u201cping\u201d from his cellphone near Erie on Sunday and had searched the area without success, Chief Williams said.Upon learning of Mr. Stephens\u2019s suicide, \u201cthere was a mixture of sadness and relief\u201d at the organization, Ms. Kortemeyer said.Debbie Godwin, one of the victim\u2019s six daughters, said in an interview: \u201cWe are not happy about the outcome because we would\u2019ve preferred that he turned himself in and paid the penalty for taking my father\u2019s life. We forgave him, but even the Bible says the law is the law. Him dying serves us no purpose.\u201dIn news conferences, officials took what Clinton Van Zandt, a former F.B.I. profiler and negotiator, called \u201ca softer, velvet glove\u201d approach to Mr. Stephens, appealing to him to turn himself in while trying not to provoke him. They referred to him as \u201cSteve,\u201d avoided harsh comments on his actions, and said his family and friends were waiting to hear from him.That the chase ended in suicide was no surprise to manhunt experts, given Mr. Stephens\u2019s behavior. According to news reports, he was a gambler who struggled with debts, had recently been evicted from an apartment for failure to pay rent and, on his video, he described himself as having lost everything.Mr. Stephens had not taken steps to cover his tracks that other fugitives have done, like discarding his cellphone, changing vehicles or traveling far from home. Even the killing, Mr. Van Zandt said, \u201cwas, I think, an impulsive act and that his escape may not be as thought-out.\u201dIn the end, it was a simple trip through a McDonald\u2019s drive-through that brought the manhunt to a close. \u201cI think we interacted with him for like 15 seconds,\u201d said Mr. Sayers, the manager.Officials did not immediately say whether the restaurant employees would collect the $50,000 reward for information leading to Mr. Stephens\u2019s capture.Daniel Victor, Frances Robles and Richard A.

{"Headline": "A Referee Marches On (Much to Kentucky Fans\u2019 Chagrin)", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byAfter Higgins worked North Carolina\u2019s round of 8 win over Kentucky last month, some Kentucky fans \u2014 furious about calls he made that they felt denied the Wildcats a victory \u2014 reportedly issued death threats against him and inundated the Facebook page of his Omaha-based roofing business with digital graffiti.This was not arbitrary. In college basketball, the teams are not the only ones that compete over a regular season and then are funneled into the N.C.A.A. tournament until only the best of the best remain. According to J. D. Collins, the N.C.A.A.\u2019s national coordinator of officiating, he and a group of regional advisers review more than 560 regular-season games to determine the 100 officials asked to work the tournament each year. Those officials advance to ensuing rounds by their meticulously reviewed performances in the tournament itself.\u201cJohn\u2019s regional performance justified this,\u201d Collins said, referring to his Final Four assignment. Collins added that the N.C.A.A. \u201cwent above and beyond\u201d to provide Higgins and his family with extra security in light of the circumstances. (An inquiry made on Sunday to Higgins through his business was not returned.)\u201cNobody\u2019s harder on officials than me, but I feel sorry for them,\u201d said Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo, who like everyone else interviewed for this article said that the reaction from some Kentucky partisans was beyond the pale.\u201cI always brag that we have the classiest fans in the country,\u201d Calipari wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure we remain that way even after a tough loss.\u201dCollege referees encounter frequently altered rules: In just the last few years, the men\u2019s shot clock has been shortened; the restricted area underneath the basket has been enlarged; and foul definitions, including the highly subjective block/charge distinction, have been modified. They also must officiate games featuring disparate styles and talent levels.\u201cA lot of these guys have got two jobs,\u201d Izzo said. (To wit: Higgins\u2019s roofing business, whose website is rooferees.com.)Collins, formerly a referee, disputed that college referees were overworked, telling reporters on Sunday in a round-table discussion that he felt his best years as an official were the ones when he devoted himself to basketball full time. He also said that the N.C.A.A. had examined making its men\u2019s basketball referees full-time employees, but that the costs, at least in the short term, appeared prohibitive. Absent that status, referees must align themselves with a conference (or more) and create their own busy schedules.But there is no panacea for fans\u2019 being upset at referees.\u201cYou know going into this business,\u201d said Ed Hightower, a retired college basketball referee who was the prime subject of Bob Katz\u2019s 2015 book, \u201cThe Whistleblower.\u201d \u201cAnd you know as you evolve into the face of college basketball \u2014 because you\u2019ve earned that right to work those huge games, as John Higgins has \u2014 you know going in that what you have to do in your mind is not allow that criticism to impact you.\u201dHe added, \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s more important to be fair and honest and have integrity than to be worried about what someone is going to say about you.\u201dTrends in the game and in its presentation to the public have conspired to increase scrutiny on referees, however. Replays are better, and more numerous, and echo chambers like Twitter can circulate and amplify complaints at lightning speed.\u201cIt\u2019s like this storm \u2014 the more games, the more visibility, therefore the more people think that they can \u2018know\u2019 them,\u201d St. Joseph\u2019s Coach Phil Martelli said. \u201cAnd then you mix in the volatility of social media, and it\u2019s not healthy.\u201dIzzo added, \u201cWhen you have 73 different television angles and an official doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ve made it worse on them.\u201dOf course, like politics, all complaining about referees is local. Collins said that during one season he worked as a referee, Gene Keady, the former longtime Purdue coach, was 2-9 in games Collins had officiated. (That, Collins acknowledged, is more of one team\u2019s games than any referee should work.) The next season, the Boilermakers were 6-1 in Collins\u2019s games, prompting Keady to compliment Collins on his improved craft.But working the refs is one of the sports world\u2019s oldest professions.\u201cI\u2019ve held a grudge since 1981 against a referee,\u201d North Carolina Coach Roy Williams said on Sunday, declining to name his perceived archenemy.But, he added, in reference to Higgins: \u201cWe are playing a game. We are providing entertainment. And for it to go to that extent to a very good referee, who has had a very good career, that was pretty harsh.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Canada, Where Muslims Are Few, Group Stirs Fear of Islamists", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byWithin a month, they had 15,000 followers. Today, the number has surpassed 50,000, and the group is still attracting people. Now, Mr. Beaudry and his colleagues say they are shaping those followers into dues-paying members who will give the group financial muscle and, they hope, political clout.Nowhere has it galvanized such large numbers as in Quebec, where many people still refer to themselves as pure laine, or pure wool, direct descendants of the 17th-century settlers of New France. The most emotional response has focused on conservative Muslim immigrants, who perhaps present the greatest contrast to traditional European-based culture and the secularism that Quebec struggled hard to win from the Roman Catholic Church.Nonetheless, Mr. Beaudry and his peers say they believe there is a real threat that Islamists are bending Canada\u2019s tolerant culture to their will. The group\u2019s main concern is political Islam pushed by the Muslim Brotherhood, the Pan-Arab movement that grew out of Egypt after the fall of the Ottoman Empire following World War I.\u201cPolitical Islam is slowly invading our institutions,\u201d Mr. Beaudry declared, claiming that his group had documentary proof, though he was not prepared to show it. \u201cWe have to wake up people and shake them up, and then we will be able to bring change.\u201dThe theme is popular among right-wing groups across North America and Europe, where the slow integration of conservative Muslim immigrants into Judeo-Christian cultures has excited fears among some of a global culture war.A 2004 move to set up Shariah mediation for Muslim family disputes in Ontario, which already allowed Jewish and Catholic faith-based tribunals to operate in the province, incited a national outcry.Quebec subsequently passed a law banning Shariah tribunals. Ontario eventually banned faith-based tribunals for all religions. Nonetheless, the events left an impression among many people that conservative Muslims were working to instill Shariah law in Canada.Canadian Muslims say that not only are such fears unfounded, but that propagating them is also dangerous, to Muslims and to society as a whole.\u201cThey are creating a problem where there is no problem,\u201d said Hassan Guillet, a lawyer and imam.Mr. Guillet said Canadian Muslims were caught between what he called a relentless and often-negative media focus on Islam and right-wing groups like La Meute that spread misinformation.\u201cIf you keep rejecting the young, they will feel frustrated and feel that they don\u2019t belong, and they will look for their own society,\u201d Mr. Guillet warned, adding that such disenfranchisement had led some young European Muslims down the path of radicalization. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that. We want our kids to feel that they belong, we want our kids to feel Canadian.\u201dAs for the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood in Canada, Samer Majzoub, president of the Canadian Muslim Forum and a frequent target of conspiracy theories, called it simple fearmongering.Small, violent right-wing groups have appeared in the decades since Canada relaxed its immigration laws to embrace multiculturalism. But revulsion toward violence and hate speech has kept such groups on the margins. La Meute has created a more moderate setting where people can communicate their fears.\u201cLa Meute is very different from what we have seen so far,\u201d said Samuel Tanner, an associate professor at the International Center for Comparative Criminology at the University of Montreal who studies Canada\u2019s far right.He likened the group\u2019s followers to the blue-collar Democrats in the United States who supported President Trump. \u201cThey are a new type of right, blending conservatism with some liberal values,\u201d he said.The conversation within La Meute\u2019s private Facebook page can border on hateful. In response to one person\u2019s request about what could be done to prevent construction of a mosque in the neighborhood, another follower suggested pouring pig\u2019s blood on the ground and letting Muslims know the land had been desecrated.He said that the primary goal in founding La Meute was to educate members and others about the growth of political Islam in Canada.Mr. Beaudry spoke specifically about the group\u2019s opposition to the niqab and the burqa, Islamic styles of dress that cover women\u2019s faces.

{"Headline": "A Label That Fostered Mexican Cumbia Gets Its Own Shout-Out", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Elsa Miriam Escobar, a 47-year-old D.J., surveyed the crowd on a recent Wednesday night at La Cita, a downtown Mexican dive bar here. A cluster of twirling couples danced to a cumbia beat under the low-slung ceiling, while onlookers clutched bottles of Victoria beer. Some slipped notes to the D.J. scribbled on napkins, but they weren\u2019t requests.Ms. Escobar typed up their contents and held up the list for another D.J., Jorge Ariano (known as Sonidero Rumbandela), who used CD players and a laptop to juggle the steady, propulsive beat of guacharaca and g\u00fciro punctuated with accordion, guitar and bass. \u201cUn saludo [a shout-out] to Jos\u00e9, another to Adriana!\u201d he read in Spanish, in the commanding voice of a master of ceremonies.The call-outs to specific people, either at the bar or watching online via Facebook Live, never stopped, nearly drowning out the music. While such constant banter would frustrate dancers in some club settings, this microphone chatter is expected in the world of Mexican cumbia sonidera.With the largest Mexican community in the United States, the Los Angeles area is cumbia sonidera culture\u2019s nerve center north of the border. The city\u2019s dance hall Salon Lazaros packs in up to 4,000 every weekend, and house parties blast cumbia from Compton to Boyle Heights.During the party at La Cita last week, this flourishing cross-border music scene celebrated one of its most prolific purveyors, Discos Barba Azul. From 2006 to 2013, this one-man independent label, run by Vicente Pedraza, released about 150 CD recordings. A baker\u2019s dozen of Barba Azul\u2019s best are now available on vinyl, cassette and MP3 via a compilation called \u201c\u00a1Un Saludo! \u2014 Mexican Soundsystem Cumbia in LA.\u201d It will be released Friday by the New York digital club music label Dutty Artz and the Portland, Ore., imprint Songs From Home, a new joint venture by the ethnographic specialist Sahel Sounds and the reissuer Mississippi Records.\u201cDiscos Barba Azul really helped the cumbia scene,\u201d Mr. Ariano, 38, said. \u201cThe young generation that now wants to become sonideros, they owe [Mr. Pedraza] a lot.\u201dMr. Pedraza, 42, started the label after years of running a small music shop on South Broadway in downtown Los Angeles. His customers asked him for cumbia sonidera, which he confessed he had not yet heard of at the time, so he began hunting for CDs directly from Mexican labels that had no United States distribution.In 2006, having amassed knowledge of what was selling, he offered to bankroll recording sessions for bands in studios in Mexico. In return, they would mail him the tapes for mastering and pressing in Los Angeles. Rather than royalties, a band would typically receive a flat fee up front, plus CDs.Before committing to a full album, Mr. Pedraza would test the market by making compilations to sell at the swap meets ubiquitous in Los Angeles\u2019s Mexican neighborhoods. \u201cWhen customers asked for a whole CD from a specific band, I told them that I don\u2019t have it \u2014 but I\u2019ll get it in a month,\u201d he said.A tireless promoter, Mr. Pedraza traveled to sonidero parties and radio stations in cities across California and Texas, plus Chicago, Phoenix, Atlanta and Denver. If he was unsure about a track\u2019s potential, he would ask the sonidero to play it live and gauge the crowd response.Among sonideros, Discos Barba Azul\u2019s material was indispensable. At its peak in 2007, Mr. Pedraza estimates, his label released at least two or three songs playing in the rotation at every cumbia sonidera night across the United States and in cumbia hot spots in Mexico like Puebla, Le\u00f3n, Monterrey and Mexico City.While the hype-man aspect of sonidero culture \u2014 exhorting the crowd to have a good time \u2014 will be familiar to anyone who has been to a hip-hop concert, the main focus of the sonidero\u2019s attention is unique to Mexican immigrant life. Sonideros spend much of their time collecting names to recite over the microphone, which serve to connect family and friends across long distances. A partygoer in Los Angeles might shout out to a cousin in Puebla, which the recipient would listen for when tuning in to the sonidero\u2019s set.\u201cBarba Azul is a portal from those \u2019hoods in Puebla and the Distrito Federal [Mexico City] to \u2019hoods here in East and South L.A.,\u201d said Mr. Guerrero.In years past, a set full of shout-outs was recorded live, then sold on cassette tapes in Mexican communities in the United States and back across the border. These days, it\u2019s more likely to be posted online or live-streamed. That same digital trend ultimately sunk Discos Barba Azul; the label\u2019s CD sales plummeted when most of the material ended up on YouTube.Alexandra Lippman, a cultural anthropologist at the University of California-Davis, compiled \u201c\u00a1Un Saludo!\u201d and said that while the shout-out may seem like a simple act, it has a deeper meaning. \u201cCumbia fans speak through the sonidero\u2019s voice to shout out their family and recognize villages left behind,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sonideros\u2019 voices create a simultaneous sonic presence between Mexico and the United States, between here and there.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the cultural anthropologist at the University of California-Davis.

She ran inside the school, only to be felled by three shots that left her dead and bleeding on the floor.Her sister Beatriz da Costa, 21, heard the gunfire. \u201cI went into the school and stayed there with her, lying on the floor, crying,\u201d Ms. da Costa said in a phone interview.It was one more tragic death in this city, adding to a spike in the numbers of people killed during police operations in Rio since last year. And it seems to have increased a sense that violence \u2014 particularly killings involving the police \u2014 is spinning out of control just seven months after the city hosted the Olympics.Cellphone video shot during the gun battle showed two police officers approaching two men lying on the ground outside the school, picking up a rifle and shooting them dead. Both officers have been arrested.The killing generated a flood of shocked headlines and reactions in a city that has endured tragedies like this before. The city\u2019s education secretary, C\u00e9sar Benjamin, wrote on his Facebook page that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d the shots that killed Maria Eduarda had been fired by officers aiming at two armed men. Residents of nearby communities called for an end to military-style police operations.\u201cThese operations don\u2019t result in anything, just violence,\u201d said Valdinei Martins, 44, a resident of the neighboring Acari favela whose brother Jo\u00e3o was killed by a stray bullet in 2014. \u201cThere is no intelligence.\u201dKillings as a result of \u201copposition to police intervention\u201d across Rio de Janeiro State rose from 49 in February 2016 to 84 this February \u2014 a 71 percent increase, according to government reports. The 41st police battalion responsible for policing Fazenda Botafogo and surrounding areas, far from Rio\u2019s picturesque beaches, proved even more lethal. In January and February, 36 people were killed during actions by officers from that battalion, compared with six during the same period last year, according to the same reports.The Rio police declined to answer questions about Maria Eduarda\u2019s death. In an emailed statement, they said officers had been sent \u201cto intervene in an action by criminals\u201d and that \u201cthere was a confrontation.\u201d Maria Eduarda\u2019s death is being investigated, the statement said, and the two officers shown in the video are in custody and their case being investigated by internal affairs.The deaths also come as Rio struggles with financial and political crises. Brazil is undergoing its worst recession on record, with 13 million people unemployed and an economy that contracted 3.6 percent last year. The state government in Rio is broke, struggling to pay police salaries and reeling from the jailing of a former governor, S\u00e9rgio Cabral, accused of running a multimillion-dollar graft network that took bribes from Olympic and other public works projects.Although policing is a state government responsibility, the current governor, Luiz de Souza, formerly Mr. Cabral\u2019s deputy governor, has yet to comment on the killings but plans to meet with Maria Eduarda\u2019s family this week.Ant\u00f4nio Costa, founder of River of Peace, an anti-violence group, said Mr. de Souza\u2019s silence was symptomatic of a city many feel is descending into chaos.\u201cThe State of Rio has no leader,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no one in command, there is a complete loss of credibility,\u201d he said.Maria Eduarda\u2019s brother Uidson Ferreira, a 32-year-old martial arts instructor, said his sister\u2019s death showed how the police were woefully unprepared to deal with armed confrontation in densely populated areas. \u201cWith this crisis, with these 13 million unemployed, the violence has been very explicit,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cWhat is happening is a lack of preparation of the whole hierarchy of the government. This comes from above, and the poor class always pays the bill.\u201d\u201cThe family has totally fallen apart psychologically,\u201d he added, his voice shaking with tears. \u201cIt is like we are going crazy.\u201dBruna Aguiar, 25, a university student and resident of Acari, a favela just across the subway line from Fazenda Botafogo, said the police would have thought more carefully before opening fire near a school in a middle-class area. Outside Rio\u2019s favelas, she said, people avoid subjects like police killings and poverty.\u201cIf you talk about it, you touch on an open wound,\u201d Ms. Aguiar said.They know all about stray bullets in Acari, which is also policed by the 41st battalion. Ms. Aguiar is part of a local collective that has denounced regular police invasions it says causes terror among residents.On Sunday afternoon, the favela hummed with life. Beeping motorbikes zipped down its winding lanes, where residents sat out on plastic chairs and young men with rifles from its dominant drug gang, the Third Pure Command, guarded strategic corners.One with a radio pointed to the rooftop from which he said the police had shot a fellow gang member dead the previous week. As darkness fell, another wearing an earpiece cradled a machine gun and moved to music booming from a nearby bar.Priscilla Cabral, 32, a shop assistant, showed the bullet holes left in her front door after one police operation; her daughter Angelina, 8, had tried to cover them up with chewing gum. Ms. Cabral had pulled her dozing son Robert, 15, off the sofa seconds before another bullet thudded into the wall behind him.She said her studious daughter got upset when gun battles stopped her from going to school.\u201cShe said to me: \u2018Take me out of here. I can\u2019t stand it anymore,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Cabral said.Advertisement"}

Timianne had just returned from her first ultrasound (it\u2019s a girl!), so I couldn\u2019t expect her to jump in if things got hectic. That meant if I messed up, a quarter-ton of a kicking, biting African equine could soon be thundering down the road toward the Michigan interstate.A zebra.But she had to admit the feed store guys were on to something. \u201cZebras and donkeys are very social,\u201d she explained when I came to visit. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten so that when our donkeys see me flick a light on in the house, they call for me to come out. But as much as they learn from you, they learn even more from the herd. They\u2019re great at teaching each other how to behave.\u201dSo if the animals are coaching themselves, how does Timianne get them to follow her commands? By handling every animal, every day, from the moment they\u2019re born. Timianne keeps monitors in all the stalls so within minutes of a birth, she\u2019s there to stroke the new foal. She doesn\u2019t bottle-feed the newborns or treat them like \u201cfur babies\u201d (a term that makes her grind her teeth). She just makes a connection.\u201cYou let them know you\u2019re different, but they can trust you,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you establish boundaries that you both respect.\u201d Take Rarity; once Timianne sensed the zebra didn\u2019t enjoy being ridden, she hung up his saddle for good. In return, Rarity is a cooperative breeder and easy to handle. Today, he ambles straight toward us as soon as he spots Timianne. She takes his big striped head in her hands and gives it a smooch.\u201cYup, you\u2019re a big dork,\u201d she told him. They\u2019ve been together for 13 years, ever since Timianne was a horse-obsessed teenager who raised money to buy him by mucking stalls after school. She persuaded her mother to drive her to North Carolina to pick him up, and was horrified to find Rarity\u2019s owner beating him with a rope. When Timianne got him home, she turned the traumatized zebra loose in a pasture and let him be, while she sat quietly in the grass as he eyed her.\u201cIt takes three months to train a horse,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took three years to train him.\u201dBut her hands-off approach led her to a revelation: Sometimes the best thing you can do is nothing at all.\u201cYou\u2019ll see a first-timer develop an amazing relationship, while people who know more can turn their animal into a big hot mess,\u201d said Sammi Jo, who has also trained badgers, a pelican and a water buffalo. The secret, she believes, is watching your animal and learning how it communicates.\u201cWhen your horse can tell you with a glance that she has an itchy right stifle (a hard-to-reach spot on a horse\u2019s upper leg) it\u2019s just \u2014 wow! So exhilarating. Better than competition.\u201d It reminded me of a conversation I\u2019d had with a Mennonite neighbor. When I asked how he\u2019d raised six children into happy, hard-working adults, he replied, \u201cDinner. We have dinner together every night.\u201d Not church, not chores \u2014 downtime.Back at Timianne\u2019s, it was time to try my hand at taking Ziana, her 11-year-old zebra mare, for a walk. \u201cZebras are more powerful and athletic than horses, so if she wants to get away, there\u2019s no stopping her,\u201d Timianne warned me. \u201cAll she has to do is turn her neck and she\u2019ll rip that rope right out of your hands. But \u2014\u201d she looked me in the eyes to make sure I was getting it. \u201cYou can\u2019t be fearful. They will test you.\u201d\u201cNow you\u2019re catching on,\u201d Timianne said.I was dying to take Ziana home, but since I couldn\u2019t pass the Timianne Test, I\u2019d have to be grateful for what she gave me instead. I couldn\u2019t wait to get back to Sherman and just \u2026 watch.Advertisement"}

And their story line is preordained: A forced confession, a show trial, a sentence to years of hard labor with little chance of appeal.The arrest on Saturday of Tony Kim, also known as Kim Sang-duk, brings to three the number of American citizens currently being held in North Korea. The others are Otto F. Warmbier and Kim Dong-chul. Little, however, is known about Mr. Kim\u2019s case, including why he was detained.But the experiences of other Americans who have been detained and eventually released by North Korea, often with the help of prominent American politicians, crack open the door on the secretive regime\u2019s network of prison camps and the deprivation found there.The three Americans now detained in North Korea are being held at a time of heightened tensions. Their cases may be different, but the circumstances in which they now find themselves, as pawns in a complex geopolitical game, are strikingly similar.These are their stories.Mr. Kim had spent a month teaching accounting at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, in North Korea\u2019s capital, and was trying to board a plane to leave the country when he was arrested on Saturday, according to the chancellor of the university, Chan-Mo Park.\u201cThe cause of his arrest is not known but some officials at P.U.S.T. told me his arrest was not related to his work at P.U.S.T.,\u201d Mr. Park told Reuters. \u201cHe had been involved with some other activities outside P.U.S.T., such as helping an orphanage.\u201dMr. Kim, who is in his 50s, had previously taught at Yanbian University of Science and Technology, an affiliated institute in the Chinese province of Jilin, near the North Korean border. He had most recently been living in North Korea with his wife, who is believed to still be in the country.Mr. Kim studied accounting at the University of California, Riverside and Aurora University, and worked as an accountant in the United States for more than a decade, according to his Facebook page.In announcing his arrest, state news media said that Mr. Warmbier had visited North Korea with the intention of \u201cbringing down the foundation of its single-minded unity.\u201dAt a news conference last year, Mr. Warmbier acknowledged stealing the poster and said that he had done so because an acquaintance had offered to give him a used car worth $10,000 in exchange for it. \u201cI made the worst mistake of my life,\u201d Mr. Warmbier said. Whether the confession was genuine or coerced was not clear.Mr. Warmbier is an honors student at the university and a member of the Theta Chi fraternity.Kim Dong-chul, an American businessman, was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor in April 2016 for spying and other offenses.Mr. Kim\u2019s predicament was not known until January 2016, when the North Korean government allowed CNN to interview him in Pyongyang. At that time, Mr. Kim identified himself as a 62-year-old naturalized American citizen who lived in Fairfax, Va. He said he once ran a trading and hotel services company in Rason, a special economic zone that North Korea operates near its borders with China and Russia.He said he was arrested in October 2015 while meeting with a former North Korean soldier to receive classified data.An article on Thursday about three Americans now being detained in North Korea misstated the age of one of them, Otto F.

It\u2019s not that riesling is unpopular, though public acceptance never quite matches critical plaudits. But this particular wine, riesling with discernible sweetness, is an especially difficult sell.Nonetheless, we\u2019re plunging in. These wines are too thrilling, too delicious and too versatile with food to allow us to be deterred by a bunch of umlauts. There\u2019s no accounting for taste, of course. But you\u2019ve got to try the wines first. And if you already think you know these wines, why not try them again? Tastes evolve.Here are the three wines I recommend:Can\u2019t find these wines, or other sp\u00e4tlese cuv\u00e9es from these producers? Don\u2019t worry. Dozens of exceptional wines are available. The key words to look for are \u201criesling sp\u00e4tlese,\u201d which indicate very ripe riesling grapes fermented to leave some discernible sweetness in the wine. Avoid any sp\u00e4tlese also labeled \u201ctrocken,\u201d which indicates a dry wine.Along with additional sp\u00e4tlese cuv\u00e9es from these winemakers, other German producers to look for include: Julian Haart, Weiser-K\u00fcnstler, Schloss Lieser, Sch\u00e4fer-Fr\u00f6hlich, A. J. Adam, Dr. Loosen, Fritz Haag, Maximin Gr\u00fcnhaus, Selbach-Oster, Alfred Merkelbach, Joh. Jos. Christoffel, Willi Schaefer and Leitz.I selected the 2015 vintage, which has received a great deal of hype, partly because it is now in the market. But if you find older vintages, do not hesitate to buy them. They may be even better.What to serve with these wines? Just about anything you like. Light seafood and poultry dishes would be fine, as would many spicy dishes. Why not test the frequently repeated notion that sp\u00e4tlese rieslings go wonderfully with Asian cuisines?Now, let me repeat the usual caution: Don\u2019t serve these wines too cold. If they are icy, the nuances will be difficult to detect. Take the bottles out of the fridge about half an hour before serving.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Soon, Your Car May Be Able to Read Your Expressions", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byWheelsWhen you shop for cat food online, Amazon knows who you are. When you look for the best airfares for summer vacation, Google knows who you are. Soon, when you get behind the wheel, your car may recognize you, too.Using cameras with facial recognition software and other biometric indicators, automakers are looking to personalize the driving experience with cars that stare back at you, quietly adjusting seats and driving modes. They may even anticipate your wants and desires by playing your favorite music based on your mood. And it\u2019s not only about convenience, but also about the possibility of improving safety and security.Continental has already demonstrated in-car systems that allow drivers to register their faces using something as simple as a driver\u2019s license picture. An interior infrared camera is used to overcome potential obstacles like sunglasses, which would stymie a conventional video camera. Putting the camera in the center instrument cluster also helps to pinpoint the driver\u2019s eyes, even if she\u2019s wearing a hat. The biggest technical challenge \u2014 glare caused by sunlight \u2014 can be filtered out using machine learning, Mr. Bolton said.Once the car knows who you are, systems in vehicles like the Chrysler Portal concept car would automatically adjust the seat for maximum comfort, select a driving mode (for example, one driver likes to let the car do most of the work; another likes taking control in sport mode) and suggest a destination based on the owner\u2019s past behavior.Watching a driver\u2019s face can also give a car important clues about that person\u2019s state of mind. For several years, carmakers like Ford and tech companies like Intel have been interested in determining whether a driver is happy or sad. Depending on your mood, a car could change its tune, playing a bouncy Beach Boys song and changing the interior lighting to improve your attitude.There are practical reasons as well, designers say, for detecting a driver\u2019s emotional state: A calm driver is a safer driver. So cars that recognize when you are becoming angry and thus prone to road rage could potentially quell annoying bells and chimes in the car and play some mellow jazz to soothe you.In this digital age, our faces are everywhere: in online company profiles, on Twitter accounts, even tagged in friends\u2019 Facebook accounts. Finding an image to print out and foil a car\u2019s facial recognition system would not be very difficult.Fortunately, engineers have devised high-tech countermeasures. Stereoscopic video cameras, for example, can tell the difference between a flat image and a three-dimensional object. Continental\u2019s cameras measure the distance of reflected light off various parts of a person\u2019s face, ensuring that it is a real object rather than a high-resolution shot of the owner\u2019s visage.\u201cSome systems have added blink detection and aliveness detection,\u201d said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer for security at Intel. But he acknowledged that it was still possible to thwart such technology. \u201cWe had 3-D masks printed that we ordered and were able to trick some systems,\u201d he said. But he said most thieves would be unlikely to go to such extreme lengths to steal a car.On the other hand, high-tech personalization could be used not only to create amenities for single owners, but also to instantly adapt a vehicle to suit a variety of drivers. Valets, for example, could be automatically prevented from accessing personal information in a navigation system or driving faster than, say, 30 miles per hour. In a ride-sharing situation, such systems could also be used to quickly tailor a car\u2019s interior to the physical characteristics of different drivers and passengers.Rental cars would be easier to operate and safer, Mr. Bolton of Continental said. \u201cIf I know where your head is and where your eyes are,\u201d he said, \u201cI can adjust the position of the steering wheel and the mirrors so you don\u2019t have to fumble looking for the right buttons.\u201dEven airbags could be fine-tuned, reducing the intensity of their deployment depending on the size and position of a driver or young passenger.Such convenience may come with some trade-offs on privacy.Using traffic-tracking programs like Waze, some consumers have already signaled their preference for convenience in return for giving up some information like their location. Programmers also point out that such services are optional: You don\u2019t have to let the company track you \u2014 but then you may get stuck in traffic for 45 minutes.And it could be fun. Consider the entertainment and social media repercussions in the vein of James Corden\u2019s \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d segments. A built-in camera could record and broadcast your singalong on Facebook or Twitter \u2014 assuming the car was in autonomous driving mode. Of course, drivers could grab quick selfies on the road, too.\u201cIt\u2019s a novel ideal,\u201d Mr. Bolton said, \u201cbut remember that an infrared camera makes your face look a little like a skeleton, so it\u2019s not that flattering.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Internet Privacy, VPNs Are an Imperfect Shield", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byTech FixA VPN was a natural service to consider in response. That\u2019s because the technology creates a virtual tunnel that shields your browsing information from your internet service provider. So Mr. Wilmot researched VPNs in hopes of protecting his own browsing data.\u201cI don\u2019t really want anybody to have any sort of access to what I\u2019m looking at,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone is going to profit off my privacy, I\u2019d prefer it to be me.\u201dBut while VPNs are worth considering, they are an incomplete and flawed solution. For one thing, they often slow down internet speeds significantly. Some apps and services may also stop working properly when you are connected to a virtual network.Still, VPNs are among several tools for better protecting your digital privacy. Here\u2019s an overview of the pros and cons, based on tests of VPN services and interviews with security experts.When you browse the web, a broadband provider helps route your device\u2019s internet traffic to each destination website. Each device you use has an identifier consisting of a string of numbers, also known as an IP address. When you are on the internet, a service provider can see which devices you use and which sites you visit.VPNs help cloak your browsing information from your internet provider. When you use VPN software, your device connects to a VPN provider\u2019s servers. That way, all your web traffic passes through the VPN provider\u2019s internet connection. So if your internet provider was trying to listen in on your web traffic, all it would see is the VPN server\u2019s IP address connected to the VPN service.\u201cWe provide you an encrypted tunnel from you to us,\u201d said Sean Sullivan, a security adviser for F-Secure, a Finland-based company that offers a VPN called Freedome.VPNs are especially handy when you are connecting to a public Wi-Fi network with which you aren\u2019t familiar. For example, when you use public Wi-Fi at a cafe, airport or hotel, it\u2019s often unclear who the service provider is and what its data collection policies entail. In this scenario, a VPN is highly recommended.VPNs also have the ability to make it appear as though your device is connecting from a different location. So if you are in Europe, traveling to Spain from France, and want to stream content that is only viewable in France, you could connect to a VPN server whose IP address is in France.VPN services have their downsides, and the biggest one is speed degradation. Because your internet traffic passes through a VPN provider\u2019s connection, you will likely see a dip in broadband performance.Speeds will vary depending on the VPN provider\u2019s infrastructure. In my tests with a Mac, download speeds dropped about 85 percent after connecting to F-Secure\u2019s Freedome VPN service, and by 50 percent when connected to another VPN service called Private Internet Access. In other words, if you are downloading large files over a VPN, it will take much longer to accomplish those tasks.Another drawback is that VPN services cost money. F-Secure charges $4.17 a month to use its service for a year on three devices, and Private Internet Access charges $6.95 per month or $40 a year on five devices. That\u2019s not a lot of money, but broadband service is generally expensive, and tacking on a few extra dollars a month to use the internet more privately can be annoying.In addition, some services may not work properly on a VPN. Netflix often blocks them to keep people from streaming content that is not licensed for their regions. In tests with Freedome and Private Internet Access, I tried connecting to a server in Mexico to stream the catalog of Netflix movies available there. With both VPN services, Netflix detected I was using a VPN and prevented movies from playing.For VPN providers, this is a known issue. F-Secure\u2019s Mr. Sullivan said that when services like Netflix block VPNs, they are probably \u201cputting up a fight for Hollywood.\u201dThere are hundreds of VPNs on the market, and vetting them can be overwhelming.Runa Sandvik, a director of information security for The New York Times, said that consumers should be scrupulous about reading privacy policies and selecting a VPN they can trust. That\u2019s because a VPN service is also tied to an internet service provider, meaning a VPN provider could share your information with the service provider if it wanted to do so.Based on those recommendations, I tried Private Internet Access and Freedome for my tests. Both products were easy to use: Just install an app on your smartphone, computer or tablet and hit a button to connect to a server. In the end, I preferred Private Internet Access because of its faster speeds.All things considered, VPN is only a partial solution for keeping your browsing data private.\u201cThe real problem is ads are dangerous,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company. \u201cThey\u2019re fully functioning programs and they carry malware.\u201dWith VPNs, most people would probably be better off using them when it seems necessary \u2014 and turning them off when they are not needed. The slowdown in speed is the biggest negative and makes constant use impractical.Many people would probably benefit from using a VPN in certain situations, like when they are connected to a public Wi-Fi network or are browsing sensitive websites. But for watching Netflix or sending emails with large attachments? Turn the VPN off.For Mr. Wilmot, the Los Angeles musician, the slow speeds of internet downloading spurred by VPNs were a dealbreaker. In the end, he opted against getting one at all.\u201cIf I don\u2019t have lightning-fast internet 24 hours a day, it inhibits my workflow and affects deadlines,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019m accidentally relaxing into that kind of \u2018What can you do?\u2019 mentality. There\u2019s no good option.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And turning off the sirens also proved difficult, eventually prompting officials to shut down the entire system.\u201cEvery time we thought we had turned it off, the sirens would sound again, because whoever was hacking us was continuously hacking us,\u201d Ms. Syed said.The system was still down on Saturday afternoon, and officials said they hoped to have it functional again by the end of the weekend. They said they had pinpointed the origin of the security breach after ruling out that the alarms had come from their control system or from remote access.\u201cTalking to all the experts in the siren industry, in the field,\u201d Mr. Vaz said. \u201cThis is a very rare event.\u201dMr. Vaz said that Dallas had reached out to the Federal Communications Commission for help and was taking steps to prevent hackers from setting off the entire system again, but that city officials had not communicated with federal law enforcement authorities.At least 4,400 calls came into the area\u2019s 911 system locally in the hours around the attack on Friday night, Ms. Syed said \u2014 about double the amount normal overnight.

{"Headline": "With Couscous, Einat Admony\u2019s Patience Pays Off", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byCoaxing dry, coarse semolina into soft, fluffy couscous is a marathon, not a sprint. This explains why so many cooks use the instant variety; making fresh couscous from scratch requires a patience for repetition \u2014 hand-rolling, sifting, steaming \u2014 and attention to the minute changes in the flour\u2019s temperament.As in any race, the start is crucial. Too much water, introduced too quickly, and the grains will stick together, turning to mush instead of tender clusters. Some cooks spritz the flour as they would a rare and delicate orchid, but the chef Einat Admony, who owns several restaurants in New York, doesn\u2019t bother with all that.Ms. Admony poured a cup of water over her fist and let it run into a large bowl of flour. She spread her fingers apart and expertly combed through the damp semolina, rubbing the flour in her hands to encourage gritty clumps, spinning her palms around the sides of the bowl and winding her way to the center.In September, Ms. Admony plans to open Kish-Kash, a West Village restaurant that will specialize in fresh couscous.There will be a communal table, and counter service at lunchtime. The couscous will be served with a variety of dishes inspired by the foods of Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. \u201cI want it to feel like Shabbat at my house,\u201d said Ms. Admony, 45, who grew up just outside Tel Aviv with her Iranian mother and Yemeni father.For now, every Tuesday is couscous night at Balaboosta, one of the few places in New York serving couscous made from scratch.It comes in a pile, pale and airy, with pickles and condiments, next to Tripoli-style fish shimmering with preserved lemon and harissa, or tender mafroum. Ms. Admony makes mafroum, a North African specialty, by stuffing potatoes with beef and herbs, frying the packages and braising them in a rich tomato sauce, tingling with cinnamon.\u201cMafroum is very old-school,\u201d she said, \u201cand couscous with mafroum is my favorite food in the world. It\u2019s my craving.\u201dUnlike both Israeli couscous, a small pasta that Ms. Admony does not consider to be couscous at all, and Moroccan couscous, which is traditionally steamed over a meaty broth, Ms. Admony\u2019s couscous is steamed with plain water.\u201cWhen it\u2019s perfect, it\u2019s so delicious you can even eat it plain,\u201d she said.When Ms. Admony was 8, she helped with kitchen tasks at home: picking small stones from an aluminum tray of nigella seeds, or white pith from pomegranate seeds. And she learned the basics of making fresh couscous from a Moroccan neighbor in her three-story apartment building.Even in homes where couscous is hand-rolled, the dish is still considered a rare treat, Ms. Admony said, and because of the labor-intensive process, it is hardly ever made from scratch in restaurants.In the tiny kitchen at Balaboosta, Ms. Admony took up more handfuls of wet semolina. She slid her palms together as if she were washing them under running water, letting the flour fall back into the bowl in clumps. Working in batches, she pushed these clumps through a wide-meshed sieve. (Any large, doughy pieces left behind would be fried for a family meal.)What she packed into the steamer did look like couscous, but it was not there yet. The grains were still small and they needed to swell with more moisture. She steamed her first round for a half-hour, before tipping the hot semolina back into a large bowl so the starch could cool and rest.Then she mixed in more water, passed the mass through the sieve and steamed it a second time. Couscous-making techniques vary from home to home, and while some cooks may pass the semolina through the strainer only once, others repeat the process three times for an airy, even grain.But after two rounds of steaming, Ms. Admony ran her hands through the warm, tender couscous and declared it ready.She leaned over the bowl to breathe in the rising steam. \u201cI love it exactly like this.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}

Trump boasts on tape of forcing himself on women, and women flood the internet with raw memories of when they were groped or assaulted.Six months ago, the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape with Mr. Trump\u2019s comments prompted widespread revulsion and equally widespread predictions that it would doom his candidacy. But women who voted for him either shrugged it off as how men talk among themselves or decided that his promises to create jobs and tighten borders mattered more. And Mr. Trump\u2019s swagger was a dog whistle for those men who felt women\u2019s gains were their losses.The lesson Mr. Trump apparently drew is that powerful men are not going to be held accountable. That wider sense of impunity is one reason women often decide not to report sexual harassment, even as Mr. O\u2019Reilly has denied the accusations and cites the lack of such calls to hotlines in his defense.Fox is a case in point. Multiple lawsuits, accounts of women who worked there and even an internal investigation that resulted in the departure of the chief executive of Fox News, Roger Ailes, all suggested a \u201cMad Men\u201d-style workplace, where women were often harassed.Female employees reported being pressed to trade sexual favors for advancement, explicit sex talk, groping and more. On-air, disdain and contempt for feminism were openly expressed. Feminists were dismissed as unattractive, shrill harridans or ridiculed as politically correct scolds. In Fox\u2019s world, women do not encounter systemic oppression. Some of its most prominent female anchors publicly rejected the label of feminist.So what would it take to make sexual harassers stop?But the staying power of such movements is unclear, although the passion is real. A resistance movement has sprung up largely powered by women repelled at what the election wrought. They confront a White House dominated by white men making policies that threaten women\u2019s health care and propose to slash money for social programs that have benefited poor and working-class women.An earlier version of this article stated that Bill O\u2019Reilly, of Fox News, settled five lawsuits alleging sexual harassment.

Yet nobody has done much to fix it.That may finally change, if the people in charge of Silicon Valley \u2014 venture capitalists, who control the money \u2014 start to realize that the real problem with tech bros is not just that they\u2019re boorish jerks. It\u2019s that they\u2019re boorish jerks who don\u2019t know how to run companies.What is bro culture? Basically, a world that favors young men at the expense of everyone else. A \u201cbro co.\u201d has a \u201cbro\u201d C.E.O., or C.E.-Bro, usually a young man who has little work experience but is good-looking, cocky and slightly amoral \u2014 a hustler. Instead of being forced by investors to surround himself with seasoned executives, he is left to make decisions on his own.Bro cos. become corporate frat houses, where employees are chosen like pledges, based on \u201cculture fit.\u201d Women get hired, but they rarely get promoted and sometimes complain of being harassed. Minorities and older workers are excluded.Bro culture also values speedy growth over sustainable profits, and encourages cutting corners, ignoring regulations and doing whatever it takes to win.Sometimes it works. But often the whole thing just flames out. The bros blow through the money and find they have no viable business. For example: Quirky, founded in 2009 by the 20-something Ben Kaufman. It raised $185 million to build a \u201csocial product development platform\u201d that sold kooky gadgets, but filed for bankruptcy basically because the \u201cbrash\u201d and \u201cunorthodox\u201d chief executive had no business being a chief executive. One indication that Mr. Kaufman is a bro? Well, the first reference he lists on his LinkedIn page is: \u201cHe\u2019s a dick \u2026 but hilarious.\u201dHoping to right the ship, Uber appointed one of its board members, Arianna Huffington, to join former attorney general Eric Holder and others to investigate the sexual harassment claims. Mr. Kalanick has apologized and vowed to \u201cgrow up.\u201d (He\u2019s 40.) Most important, Uber has announced that it is planning to hire a chief operating officer, ideally a steady hand like Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook. It\u2019s a great idea, but it should have happened years ago. Now it may be too late.Bro C.E.O.s are better at raising money than making money. So why do venture capitalists keep investing in them? It may be because many of the venture capitalists are bros as well.Uber\u2019s collapse should not come as a surprise but it does offer a lesson: Toxic workplace culture and rotten financial performance go hand-in-hand. It\u2019s possible for a boorish jerk to run a successful company, but jerks do best when surrounded by non-jerks, and bros do best when they hire seasoned executives to help them. Without \u201cadult supervision\u201d and institutional restraints, the C.E.-Bro\u2019s vices end up infecting the culture of the workplaces they control.This poisonous state of affairs will get fixed only when investors start getting hurt.

{"Headline": "Slack, an Upstart in Messaging, Now Faces Giant Tech Rivals", "Date": "2017-04-16", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Slack is the classic Silicon Valley accidental success. Born three years ago, with roots in a failed video game, the messaging software is now used by five million people.The company behind it, Slack Technologies, found success by combining something that Silicon Valley fetishizes \u2014 rich data on how people use a product \u2014 with something it often overlooks: How do people actually feel while using it?This combination produced an unlikely hit that, when it became available in 2014, grew mostly by word of mouth, which is unusual for corporate software. Last year, the privately held company was valued at nearly $4 billion.Now Slack faces a significant new challenge. It has become big enough to draw a competitive response from giants like Microsoft, but not big enough to have the roster of large corporate clients it needs to compete with the giants.As a result, Slack, which built up momentum as a lovable underdog, must fend off some of technology\u2019s largest and fiercest competitors if it wants to be more than a niche tool for small businesses and teams.Microsoft, for instance, already offers ways for employees to collaborate. And while its offerings have not been viral hits, they have offered boring but important features that big companies demand, like strong data security and regulatory compliance controls.There is no illusion within Slack that success is certain. But Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive, said small tech companies with new ideas had long defeated larger rivals that tried to copy them. Think of Apple\u2019s beating IBM in personal computing, Google\u2019s beating Microsoft in search and Facebook\u2019s crushing Google in social networks.One advantage Slack does have is focus, Mr. Butterfield maintains. Microsoft, for example, has numerous Slack-like products including Yammer, SharePoint, Skype for Business and now Teams. The executives who run those businesses within Microsoft must \u201ccompete for budget and mind share and attention,\u201d he said, providing an opening for Slack to gain users while Microsoft managers wage internal wars.Microsoft said users would embrace Teams because it had strong encryption and global support and worked seamlessly with software they already used, like Excel. \u201cWe think customers value coherence,\u201d said Bryan Goode, the general manager of Office 365 at Microsoft.Slack is the product of Mr. Butterfield\u2019s second failed attempt to make a video game. His first, called Game Neverending, had a photo-sharing feature that became more popular than the game. It became Flickr, which was sold to Yahoo for $25 million in 2005.In 2011, he introduced another game, Glitch, in which people cooperated to build a shared world. (Misbehaving players got a timeout.) At its height, the game was costing the company $500,000 a month and bringing in $30,000, so Mr. Butterfield shuttered it in late 2012. A few employees stayed on to build out the messaging platform that Glitch engineers had used to talk among themselves. That project became Slack.Slack was officially introduced in February 2014 and today has five million daily users, up from four million in October. Most users are on a free version, but about 1.5 million pay Slack $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search. The 800-person company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable.Initially popular with small teams of software engineers who wanted to work remotely without cumbersome videoconferences or email, Slack was not designed for big companies. Users chat in \u201cchannels,\u201d typically organized around a few well-defined tasks.\u201cThe overhead of working among different offices becomes less of an issue\u201d with Slack, said Nick Coronges, chief technology officer at R/GA, a 2,000-person design and marketing agency with offices in several cities.But Slack has focused on making a product that people love, a strategy that is more common among consumer companies like Apple, Snap and Spotify.Slack modeled itself after consumer messaging apps that let users communicate with GIFs, stickers and emojis. One Slack emoji is a cartoon raccoon with its palms pressed in respectful greeting. Called \u201craccooning,\u201d it signifies, \u201cPlease take this conversation someplace else. You are getting off topic.\u201dIn Slack\u2019s office in Vancouver, British Columbia, designers think about things like color choice, layout and Slack\u2019s sign-in greeting, and how they might affect a customer\u2019s peace of mind. Back at San Francisco headquarters, data jockeys pore over the kinds of signals that tech companies normally study, like time spent with the product and whether moving a button elicits a change in behavior.Unlike some Silicon Valley companies, Slack believes humans are as important as robots. All executives, including Mr. Butterfield, have fielded the 6,000 customer support calls and 2,800 Twitter messages that come in each week. The average turnaround time for a help request is under an hour.\u201cI get worried if I see customer satisfaction scores dip below 97 percent,\u201d said Ali Rayl, Slack\u2019s head of customer experience.If Slack can dovetail seamlessly with how people behave, feel like second nature to use and strongly appeal to employees, taking it away could become \u201clike taking off your astronaut helmet in space,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said.When it began, Slack had fewer features than its rivals had, but that wasn\u2019t seen as a problem at first. Tens of thousands of small teams were creating accounts, some even paying for them, without much prompting. Smaller customers still account for more than 50 percent of Slack\u2019s revenue.But Slack knew it would always be a niche product without basic features like \u201cthreading,\u201d a standard email and chat room feature that groups together replies to a message, and an easier sign-in process. Originally each team required its own sign-in, even if an employee worked on many teams in the same organization.As competition heated up, Slack started to elicit feedback from companies like Capital One. The bank\u2019s teams wanted to log in at one place and get access to all of their Slack rooms. They wanted each channel to allow more people, and they wanted to customize features, like file sharing, to comply with regulations.Slack made those changes, and employees \u201clatched on,\u201d said Jennifer Manry, vice president for work force technology at Capital One, \u201can indication that it was filling a critical need.\u201dAt the end of January, Mr. Butterfield unveiled Enterprise Grid. Aimed at companies and governments, it can manage the conversations of up to 500,000 employees at once. IBM, Jet.com, NASA and Home Depot have all used the product.But Slack has not taken over. Capital One still uses collaboration tools from Microsoft and Atlassian. Facebook and smaller companies like Asana share customers with Slack, too. Microsoft Teams is available in 181 markets around the world in 19 languages. Slack is available only in English, wherever the app is available for download.The battle between Slack and its competitors is essentially a fight over who will make the next piece of workplace software that no one can live without. Many businesses, large and small, depend on Excel from Microsoft, Photoshop from Adobe and Gmail from Google.Slack wants to be in that pantheon \u2014 as the place where people collaborate and hang out online, the world\u2019s virtual conference room and water cooler.Slack\u2019s name \u2014 an acronym for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge \u2014 underscores its big ambition. But to become a Microsoft-size success it needs workers to choose Slack over its competitors.\u201cCompanies want their employees to collaborate more, because better collaboration reduces the need to jump ship,\u201d said Sean Ryan, the head of partnerships at Facebook\u2019s Workplace. \u201cThe No. 1 reason people leave their jobs is they feel isolated.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build empathy at scale,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said. Slack\u2019s office walls are covered with customer feedback, and soothing French pop music is piped into the restrooms. Company engineers say being a good designer is like being a good host, and they use shorthand like \u201cset out the towels\u201d as they create new user features.\u201cI\u2019ve been building software for 15 years, and I\u2019ve become more attuned to how the average person will interact with and experience software in the last 18 months here than in the prior 13 years,\u201d said April Underwood, who joined Slack as vice president of product in 2015.Whether this approach translates into profits for Slack depends largely on how fast the company can expand into more countries and whether employees at big companies push their information technology departments to pay for it. That would necessitate an unusual level of devotion to a piece of workplace software, which is why Slack says it is so devoted to its users\u2019 well-being.\u201cThere are people who will die, get divorced, have children with cancer,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said. \u201cYou really have to put yourself in their frames of mind. If we preoccupy these people for a minute longer than we have to, we\u2019ll lose them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article contained several errors. Users pay Slack $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search, not $8 to $12.50. The company has 800 employees, not 750. And Slack is available in English wherever it can be downloaded, not only in the United States and Britain.An article last Monday about Slack Technologies and the competition it faces from larger companies misstated the number of employees at R/GA, whose chief technology officer commented on the use of Slack\u2019s software. It is 2,000, not 1,000.Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The bad guys in the movies never fully understood that the menace behind Wayne\u2019s grin (\u201cWhoa, take \u2018er easy there, Pilgrim\u201d) meant he was about to deliver blazing fantasies of triumphant gunfire that would leave them dead in the dust. It\u2019s no wonder modern Florida legislators could not resist protecting actual shooters who draw and fire like John Wayne as guilt-free, \u201cstand-your-ground\u201d defenders.There are thousands of ingenious, gleaming rifles and handguns in displays about America\u2019s gun-rich history of colonialism, immigration, expansionism and vigilante justice.

(Or rather, the bowl.)\u201cOur intentions were good,\u201d Ms. Madison continued. \u201cWe were using wholesome foods in contrast to our mothers\u2019 new reliance on cake mixes, white flour, TV dinners and that sort of thing.\u201dThe problem, she said, was that her generation didn\u2019t know much about cooking.The current food mood may also be a reaction to the more exhausting aspects of life in the digital era.\u201cIt\u2019s a weird mixture of technology and palo santo\u201d \u2014 iPhones and incense \u2014 said the chef Gerardo Gonzalez, suggesting that people who live online may be moved to seek out the restorative properties of natural foods. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly in this thing that\u2019s not reality, and eating food can be the most real act you can partake in.\u201dGrowing up with chain restaurants and living with the \u201cmental fog\u201d that comes from regularly eating meat, dairy and starch, said Mr. Gonzalez, 34, has led him and his peers to seek an alternative.\u201cI think people are now more likely to turn to a\u00e7ai bowls than a bacon cheeseburger for their hangover,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a lot of people who gravitate toward this lifestyle, it\u2019s not hypocritical.\u201d\u201cThere was a huge awakening that happened in the last couple of years with the way that New Yorkers approach food,\u201d she said. \u201cThe meat-heavy, super-masculine-style restaurants that were ever-present became outdated and were overtaken by a much more vibrant and produce-driven menu.\u201dDespite the often extragavant price tag attached to many haute-hippie staples and the Vitamix required to prepare them, this is food that is easy to make at home, with plenty of cookbooks for guidance.In fact, a kombucha- and tempeh-making business just opened near Mr. Katz\u2019s home in Cannon County, Tenn., population 16,000. \u201cIt\u2019s not just happening in New York, San Francisco and Portland,\u201d he said.(For the record, Mr. Katz bristles at the association of fermentation with hippiedom. \u201cIn terms of countercultural movements, I feel like punk is much more resonant,\u201d he said. \u201cThe punk movement was all about D.I.Y. and publishing your own zine, and figuring out how to make things yourself and improvise.\u201d)Mr. Gonzalez has noticed a change in diners\u2019 palates toward flavors that are brighter and more acidic, like those produced by fermentation, as well as earthier and umami-rich flavors, like nutritional yeast. \u201cPeople are starting to realize that these ingredients are a whole new color palette,\u201d he said.This group of Americans has also developed a less-sweet tooth and an appreciation of the textures imparted by grains like buckwheat and rye. \u201cI was in a meeting last night where one person suggested making a chocolate cake recipe with fermented cabbage in it,\u201d Ms. Madison said.As with anything counterculture edging toward the mainstream, the threat of co-optation looms.Alice Waters, the Berkeley queen of local and seasonal cooking, applauds the movement away from fast and processed food, but said she was wary of how its language had been appropriated by mainstream brands. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hijacking going on right now that is very disturbing,\u201d Ms. Waters said. \u201cI mean, they can\u2019t quite take \u2018organic,\u2019 but they\u2019re taking everything else.\u201dAt the restaurant level, though, hippie fare has long been \u201ca lifestyle and a brand,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez conceded.\u201cYou\u2019re not just selling food,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re giving the promise of a healthier life, or a more enlightened meal.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Atrocities Mount in Syria, Justice Seems Out of Reach", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byISTANBUL \u2014 The evidence is staggering.Three tons of captured Syrian government documents, providing a chilling and extensive catalog of the state\u2019s war crimes, are held by a single organization in Europe. A Syrian police photographer fled with pictures of more than 6,000 dead at the hands of the state, many of them tortured. The smartphone alone has broken war\u2019s barriers: Records of crimes are now so graphic, so immediate, so overwhelming.Yet six years since the war began, this mountain of documentation \u2014 more perhaps than in any conflict before it \u2014 has brought little justice. The people behind the violence remain free, and there is no clear path to bring the bulk of the evidence before any court, anywhere.But so far, only a handful of war-crimes investigations are being pursued by judicial authorities in Europe, and all the suspects in those cases are at large.No cases have gone to the International Criminal Court. Syria never joined it, so the court\u2019s chief prosecutor cannot start an investigation on her own. The United Nations Security Council could refer a case to the court, but Russia has repeatedly used its veto power to shield Syria from international condemnation. And even if the Council were to take action, President Bashar al-Assad and his top officials are battened down in Damascus, making their arrests difficult, to say the least.As Mr. Assad has consolidated his control of Syria\u2019s major cities, some countries that have long opposed him have signaled a new willingness to accept his rule as the fastest way to end the war, encourage refugees to go home and accelerate the fight against the jihadists. As bad as Mr. Assad may be, some argue, Syria would be worse without him.Mr. Assad\u2019s opponents counter that keeping a head of state with so much blood on his hands perpetuates the war.The chemical attack was just his most recent atrocity, after years of torture, enforced disappearances, siege warfare and indiscriminate bombing of civilian neighborhoods and hospitals. The violence will continue as long as Mr. Assad and his security apparatus remain, his enemies say.Syria\u2019s war has seen atrocities by all sides. Rebels have shelled civilian neighborhoods, and the jihadists of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have deployed suicide bombers, tortured enemies and executed prisoners, often on video.But the largest number of violations by far has been by the Syrian government and its allies, investigators say, because they wield the apparatus of the state, including a formal military with an air force, extensive security services and networks of prisons.The Syrian government portrays the conflict as an international conspiracy to destroy the country and equates all opposition with foreign-backed terrorism. It denies that its forces have used chemical weapons or committed atrocities.\u201cThese are allegations,\u201d Mr. Assad said. \u201cWhat are the facts?\u201dThe United Nations commission, in a report last year, quoted a defector from an intelligence agency as saying officers had orders to arrest male demonstrators between the ages of 16 and 40; another defector described his training in techniques that detainees have described, like beatings with cables, hanging by the wrists and electrocution.Dozens of people over the years have told The Times in detail about their arrests and detentions and the disappearances of their relatives into the maw of the security system, from early 2011 to this month.The arrests cut across political and socioeconomic lines. Yahya and Ma\u2019an Sharbaji, two brothers, were arrested with a friend, Ghiath Matar, in September 2011, after leading protests in Daraya, a Damascus suburb. They had been part of a Muslim student group arrested years before for activities like holding discussions on liberalizing Islam and working for peaceful change. Mr. Matar\u2019s body was returned to his family with signs of torture; the Sharbaji brothers have not been seen since, according to the family.In September 2012, Abdelaziz al-Khair, a leftist dissident, disappeared with his stepson Maher Tahan while leaving the Damascus airport, having flown in from abroad for an opposition conference.His wife, Fadwa Mahmoud, has teamed up with Mr. Sharbaji\u2019s sister Bayan, and other women with missing family members, to fight for the rights of the detained and disappeared.About 100,000 Syrians are still detained or missing, Ms. Mahmoud said in an interview, which affects perhaps a million family members. When men disappear, women, in a society with laws that privilege male authority, are left in limbo.\u201cThey cannot grieve, they cannot remarry, they cannot sell property, the family has lost their breadwinner,\u201d she said.It is rare to meet a Syrian refugee family that does not have a detained or disappeared member, and rarer still to find a former detainee who has not been tortured, said Sareta Ashraph, until recently the chief analyst for the United Nations commission.K.K., a lawyer, was arrested in 2014, two years after he participated in a demonstration \u2014 with government permission \u2014 in Aleppo. He had also represented detainees, acidly commenting one too many times on a court system that finished trials in minutes and gave lawyers no access to their clients or the supposed evidence against them.He described his eight-month ordeal in hours of interviews: daily beatings, a cell so packed that there was no room to lie down. He spent three months, he said, with personal space smaller than the size of a manhole.In one of his first interrogations, he said, he was forced to count the blows, reaching 80 before he passed out.Doused with cold water, he awoke to be hung for hours by his wrists, bound behind his back with handcuffs. Later, he saw a young detainee get doused with kerosene, and set on fire. It took him 20 days to die, untreated, of infection.The torture went on until K.K. signed a confession of financing \u201cterrorist\u201d demonstrations \u2014 entirely fiction, he said, dictated by his captors.Now K.K. works with other Syrian lawyers and former detainees to compile lists of victims, hoping their records will someday make a difference.Other alleged war crimes take place in full view.By 2013, bombings of rebel-held neighborhoods by artillery and warplanes had become routine. Hundreds of videos showed mutilated civilians, including women and children, pulled from rubble.There have been dozens of cases of starvation, many of them children, and ill and elderly people.Since this month\u2019s chemical attack, residents have reported several attacks with incendiary weapons in Idlib and neighboring Hama provinces, uploading videos that show blinding fires typical of weapons like thermite and white phosphorus. They cause severe burns, similar to napalm, and their use is prohibited in civilian areas.Many who have suffered lost hope of redress long ago.A Syrian man who did four stints of detention and torture for taking humanitarian aid to wounded protesters and rebels recounted his experiences, but then expressed despair that anything would come of it.\u201cCountries don\u2019t need this evidence \u2014 they already know what\u2019s happening,\u201d said the man, Abu Ali al-Hamwi, using his nom de guerre because his mother is in government-controlled Syria.\u201cWe are just pawns on a chessboard. I have women friends who were detained, raped, got pregnant, were tortured with acid.\u201dHe shrugged.\u201cThere is no justice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because there is no justice, there is no hope.\u201dAs the war has dragged on, groups of activists, lawyers and others in Syria and beyond are documenting atrocities in hopes of one day bringing perpetrators to account.Some film the aftermath of attacks and compile lists of the dead. Others are experienced war-crimes prosecutors who have begun building cases against Mr. Assad and other government officials.The group, funded by Western governments, now has more than 750,000 Syrian government documents that contain hundreds of thousands of names, including those of top players in Syria\u2019s security apparatus, according to William H. Wiley, the group\u2019s executive director.So far, the group has prepared eight detailed case briefs against ranking Syrian security and intelligence officials, Mr. Wiley said. Seven of them directly implicate Mr. Assad.\u201cObviously, President Assad figures prominently in certain of the case files,\u201d Mr. Wiley said via Skype from his office in a European city that his organization keeps secret for fear of being targeted by the Syrian government. \u201cPretty much the entire military and intelligence security infrastructure of the regime is now featured in one or more of the prosecution briefs.\u201dThe photos have been verified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and determined to contain images of 6,700 individuals, according to Stephen J. Rapp, who served as ambassador at large for war crimes during the Obama administration.More than 700 of the people in the photos have been identified by name, opening other avenues for potential prosecution. Indeed, one of those photos led to the most recent legal action against Syrian officials.In 2014, Amal Hag Hamdo Anfalis, a Spanish-Syrian hairdresser, received a text message from her niece containing a photo of a body she had seen on Facebook. She immediately recognized her brother, a truck driver who had disappeared at a Syrian government checkpoint a year earlier.\u201cAs soon as I saw it, I completely collapsed and my children were wondering why I was crying,\u201d she said by phone from Madrid. \u201cMy children recognized him right away. They looked at the photo and said, \u2018That\u2019s our uncle.\u2019\u201dThe image was from the Caesar archive, parts of which activists had been posting online to identify victims.The defendants include Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa; Ali Mamlouk, head of the National Security Bureau; Gen. Jamil Hassan, head of air force intelligence; and senior officers at the prison where Ms. Hamdo believes her brother was detained and killed.Judges and prosecutors in France and Germany are also investigating war-crimes allegations against Syrian officials for possible prosecution in domestic courts.But even those working for war-crimes prosecutions face substantial barriers during a conflict.The road to the International Criminal Court appears blocked, and European courts have trouble getting access to the accused. So the best-case scenario is often an international warrant that could lead to the suspects\u2019 arrests should they set foot in a country willing to cooperate.\u201cThe problem as I see it is not so much what mechanism one can use to bring accountability, but how you actually get your hands on the people you want to prosecute,\u201d he said.The limited prospects for prosecution have led some to pursue other kinds of justice.Alex Whiting, a Harvard law professor, said accountability is a matter of politics and so far Syria has not been high in the world\u2019s priorities. But he has been surprised, tenuously, since the latest chemical attack.\u201cSuddenly there is a turn in the world against Assad, which could lead to him being pushed from power, opening a space for accountability in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s likely, but it certainly seems more possible.\u201dAn article last Sunday about efforts to investigate and prosecute cases of war crimes committed in Syria referred incorrectly to a case against Syrian officials that has been filed in a court in Spain. It is one of such cases pending, but not the only one. (Investigations are also open in France and Germany.)Anne Barnard reported from Istanbul; Beirut, Lebanon; Damascus, Syria; Geneva; and D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany; Ben Hubbard from Beirut; and Ian Fisher from Jerusalem. Reporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Karam Shoumali from Istanbul, and Somini Sengupta from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thousands of Russians Present Letters of Protest in Demonstrations", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Thousands of Russians lined up in cities across their country on Saturday to present letters of protest at government offices, the second widespread show of public discontent in two months.Some of the protests turned violent. Nearly 120 people were arrested in St. Petersburg, according to O.V.D. Info, an independent organization that tracks protest arrests, and there were scattered detentions in at least a half-dozen other cities. In Samara, a scheduled rally was canceled because of organizational roadblocks put up by the local government, and because a printer backed out at the last minute, Open Russia said.Pictures of the protest in St. Petersburg, which organizers said had attracted about 300 people, showed riot police officers hustling protesters onto buses, including one older woman holding a sign critical of President Vladimir V. Putin, which said, \u201cV. V. Putin \u2014 there is a way out \u2014 take a pension.\u201dThe overarching theme for the day was \u201cNadoel!\u201d or \u201cEnough!\u201d as in enough of Mr. Putin and his government. Signs and many petitions called on him not to seek a fourth term in next year\u2019s presidential election. He is expected to run, although he has yet to officially declare his plans.\u201cWe have Putin, we don\u2019t need food,\u201d read one sarcastic protest sign in the Siberian city of Tomsk, where some press reports said 500 people had taken part in the event.Before Saturday, Open Russia announced that it had organized protests in about 30 cities. Over all, the number of participants was smaller than the tens of thousands who turned out in about 80 cities for protests called by the main opposition leader, Aleksei A. Navalny, on March 26. Mr. Navalny has called for more demonstrations on June 12.In Moscow, the capital, hundreds of people holding petitions lined the sidewalk near the Kremlin administration building between Red Square and Staraya Ploshad, or Old Square. For a little more than two hours starting around 2 p.m., petitioners filed into a government office to present their letters, many of them written on the spot.In the days before the protest, the government had deployed construction equipment and barriers near the office that handles such letters, leaving organizers to believe the entrance would be blocked.After word went out that the letters were indeed being accepted, many more people arrived to stand in line. Organizers said that an early count found that at least 1,500 people had presented petitions in Moscow.\u201cWe must participate in such events to show the authority that more and more people whose rights are being violated are against this,\u201d a 30-year-old marketing specialist who identified herself only as Veronika said as she wrote her letter. Many participants were reluctant to give their names because of the legal problems faced by numerous people who took part in previous protests. \u201cI want to live in a country where laws are observed,\u201d she said.Another protester who declined to give his full name, Aleksandr, 26, said he had tried to start an emergency services company to work in gas fields and had been blocked at every turn. \u201cThey keep telling me that they don\u2019t have the budget, maybe because the prime minister stole $70 million dollars,\u201d he said, referring to recent accusations against Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev in a YouTube video produced by Mr. Navalny.\u201cThe government does not care about ordinary people \u2014 about our salaries, medication, our rights, nothing,\u201d Aleksandr said.Many of those presenting petitions acknowledged that the relatively low turnout and the government\u2019s general indifference meant the protests would probably not have much of an effect. But they said it was time to start pushing back against an erosion of civil liberties and the country\u2019s poor economic performance.Open Russia\u2019s Facebook page had a few suggestions about subjects to be addressed in the petitions, including \u201cWe are tired of living on poverty-level salaries and pensions\u201d; \u201cWe are tired of listening to lies on television\u201d; and \u201cWe are tired of driving on bad roads.\u201dUnder Russian law, the government is supposed to respond to such letters in 30 days. Two women who were accepting petitions assigned each one a number and gave the writer a slip of paper with a telephone number to call. Few expected answers, especially to the many letters calling on Mr. Putin to quit.\u201cThey will probably answer that the writer was not suggesting any exact problem so thank you very much,\u201d said Aleksandr Y. Soloviev, 29, the chairman of Open Russia.The group\u2019s founder, Mr. Khodorkovsky, a former chairman of the oil giant Yukos, spent several years in prison before being pardoned by Mr. Putin in 2013. Since then, he has lived abroad, becoming one of the Kremlin\u2019s most outspoken critics.Mr. Navalny appears to have hit a public nerve with a series of videos accusing senior government officials of widespread corruption.His latest video focused on what he said was a group of four bogus charities that spend more than $66 million annually to maintain a series of luxurious residences for the prime minister.Mr. Navalny was doused with green dye for a second time on Thursday, and one eye required medical treatment. He appeared on his YouTube channel afterward, tinted slightly green, to answer questions from around the country.He expressed support for the idea of submitting petitions on Saturday, but he said he doubted that doing so would produce any positive results.Asked about the Saturday protest last week, Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, noted that it was illegal and would be dealt with accordingly. The police in Moscow repeatedly ordered anyone lingering on the sidewalk to move on, but otherwise treated the protesters respectfully.A day earlier, the government had declared Open Russia, which has its headquarters in Britain, an \u201cundesirable\u201d organization, making it illegal for the parent organization to operate in Russia. The main reason cited for the designation was that the group had organized protests.On Friday, Ren TV, a Russian television channel that serves as a cheerleader for the Kremlin, broadcast a documentary that portrayed Open Russia as a collection of criminals and drug addicts who cultivate ties with the United States.No reports about Saturday\u2019s protests appeared on Rossiya 24, the main cable news channel. Reports included one about the opening of Fountain Season in the capital, with the water being turned on after the long winter freeze, as well as the bike-sharing system.There also seemed to be a less-than-subtle message directed at the protesters, whom the government often accuses of being financed from abroad. The cable station showed a documentary about treacherous military officers who served the enemy during World War II.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the cancellation of a planned rally in Samara. Open Russia said it was canceled because the local government put up organizational roadblocks and a printer backed out, not because of a heavy police presence.An article on Sunday, about demonstrations in Russia, misquoted an outspoken critic of the Kremlin, Aleksei A. Navalny. In a recent video, Mr. Navalny said that four charities had spent $66 million to maintain luxury residences for Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, not $66 billion. The incorrect figure was repeated in a quote attributed to a protester.Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Union Square Cafe Returns, With More Than a Dash of D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review9 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The bartender assured her that it was. \u201cIf we ever took it off the menu, we\u2019d have a riot on our hands,\u201d he said.The item in question was a salad of red-tipped oakleaf and Bibb lettuces, with some fresh and springy croutons and whitecaps of grated Gruy\u00e8re on top. It is a very nice salad, a model of good behavior. It does not bring to mind images of mob violence. This is Union Square Cafe, though, a place that from the beginning has inspired attachments of a peculiar intensity.Other restaurants have customers; Union Square Cafe has fans, and knows it. Almost everything about the new place caters to their memories of the original, fetishizing the restaurant\u2019s own idiosyncrasies to an amazing degree. It\u2019s almost a museum to itself. If you\u2019re not part of the fan base, you might feel a bit like somebody who goes to see \u201cRogue One\u201d without ever having seen \u201cStar Wars.\u201dThe upstairs bar top where my cocktail rested was precisely the size of the old upstairs bar top because it was, in fact, the same piece of wood with a fresh coat of varnish. The art collection has come along for the ride, too, and one of the pleasures of the Rockwell layout is the way you seem to bump into a Frank Stella or a Claes Oldenburg or a Judy Rifka every time you turn around.The cellar stocks wines from Italy, France and the United States, and nowhere else. As Jason Wagner, the wine director, explained one night, those are the countries that were on the list when Union Square Cafe opened in 1985.The menu does not go so far as to point out all the old showstoppers \u2014 some from Michael Romano\u2019s reign in the kitchen and others from that of the current chef, Carmen Quagliata \u2014 but the servers are happy to help. Do I even need to say this? It\u2019s the most famous thing about Union Square Cafe: The servers are always happy to help.I hadn\u2019t realized the salad was a cult object, but I did know about the gnocchi. In this case, I stand with the cult. They are not so much gnocchi as little cushions of ricotta that have been tricked into holding their cylindrical shape only for as long as it takes to move them from the plate to the mouth.Consider me a fanboy when it comes to the ideally crunchy fritto misto, and the polenta, too, a $13 bowl of warm fluff that has absorbed its weight, and then some, in milk and creamy young cow\u2019s milk cheese. With maitake mushrooms and shiny green pesto, it\u2019s so filling and likable that you could make a meal of it and walk away more content than if you\u2019d had a 12-course tasting somewhere else.The risk in churning out old recipes like this is that the kitchen becomes bored, and the food boring. That\u2019s not happening at Union Square Cafe right now; the cooks seem to have dialed right in on the qualities that made these dishes favorites in the first place.Union Square Cafe has always been the offspring of a mixed marriage between a trattoria and a bistro, with an American bar and grill somewhere in the family tree. In the current phenotype, the trattoria genes are dominant.There is a wonderfully tender and gentle rabbit sugo, tossed with bands of pappardelle. Mr. Quagliata\u2019s pasta work can be just as satisfying when he carves out new traditions, tossing tubes of rigatoni with roasted carrots and sizzled scallions and chiles, then brightening the flavors with a spoonful of yogurt.A little less thrilling was a lasagna Bolognese that has been rotated off the menu for the time being; while the pasta sheets were as thin and light as any Italian could hope for, the flavors in the meat sauce weren\u2019t as developed as they might have been.Though I split that lasagna with somebody else so we could have traditional appetizer-primi-secondi meals, the mains are so imposing that a simple two-course plan is the wiser path. I was nearly done in by a braised lamb shank, although the bright salsa verde helped spur me along. Even the choices that sound lighter, like red snapper sandwiched between a thatch of shaved puntarelle and a bed of chickpea pur\u00e9e, or a flattened half-chicken, with cumin and dried chiles embedded in its surface and slabs of white sweet potato peeking out from below, are best tackled with an undented appetite.After all: There will be dessert, and it will not be a minor event, especially if somebody at your table has strong memories of the panna cotta (beautiful; the pastry chef, Daniel Alvarez, surrounds it with citrus segments and granola), or the pumpkin bread pudding (more bread than pudding when I last saw it), or the fantastic tart topped with a caramelized puff of banana so soft it seems to have blown apart.Sometimes Union Square Cafe\u2019s eagerness to please has something close to the opposite effect. When a server suggested with wide-eyed eagerness that I might like \u201ca very cold glass of milk\u201d with the espresso-chocolate cake, chills went down my spine, and not chills of anticipation. The last time I drank milk with a meal, I was wearing footed pajamas.Then I\u2019d remember how happy the service had made one of my guests, who had shown up before me, but still about 30 seconds too late to grab a seat at the downstairs bar. She spun around in agitation for a moment, but a manager spotted her and offered to call upstairs to see if there were any open bar stools there.The restaurant is far too nice to be polarizing, but it won\u2019t be everybody\u2019s cold glass of milk. Diners from the Instagram generation might want more crunch, more adventure or more spontaneity. I hope that as it settles into its new home, it gets a little less self-referential. But even now, it has a combination of energy and well-honed familiarity that\u2019s rare in Manhattan.

{"Headline": "Reporting on Brexit From the House of Commons", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported by\u2018I Was There\u2019LONDON \u2014 As he watched Prime Minister Theresa May rise from her seat to brief a crammed House of Commons about the start of the \u201cBrexit\u201d process, Stephen Castle experienced what might be called d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 had that not been too European a term for such a Euroskeptic occasion.A quarter of a century earlier Mr. Castle was in the same green-bench chamber when another Conservative prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, declared \u201cNo, no, no\u201d to further integration with Europe. She was promptly ousted by her own party because her colleagues feared she was out of touch with the public mood on Europe and other issues.Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s removal was ruthless \u2014 she never lost a general election \u2014 but then Britain\u2019s Parliament has for centuries been a highly adversarial place. When in full cry it is akin to the bear pits and bare-knuckled boxing rings that were a feature of London in the Victorian Era when the iconic modern building was raised upon a site associated with the business of establishing consent between governor and governed for nearly a millennium.Although other issues arouse strong passions at Westminster, none matches those stirred up by the relationship between Britain and Europe.So Theresa May\u2019s declaration on March 29 that Britain had formally begun the process of leaving the European Union was for Mr. Castle, a Times reporter based in London, the final culmination of a long drawn-out drama.\u201cThe issue of Europe has in one way or another destroyed every other Conservative prime minister since Margaret Thatcher,\u201d said Mr. Castle. \u201cTo me it seems like the party has been fighting about this for a quarter of a century and this was the culmination.\u201dBut the two historic moments illustrate the very different kinds of parliamentary drama that the British system produces.Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s downfall was a surprise, said Mr. Castle, a politically fatal blow delivered by her seemingly unassuming deputy prime minister Geoffrey Howe, who used rhetoric no more incendiary than mildly amusing cricketing metaphors.\u201cThe Thatcher moment was more of a personal drama,\u201d Mr. Castle recalled. \u201cGeoffrey Howe had this very downbeat, deadpan delivery. He spoke in a very civilized manner. One of his opponents once joked that being attacked by him was like being savaged by a dead sheep. But he then produced this one speech that was absolutely devastating, and it drew audible gasps of shock and surprise.\u201dBy contrast, he said, Theresa May\u2019s moment of saying no to Europe \u201cwas not a surprise \u2014 everyone knew it was coming. But it was a national occasion.\u201d\u201cIt has got to be classified as a historic moment,\u201d he said. \u201cFor four decades, Britain has been integrating more and more with its neighbors in Europe, and this was a sudden jolt; it was a sudden departure. So this has to be one of the biggest decisions in British history since the Second World War.\u201dInterviewed as part of the new Times video interactive series \u201cI Was There,\u201d Mr. Castle was asked by one Facebook Live commenter, Kitti Rouk, if Britain was being selfish by leaving Europe.Brexit supporters, said Mr. Castle, \u201cwould argue that actually it is going to be doing the European Union a favor, because this is going to regenerate democracy in Europe.\u201d Pro-Europeans, however, believe that Brexit will damage both Britain and Europe.\u201cThis is one of the questions that actually we will only find out in due course, whether this galvanizes Europe to stay together and to carry on the path it was, or whether it\u2019s the beginning of the fragmentation of Europe, which it may well be,\u201d Mr. Castle said._____Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New G.O.P. Health Proposal Evokes the Old Days", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byPublic HealthThe proposal, offered by leaders of libertarian and centrist groups within the House Republican caucus, would allow states to waive key insurance rules imposed by the Affordable Care Act if they believe the changes could lower premiums or advance other state goals. The proposal retains the health law\u2019s promise that people with pre-existing health conditions can still buy insurance. But the protection would be largely technical.States could waive a closely related rule that requires insurers to charge the same prices to healthy and sick customers of the same age. States could also exempt insurers from offering the \u201cessential health benefits\u201d currently required. To compensate, states would have to set up special insurance markets for sick customers called high risk pools.To get an idea of what such a world might look like, please join me in my time machine as we travel back to 2011.At that time, the Affordable Care Act had been passed, but most of its key provisions hadn\u2019t kicked in. Insurers could charge different prices to customers, depending on their health history. And patients who were shut out of the traditional market had access to a high-risk pool.There were a lot of questions. In addition to a multi-page form, asking about prior diagnoses, prescriptions, height, weight, occupation and other details, many customers were asked to fill out supplementary questionnaires about their health problems. Anyone who answered \u201cyes\u201d to a question about a history of allergies, for example, would get follow-up questions \u2014 and sometimes be asked for more medical records or a doctor\u2019s note.Customers were slotted into different categories, depending on their answers. The most healthy were called \u201cSuper Preferred,\u201d and could get a 7 percent discount on the standard premium. The least healthy were called \u201cModified 5,\u201d and were charged three times the standard rate. (This was at a time when anyone receiving treatment for, say, acne or osteoarthritis, or with blood cholesterol above 260, could be denied coverage altogether, so least healthy was relative.)Height and weight calculations also affected premium prices, and not just for adults. If your child was 3 feet 2 inches tall and weighed more than 62 pounds, the price of insurance would rise.Some plans would make you get a physical if you hadn\u2019t been to the doctor in a while.The only way to find out the price of a given plan was to fill out all the forms, and wait for an answer. Other insurers had different questions and different cutoffs for price changes. And the various plans, freed from standard benefit requirements, often covered substantially different health services.This system was tedious for everyone, but ended up being a pretty good deal for the super-preferred customers of the world. If you were fortunate enough to have required little medical care in the past, and you didn\u2019t smoke, or you didn\u2019t weigh too much or didn\u2019t work a dangerous job, you could buy insurance that was less expensive than what you can find today in many markets.People with health problems, even relatively minor ones, often paid much higher prices. And insurance tended not to cover services not required by states \u2014 like addiction treatment or pregnancy care.In states with waivers, the health insurance market of the future might look substantially like the market of the past, where buying health insurance meant jumping through various hoops and where sicker patients struggled to find affordable coverage.The bill would also substantially reduce federal funding for state Medicaid programs, and revamp the federal subsidy system used to make insurance affordable for middle-income Americans who buy their own coverage. The bill would make insurance more expensive for Americans who are poorer and older, but more affordable for people who are younger and richer.A comparison of the House Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare and the current law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea Seeks to Assure Citizens U.S. Won\u2019t Strike North Pre-emptively", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Reacting to worries and conjecture spreading in South Korea of a possible pre-emptive American military strike on nuclear-armed North Korea, the government sought to reassure citizens on Tuesday that there would be no such attack without its consent.Statements of reassurance from government officials came as a leading presidential candidate warned that no foreign countries, including the United States, should bring war to the Korean Peninsula.Anxiety and rumormongering among South Koreans that the Trump administration would answer the North\u2019s messages of nuclear belligerence with a military strike have intensified over the last week.Mr. Trump added to the worries on Tuesday with Twitter messages declaring that if the Chinese would not help, \u201cwe will solve the problem without them!\u201dAlthough officials in South Korea have said the United States would never attack the North without first consulting the South Korean government, the confluence of events has revived fears of such a possibility.\u201cThe United States makes it clear that it will not take a new policy or measure without consultations with us,\u201d Cho June-hyuck, a spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said on Tuesday when asked by reporters about the rumors.Moon Sang-gyun, a Defense Ministry spokesman, also warned that South Koreans should not be \u201cdeluded\u201d by unfounded rumors spreading online.\u201cThe safety of South Korea is as important as that of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should never be a pre-emptive strike without South Korean consent.\u201d\u201cNeighboring countries are taking advantage of the absence of a president in South Korea to try to exclude us and handle issues on the Korean Peninsula according to their own understanding,\u201d Mr. Moon said, without blaming the Trump administration by name.Although South Koreans generally consider the United States their most important ally in deterring North Korea, they remain deeply wary of any American moves that they fear will raise tensions and even rekindle war. The Korean Peninsula remains technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War was halted by an armistice, not a peace treaty.The United States and South Korea would together win any war against North Korea, but many fear catastrophic devastation to South Korea, especially Seoul. The capital city \u2014 home to 10 million people and surrounded by satellite cities with another 10 million residents \u2014 lies within the range of North Korean artillery, rockets and short-range missiles amassed along the border.In 1994, not long after the nuclear crisis first flared with North Korea, President Bill Clinton considered launching an attack on the North\u2019s main nuclear complex in Yongbyon north of Pyongyang, the capital, according to the South Korean president at the time, Kim Young-sam. Panic swept through South Korea, with people stocking up on food. Mr. Kim later said he had personally protested to Mr. Clinton, persuading Washington to drop the plan to strike Yongbyon.Since Kim Jong-un took power five years ago, North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests and nearly 50 ballistic missile tests. And in his New Year\u2019s Day speech, Mr. Kim said his country was in the \u201cfinal stage\u201d of preparing for its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile.Mr. Trump retorted at the time: \u201cIt won\u2019t happen!\u201dDefense analysts said there were too many constraints for the United States to launch a pre-emptive strike against North Korea without expecting a major retaliation. North Korea keeps most of its crucial military assets in tunnels, and it remains unclear whether the United States and South Korean military planners have located them all. There are also 200,000 American civilians, as well as 28,500 United States troops, living in South Korea, and their neighborhoods would probably be among the first targets of any North Korean retaliation.On Tuesday, North Korea\u2019s main state-run newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said that if the United States tried a pre-emptive strike, it would be \u201cas foolish as putting its own neck on the chopping block.\u201dIn another sign that North Korea has no intention of forsaking nuclear arms, top North Korean officials in Pyongyang gathered on Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of Mr. Kim\u2019s election as leader of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, and vowed to uphold his policy of strengthening the North\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the state news media reported. Also on Tuesday, Ri Su-yong, an 82-year-old Politburo member, former foreign minister, and adviser and childhood mentor to Mr. Kim, was given another powerful position in Parliament. Last year, Mr. Ri told Chinese officials that North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons expansion was \u201cpermanent.\u201dWith less than one month left before the presidential election in the South, how to deal with North Korea has become a dominant campaign issue.Mr. Ahn, the presidential candidate of the centrist People\u2019s Party, has recently surged in popularity to rival Mr. Moon in a neck-and-neck race. Many conservative voters who were disappointed by Ms. Park\u2019s conservative camp are supporting Mr. Ahn, whom they consider tougher on North Korea than Mr. Moon, political analysts said.China has vehemently opposed the deployment, calling it a threat to its own security, and South Korean shops, movies and TV dramas have been boycotted by many Chinese in recent months.On Tuesday, Mr. Moon said if North Korea froze its nuclear weapons program and returned to negotiations, the deployment of the so-called Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, could be suspended. But if North Korea conducts its sixth nuclear test and advances its nuclear weapons program, he warned, the deployment will become \u201cinevitable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He now works for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency tasked with finding and deporting people living in the United States illegally.His last Twitter post, on Jan. 20, read simply: \u201cIt\u2019s time to make immigration policy great again.\u201dIt's time to make immigration policy great again.For years, a network of immigration hard-liners in Washington was known chiefly for fending off proposals to legalize the status of more people. But with the election of a like-minded president, these groups have moved unexpectedly from defense to offense, with some of their leaders now in positions to carry out their agenda on a national scale.Julie Kirchner, who served for a decade as executive director of the organization, also known as FAIR, is now working as an adviser to the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. Kellyanne Conway, before she was known for campaign work and spirited defenses of Mr. Trump on cable television, worked regularly as a pollster for FAIR.\u201cYou would have to go to the 1920s and 1930s to find a comparable period in which you could point to people within the executive agencies and the White House who favored significant restrictions,\u201d Mr. Tichenor said.Their influence is already being felt. Mr. Trump is known for his sound-bite-ready pledges to deport millions of people here illegally and to build a border wall, but some of the administration\u2019s more technical yet critical changes to immigration procedures came directly from officials with long ties to the hard-line groups.These include expanding cooperation between immigration agents and local law enforcement officials; cracking down on \u201csanctuary cities\u201d; making it more difficult for migrants to successfully claim asylum; allowing the Border Patrol access to all federal lands; and curtailing the practice of \u201ccatch and release,\u201d in which undocumented immigrants are released from detention while their cases plod through the courts.\u201cTrump has put together the people who are taking this thing down to the operating-instruction level,\u201d Mr. Stein said.Even those who have labored for decades to scale back immigration did not expect such a dramatic change. \u201cThis is inconceivable a year ago,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s almost inconceivable six months ago.\u201dWhen Mr. Feere asked him for a leave of absence to work on the Trump campaign, Mr. Krikorian said he granted it without necessarily expecting it to lead anywhere. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t think that would pan out,\u201d he said, but recalled telling Mr. Feere, \u201cLook, you know we\u2019ve always got a job for you if it doesn\u2019t work out.\u201dDr. Tanton came under sharp criticism for corresponding with white nationalists and for couching the fight to reduce immigration as a racial and demographic struggle. \u201cFor European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that,\u201d Dr. Tanton once wrote to a friend, elsewhere expressing his fear of a \u201cLatin onslaught.\u201dThe Southern Poverty Law Center has long been especially critical of FAIR, which had in the past received money from the Pioneer Fund, a foundation that has financed research on the relationship between race and intelligence. Mr. Stein of FAIR rejected the attacks as politically motivated, prompted by the group\u2019s success in helping defeat an immigration overhaul in Congress.This month, FAIR filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service accusing the Southern Poverty Law Center of committing \u201cflagrant and intentional\u201d violations of its tax-exempt status by criticizing Republican candidates during the 2016 presidential race.Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said it never crossed the line into improper political activity. \u201cI think we have an obligation to expose hate not just in the dark corners of our society but also in the mainstream,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten under FAIR\u2019s skin many times, and now they feel like they have allies in the administration and they\u2019re going for it.\u201dAlthough immigration advocates call them xenophobic, people at all three groups say they do not like to be labeled anti-immigrant; the Center for Immigration Studies uses the motto \u201clow immigration, pro-immigrant\u201d on its website. They say they just expect to see the nation\u2019s immigration laws enforced and that those living here illegally are caught and deported.They also say they want legal immigration brought down to what they view as more sustainable levels, in particular to help buoy the wages of lower-income Americans who compete with unskilled migrants on the bottom rungs of the work force.\u201cThe average American basically likes the idea of immigration, maybe loves the concept \u2014 it\u2019s played an important historic role in our history \u2014 but would be perfectly fine if we didn\u2019t have another immigrant for 50 years,\u201d Mr. Stein said.FAIR lobbies members of Congress and their staff from its offices on Massachusetts Avenue, a short walk from Capitol Hill, while maintaining strong contacts with talk-radio hosts. There is even a radio studio in the group\u2019s office.With roughly two dozen staff members and fellows, the Center for Immigration Studies provides research, filling the traditional think-tank role.\u201cWe feel like we are going to continue to need to bring grass-roots influence on this administration because there\u2019s a lot of competing interests,\u201d said Mr. Beck of NumbersUSA.\u201cThe biggest enemy we face right now is complacency,\u201d Mr. Stein of FAIR said, \u201cbecause Trump\u2019s people have our ideas.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Did you finish it? Did you learn anything, despite your dislike?Think about required reading, and the demands it places on your time, your brainpower and your emotions. Are there any hidden benefits to required reading assignments?Here\u2019s a reading challenge: Pick up a book you\u2019re pretty sure you won\u2019t like \u2014 the style is wrong, the taste not your own, the author bio unappealing. You might even take it one step further. Pick up a book you think you will hate, of a genre you\u2019ve dismissed since high school, written by an author you\u2019re inclined to avoid. Now read it to the last bitter page.Sound like hell? You\u2019re off to a good start.This is not about reading a book you know is bad, a pleasure in its own right, like an exceptionally dashing villain. It\u2019s about finding a book that affronts you, and staring it down to the last word.At a time when people are siloed into narrow sources of information according to their particular tinted worldview \u2014 those they follow on Twitter, the evening shoutfest they choose, AM talk radio or NPR \u2014 it\u2019s no surprise most of us also read books we\u2019re inclined to favor. Reading is a pleasure and a time-consuming one. Why bother reading something you dislike?But reading what you hate helps you refine what it is you value, whether it\u2019s a style, a story line or an argument. Because books are long-form, they require more of the writer and the reader than a talk show or Facebook link. You can finish watching a movie in two hours and forget about it; not so a novel. Sticking it out for 300 pages means immersing yourself in another person\u2019s world and discovering how it feels. That\u2019s part of what makes books you despise so hard to dismiss. Rather than toss the book aside, turn to the next page and wrestle with its ideas. What about them makes you so uncomfortable?\u2014 Have you ever voluntarily chosen a book you disliked for recreational reading? Why or why not? If so, did you read it to the end? And what did you learn in the process?\u2014 How are readers benefited by seeking out and finishing books they dislike?\u2014 In your own future reading life, will you make it a personal goal to read books you are sure you will not enjoy?

{"Headline": "Outspoken Maldives Blogger Who Challenged Radical Islamists Is Killed", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Supported byMAL\u00c9, Maldives \u2014 A liberal blogger who wrote satirical critiques of the Maldivian government and the spread of radical Islam died Sunday after being stabbed in the stairway of his apartment building.The blogger, Yameen Rasheed, 29, had complained repeatedly to the police about receiving death threats, he said in an interview with The New York Times this year, adding that the police often failed to return his calls or dropped his complaints without investigation.The police said that Mr. Rasheed was found with multiple stab wounds in his apartment building in the capital, Mal\u00e9, shortly before 3 a.m. He was rushed to Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital and died soon after.The Republic of Maldives, a nation of nearly 1,200 islands southwest of India, is best known as a spectacular vacation destination. But the country, with fewer than 400,000 people, has also become a source of recruits for the Islamic State. The government said at least 49 Maldivians had traveled to Syria to fight with the group, also known as ISIS; a 2015 study by an international security firm said the number was about 200.The population, which is predominantly Sunni Muslim, has traditionally been liberal in its interpretation of Islam, with women rarely covering their heads. But a more conservative strain of Islam has spread in recent years under the increasing influence of Saudi Arabia, which sends religious leaders to the Maldives and offers scholarships to Maldivian students to study at Saudi universities.A spokeswoman for the hospital, Zeenath Ali Habeeb, said Mr. Rasheed had been brought in at 3:15 a.m. with multiple stab wounds, having lost a lot of blood. He was unconscious and had a very weak pulse, she said, and he died while being treated.His father, Hussain Rasheed, told the local news media that his son had been stabbed 16 times in the chest, neck and head.\u201cWe condemn this action in the harshest terms,\u201d President Abdulla Yameen said in a statement. \u201cAll resources of the state will be utilized to bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice.\u201dMr. Yameen said he had ordered a review of the procedures for investigating threats against journalists to make sure they are acted upon \u201cswiftly\u201d and in a \u201cmanner that ensures safety for everyone.\u201dThree former presidents of the Maldives appealed for a speedy and thorough investigation into Mr. Rasheed\u2019s death.Amnesty International noted that the killing of Mr. Rasheed took place against the backdrop of the Maldivian authorities\u2019 growing restrictions on public debate.\u201cThis crackdown has intensified in recent weeks and must end immediately,\u201d the organization said. \u201cAuthorities should protect those who speak out, not try to criminalize them.\u201dIn his interview with The Times in January, Mr. Rasheed described how bloggers like himself and Mr. Abdulla were targeted by radicalized gangs in the Maldives, from which jihadists recruit fighters for the Islamic State.Mr. Rasheed said that nearly all of the 20 members of the group committed to finding Mr. Abdulla had received death threats, from people who brandished knives in public or through text messages. The messages were often graphic and called for their beheading.Friends described Mr. Rasheed as soft-spoken, funny and fiercely committed to finding Mr. Abdulla and seeking justice for his family. Celine Peroni, Mr. Rasheed\u2019s girlfriend, said he was \u201cjust the smartest, wittiest and sweetest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201dMs. Peroni said she and Mr. Rasheed had often talked about the death threats, which intensified in December when his name began circulating as a person of interest within extremist groups. She asked him to take cabs home at night, and Mr. Rasheed was always careful to walk in view of CCTV cameras.Recently, however, Mr. Rasheed \u201cwas feeling more relaxed,\u201d Ms. Peroni said, and the couple had booked a summer vacation to Sri Lanka. He had even started walking home again instead of taking cabs, she said.\u201cHe was aware of the threats, but cautious,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wanted the voice of the truth to be heard, despite the risks.\u201dHassan Moosa reported from Mal\u00e9, and Kai Schultz from New Delhi.

This film, directed by James Ponsoldt, is an adaptation of Dave Eggers\u2019s 2013 novel, and the two collaborated on the screenplay. Mr. Eggers\u2019s book is both a satire and a cautionary tale, grafting surveillance-state mechanisms to a faux-progressive vision with pronounced cult leanings \u2014 a lot of its \u201cjoin us\u201d vibe feels passed down from Philip Kaufman\u2019s 1978 version of \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d a tale set, like the one here, in the San Francisco Bay Area.Mr. Ponsoldt\u2019s movie begins with its heroine, Mae (Emma Watson), trapped in a stale cubicle doing meaningless dunning labor for a meaningless company; in due time, she\u2019s doing much more high-tech \u201ccustomer experience\u201d work at the Circle, an internet service that seems to meld all the most annoying features of Google, Facebook, Twitter, you name it. Adding to the forced-extroversion fun is a new invention, a multipurpose webcam that\u2019s the relative size and shape of an eyeball. \u201cKnowing is good but knowing everything is better,\u201d crows one of the company\u2019s principals, a Steve Jobs-like visionary named Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks).That maxim also appears in the novel, and it sticks in the craw, not least because any first-year graduate student in philosophy could demolish it. At what point did the Circle put a hiring freeze on anyone conversant with epistemology? Lampooning the simple-mindedness of utopian web clich\u00e9s was arguably part of Mr. Eggers\u2019s point, but much of that point is often muddled in the book. And it\u2019s simply incoherent in the movie. The novel is at its most trenchantly funny when depicting the exhausting nature of virtual social life, and it\u2019s in this area, too, that the movie gets its very few knowing laughs. But it\u2019s plain, not much more than 15 minutes in, that without the story\u2019s paranoid aspects you\u2019re left with a conceptual framework that\u2019s been lapped three times over by the likes of, say, the Joshua Cohen novel \u201cBook of Numbers,\u201d or the HBO comedy series \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201dYou\u2019re also left with oodles and oodles of bad acting and bad dialogue. Ms. Watson has to spend way too much time looking concerned while staring at various screens. Ellar Coltrane, who was so unaffectedly appealing as he grew up onscreen in Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cBoyhood,\u201d can\u2019t find any footing in the role of Mae\u2019s Mr. Integrity ex-boyfriend. It doesn\u2019t help that he has to mouth lines like \u201cWe used to go on adventures and have fun and see things, and you were brave and exciting.\u201dMr. Hanks evokes an idea of avuncular visionary charm, and doesn\u2019t have much to do beyond that. And John Boyega \u2014 playing a character who was vital in the book but whose role has been reconfigured so that his function in the movie makes no sense \u2014 mostly stands around at the rear of auditoriums, backlit, and when called upon to speak does a very creditable Denzel Washington impersonation.A film review on Friday about \u201cThe Circle,\u201d an adaptation of the Dave Eggers novel, misstated the year the book was released.

{"Headline": "Trump Signs Order That Could Lead to Curbs on Foreign Workers", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byAfter recent policy reversals that have angered his populist base, Mr. Trump described the visa program as an initiative gone awry that has driven down wages for Americans. The order was a means to end the \u201ctheft of American prosperity,\u201d which he said had been brought on by low-wage immigrant labor.Yet the order calls for a series of relatively modest steps, like a multiagency report on changes needed for the H-1B program, under which the government admits 85,000 foreign workers annually, many of them in the high-tech, industrial, medical and science fields. Collectively, the efforts outlined in the order could take years to carry out.The H1-B program has become a focus in the debate over the impact of foreign workers. Mr. Trump has criticized employers for abusing the program and using it to avoid hiring higher-paid American counterparts. He vowed to revamp its lottery-based selection process.The order, signed at the sprawling Snap-on tool factory here, represents a small win for bigger tech companies, which have been in pitched battles for those visas. Companies like Google and Microsoft, which rely heavily on high-skilled foreign workers, had worried that President Trump would make drastic curbs to worker programs that could cripple them.\u201cI think people are cautiously optimistic that this will be O.K., and maybe even better,\u201d said Tom Alberg, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle firm that invests in high-tech start-ups.But the order would likely hurt the biggest users of the visa program, technology outsourcing firms that bring foreign workers to the United States to perform technical jobs, typically from India.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump stoked outrage from his supporters with accounts of companies like Walt Disney forcing laid-off technical workers to train their overseas replacements.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump spoke in terms of an apple-pie populism that helped him pull off upset victories in November in Midwestern states like Wisconsin.H-1B visas \u201cshould include only the most skilled and highest-paid applicants and should never, ever be used to replace American workers,\u201d Mr. Trump told a gathering of about 500 workers and local luminaries, including the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who hails from Kenosha.On this point, many executives at American technology companies agree with Mr. Trump. They argue that they mostly apply for H-1Bs for workers when they can\u2019t find qualified American workers, usually those with advanced degrees like a masters or Ph.D.In recent years, there has been so much demand for H-1B visas that the whole fiscal year\u2019s allocation has run out in a few days in April, when applications are accepted. The visas are then awarded by lottery to qualified applicants. Some 600,000 to 900,000 immigrants are currently in the United States on H-1B visas, researchers estimate.Outsourcing firms \u2014 the top 13 of which accounted for a third of all granted visas in 2014, the last year for which information is publicly available \u2014 typically flood the system with visa applications. The top recipients were Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro, all from India.India\u2019s leading tech trade group, the National Association of Software and Services Companies, said Indian companies were being treated unfairly. \u201cWe believe that the current campaign to discredit our sector is driven by persistent myths, such as the ideas that H-1B visa holders are \u2018cheap labor\u2019 and \u2018train their replacements,\u2019 neither of which is accurate,\u201d the group said in a statement.Companies like Microsoft, Intel and Amazon are also big recipients. At least 15 percent of the American workforces of Facebook and the chip maker Qualcomm hold H-1Bs, according to the most recent documents the companies have filed with the Labor Department.\u201cThis does nothing,\u201d said Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cLike all the other executive orders, it\u2019s just words \u2014 he\u2019s calling for new studies. It\u2019s not going to fix the problem. It\u2019s not going to create a single job.\u201dRepresentative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat whose district includes Silicon Valley, said the issue of foreign workers was real, but dismissed the president\u2019s order as poorly targeted and unlikely to achieve its desired result.\u201cHalf of the start-ups in Silicon Valley were created by highly skilled people from other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president and his staff fully appreciates that fact.\u201dIn a briefing with reporters on Monday, White House officials said the \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d order would also overhaul federal procurement practices to increase the selection of products from American companies, especially in the domestic steel industry, which has faced stiff competition from China.One reform advocated by the Trump administration, which has drawn bipartisan support from Congress, would change the lottery system for awarding H-1B visas, giving extra preference to the highest-paying jobs \u2014 a proposal favored by many in the American technology industry.Representatives from Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google either declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Blake Irving, the chief executive of domain name and web hosting firm GoDaddy, said he supported the idea of changing the system for issuing H-1Bs to give priority to higher-skilled workers. He said GoDaddy typically receives only about 20 percent of the H-1B visas it applies for.\u201cIf anything, it moves the policy towards something that\u2019s preferential to the expert work force,\u201d said Mr. Irving. \u201cAnything that gets us closer to that is goodness.\u201dBut some smaller technology companies said they were concerned about the changes proposed by the Trump administration.Punit Soni, the chief executive of Learning Motors, a six-person company in Silicon Valley that is trying to apply artificial intelligence to health care, said the visa changes proposed by the Trump administration would hurt start-ups.Small companies cannot afford to pay high salaries and are already struggling to attract talent in a tight market, he said. A visa system that favors the highest-paid workers will steer immigrants only to already successful big companies like Google, his former employer.\u201cWe\u2019re a small start-up. Everyone is getting way below-market average salary,\u201d he said.Glen Thrush reported from Kenosha, Nick Wingfield from Seattle and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Inviting the Easter Bunny to the Seder", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byI went on my first Easter egg hunt a couple of years ago, hand in hand with my then 2-year-old son, Max. I\u2019ve got 44 years on him, but it was a first for both of us.In Jerusalem, where I grew up, the world of the Easter bunny, hot cross buns, roast lamb and simnel cake just did not exist for me. If someone had described an Easter egg hunt to me \u2014 \u201ckids rush around collecting chocolate eggs that have been hidden by a rabbit\u201d \u2014 I would have thought it strange. The concept of Easter was something distant, miles away from our own tradition of Pesach, or Passover.Without a doubt, though, our Seder in Israel would have seemed equally strange to the children tucking into their Easter lunch in Britain, where I live now. Why is a story \u2014 the Haggadah \u2014 told, and what does it mean? Why is the dining plate compartmentalized? What does one even do with lettuce leaves and radishes dipped in salty water? Most important, where\u2019s the chocolate?The traditions of Easter and Passover seemed worlds apart to me until that hand-in-hand moment with Max. We had been invited by friends to have lunch on Easter Sunday. At the end of the meal came the unqualified highlight: the big hunt for the little coveted eggs.My moment of connection came as I was delving around in the compost heap at the end of the garden. As I uncovered a gold foil-wrapped egg with Max, my own childhood memories of finding the afikoman \u2014 hidden earlier in the evening, inevitably, behind the sofa \u2014 came flooding back. Back then we were hunting for half a matzo, but the thrill was the same and there it was.At both Easter and Passover, the meal is more than just food. It is the bridge between generations and the signifier of a story. At Easter, the simnel cake is decorated with 11 balls of marzipan to represent all the apostles minus Judas. The lamb represents Abraham\u2019s sacrifice of his son, and Christ\u2019s sacrifice of his own life. At Passover, flat matzo, rather than regular leavened bread, recalls how the Jews were forced to leave Egypt in such a hurry that there was no time to wait for their bread to rise. Bitter herbs stand for suffering.My own favorite as a child was my Italian grandmother\u2019s haroseth. Hers was made of dates with a little bit of orange, dusted with cinnamon and dotted all over with long pine nuts, which made it look like a hedgehog. Tucking into a slice of simnel cake at that Easter lunch \u2014 as rich and dense with dried fruit and nuts as my grandmother\u2019s hedgehog haroseth \u2014 was a powerful madeleine moment.Whichever traditions we might be putting into practice over Easter weekend, or the eight days of Passover, they\u2019ll be serving two purposes. On the one hand, they are symbolic, providing a platform for all of us to connect with a shared story. On the other hand, these same traditions allow us to connect personally with the history we are making within our own family and circle of friends, last year and the year before that and the year before that, when the kids were very young.We haven\u2019t yet done a proper Seder meal for our children in London. Family-friendly though the celebration is, I know our boys would be in deep slumber well before any haroseth is spread over a piece of matzo. When we do, though, we will be seating the Easter bunny alongside the hedgehog. Such is my story and the story of my family: In order to live on, traditions need to be braided together to become something new. I offer two recipes to those baking, then, that are very different from each other.The casatiello is an Easter bread steeped in Neapolitan tradition. My grandmother may have been Italian, but she certainly wouldn\u2019t have been baking with flour for her Seder meal, nor serving pork products (at any time of the year). Casatiello is made the day after the big Easter feast in Italy, when there is leftover meat and cheese. Heading out for an Easter Monday picnic is also something of a ritual in Naples, so again, this bread makes sense: All of the fillings, baked as they are into the dough, are safely tucked in and won\u2019t fall out.Intended more for the Passover table, then, is the flour-free walnut cake. The necessity for unleavened cakes is the mother of great invention; in so many of my favorite cakes, ground nuts replace the typical flour.

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: When Twitter Confuses and Facebook Copies", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byBitsSo, back to Facebook. We\u2019ve talked about the frighteningly effective brazenness with which Facebook copies its competitors before. I don\u2019t really know what to say other than I stand in horrified awe. We\u2019ve just witnessed a pilfering on a historic scale. Snapchat\u2019s Stories is one of the most interesting and original new social features in years, but in the long run it\u2019s Facebook and its subsidiaries that may end up enjoying the most of this innovation.No one ever said the tech business was fair, I guess.One thing I wonder is how these employees fill their Stories with new fun stuff all the time. They\u2019re pretty much forced to look like they\u2019re living an amazing life at all hours in order to test the product. But if I were constantly filming Stories? It would be me hunched over my laptop, shoveling Indian food into my mouth.Does that make me weird?Am I missing something or is this very, very bad for Uber and the future of its self-driving program?Those two interests are not necessarily aligned. And as we saw this week, Levandowski\u2019s opting not to provide some evidence might actually hurt Uber (though Uber\u2019s lawyers say they can prove Uber is innocent even without Levandowski\u2019s help).Anyway, the whole thing is a complete mess. But it\u2019s fascinating to watch Uber and Levandowski slowly disentangle themselves from each other in public view.I\u2019m not sure what that means for self-driving initiatives at Uber. But if they are served with an injunction to stop working on driverless cars until the case is seen through, there\u2019s going to be about 1,000 Uber engineers with a whole lot of nothing to do.O.K., that\u2019s enough out of me. I hope you get some better sleep this weekend!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Everyone Has a Price\u2019: Readers React to Removal of Passenger From United Flight", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byCellphone videos of an unidentified man being dragged off a United Airlines flight on Sunday elicited outrage after passengers posted the videos on Twitter. The footage shows the man screaming as he was forced out of his seat by a security officer and dragged down the aisle by his arms. There was blood visible on his mouth, and his glasses and shirt were askew.Below is a selection of those comments, which have been edited for length and clarity.I\u2019m a retired United pilot. While I agree this was unnecessary roughness, there are several points to clarify.This was not mainline United Airlines. This was on a United Express flight, meaning the flight crew and agents work for a totally separate air carrier that flies smaller planes under contract by United Airlines.Just an educated hunch, not knowing the facts here, but it sounds like the four employees who were \u201cmust rides\u201d were going to Louisville to crew another aircraft, and this was a last-minute reassignment.But none of this supports throwing a passenger off a plane physically. I am speechless.Not an impressive move by United, and in the city of their headquarters. I used to be a United Global Services member, which (oddly) meant that they would remove someone from a flight if the flight was sold out and I wanted a seat on that flight. Apparently, this now extends to employees who want to hop from city to city. Shame on UAL.Same thing happened to me on a United flight some years ago. While I didn\u2019t get dragged down the aisle like him, I was \u201cescorted\u201d from the door of the aircraft back to the gate. When a few us reached the door to the aircraft, the flight attendants stopped me and said I couldn\u2019t board at the last minute because the flight was overbooked.When I protested, two female flight attendants on either side took both my arms and escorted me back to the gate. I was furious. After much wrangling, I was able to get back on the plane because I had a 9 a.m. job interview and it was the last plane out of Chicago to L.A. and someone was kind enough to let me have her seat. I have never taken another United flight again. For this \u201cassault,\u201d they gave me a $150 voucher which I tore up and threw away. They are reprehensible. By the way, I\u2019m Asian too.The man was disorderly and refusing to obey airline staff and police instructions. What were the cops supposed to do? Meekly tell him to have a nice day and walk off the plane? When the police are called in most cases like this they take some kind of action. This gentleman bears the responsibility for how this scene played out.I\u2019m trying to understand why airlines aren\u2019t required to simply keep upping their offer until they get volunteers. We supposedly live in a free market society and everyone has a price.Yes, they\u2019ll probably get into scenarios where they are losing money. Tough. They\u2019re breaking a contract with their customer; they should have to pay the price for that.I was once on a JetBlue flight that was overbooked. They offered a hotel room to whoever wanted to leave. When no one volunteered they upped the offer until someone did. They didn\u2019t drag someone out of their seat. This is no way to conduct a business.I was bumped off a flight once and was replaced by the airline\u2019s captain (or a first officer). I was on my way to my aunt\u2019s funeral, and before I departed the cabin I turned and pleaded with the other passengers if anyone could go off the plane so I could fly. No one offered. I was really [bummed] because I knew I might miss the funeral and family gathering.Of course I got a free round-trip ticket to use within the continental United States and luckily got on a flight one hour later. The first plane from which I was bumped ended up having landing gear issues! It had to dump all of its fuel and circle the airport while my plane landed just ahead of it.I saw those first plane passengers in baggage claim and they were all stressed and shook up. The guy who was seated next to me on the first plane saw me and acted like he had seen a ghost. That made my day. It is strange how sometimes getting bumped isn\u2019t all bad.I hope this ends up being the most expensive passenger \u201cbump\u201d in the history of United.They could have just offered more cash for willing volunteers. Instead, I hope this man sues. And the other three people who were made to leave should sue also.I am a cardiologist who has been asked to provide emergency care on two separate flights. I never received, or expected, anything in return. But is it too much to expect that they won\u2019t beat you?In what other industry can you pay hundreds of dollars for a service (that is often essential personally or professionally) and then have that service randomly revoked? So the airlines make a bit less money \u2014 they are already raking it in. Ending overbooking practices would not cost airlines anything except immoral profits at the expense of desperate travelers!I served on the board of a Chinese-American civil rights organization for 30 years. The organization routinely monitored dozens of incidents every year involving law enforcement and Asian-Americans due to racist perceptions that we\u2019re passive, docile, and never litigate or protest official misconduct or mistreatment.It\u2019s likely that this particular passenger wasn\u2019t randomly chosen but consciously selected because United thought he\u2019d be easy pickings, as a bespectacled Asian follows orders and goes quietly.I still am asked if I speak English or told that my English is pretty good for a \u201cChinaman.\u201d When I used to travel to Chapel Hill for work, I\u2019m asked if dogs are part of my diet.Older Chinese speak of the \u201cbitter tea\u201d we must drink in America, even if we\u2019re American. I wasn\u2019t aware it was a featured beverage on United. It\u2019s a taste the doctor will never get over.All the other passengers on the plane saw this going on and not one of them volunteered to take his place. Surely, there was at least one person on that plane who could show some flexibility in their travel arrangements? The whole situation is just appalling, for all involved.I\u2019m happy other passengers documented this violence.I\u2019d like to imagine that I would have stood in the aisle and blocked the officer. Imagine the aisle filled with other passengers blocking the exit.I don\u2019t think I am brave enough to have done that, but I need to think about what my actions should be in responding to all police violence. Are we just a society of video makers? Am I willing to step in before they shoot someone?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Le Pen\u2019s Inner Circle Fuels Doubt About Bid to \u2018Un-Demonize\u2019 Her Party", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Little more than a week before France\u2019s presidential election, Marine Le Pen remains a front-runner after working hard to sanitize the image of her party, the National Front, and to distance it from the uglier associations of Europe\u2019s far right.But descriptions of the inner workings of her party by present and former close Le Pen associates, as well as court documents, raise fresh doubts about the success and sincerity of those efforts.Two men in her innermost circle \u2014 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chatillon and Axel Loustau \u2014 are well-known former members of a violent, far-right student union that fought pitched battles with leftists and took a turn toward Hitler nostalgia in the mid-1990s.They have been associates of Ms. Le Pen since her days in law school in the 1980s and remain among her closest friends, according to numerous accounts.French television recently broadcast video from the 1990s of Mr. Loustau visiting an aging prominent former SS member, L\u00e9on Degrelle, a decorated warrior for Hitler and the founder of the Belgian Rex party, a prewar fascist movement.Some in the National Front flatly deny Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau are either anti-Semitic or nostalgic for the Third Reich, while others make no secret of avoiding them, precisely because of their taint.But their lingering presence in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s inner circle has called into question the sincerity of her strategy to \u201cun-demonize\u201d her party and renounce its heritage of deep-rooted anti-Semitism since she took over from her father, Jean-Marie, in 2011.\u201cBy the evidence,\u201d said the historian Nicolas Lebourg, a leading National Front specialist at the University of Montpellier, \u201cshe considers it\u2019s not something very important.\u201dThe two trusted men continue to work closely with the party\u2019s top leadership, including Ms. Le Pen. They have been charged by French prosecutors in an elaborate campaign-finance scheme that has been crucial to keeping the National Front afloat for years.The financial scandals have not dented Ms. Le Pen in the polls before the first round of voting on April 23. Potentially more damaging may be the recent revelations about the people she has surrounded herself with, in particular Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau.\u201cThey have remained National Socialist,\u201d said Aymeric Chauprade, once Ms. Le Pen\u2019s principal adviser on foreign affairs until a falling out, partly over his pro-Israel stance.\u201cThey are anti-Semites, nostalgic for the Third Reich, violently anticapitalist, with a hatred for democracy,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cPeople think they\u2019re marginal. But in fact, I discovered, she protects them. She supports them. They are at the heart of everything.\u201dMr. Chauprade recalled a dinner with Mr. Chatillon and others in the spring of 2014 that was \u201cfull of anti-Semitic jokes.\u201d But he added: \u201cThey are not joking. They are real Nazis.\u201dSeparately, an affidavit filed in a 2014 defamation lawsuit (later dropped) offers a fuller portrait of Mr. Chatillon\u2019s extremist views from that era.In the affidavit, Denis Le Moal, once a member of G.U.D., described Mr. Chatillon\u2019s nostalgia for the Third Reich and his closeness to Holocaust deniers.Mr. Le Moal told of a 1993 rally Mr. Chatillon organized for the student group in Paris that resounded with \u201cSieg Heils\u201d and Nazi salutes.\u201cDuring that period, every year, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chatillon organized a dinner on the birthday of the \u2018fuhrer,\u2019 April 20, to pay homage to \u2018this great man,\u2019\u201d the affidavit states.It goes on to describe a gathering in a Paris restaurant when Mr. Chatillon brought a painted portrait of Hitler \u2014 \u201ca portrait Chatillon showed us during the dinner, saying, \u2018My beloved fuhrer, he is magnificent,\u2019 and kissing the picture.\u201dIt says he also organized \u201cstriped-pajama\u201d parties as a student, an allusion to the clothing Jews wore in death camps and concentration camps.\u201cThe only debatable point, in the use of the term \u2018neo-Nazi,\u2019 is the wrongful qualifier \u2018neo,\u2019\u201d the affidavit states.Requests to arrange interviews with Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau through associates of theirs were unsuccessful. The men have made no secret of their disdain for journalists.\u201cTo hell with Hitler and the Third Reich!\u201d Mr. Chatillon wrote in a recent Facebook posting. \u201cBut to hell also with these \u2018journalists\u2019 who write whatever the hell they want.\u201dOn Twitter, Mr. Loustau denounced \u201cthese activists hiding behind a press card, benefiting from all the means of state television to try to destroy us.\u201dThe National Front\u2019s treasurer, Wallerand de Saint-Just, defended the men. \u201cIn no sense are they nostalgic for the Third Reich,\u201d he said.\u201cThey were turbulent boys, but they have become true professionals,\u201d Mr. Saint-Just said. \u201cThey work closely with us and we have confidence in them, in the conception, printing and delivery of campaign materials.\u201dThat role has been at the center of a campaign finance scandal that has haunted the National Front for years.Mr. Chatillon\u2019s company, Riwal, served as the exclusive supplier of campaign materials to the National Front in elections from 2012 to 2015. Prosecutors suspect it of systematically overcharging for posters, fliers and the like sold in campaign \u201ckits\u201d \u2014 and then, milking giant reimbursements from the state.Under French law, the state reimburses the campaign expenses of candidates who earn more than 5 percent of votes. Mr. Chatillon had refined the system to an art, according to a high-ranking French campaign finance official and Mr. Chauprade, as well as two new books that closely examine the National Front\u2019s finances.A printer would charge Riwal, say, 180 to 220 euros, or $191 to $233, for 400 posters; Riwal would then charge a small front party affiliated with the National Front, called Jeanne, \u20ac500 for the posters. Jeanne, in turn, would charge the candidates the inflated price.After the election, the candidates would claim reimbursement from the state for the inflated amount, and that reimbursement would be turned over to Jeanne.At least some of that money would wind up in the coffers of the National Front, according to the French campaign finance official, who requested anonymity because of the continuing presidential campaign.\u201cThey\u2019ve constructed an economy out of reimbursements from the state,\u201d said Mr. Chauprade, who has been interviewed by prosecutors about the party\u2019s financial affairs.Mr. Chauprade said he had been pressured by Ms. Le Pen herself to buy a kit, but refused, to the fury of party officials.The system operated through a number of recent election cycles \u2014 regional, municipal, legislative \u2014 from 2012 on. And most National Front candidates went along with it, the official said.Once the government oversight agency began to see a pattern of excessive amounts benefiting the National Front, it began to challenge them \u2014 knocking off more than \u20ac1 million in just one campaign, the official said.The National Front treasurer, Mr. Saint-Just, who has himself been charged with embezzlement in the scandal, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done anything wrong, and we think they will be acquitted.\u201dAs for Mr. Chauprade, \u201cHe\u2019s a profound traitor,\u201d Mr. Saint-Just said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to avenge himself.\u201dThe historian, Mr. Lebourg, cast no doubt on the recent revelations about the party, but agreed that Mr. Chauprade was \u201cnot exactly the Virgin Mary.\u201dMr. Chauprade was elected in 2014 as a National Front deputy in the European Parliament. There he was pursued by human rights groups for hate speech for issuing an anti-Islamist diatribe after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris in early 2015.Now on the outside, he has been willing to say aloud what many critics have long suspected about the National Front.\u201cIt is a mafia-like system,\u201d Mr. Chauprade told the newspaper Le Monde last month. \u201cYou stick an arm into it, you are stuck yourself.\u201dHe has also spoken to the police about a phony National Front jobs scheme at the European Parliament, which gives deputies expense money that can be used to pay support staff members.The European Parliament is now demanding that more than \u20ac1 million be returned from six people, including Ms. Le Pen, who are associated with the party. Ms. Le Pen, a European Parliament member, has invoked her parliamentary immunity, although French prosecutors said on Friday that investigators had asked the European Parliament to lift it.All of that money could be applied to National Front operations in France, giving Ms. Le Pen\u2019s party yet another boost. \u201cHer system was illegal,\u201d Mr. Chauprade said.Philippe P\u00e9ninque, a leader of the student movement G.U.D. in the 1970s who remains close to Ms. Le Pen, said he was confident the National Front would be vindicated in its financial scandals.In a lengthy interview at an outdoor cafe in the moneyed 16th Arrondissement of Paris, he also heaped scorn on journalists and others for writing about Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau. And he defended Mr. Chatillon\u2019s visit to the aging SS man, Mr. Degrelle \u2014 \u201cHe didn\u2019t open any concentration camps,\u201d he said.\u201cMy friends\u201d were all about \u201cupside-down humor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t respect anything.\u201dThey were neither Third Reich nostalgists nor any danger to the party, he said. \u201cMarine kicked out her father, and she keeps the Nazis?\u201d Mr. P\u00e9ninque asked incredulously.Mr. Chauprade is not so sure. \u201cShe sacrificed her father, and yet they are much more radical,\u201d he said of her inner circle, making a comparison to President Trump\u2019s senior adviser, Stephen K. Bannon.\u201cIf she enters the Elys\u00e9e\u201d \u2014 the French presidential palace \u2014 \u201cthey will enter as surely as Bannon has entered the Oval Office,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The attention of the very rich is of course focused elsewhere: on getting even richer.It is, however, unhistorical to say, as Deaton does, that \u201cthe coexistence of very rich and very poor leads to two possibilities. The rich can rule alone, disenfranchising or even enslaving the poor, or the poor can rise up and confiscate the wealth of the rich.\u201d The very rich have always controlled American government and continue to do so today. The advance of what we call democracy threw up challenges that the rich overcame, more or less openly in the 19th century but covertly today, as the tireless exertions of the Koch brothers and billionaires like them bear witness.In Europe, the poor, having been admitted little by little to the franchise, ever more vigorously challenged the rich from the later 19th century. Their intent was not, however, to rise up and dispossess the rich. They were bought off with the welfare state, with the rich still controlling the levers of power.The writer is a professor emeritus of history at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.\u2666To the Editor:I read Angus Deaton\u2019s review of Ganesh Sitaraman\u2019s \u201ccall to arms\u201d wondering whether America\u2019s income inequality today is truly that different from past eras. Deaton points to the \u201cachievements of the Progressive movement \u2026in taming inequality,\u201d but how does he handle slavery, indentured servitude and the almost nonexistent property rights of all women through much of our national history? By ignoring these factors and claiming \u201csome sketchy evidence that income and wealth inequality was indeed low in the 18th century.\u201d Only by ignoring the majority of the population could there be \u201cevidence\u201d for this claim.Our nation has always experienced vast \u201cincome inequality,\u201d but if our political system ruptures this time it will not be because income inequality is something new.\u2666\u2666\u2666To the Editor:Sarah Jaffe\u2019s review of Mary Otto\u2019s \u201cTeeth: The Story of Beauty, Inequality, and the Struggle for Oral Health in America\u201d (March 26) sheds some needed light on the rarely discussed position of dentistry in America\u2019s growing health care disaster. The cost of dental care is beyond reach for many in the middle class, the programs serving the poor are so underfunded as to be useless (in Minnesota, the Medical Assistance program pays private dentists approximately 35 percent of the standard fee, half the dentist\u2019s overhead), and an increasing amount of dental care is directed toward cosmetic and high-profit procedures: cosmetic veneers, implants, whitening.But dental insurance is not, as Jaffe states, \u201cstill rare.\u201d About two-thirds of our citizens have some kind of dental plan, and that is part of the problem: high deductibles and co-pays, ridiculously low annual limits, exceptions and exclusions. Multiple plans and options offer more loopholes and obfuscation than actual care. A typical example: One of my patients came into our office hopping mad about the tiny amount his insurance covered for a one-hour appointment at which we performed all eight of his rather simple but necessary fillings. In studying his lengthy policy we discovered that the company would cover only a portion of up to two fillings per sitting \u2014 a trick to require the patient to take off work four times and the dentist to incur much more overhead in delivering the service.In such situations I sometimes point out to patients that insurance companies have obligations to their shareholders; that any one of the highest-paid C.E.O.s at these companies makes as much in a year as 100 dentists or 300 dental assistants put together.The writer left his private practice three years ago and now works as a dentist at the nonprofit Northern Dental Access Center in Bemidji. The clinic serves an estimated 10,000 patients annually who come from a more-than-100-mile radius and are unable to afford care in a fee-for-service setting.\u2666To the Editor:I was amused by Mary Otto\u2019s elucidation of teeth as a class signifier. We students at Mount Holyoke College in the early \u201960s took pains to play down economic and class distinctions. Since we wore jeans and gym clothes during the week, and cars on campus were prohibited until the second semester of senior year, there were few ways to tell the difference between those who were second- or third-generation attendees and others from more plebeian backgrounds.As a dentist\u2019s daughter, however, I had little trouble discerning richer and poorer. I just looked at their teeth.\u2666\u2666\u2666To the Editor: I would like to thank Fran Lebowitz (By the Book, March 26) for affirming my belief that reading a book, when eating anything, is highly preferable to talking. And yes, even when eating an apple. I was raised to read while eating, and when my family went to restaurants, we all took books. It wasn\u2019t until the first time I dated and the boy showed up without a book that I discovered that most people did not read at the table, and that I was expected to make conversation. I was horrified. I have married only men who are prepared to read while eating.Thank you, Ms. Lebowitz.

But in her review of \u201cThe Campus Rape Frenzy\u201d (April 9), Jill Filipovic is merciless in her criticism of its authors, KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor Jr., for their use of anecdotal evidence about men falsely accused of date rape in order to call attention to the ruinous effect of such denunciations.Yet any practicing psychiatrist or defense lawyer can easily confirm similar examples. The tendency to view women as inevitably the victims of sexual assault leads to an unbalanced response to any claim of rape, without any evaluation of the complex and destructive motives that may underlie such accusations.To dismiss this book and denounce its authors only perpetuates the myth that due process actually occurs on our university campuses.

Then followed the succession of American-backed dictators, the killing of some three million Indochinese and the poisoning of the land with Agent Orange and other defoliants in a futile war to prevent the reunification of Vietnam.Would we describe the decades of American imposition of and support for military dictators in South Korea, or support for the Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines, as what Chang terms \u201csharing American ideals\u201d?America\u2019s Asia-Pacific hegemony has been constructed via coercion: conquest, colonization, occupation and more subtle forms of imperialism.

His main exhibit in support of this serious charge is that Green\u2019s book does not take into account China\u2019s aggressive conduct when its pilot tipped the wing of an American spy plane, forcing it to land in China. Chang accepts the official American account of what happened. Others suggest that the Chinese pilot inadvertently hit the American plane, though he was clearly buzzing it. In any case, it was one incident, not repeated, despite the fact that the United States conducts many thousands of such legal but provocative surveillance flights up and down the Chinese coast.Chang dismisses the fact that the Bush administration apologized for the incident and offered compensation. The Bush administration rarely accepted blame for whatever went wrong overseas. The fact that it did so in this case speaks volumes.More generally, China\u2019s acts, which are often labeled aggressive (e.g. island building), do not meet the United Nations definition of aggression. And the only person who was killed \u2014 during all these acts \u2014 was the Chinese pilot! One wishes many more nations would not be more aggressive.The writer\u2019s most recent book is \u201cAvoiding War With China.\u201d\u2666To the Editor:I read with interest Sandra Tsing Loh\u2019s review of \u201cDrop the Ball\u201d and \u201cThe Unmade Bed\u201d (April 2). Both books address the issue of how to manage the pesky tasks of household maintenance. The observation that women, as they achieve financial independence, \u201cfetishize nostalgic and unnecessary domestic arts like knitting and making candles\u201d is misguided and insulting. Perhaps these women are interested in being creative in a manner that produces something beautiful, lasting and useful. Perhaps they are also learning to relax.

{"Headline": "ESPN Layoffs: The Struggling Industry Giant Sheds On-Air Talent", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byThe \u201cWorldwide Leader in Sports,\u201d as ESPN brands itself, laid off scores of journalists and on-air talent on Wednesday, showing that even the most formidable media kingdom was vulnerable to the transformation upending the sports broadcasting industry as more and more people turn away from cable television.Among the prominent people let go were the former N.F.L. players Trent Dilfer and Danny Kanell, the former N.B.A. player Len Elmore, the former baseball general manager Jim Bowden and the longtime N.F.L. reporter Ed Werder.ESPN is by far the biggest and most powerful entity in the sports media industry, and it has felt the sting as viewers turn away from traditional ways of consuming live sports.In October 2015, ESPN laid off about 300 people, most of whom were not on camera. The network has been periodically culling its staff as it searches for ways to cut costs and adapts to changing consumer habits, with fans increasingly watching video clips on their smartphones at the expense of traditional highlight shows like \u201cSportsCenter.\u201d With ESPN locked into long-term contracts for programming rights with various sports leagues, savings must primarily come from a reduced staff.In a letter to employees on Wednesday, ESPN\u2019s president, John Skipper, acknowledged the \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d ahead and suggested what the network was looking for as it reshapes itself.In the most recent quarter, Disney\u2019s cable networks division reported $864 million in operating income, an 11 percent drop from the same period a year ago, with ESPN the reason for the entire decline, Disney said at the time. The company blamed higher N.B.A. and N.F.L. programming costs and lower ad sales for the weak results.Earlier this month, Amazon paid $50 million for streaming rights to 10 of the N.F.L.\u2019s Thursday night games for the 2017 season \u2014 or five times more than what Twitter paid a season ago, according to SportsBusiness Journal, which also reported that Facebook and YouTube bid on the package.The ESPN layoffs come as Disney accelerates efforts to introduce an ESPN-branded subscription streaming service. The offering, expected this year and made possible by Disney\u2019s $1 billion purchase in 2016 of part of BamTech, Major League Baseball\u2019s streaming division, will include coverage of sports like hockey, tennis, cricket and college sports \u2014 mostly rights that are owned by ESPN, but not televised.\u201cYou have to be willing to either create or experience some distribution as we migrate from what has been a more traditionally distributed world to a more nontraditional distribution world,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call in February. \u201cAnd some of that we\u2019re going to end up doing to ourselves, meaning that we understand there is disruption, but we believe we have to be a disrupter, too.\u201dDisney has long relied on ESPN\u2019s steadily climbing cable subscriber fees as a profit engine. But cable networks across the board have been losing viewers to online media, which has slowed growth, and Wall Street has responded unfavorably.Despite assurances by Mr. Iger that ESPN remains strong, investors and analysts have remained concerned about upheaval in the television business. Viewership via satellite and cable services is declining as streaming options proliferate, and ESPN, the naysayers contend, is particularly exposed to a slowdown because Disney has locked itself into lavish, long-term payments for sports rights.In a sign that Disney had done a good job preparing investors for the layoffs, shares climbed slightly in Wednesday morning trading.Here are some of the ESPN employees who have made statements on social media so far (we will update this list):Jay Crawford, \u201cSportsCenter\u201d anchor Ed Werder, N.F.L. reporterJayson Stark, baseball writerTrent Dilfer, N.F.L. analystAndy Katz, college basketball reporterLen Elmore, college basketball analyst Dana O\u2019Neil, college basketball reporter  Eamonn Brennan, college basketball reporterDanny Kanell, \u201cRussillo and Kanell\u201d radio hostJustin Verrier, N.B.A. reporterRobin Lundberg, radio hostCalvin Watkins, N.B.A. reporterMelissa Isaacson, columnistTed Miller, Pac-12 reporterJane McManus, writerAshley Fox, N.F.L. reporterEthan Strauss, N.B.A. reporterJeremy Crabtree, college football reporterBrian Bennett, Big Ten reporterDoug Padilla, baseball writerMax Olson, college football reporterC.

{"Headline": "South Koreans Feel Cheated After U.S. Carrier Miscue", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 When news broke less than two weeks ago that the Trump administration was sending the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to the Korean Peninsula, many South Koreans feared a war with North Korea. Others cheered for Washington, calling the deployment a powerful symbol of its commitment to deterring the North.\u201cLike North Korea, which is often accused of displaying fake missiles during military parades, is the United States, too, now employing \u2018bluffing\u2019 as its North Korea policy?\u201d the article asked.The episode raised questions about whether major allies of the United States, like South Korea and Japan, had been informed of the carrier\u2019s whereabouts, and whether the misinformation undercut America\u2019s strategy to contain North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions by using empty threats.\u201cThe 50 million South Koreans, as well as many common-sensical people around the world, cannot help but feel embarrassed and shocked,\u201d said Youn Kwan-suk, spokesman of the main opposition Democratic Party, which is leading in voter surveys before the May 9 presidential election.American aircraft carriers regularly visit areas near the Korean Peninsula as part of annual military exercises with South Korea and Japan. But when the United States Pacific Command said on April 9 that the Carl Vinson had been ordered to leave Singapore and return to the Western Pacific, the decision was considered highly unusual, as the carrier had been in exercises off the Korean Peninsula just last month.\u201cWe\u2019re sending an armada,\u201d President Trump said at the time.On Wednesday, the South Korean Defense Ministry declined to comment, other than to say that the United States and South Korea do not discuss the details of their joint strategy to deter North Korean provocations.But critics accused the ministry of fanning jitters among South Koreans before the May 9 election, in which North Korea\u2019s behavior has been a central issue \u2014 as have Seoul\u2019s close military ties to Washington.\u201cThere is no way for South Korea not to have known that the Carl Vinson would not be in Korean waters last Saturday,\u201d said Kim Dong-yub, a former navy officer and defense analyst at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul. \u201cStill, they kept mum, doing nothing to ease the anxiety when security was a key election issue.\u201dMr. Kim added: \u201cWhat they did was nothing short of trying to influence the election. The whole episode is a reminder of how fettered South Korea remains to its alliance with the United States.\u201dShin In-kyun, a military expert who runs the civic group Korea Defense Network, said that Mr. Trump appeared to have used the Carl Vinson as a feint aimed at preventing North Korea from conducting a nuclear test.\u201cIt would have been very awkward for the South Korean military to come out and clarify when they knew that Trump was bluffing,\u201d Mr. Shin said. \u201cThe bluffing worked, in fact. North Korea didn\u2019t do a nuclear test last Saturday.\u201dThe fear was that if North Korea were to conduct a nuclear or long-range missile test on Saturday to commemorate the 105th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the North\u2019s founding president and the grandfather of Kim Jong-un, the Carl Vinson would be in Korean waters by then to launch a pre-emptive strike.In South Korea, all major candidates for the presidential election issued statements warning that a pre-emptive American strike would set off a full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula. They intensified their bickering over who was best suited to keep the peace on the peninsula.Kim Ky-baek, who runs the nationalist South Korean website Minjokcorea, expressed fear that the Carl Vinson episode would damage Mr. Trump\u2019s credibility among South Koreans.\u201cTrump may say this was part of his smoke-screen tactic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the impression we get is that the Trump administration still doesn\u2019t know what it is really trying to do with North Korea, and has no clear and efficient line of communication.\u201dWhen the chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga, the Japanese government spokesman, was asked about the issue at his daily news briefing on Wednesday, he declined to address the misreported itinerary directly.\u201cIt\u2019s an operational matter for the United States military,\u201d he said.But Hideshi Takesada, a professor at the Institute of World Studies at Takushoku University in Japan, said it was inconceivable that the Japanese military was unaware of plans for the Carl Vinson\u2019s deployment.\u201cWhen it comes to matters that concern Japan, the two militaries communicate essentially in real time,\u201d he said.By allowing misconceptions about the strike group\u2019s location to persist, he added, the Trump administration had increased pressure on North Korea. Officials in Tokyo effectively cooperated by not speaking out.\u201cWhatever the case, whether it was deliberate misinformation or a miscommunication between the Pentagon and the White House, it\u2019s quite serious,\u201d said Narushige Michishita, a specialist in international security at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. \u201cIt undermines the credibility of U.S. leadership.\u201dThe United States continues to adopt a muscular posture toward North Korea, however, with Vice President Mike Pence promising during a visit to Japan on Wednesday that Washington would give an \u201coverwhelming and effective\u201d response to the use of conventional or nuclear weapons.The Carl Vinson is now actually headed to the Korean Peninsula and is expected to arrive in the region next week, Pentagon officials say. April 25 is another major anniversary in North Korea, the birthday of the Korean People\u2019s Army, and some analysts say the North might try to celebrate with a major provocation.Jonathan Soble contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Ivy League Sweep: Still Rare, but You\u2019re More Likely to Hear About It", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byIn the waning days of a high school career, it is an aspirational feat: gaining acceptance to not one, not two, but all eight Ivy League schools.But despite the attention, experts say it\u2019s unlikely that the number of sweeps has gone up significantly. Rather, it is the opportunity to promote the accomplishment on social media that is leading high achievers to publicize their feat. The news media takes care of the rest.\u201cI will tell you that because social media makes these things more visible to reporters, there\u2019s a sense that this is happening more,\u201d said Aba Blankson, a spokeswoman for the Common Application, a standardized form that allows students to send one basic application to many different institutions.\u201cStudents have always applied to multiple institutions using a paper application,\u201d Ms. Blankson said. \u201cThere was no way for a student to easily tell the world, \u2018I was admitted here and here and here.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe are reporting it now,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a new thing.\u201dWhile there are no exact numbers on how many students each year achieve an Ivy League Sweep, news reports suggest that they are few and far between.The Common Application is accepted by all eight Ivy League schools \u2014 Yale, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell, Columbia and Princeton \u2014 as well as other top colleges, including Stanford, Duke and Northwestern. It significantly lessens the workload of applying to schools, according to college counselors and prospective students.\u201cI submitted the Costco one to all of the schools as the main essay, and then there are different supplemental essays for each school,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for some of the supplemental ones, there\u2019s kind of an overlap where I could write a general supplemental essay and mix and match the right detail for each school.\u201dNick Pelosi, a college counselor at Morris Hills, the New Jersey high school attended by Ms. White-Thorpe, agreed that the feat was far from common. He did not work with any students this year who applied to all eight Ivy League schools. (Ms. White-Thorpe\u2019s counselor, John Roman, declined to comment directly.)Mr. Pelosi said that it was not general practice to encourage students to go for a sweep, and that counselors instead tailor their recommendations to students\u2019 interests. He added that Ms. White-Thorpe\u2019s interest in schools with impressive research facilities made the Ivy League a particularly good fit for her.\u201cGenerally with students, we just tell them, apply where you feel comfortable,\u201d he said.Ms. Stinson, who also expressed an interest in biology and research programs and said she will most likely major in human biology, said that she did not remember any students being angry that they had been rejected from the schools that had accepted her.\u201cOf all of the commentary and random messages I got on Facebook, about 90 percent were positive,\u201d she said. \u201cI was actually very surprised, people all around the world contacted me, offering me congratulations for getting into these schools.\u201dShe said that she was recognized for her essay while she was still visiting schools, and that she is still occasionally associated with it on campus.\u201cSome people recognized me,\u201d she said, recounting one such experience. \u201cI was like \u2018Oh no, not this.\u2019 They were like, \u201cOh my God, aren\u2019t you the Costco girl?\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a student who was accepted into all the Ivy League schools.

The Daily Telegraph, a tabloid, called for Ms. Abdel-Magied to be fired on its front page Wednesday.\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting switch from saying Muslim women are victims and forced to stay within their homes and secluded and silent, to this victimization of an outspoken and very successful Muslim woman,\u201d said Shakira Hussein, a research fellow at the Asia Institute of Melbourne University who wrote \u201cFrom Victims to Suspects: Muslim Women Since 9/11.\u201dOn Wednesday, ABC said in a statement that Ms. Abdel-Magied\u2019s decision to remove the original post and apologize was \u201cappropriate.\u201dBut vitriol from social media users continued, and an online petition calling for her dismissal from ABC had more than 20,000 signatures by Wednesday night.\u201cHow dare you hijack an Australian special day for your personal agenda,\u201d wrote one Facebook user, who added, \u201cYou were born in Sudan & we all know you are Sunni.\u201d Another user wrote, \u201cYou are a disgrace to this country and should be deported.\u201dTasneem Chopra, chairwoman of the Australian Muslim Women\u2019s Center for Human Rights, said the timing of Ms. Abdel-Magied\u2019s comment was \u201cinsensitive,\u201d but she said the ensuing controversy reflected a double standard for Muslim voices in the public arena.\u201cIt\u2019s been an overkill from the tabloid media,\u201d Ms. Chopra said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of consistency in the way Muslims are treated for transgressions when compared to the mainstream.

It is a very simple question with no clear answer.\u201dSo using sarin gas \u201cmade a lot of sense after public signals that the U.S. might not be seeking to oust him,\u201d said Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to kill a lot of people, but you can frighten a lot of people.\u201d\u201cA Syrian reporter for Gulf-based Orient TV tweeted about the attack 24 hours before it took place.\u201dCongress has broadly supported President Trump's missile strike against Syria.\u201cThe White Helmets, an Al Qaeda affiliated group funded by George Soros and the British government, have reportedly staged another chemical weapon attack on civilians in the Syrian city of Khan Shaykhun to lay blame on the Syrian government.\u201dThe websites offer no evidence for their claim that the White Helmets are \u201cAl Qaeda affiliated\u201d beyond implying that it cannot be a coincidence that 250 people in Hama were kidnapped by Al Qaeda a week before the sarin attack, \u201cwhich is the same number as the current body count of wounded and killed civilians.\u201dGiven Russia\u2019s support of Mr. Assad, casting doubt on the White Helmets is \u201cbasic counterinsurgency in certainly ruthless terms,\u201d Mr. Cordesman said. \u201cIf you can alter the flow of aid, you can depopulate the area and essentially gain control of territory.\u201dAnother theory posited by the websites suggested that Mr. Assad couldn\u2019t have been capable of launching the attack because President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry declared Syria\u2019s stockpile eliminated in 2014, while opposition forces still had chemical weapons.\u201cYou don\u2019t suddenly bomb a sarin gas deposit and have sarin gas emerge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t armed.

(\u201cMore Chilean than mote con huesillo\u201d is the saying.)

It worked: a tattoo of crunch and a tempering of the char\u2019s bitterness.In Valpara\u00edso, paila marina, a seafood soup, would brim over with the day\u2019s catch. Here, the chefs, Alejandro Salgado and Emilio Macera, make do with a mix of frozen seafood, cramming as much of it as they can into the bowl: half-shelled mussels lined like shields along the rim; gaping clams strewn with little tentacles of squid and pink whorls of imitation crab; shrimp, strips of octopus and mild whitefish \u2014 pangasius, a kind of catfish farmed in Vietnam \u2014 lurking below. The broth is almost an afterthought, but clean and simple.Gaspar Calder\u00f3n, the baker, makes dense pan de amasado for chacarero, an oversize sandwich enclosing planes of steak cut thin but still resisting the teeth, and string beans with a bit of snap. Late in the day, the bread stiffens; a generous swab of mayonnaise corrects the balance.Hot dog buns are homemade, too, and so large they dwarf their contents. You can barely see the hot dog under its ornaments: roughly smashed avocado, chopped tomato, a Pollocking of mayonnaise and the necessary, bracing sauerkraut.Empanadas are equally grand in scale, with thick bumpy braids, and more doughy than flaky. One stuffed with seafood I found too concentrated, like the smell by the docks when the tide goes out. Better is one filled with pino, to which the kitchen sometimes adds merk\u00e9n, a blend of smoked chile ground with salt, coriander and cumin \u2014 a legacy of the Mapuche people, among the last holdouts against the conquistadors.Afterward, there are chilenitos con manjar, cousins to Argentine alfajores, with thin shortbreadlike biscuits slightly upturned at the edges and squeezed around dulce de leche. Sometimes Ms. Isler hands out free mantecados, cookies soft from lard, with powdered sugar that clings to the tongue.Her parents left Valpara\u00edso for New York City in 2001, when she was 7. She stayed behind, in her grandfather\u2019s care, until she made the same journey nine years later.For her, the kitchen smells like Chile. \u201cWhen I close my eyes,\u201d she said, \u201cI think it is my grandfather cooking.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mushrooms on Toast, Done Just Right", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byCity KitchenMy friends Richard and Deirdre live outside London near Heathrow Airport. Apart from a few annoying planes flying over at odd hours, the setting is idyllic, with fields of wildflowers and tall grasses and trees, and a river flowing by.A continuing project is the restoration of the old family manor, some part of which is always falling down, constantly being repaired and refurbished in their rather particular artistic style. Richard, an intrepid designer and jack-of-all-trades, is always happiest renovating. He turned their large sitting room into a spacious, tall, light-filled kitchen, the floor painstakingly covered in tiny white mosaic tiles. Elsewhere in the house, walls are rubbed with paints in hues of lime, indigo, turmeric or beet.Deirdre, also intrepid, is known to all as a terrific cook. She is fast, organized and no-nonsense, known as much for her delicious food as for her unvarnished pronouncements and opinions.I wanted to know about her acclaimed version of mushrooms on toast. I reached Richard by email, and he was willing to try to coax the recipe from her. \u201cBut there is no recipe!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s just butter and a bloody hot pan. I\u2019m sure he knows how to fry mushrooms.\u201dNonetheless, Richard persuaded Deirdre to prepare mushrooms on toast for their lunch the following day and filmed the entire procedure, sending it to me in short clips. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a toaster, so the toast is going to be made on the stovetop in a griddle pan,\u201d she says. It\u2019s clear she has no aversion to generously daubing the bread \u2014 thick slices from an Italian loaf, though she prefers a white sourdough \u2014 with olive oil, for toast that browns and crisps beautifully.She heats a large cast-iron pan on the stovetop. \u201cThis thing doesn\u2019t get hot enough. Richard, I know you think it does, but it doesn\u2019t.\u201dShe explains, \u201cThe pan must be quite hot so the mushrooms brown properly; otherwise they\u2019ll just simmer in their own juices, and you don\u2019t want that until they\u2019re nearly finished.\u201dAs the butter begins to sizzle, she commences to fry and stir the mushroom slices, tossing in another knob of butter for good measure. When they are nearly ready, a little chopped garlic and thyme are added and the heat is lowered, allowing the mushrooms to go juicy. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Richard asks. Deirdre sometimes adds a splash of Marsala or a little cream, but not today.Warm plates, warm toast. The steaming mushrooms are spooned over them, and lunch is ready.And to Drink ...The best wine with this tangy, rich mushroom dish simply depends on your mood. If you prefer a white, you have options: A good Chablis, a restrained Sancerre or even a young Champagne dominated by chardonnay would all complement the fresh, herbal components of this dish. Or, if you are feeling flush, you could try an older Champagne or a Meursault with a little age, which would go well with the richer mushroom flavors. If a red feels right, you have a similar choice: A good young Loire red, made with the cabernet franc grape, would be delicious, but so would a nebbiolo wine from the Piedmont region of Italy, or even an easygoing red Burgundy. If you\u2019re feeling bold, try a sherry: You will not go wrong with an Amontillado. ERIC ASIMOVcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Contract Fight With U.S.A. Hockey Over, Hard Work Begins for Women\u2019s Team", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byOn Tuesday night, Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson and her twin sister, Monique Lamoureux-Morando, helped the United States women\u2019s hockey team earn a major victory for gender equity in sports.The twins were leaders in the players\u2019 15 months of negotiations and eventual two-week boycott that culminated in an agreement with U.S.A. Hockey for increased pay and support.Less than 24 hours later, they were reminded of the battles still ahead.Amid celebrations of Tuesday\u2019s news, players recognized that their work was incomplete. That was why a key component of the deal with U.S.A. Hockey was the formation of the Women\u2019s High Performance Advisory Group to work within the governing body.The new four-year contract for the American women\u2019s team is similar to an agreement the Canadian team reached with its national governing body, Hockey Canada, almost 20 years ago. Vital to Canada\u2019s success was the creation of a Women\u2019s High Performance Advisory Committee, which acted as a players\u2019 union in negotiations with Hockey Canada and fostered development on the youth level.In a statement released Tuesday, U.S.A. Hockey said its advisory group would consist of former and current national team players, volunteers and staff leaders who would regularly meet to assist in efforts \u201cto advance girls\u2019 and women\u2019s hockey in all areas, including programming, marketing, promotion and fund-raising.\u201d\u201cThere are mentalities that need to be changed, because people aren\u2019t changed enough,\u201d said Hilary Knight, a star on the American team.Some within women\u2019s hockey believe more action is needed from the International Ice Hockey Federation, which holds influence over every participating nation\u2019s governing body.Cammi Granato, a member of the American team that won the gold medal in the first women\u2019s hockey Olympic tournament in 1998, said the recent changes enacted by U.S.A. Hockey should put pressure on the international federation \u201cto look within and bring up the modern-day standard.\u201d\u201cIf you look at that organization, there are imbalances there,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they do that and take the leadership role there, you might have other countries\u2019 federations taking a stand as well.\u201dThe international federation did little to intervene in U.S.A. Hockey\u2019s dispute with its women\u2019s team, the three-time defending world champions. The federation released a statement on March 17 that said it was \u201cmonitoring the situation closely.\u201d Several players said they learned during negotiations that the federation was pushing U.S.A. Hockey to find replacement players to field a new team in case the boycott continued.The event that the women\u2019s team was boycotting, the federation\u2019s world championship, began Friday with a 2-0 victory by the United States over Canada, and continued Saturday with the Americans\u2019 7-0 rout of Russia. A major point of contention in the team\u2019s boycott was not receiving travel and insurance allotments similar to men\u2019s players.Players from other countries followed the U.S.A. Hockey negotiations closely. Janine Weber, a member of the Austrian national team, said many European women\u2019s players shared news of the boycott on Facebook.\u201cI think it\u2019s something we can all relate to and something we hope to accomplish one day in terms of equal support from our federations,\u201d Weber wrote in an email, adding that more investment would help close the performance gap between the United States and Canada and the rest of the world in women\u2019s hockey.\u201cEven we have desire to fight for equal wages and gender equality,\u201d Park wrote in an email during the United States team\u2019s boycott. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do that. But always think of equalities.\u201dAmerican players hope their stance will ultimately assist women\u2019s hockey programs across the world, but they first are focused on increasing diversity in U.S.A. Hockey\u2019s leadership.Currently, only 15 of 91 voting members of its board of directors are women. It is the only national governing body among American Winter Olympic sports with a board that has less than 20 percent women. According to U.S.A. Hockey\u2019s annual guide, the terms of 29 board members end this year.The importance of having strong voices on the board was clear in the contract negotiations.Meghan Duggan, the national team captain, is a player representative on the board. To avoid a conflict of interest, she did not vote, but she remained involved in negotiations throughout, acting as a channel for the concerns of her 22 teammates.\u201cWomen in these positions need to continue to be on calls and speak up and push the boundaries,\u201d Duggan said.The prospects of a deal were dim on Monday. U.S.A. Hockey held a teleconference for its board of directors to vote on a proposal presented by the team. After more than three hours of discussion, the contract was voted down. Instead, the majority of the board wanted to respond with an offer that had already been rejected by the players.But according to people with knowledge of the meeting, Julie Chu stepped up. One of the United States\u2019 most decorated Olympic athletes, Chu is a four-time medal winner and a pioneer in women\u2019s hockey. She carried the flag for the United States Olympic team at the closing ceremony of the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia.Throughout the boycott, Chu supported the women\u2019s team on social media. As discussions sputtered, she suggested that the executive committee should be authorized to continue negotiations with the players and then come to a final decision.That path led to an agreement one day later.\u201cIt explains her character and how much it means to her as well,\u201d said Granato, who texted and called Chu throughout the negotiations. \u201cShe was able to speak up, and that\u2019s why more women in there like that are needed because they can get through. That helps. It was vital.\u201dSince the 1990s \u2014 including Granato\u2019s teams, Chu\u2019s era and the current roster led by Knight and Duggan \u2014 the women\u2019s national team has been the most consistently successful U.S.A. Hockey product. The players who fought for their new contract said they believed they had only begun to shape the organization from within.\u201cStarting a culture change in U.S.A. Hockey, that\u2019s ultimately at the end of the day what needs to happen to progress and move forward,\u201d Lamoureux-Morando said. \u201cHopefully, other countries now will kind of follow suit. We\u2019re a model to look at.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How \u2018Survivor\u2019 and CBS Prepared for Outrage at Transgender Contestant\u2019s Outing", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byAt first blush, it looks like a crisis for CBS: broadcasting an episode of its hit reality show \u201cSurvivor\u201d on Wednesday in which one contestant outs a rival as transgender during an elimination round \u2014 a violation of privacy as well as a cultural flash point.But in fact, CBS and the producers of \u201cSurvivor\u201d have been preparing for months for just the kind of uproar that ensued Thursday over the outing of Zeke Smith.From the moment the episode was filmed nearly 10 months ago, the \u201cSurvivor\u201d producers had been consulting with Mr. Smith about how best to handle airing the incident, which included a strategic media rollout and working with Glaad, the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights group, before the episode\u2019s broadcast.\u201cThe idea of not airing this never came up,\u201d Jeff Probst, the show\u2019s longtime host and an executive producer, said in an interview. \u201cZeke never asked for that. While he certainly did not have a hand in editing the show, Zeke and I have talked for nine months.\u201dMr. Probst continued, \u201cZeke\u2019s approach has been: \u2018I\u2019m going to use this and make something great come from it.\u2019\u201dTurning to Mr. Smith, he asked, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told anyone you\u2019re transgender?\u201dMr. Smith sat in stunned silence as the other contestants erupted in outrage, calling Mr. Varner\u2019s comments inappropriate and irrelevant to the game. (Mr. Varner, who was already on thin ice, was eliminated.)Mr. Probst said he learned that Mr. Smith, an asset manager from Brooklyn, was transgender as they went through the casting process before Mr. Smith\u2019s first season on the show, which was broadcast last fall. (He is on consecutive seasons of \u201cSurvivor,\u201d and his gender had not come up before.)\u201cI know from talking to Zeke a lot before the show that he was fully prepared with the fact that it might come out,\u201d Mr. Probst said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018I will handle that as I need to, if it does.\u2019\u201dStill, Mr. Probst said that no one was expecting it to be deployed as a bombshell at a tribal council \u2014 a portion of a \u201cSurvivor\u201d episode in which dramatic reveals are more likely to make it to broadcast because they may affect who is eliminated in the vote.\u201cI was as shocked as anybody else,\u201d said Mr. Probst, who added that Mr. Varner had not indicated to a producer that he was going to bring the issue up during the vote.\u201cIn calling me deceptive, Varner invoked one of the most odious stereotypes of transgender people, a stereotype that is often used as an excuse for violence and even murder,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote. \u201cIn proclaiming, \u2018Zeke is not the guy you think he is,\u2019 and that \u2018there is deception on levels y\u2019all don\u2019t understand,\u2019 Varner is saying that I\u2019m not really a man and that simply living as my authentic self is a nefarious trick. In reality, by being Zeke the dude, I am being my most honest self.\u201dAfter the episode was broadcast, reactions poured in.Some viewers, supportive of Mr. Smith, were roundly unforgiving of his being outed.In a statement Thursday, CBS said of Mr. Smith, \u201cFrom his first season through the current edition, we have always been guided by the principle that this is his story to tell, and it remains so.\u201cWe support how Jeff Probst and the producers handled a very sensitive situation,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cand marvel at the grace Zeke exhibited under extraordinary circumstances.\u201d\u201cYep. I did that,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd I offer my deepest, most heartfelt apologies to Zeke Smith, his friends and life allies, his family, and to all those who my mistake hurt and offended. I recklessly revealed something I mistakenly believed everyone already knew. I was wrong and make no excuses for it. I own responsibility in what is the worst decision of my life.\u201dHe added, \u201cLet me be clear, outing someone is assault.\u201dDuring the tribal council, Mr. Probst decided to forgo a usual \u201cSurvivor\u201d tradition. Instead of inviting cast members to write down the person they wished to vote off the island, Mr. Probst asked them all aloud if they agreed that Mr. Varner was the one to go.\u201cThis moment, because of where we are in the culture, seemed to be so much bigger than our show,\u201d Mr. Probst said in the interview. \u201cAnd so this ritual of a torch snuffing, which is usually the end of an episode and very important, suddenly became completely insignificant.\u201d\u201cWhat happened at tribal transcended \u2018Survivor,\u2019\u201d he said.Daniel Victor contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gunman, Thought to Be Targeting Whites, Kills 3 in Fresno, Police Say", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byWhen Kori Ali Muhammad, a homeless man who voiced a hatred of white people and the government, learned on Tuesday morning that he was wanted in the killing of a Motel 6 security guard in Fresno, Calif., he decided he was going to kill again, the police said.About 10:45 a.m., Mr. Muhammad walked up to a Pacific Gas & Electric utility truck and fatally shot a 34-year-old white employee in the passenger seat, the police said. He ran down another street and fired his handgun at another white person but missed. He reloaded.Mr. Muhammad then turned onto North Fulton Street and encountered a white man carrying a backpack and a garbage bag full of clothes. A witness said it sounded as if there was an altercation before three bullets were fired into the man\u2019s abdomen.Mr. Muhammad ran away, stopping briefly to pick up bullets he dropped in the street, and, according to the police, fired his gun again when he spotted a white man outside Catholic Charities, the aid organization for homeless people and those in need.The police finally caught up to him at the end of the street, and he surrendered. In the back of a police car, Mr. Muhammad, 39, yelled \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d Arabic for \u201cGod is great,\u201d the police said.Over the span of about a minute, Mr. Muhammad fired 16 bullets from a .357-caliber revolver over several blocks, killing three white men at random, the police said. When he was finally stopped by officers, he acknowledged he was a wanted man.\u201cHe made a decision to himself that he was not going to go to jail for shooting a security guard and was going to kill as many people as he could today,\u201d Chief Jerry Dyer of the Fresno Police Department said at a news conference. \u201cThat is what he set out to do.\u201dChief Dyer said Mr. Muhammad had expressed anti-white views to detectives.\u201cHe provided some very specific detailed information that caused our detectives to believe that this was motivated based on hate and not based on any terrorist act,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is solely based on race.\u201dMr. Muhammad, a drifter who went by the nickname \u201cBlack Jesus\u201d and whose family had cut off contact with him, had been on the run since Thursday, the police said. Mr. Muhammad showed up at a Motel 6 in the city that day to meet a woman. But a security guard confronted him about being there, as he was not a guest.Mr. Muhammad pulled out a handgun, fatally shot the guard and fired several bullets at another guard on a stairwell landing, the police said. The authorities saw him on security cameras at the motel but did not release his name and photo to the public until Tuesday morning.Chief Dyer defended the department\u2019s decision not to immediately release his name, saying that officers believed they were close to finding him. He also said he worried how Mr. Muhammad might react knowing that the police were looking for him.Those gunshots were picked up by the city\u2019s gunshot detection system, and officers responded immediately, Chief Dyer said.Not long later, Aaron Van Curen said he was working in his house on North Fulton Street when he heard a gunshot. When he peered outside, Mr. Van Curen said, he saw a gunman shoot a man two additional times. The victim fell.Mr. Van Curen said he ran outside and checked for a pulse on the man, who was carrying a backpack and a bag of clothes, but could not find one. Around that time, Mr. Van Curen said he heard about five more gunshots in the next block, where the police said the last person was killed.Mr. Muhammad is facing four counts of murder and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, Chief Dyer said. The F.B.I. is also investigating the shooting as a possible hate crime or terrorism, according to court records filed late Tuesday by federal prosecutorsIn 2004, Fresno police officers found Mr. Muhammad, who was drinking in a car outside a house, with 10 grams of cocaine and two rifles. His lawyer in the case requested a psychiatric evaluation, which found he \u201cclearly suffers from psychosis, with a substantial degree of paranoia\u201d and said he was not competent to stand trial, according to court documents.He was convicted and sentenced to more than seven and a half years in prison, and his probation required him not to have a gun for at least three years. Chief Dyer said the police were investigating how Mr. Muhammad got the handgun, which, he said, Mr. Muhammad tossed before he was arrested.The authorities were spending time scrubbing Mr. Muhammad\u2019s Facebook page, where he wrote often about his dislike of white people, calling them the \u201cwhite devil,\u201d and recently posted a photo of white people gathering near a lynching. He repeatedly posted, \u201c#LetBlackPeopleGo.\u201dOn Monday, he wrote on Facebook, \u201cMy kill rate increases tremendously on the other side.\u201d Several times in recent days, he wrote on Facebook that he was in Atlanta, where he had some ties, in an apparent attempt to throw off the police. But the police said he probably never left Fresno, an agriculture hub in Central California, but he did shave off his dreadlocks to change his appearance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Mac DeMarco Became the Lovable Laid-Back Prince of Indie Rock", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Before Mac DeMarco bought a lovely blue home with a pool on a quiet hill here in Silver Lake \u2014 the first real adult spoils of a surprising career built on seeming like an affable deadbeat \u2014 he gave out his exact address to fans, not exactly expecting them to show up in droves.\u201cWe had thousands of kids, all through the day, all hours,\u201d Mr. DeMarco recalled recently as he chain-smoked Marlboro Reds in his new backyard, surrounded by overflowing ashtrays and discarded cans of beer and seltzer. \u201cIt was crazy. I really liked it.\u201dTrue to his word and reputation, he played amiable host to those making the Rockaway pilgrimage \u2014 his longtime girlfriend, Kiera McNally, \u201cwas a good sport for as long as she could be\u201d \u2014 even as summer bloomed and space got tight. \u201cSometimes we\u2019d have like 40 people sitting against the sea wall watching us rehearse,\u201d Mr. DeMarco said, insisting that the impetuous stunt did not lead to any negative experiences and only brought him closer to his fan base.That\u2019s the kind of easygoing intimacy and relatability that has turned Mr. DeMarco, who is originally from Edmonton, Alberta, into what has become a rare breed: a breakout indie-rock idol whose consistent musical output \u2014 mostly mellow guitar pop in the mold of \u201960s and \u201970s songwriters like Harry Nilsson, Neil Young and John Lennon \u2014 is only bolstered by a fervent cult of personality.As a kind of pied piper for the blog crowd, Mr. DeMarco, with his trademark gaptoothed smile and disarming baby blues, has tended to his flock not so much with the dubiously revealing gimmicks of social media, but on-the-ground, grass-roots outreach via nonstop touring and direct human connection.\u201cIt\u2019s funny, as things progress, I just want to keep making them smaller and smaller,\u201d Mr. DeMarco said, his natural inclination toward a do-it-yourself punk ethos shining through. \u201cI try to retain a certain amount of control. I\u2019m not a freak, but I don\u2019t want to do anything that I don\u2019t want to do.\u201dHe also seemed to recognize how crucial a sense of connectedness has been to his success. Approachable, genuine and undeniably charismatic, Mr. DeMarco, who turns 27 on Sunday, April 30, is a recognizable archetype to anyone familiar with small-time local music scenes \u2014 a trendsetting merrymaker likely to get drunk and pull down his pants onstage, but who also happens to be a devoted songwriter.\u201cI\u2019m not the artiste \u2014 we\u2019re just having a good time,\u201d Mr. DeMarco said, recalling being drawn as a teenager to bands \u201cthat made me go, \u2018Oh, I can do this, too!\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cKids tune in and they\u2019re like, \u2018Mac would drink a beer with me.\u2019 And the answer is probably yes! These people are paying my mortgage, putting food on the table for me and my girlfriend. Thank you! And you like the music? That\u2019s crazy.\u201dBut as grateful as he is for the support, Mr. DeMarco was realistic and self-aware in acknowledging that his irreverent rock \u2019n\u2019 roll prankster vibe and sense of humor \u2014 onstage, in legend and in countless playful YouTube videos \u2014 has spawned a following almost apart from his solid yet unassuming songs.\u201cI\u2019m like a meme,\u201d he said. \u201cMy music is one thing, and then there\u2019s also this weird personality that people attach to it.\u201d That comes with expectations. \u201cNowadays, it\u2019s like, \u2018Put the cigarette between your teeth, man!\u2019 But I did that already.\u201dYet some bewilderment aside, Mr. DeMarco insisted that he harbors no existential anxiety about the jester role, mostly because it\u2019s not a character. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to keep public Mac and me Mac fairly in line with one another so it doesn\u2019t become weird,\u201d he said. It also provides a firewall for his art.Mr. DeMarco toured and released music in Canadian obscurity, mostly under the name Makeout Videotape, for years before he signed to a label with any influence. When he did, releasing the more experimental, lo-fi \u201cRock and Roll Nightclub\u201d in 2012 on Captured Tracks, the indie-rock stars were aligning.Mr. DeMarco\u2019s freewheeling, wide-scale debut also came on the heels of a more self-serious moment in the genre, which was dominated by headliners like Animal Collective, Arcade Fire and Dirty Projectors. \u201cI played the internet game a lot in the first couple years,\u201d Mr. DeMarco said. \u201cA lot of videos, a lot of interviews, a lot of content.\u201dHe added, \u201cA lot of bands don\u2019t give it up like I do, I guess.\u201dShe described her son as a curious and enthusiastic child, who was \u201cperhaps a bit of a rabble-rouser \u2014 very, very full of energy, much like he is now.\u201d She added: \u201cHe draws people to him. Mac always traveled in a herd of kids, and even if they didn\u2019t want to like him, they ended up liking him.\u201dMr. DeMarco\u2019s immediate loved ones have long featured in his music as well as his career, though he favors what he called \u201cvague, pretty common themes and not very specific lyrics \u2014 little pop song nuggets.\u201d But on \u201cThis Old Dog,\u201d which Mr. DeMarco started at the Rockaway house and returned to after his move to California, he got more thematically pointed than ever, calling the songs \u201cdiary-entry style.\u201dThe opening track, \u201cMy Old Man,\u201d plainly addresses the father he grew up without and who struggled with addiction (\u201cUh-oh, looks like I\u2019m seeing more of my old man in me\u201d). The album was inspired in part by the two reconnecting under dire circumstances: a cancer diagnosis.\u201cI\u2019d say see you later, if I thought I\u2019d see you later and I\u2019d tell you that I loved you if I did,\u201d Mr. DeMarco sings in \u201cMoonlight on the River.\u201d The album ends on the line: \u201cAnd even though you barely know each other, it still hurts watching him fade away.\u201d\u201cIt was my \u2018See you later, partner,\u2019\u201d Mr. DeMarco said of the low-key LP, its sound stemming from the singer\u2019s recent deep-dives into the careers of Paul Simon, James Taylor and Yellow Magic Orchestra. But in a twist, his father has since recovered to an extent, outlasting his diagnosis.That this introspective moment coincides with Mr. DeMarco\u2019s turning a corner into his late 20s and adjusting his lifestyle accordingly is probably not a coincidence. \u201cI have retracted a little bit from just giving everything away,\u201d he said of his public persona. But maturation is a funny thing for a singer whose generous high jinks are foundational to his popularity.At his home in Los Angeles, those contradictions were on display as domesticity coexisted with the Neverland aspects of playing rock for a living. Guitars and gear were strewn in almost every room, and band mates had colonized the extra space, all while Ms. McNally baked sourdough bread and cinnamon buns, reminding Mr. DeMarco to take his fiber supplement. (He ate a spoonful of frosting instead.)\u201cI\u2019ve lived in way too many crawlspace rooms,\u201d Mr. DeMarco remarked, taking in his yard with astonishment and uttering a string of curse words for emphasis. \u201cIt\u2019s such a fluke, so lucky and so amazing,\u201d he said motioning over the pool, which at that point he had yet to swim in. \u201cLook at this! See this! From playing guitar? It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Integration Is a Two-Way Street", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "The storied city of Weimar, Germany (population 65,000), absorbed 900 refugees in a year. Our journalists spent months on the ground examining integration from all sides.\u2014 In This Story \u2014ANAS ALKARRI, 27, his wife, AYA ALNABULSI, 19, and their son, ZAID, 16 monthsMARGRET AURIN, 28, a German student who volunteered in the resettlement effortBASHAR AL-SULAIMAN, 20, a student and soccer enthusiast from SyriaSARAH ZDUN, 26, a German social worker and her Syrian boyfriend, OMAR, 28Like others, he hoped to take advantage of free language lessons and quickly land a job. But also like others, he found German difficult and was frustrated by the bureaucratic hurdles and internships most newcomers must clear to hold a job in Germany.\u201cThey teach you the rules, and then they teach you the exceptions, and the exceptions are more than the rule,\u201d he said of the language classes he received from the city and local university students. \u201cThe dog is a he, but the table is a she. They have no logic.\u201dRefugees are required to take roughly 700 hours of classes in German language and cultural orientation in exchange for benefits. At the end, if they pass a language test, they are eligible to hold a job and remain in the country permanently.In the first six months of 2016 \u2014 the most recent available figures \u2014 278,404 refugees were enrolled in integration courses across the country, 434 of them in and around Weimar. Nearly 64 percent nationwide passed the test needed to continue studying or pursue vocational training.Anas was an accountant in Syria but gave up on that career in Weimar. \u201cThe training here is clearly superior,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the choice, even I would hire a German over a Syrian.\u201dWith wide, sensitive eyes framed by thick-rimmed glasses, Anas is perpetually alert for an opportunity to press his case that the Muslim world is woefully misunderstood here. He recalled an intense discussion at one of the workshop\u2019s weekend gatherings about homosexuality, something he called \u201cthe monster in the closet.\u201d\u201cWe told them that, worldwide, the majority of people are opposed to homosexuality,\u201d Anas said of his counterparts. \u201cBut the Germans, they want you to be cool with it. Be cool, be easy. But many of us cannot.\u201dThe workshop grew out of a question-and-answer session that Eric Wrasse, 41, organized at a Weimar youth center in November 2015. It turned out that German high school students had a lot of questions for the newcomers, starting with the basics: What was daily life like in Syria? How difficult was the journey to Germany?So with a federal grant of 50,000 euros (about $53,000), the center created the program in which the Germans and refugees spent eight weekends doing bonding exercises, taking field trips, practicing role-playing games and trying to explain their cultures to each other.On a field trip to the Neuk\u00f6lln district of Berlin, a longtime immigrant enclave now home to a new wave of Syrians and others, a guide led the group past storefronts covered with Arabic lettering and windows full of shawarma and grilled vegetables.The guide, also a Syrian refugee, complained bitterly about being forced to live with 39 other men in a cramped shelter and described a \u201ckiller bureaucracy\u201d in Germany. At least back in Syria, he said, one could pay a little money and get to the head of the line.\u201cAre you advocating corruption?\u201d asked Eric, the head of the program.Anas echoed the guide about the sluggish and inscrutable German system. After being invited to present his workshop to a civic education group in France, he applied for permission to leave the country and was told by the German authorities that a decision would take a couple of weeks. But three months later, the permission had still not arrived and he missed out on the trip.\u201cYou benefit from the rule of law in this country,\u201d Eric said. \u201cYou have to trust the system.\u201d\u201cThat is the problem,\u201d Anas explained. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust the system.\u201dEric said, \u201cYou have food, a home, all because of the system.\u201dA crowd of refugees waited outside the locked doors of a Communist-era auditorium complex that Margret had helped transform into a discount department store. Its warren of dark rooms and bland wooden benches now contained mountains of donated linens, toys and other items stacked six-high on metal shelves.\u201cI must charge for the clothes, the city says, but at least I can set the price,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes sense to me. People will be more likely to take only what they really need.\u201dThis was new.When the refugees started arriving, Weimar, like other places, put out a call for donations, and they poured in. \u201cEvery two minutes, a car was coming,\u201d recalled Margret, who was then in her final year at Bauhaus University and, like dozens of other students, got caught up in the welcome-wagon frenzy.She took charge of the clothing shop, which at first gave out items to anyone in need. But city officials shut the operation down in December 2015, citing security concerns and organizational problems.\u201cSometimes the refugees would get angry and aggressive,\u201d Margret acknowledged. \u201cThey would tell me, oh, they are going to kill me, they are going to stab me. I got so stressed.\u201dAt the run-down former student dormitory used to house the new arrivals, rumors circulated that German volunteers were having sex with refugees. Margret said some of the men would send messages on social media with hearts and fireworks and roses; she ended up removing one particularly persistent suitor from her Facebook friends.Student volunteers decided to put together a pamphlet to explain German social customs to refugee men, including what it means if a woman hugs them and how it is perfectly acceptable for women to hold some jobs in Germany that would be forbidden to them in Syria.\u201cThen it just stopped,\u201d Margret said. \u201cThey just hadn\u2019t known how to behave, and once it was explained to them, it became all right.\u201dFor months, she argued with city officials about reopening the clothing shop, something she said was \u201clike fighting with windmills.\u201d In May, they gave permission for a trial run \u2014 but she had to charge money rather than give items away. And refugees had to bring their own bags.\u201cNo bags, we have no bags!\u201d she shouted again and again to women carrying armloads of merchandise.That first day, nearly a year ago, the shop sold 90 T-shirts, 19 pairs of shorts, 15 skirts, one jacket and 19 pairs of underwear for a total of \u20ac170 (about $180), which went to the city government.But one man was caught putting on several pairs of trousers. A pile of toys had been stacked beside a window in an unused room, raising suspicions that someone planned to come back after dark and steal them. City officials were shocked by the scene, which was more Middle Eastern souk than German Kaufhaus.\u201cIt was like an Apple store when a new product comes out,\u201d said Andreas Kohl, head of Weimar\u2019s new Department of Refugee Affairs. \u201cEvery man for himself.\u201dThe city soon shut the store down, again. It reopened in July \u2014 under new management.Beate Weber-Kehr, 56, who had been coordinating volunteer activities for the city, was now in charge. She had cobbled together more racks and shelves from old benches and bunk-bed parts. The shop was open only on Mondays, and refugees from different neighborhoods were invited in different weeks to keep crowds down.Margret declined a request to help out. She had refugee fatigue \u2014 or, at least, an aversion to struggling with the German bureaucracy.And she was not the only young volunteer to feel her enthusiasm slip in the months since the refugees began arriving. One student had tried to start a workshop linking Germans with refugees for language lessons, but only a handful of native speakers turned up. Another wanted to use a website to pair homeless newcomers with Weimar residents who had extra space, but few hosts came forward.Margret took a job with Arrive, one of more than 1,080 programs nationwide aimed at integrating refugees, organizing buddy picnics for them and locals. One August evening, she hung paper lanterns in the park across the street from her apartment, the tiny LED bulbs barely illuminating blankets stacked with sandwiches and snacks.Forty people showed up for that first picnic, but by December, the program had only 85 buddy teams, short of the goal of 100. The group plans to hold more picnics this spring and summer.\u201cIn the first months, everybody was excited, everybody wanted to help,\u201d she said. \u201cThen nothing happened, so the enthusiasm died.\u201d\u201cThe Germans say to me sometimes that they forget I am from another country \u2014 they think I am German, like them,\u201d he said, then paused, fingering the meditation beads he wears looped around his wrist.\u201cIt\u2019s nice when people make you feel you are one of them. But I have not given up on my own country. I can be both.\u201dIt is hard to know what made Bashar\u2019s path smoother than others\u2019. Maybe it was his being Christian, not Muslim. Or maybe it was soccer.Bashar played regularly in the cramped gymnasium behind Weimar\u2019s refugee dormitory when he first arrived, and now he plays most Mondays in a group where he is the only non-German. If asked the most important date in his integration journey, he does not hesitate: Oct. 24, when a German acquaintance offhandedly invited him to play.\u201cFootball is more than a hobby for me,\u201d he said, gulping water during a break in a game. \u201cIt is something I must do. It is my heart.\u201dBashar and an older brother, Yazan, left Damascus, Syria, on Aug. 4, 2015, and arrived in Weimar on Aug. 22.Hababusch, an ivy-covered four-story building in the center of the old city, had been a longtime student shelter for artsy bohemians before morphing into a youth hostel and, a few years ago, into an apartment building full of hipsters. The top floor has eight bedrooms off a central living space; Bashar pays \u20ac170 (about $180) a month for a small room in the back, beyond the kitchen, a tiny square he has filled with pictures of Syria.\u201cI miss my friends, I miss my places, I miss the things I did, I miss what was once normal \u2014 I miss it all,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t miss is the bombs, being stressed all the time, having only bad news every day, the lack of electricity. I don\u2019t miss being in a place where everything is war.\u201dBy late September 2016, a year after he landed in Weimar, Bashar had completed his government-paid language course with exceptionally high marks, bringing his proficiency to a level of B1, the minimum needed for most jobs in Germany. Since the government-financed training stops at that level, Bashar tracked down a free course at a local university; his goal is to reach level C1, which he thinks will take two years. That would qualify him to study medicine at the university in nearby Jena.\u201cWhen you want to be at the top, you must struggle for it,\u201d he said.He has struggled, too, with some of the nuances of his new world.In Syria, he said, people always ask guests twice if they would like something to eat or drink. At first, they refuse. So you ask them again, and only then do they accept.\u201cThis is seen as common politeness,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut here, if you ask someone to do something twice, it\u2019s seen as aggressive, like you\u2019re trying to twist their arm.\u201dEarly on, Bashar was visiting a friend and was offered a coffee. \u201cI said, \u2018No, thank you,\u2019 then I waited for them to ask me again but they never did.\u201cAnd I really wanted a coffee. I was like: \u2018Why? Come on.\u2019 But then I realized they were doing what they thought was polite, too.\u201d\u201cI was with some of my friends, and Omar was there with some of his,\u201d recalled Sarah, 26, a social worker at a group home for unaccompanied Afghan teenagers.Their relationship grew slowly. They saw each other now and again at the cafe; then Omar\u2019s refugee friends and Sarah\u2019s German friends began hanging out together around the city. By late spring, the two were dating \u2014 secretly.\u201cI don\u2019t want people thinking that I have lost myself here in Germany,\u201d explained Omar, 28, who spoke on the condition that his last name not be used for fear of retribution against his relatives still in Syria. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to think that I have changed.\u201dOne spring weekend, the couple huddled together over a fierce game of cards at the cacophonous cafe where they had met. A game of table tennis was underway. People ate, sipped tea, played musical instruments. Women in hijab, a few with baby carriages, chatted quietly in the fading light.Omar \u2014 short and muscled with an infectious laugh \u2014 left his family in Syria in 2013, with an economics degree and a half-baked idea to join relatives in Europe. He languished in Lebanon for more than two years, working as an accountant for a medical company, then as a cashier at a restaurant. Finally, in summer 2015, he got himself to Turkey and then, using a smuggler, across the sea to Greece and through the Balkans by train, bus and foot.Sarah \u2014 watchful, wry and fiercely competitive \u2014 grew up in Leipzig and landed in Weimar after college in the Netherlands when her marriage to a student from India faltered. She took a job with a local foundation that helps troubled young people, and ended up hanging out at the Open Sunday Caf\u00e9.In summer, the couple decided not only to go public with their relationship but also to find an apartment together \u2014 a challenge since many landlords are leery of renting to refugees. They bid on one place (\u201cIt was perfect,\u201d Sarah said), but the owner wrote in a text message that it had gone to someone else. (\u201cThey don\u2019t give you a reason,\u201d Omar said.)When they showed up a few weeks later for an appointment to see another apartment, there was no landlord to meet them. Later, Omar was told about a tiny apartment, really not big enough for both of them, in the historic center \u2014 it also fell through. \u201cThey objected to renting to a refugee,\u201d Sarah said.Things were going better with their families. Sarah\u2019s brother bonded with Omar, and her mother, also a social worker, gave her blessing. One July afternoon, they drove down to Bad Blankenburg, where Sarah\u2019s mother lived in a financially struggling corner of what had been East Germany, fertile ground for the country\u2019s growing anti-immigrant right wing.\u201cSometimes I hear people talking in my office about refugees, and I have to go into the other room,\u201d said the mother, Angelika Zdun, 55. \u201cI can\u2019t listen to it, and I don\u2019t want to argue with them. It is really difficult to change people\u2019s minds.\u201dBy September, the integration workshop that Omar participated in along with Anas had finished. Eric, the organizer, offered jobs and internships to some of the refugees, but many thought the low pay was not worth the time away from family or language lessons; others objected to the mandatory shifts in the center\u2019s kitchen.\u201cI would like to be an integration optimist, but if I am honest, I must say that I am less optimistic now than when we started,\u201d Eric said. \u201cI think the labor market is going to be very difficult for them. I don\u2019t tell them, because I don\u2019t want to dismay them, but they will be in competition with Germans, and they will meet a lot of prejudice from employers.\u201dAt least Sarah and Omar found an apartment \u2014 on a street of grand residential buildings a few blocks from the main train station, on the top floor, with a tiny balcony. They gave a party to celebrate.Sarah\u2019s mother drove up for the event. Bashar was out of town, but Margret from the clothing shop was there, and Anas, and so many of the people whose lives had intertwined in the months since the refugees began arriving in Weimar.At one point, there was a playful jostling for space on the new Ikea sofa. Five crowded on, then six, until there were nearly a dozen refugees and Germans tangled around one another in a human knot.\u201cLook,\u201d Anas said. \u201cWe are integrating!\u201dOmar beamed and rested his arm across Sarah\u2019s shoulder.The storied city of Weimar, Germany (population 65,000), absorbed 900 refugees in a year. Our journalists spent months on the ground examining integration from all sides.The Syrian man, one of 900 asylum-seekers welcomed in Weimar, Germany, was no less upset. \u201cHave you asked them?\u201d demanded Anas Alkarri, 28. \u201cI think you will find it is their choice to wear the hijab.\u201dShe pressed on: \u201cI have heard that women can\u2019t worship in the mosque. Is this true?\u201dHe scoffed: \u201cOf course they can worship in the mosque. This is a misconception. There is a separate section in the back for them.\u201dThe German woman stifled a gasp. \u201cA separate section? Oh my God.\u201dSo it went in a four-month cultural crash course pairing Weimar residents with refugees, and in informal interactions around the city and the rest of Germany, as roughly one million people arrived in galvanic waves from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. The rapid influx shook European social structures, accelerated a rise in right-wing nationalism and saddled social welfare systems with the complex challenge of absorbing so many desperate wanderers at once.The storied city of Weimar, Germany (population 65,000), absorbed 900 refugees in a year.

{"Headline": "Sheryl Sandberg Finds Comfort for Herself and Offers It to Others", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Supported byNonfictionYou could almost hear the collective gasp when news broke, in May 2015, that the internet entrepreneur Dave Goldberg had died suddenly while on vacation in Mexico with his wife, Sheryl Sandberg. Their marriage had become a public one ever since the publication, two years earlier, of \u201cLean In,\u201d her book about women and leadership. In it she had written some revolutionary things about marriage (she called it having a \u201cpartner,\u201d but the book was so much about redefining gender roles that she clearly seemed to be talking about husbands). Deciding to get married \u2014 and the choice of whom to marry \u2014 weren\u2019t just central to one\u2019s private life, she wrote. Together they made up the \u201cmost important career decision that a woman makes.\u201d She observed that most women at the top aren\u2019t the lonely, single women of clich\u00e9s; they are married women whose husbands support their ambitions and take equal responsibility for making a home. She said that her great success (she is the chief operating officer of Facebook, which has made her a billionaire) would have been impossible without the unwavering support of her husband. Now, in the cruelest way, she had lost him.\u201cLean In\u201d sparked a movement, but it had its critics, among them single mothers, women who worked outside corporate America, and those who could not afford to hire the nannies and helpers upon whom the Sandberg-Goldberg household clearly depended. There were also those who thought the principal value underlying the book was flawed. They didn\u2019t want to find ways to make their work more exhilarating; they wanted to find ways to accommodate it to their lives as parents. The tragedy was a vicious reminder of the truth we work hard to forget: Life is cruel. It will casually take away the people we love the most. Even the vaunted \u201cC-suite\u201d job is cold comfort when it cost you hours with a lost loved one. Now, two years after Goldberg\u2019s death, Sandberg has written a new book, \u201cOption B,\u201d which forthrightly addresses all of these issues. It is a remarkable achievement: generous, honest, almost unbearably poignant. It reveals an aspect of Sandberg\u2019s character that \u201cLean In\u201d had suggested but \u2014 because of the elitism at its center \u2014 did not fully demonstrate: her impulse to be helpful. She has little to gain by sharing, in excruciating detail, the events of her life over the past two years. This is a book that will be quietly passed from hand to hand, and it will surely offer great comfort to its intended readers.\u201cI have terrible news,\u201d she told her children, after flying home from Mexico. \u201cDaddy died.\u201d The intimacy of detail that fills the book is unsettling; there were times I felt that I had come across someone\u2019s secret knowledge, that I shouldn\u2019t have been in possession of something that seemed so deeply private. But the candor and simplicity with which she shares all of it \u2014 including her children\u2019s falling to the ground, unable to walk to the grave when they arrive at the cemetery \u2014 is a kind of gift. She was shielded from the financial disaster that often accompanies sudden widowhood, but in every other way she was unprotected from great pain.As she did in the memorable Facebook post composed a month after the death, she reports turning in her misery to the psychologist Adam Grant, a friend who had flown to California to attend the funeral and is an expert in the field of human resilience. She told him that her greatest fear was that her children would never be happy again. He \u201cwalked me through the data,\u201d she writes, and what she learns offers comfort. Getting \u201cwalked through the data,\u201d is as modern a response to grief as the notion that \u201cresilience\u201d is some kind of science. The book includes several illustrative stories that seem to come from Grant\u2019s research, but they are not memorable. It is Sandberg whose story commands our riveted attention, and it is her natural and untutored responses to the horror that are most moving. \u201cThis is the second worst moment of our lives,\u201d she tells her sobbing children at the cemetery. \u201cWe lived through the first and we will live through this. It can only get better from here.\u201d That is grief: Somehow, you find a language; somehow you get through it. No research could have helped her in that moment. She is the one who knew what to do and what to say. They were her children, and she knew how to comfort them.Death humbles each of us in different ways. Suddenly a single mother, Sandberg realized how hollow her \u201cLean In\u201d chapter about the importance of fully involved husbands (\u201cpartners\u201d) must have been to unmarried women. If only she had known how little time she would have with her husband, she thinks, she would have spent more of it with him. But that\u2019s not the way life works; Dave Goldberg fell in love with a woman who wanted to lead, not one who wanted to wait for him to come home from the office. The unbearable clarity that follows a death blessedly fades with time. We couldn\u2019t live with it every day.Sheryl Sandberg followed the oldest data set in the world, the one that says: The children are young, and you must keep going. Slowly the fog began to lift. She found she had something useful to offer at a meeting; she got the children through their first birthdays without their father; she began to have one O.K. day and then another. She made it through a year, all of the \u201cmilestone days\u201d had passed and something began to revive within her. Grief is the final act of love, and recovery from it is the necessary betrayal on which the future depends.

Fans Cheer Anyway.", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byIn January, Christina Ausset, a 24-year-old Maroon 5 fan in France, spotted an enticing Twitter post from another of the band\u2019s followers: \u201cI just had a conversation with Maroon 5! Awesome!\u201d\u201cHaving Maroon 5 on Messenger,\u201d she wrote in an email, \u201cmakes you feel really close to your favorite artists!\u201dFor celebrities who already use Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat to lend a personal touch to their interactions with fans, the next frontier of social media is a deliberately impersonal one: chatbots, a low-level form of artificial intelligence that can be harnessed to send news updates, push promotional content and even test new material.In the music world, \u201cbot\u201d is often a dirty word, conjuring up the tools used by high-tech ticket scalpers. Yet 50 Cent, Aerosmith, Snoop Dogg and Kiss have all deputized chatbots as their automatic, ever-alert greeters on Facebook Messenger, handling the flood of inquiries that would overwhelm any human.When someone connects to Maroon 5 on Messenger, a text bubble pops up: \u201cHi,\u201d it says, \u201cI\u2019m the Maroon 5 bot. Want to be the first to know when we release new music?\u201d A series of questions with multiple-choice answers follows, leading the fan down a path lined with emojis and video clips; social media links then point other fans back to the bot.It is a purposely simple interaction, created through technology developed by a start-up named Octane AI. Yet even in their programmed responses, chatbots can convey human personality, said Christina Milian, a singer and actress who has been among the earliest proponents of the technology, and helped found Persona Technologies, an Octane competitor.\u201cI feel like it\u2019s personal,\u201d Ms. Milian said of her own chatbot. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely in my words. It\u2019s how I talk. My fans know how I talk.\u201dNot all celebrity bots are quite up to the level of verbal verisimilitude, however. Aerosmith\u2019s, for example, responds to virtually every inquiry with \u201cRock on.\u201dBut Ms. Milian said her bot\u2019s intelligence surprised even her. \u201cWhen I\u2019m communicating with my own chatbot,\u201d she said, \u201csometimes I see something and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s so me!\u2019\u201dThe chatbots may also offer a glimpse of the music industry\u2019s future, which is already beginning to involve virtual-reality concerts, playlist algorithms and virtual assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa, said Cortney Harding, a consultant to music technology companies and the author of \u201cHow We\u2019ll Listen Next: The Future of Music From Streaming to Virtual Reality.\u201d\u201cAs A.I. develops, everything is going to go into a mixed-reality world,\u201d Ms. Harding said, \u201cwhere you could dial up a hologram of your favorite pop star and have \u2018real conversations\u2019 with the artificially intelligent version of that person.\u201dOctane AI, founded about a year ago, is one of a handful of technology companies tailoring these programs to the entertainment industry, with clients including Interscope Records, the label behind Maroon 5 and 30 Seconds to Mars. Matt Schlicht, Octane AI\u2019s chief executive, said that with more than a billion users, Messenger \u2014 the chat app connected to Facebook \u2014 was too large for celebrities to ignore. And once they are paying attention, his company\u2019s bots can help them make efficient use of it.\u201cRight now people are looking at bots and saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know, maybe they\u2019re cool, maybe not,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schlicht said. \u201cBut based on the data we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s not crazy to think that a year from now it\u2019s going to be their No. 1 distribution channel.\u201dChatbots have become a common part of online interaction for major consumer companies; Domino\u2019s, for example, lets customers use one to order a pizza. They have quickly spread since April of last year, when Facebook made it possible for developers to build bots on Messenger.The change made Messenger a more useful channel to broadcast information to numerous recipients, and for many artists and marketers it solved a frustrating problem: As Facebook has grown, its news feeds have become more crowded \u2014 not to mention pruned by algorithms \u2014 making it harder and harder to reach followers.Chris Mortimer, the head of digital marketing at Interscope, said Messenger was now a critical way for his artists to reach their fans.\u201cRight now, a Facebook Messenger inbox is what an email inbox was before the spammers got to it,\u201d he said.Maroon 5 also demonstrated its value for commercial research. In February, a day before the band released its single \u201cCold,\u201d it sent a 10-second clip of the song to its chatbot followers. Within 24 hours, fans sent 100,000 messages to the bot, and shared the clip widely on social media.\u201cYou can get pretty strong sentiment analysis in a snap,\u201d said Ben Parr, Octane AI\u2019s chief marketing officer.\u201cI hate the word bot,\u201d said Josh Bocanegra, Persona\u2019s chief executive, who founded the company with Ms. Milian. \u201cIt\u2019s never been associated with anything positive.\u201dOctane AI, which lets anyone use its technology to build a bot, does not charge for its services. The company is supported by $1.6 million from investors including the venture capital firm General Catalyst, and says it will introduce revenue-generating features soon.So far, the bots\u2019 ability to create interactions with pop stars \u2014 even if those interactions are programmed in computer code \u2014 has been enough to intrigue fans.\u201cI know it\u2019s a robot,\u201d Ms. Winett said. \u201cDoes it creep me out that it\u2019s a robot? No.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Berkeley Is Being Tested on 2 Fronts: Free Speech and Safety", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byTo Ms. Coulter and her supporters, it was another example of Berkeley showing intolerance of any opinions other than the liberal ones it is famous for. But the university that championed free expression in the 1960s has become known, in the polarizing first months of the Trump presidency, as something more: a meeting ground for those wanting to express themselves with wooden clubs and fists.\u201cThe city and campus have become the stage on which the national political tensions are playing out,\u201d said Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for the university. \u201cComing here, they know they will be able to find an opponent pretty easily.\u201dBerkeley now finds itself bracing, essentially, for two battles.One is with Ms. Coulter and the groups bringing her to campus, the Young America\u2019s Foundation and the university\u2019s College Republicans. The groups have threatened to sue the university, saying its offer to allow Ms. Coulter to speak the next week, and in the early afternoon, when fewer students will be around to hear her, \u201cviolate fundamental principles of free speech, equal protection and due process guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\u201d\u201cOur basic thing is to send a loud and clear message that this is not acceptable on our campus,\u201d said Hoku Jeffrey, a Berkeley graduate and national organizer for By Any Means Necessary, a group that took part in previous demonstrations that turned violent. \u201cWe will not tolerate anti-immigrant bigotry or bigotry of any kind, which is the only thing she\u2019s here to do.\u201dMeanwhile, Johnny Benitez of Orange County, in Southern California, said he was organizing a group of conservatives to show up in Berkeley. He was part of a group that showed up last weekend for demonstrations that ultimately led to 20 arrests.\u201cI don\u2019t really have a connection to Berkeley,\u201d said Mr. Benitez, 28. \u201cThe reason we go there is to support people who feel that their First Amendment rights are being infringed, our fellow conservatives in the city of Berkeley. The people I\u2019m mostly organizing are coming from six hours away.\u201dMr. Benitez said that his group would arrive unarmed, as they did last weekend. But in recent confrontations, demonstrators have turned rocks, fireworks and police barricades into weapons \u2014 even using a bike lock to wallop someone in the head.\u201cThe way that they assemble, the tactics that they used, it has not been seen in this region,\u201d said Capt. Alex Yao, the acting chief of the university police force, at a briefing on Thursday.Some colleges and universities, like Berkeley, have asked that speakers likely to draw protests appear in the afternoon, when crowds are more controllable than in the evening. Mr. Mogulof, the university spokesman, said Friday that the university was within its rights in setting a day, time and venue that would be \u201csafe for participants.\u201d\u201cWe are confident that we are on very solid legal grounds,\u201d Mr. Mogulof said in an email. \u201cThe constitution permits the university to take such steps to protect public safety while facilitating expressive activities, and that is exactly what we are doing.\u201dPeaceful activism remains a hallmark of the university. On Thursday, students representing the International Socialist Organization handed out fliers for May Day demonstrations amid a half-dozen other booths by organizations trying to lure students to support their causes.At the same time, Berkeley\u2019s reputation as a campus fully engaged in the divisive politics of the day is in some ways at odds with the desire of many students to study, enjoy college life and graduate from one of the country\u2019s premier public universities.On Thursday, as university officials strategized on how to handle Ms. Coulter\u2019s demands, thousands of students lounged on a lawn outside a library building and smoked pot in celebration of April 20, a kind of national holiday for marijuana lovers.\u201cAnn Coulter? What are you talking about?\u201d a woman selling doughnuts as a fund-raiser for her sorority told a reporter. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that at all.\u201dIsaac Meyer, a nuclear engineering student from Bakersfield, Calif., said that while he knew the bare outlines of the Coulter controversy, \u201cmost people don\u2019t have the mental energy to be upset about it.\u201dMr. Meyer, a senior, said that he had taken part in Black Lives Matter protests and that many students attended a women\u2019s march on Jan. 21. But he said he had no interest in attending the recent protests that turned violent.\u201cMost of the people I know, when we find out about a protest like that, we think, \u2018Oh, well, we can\u2019t walk to that part of campus today,\u2019\u201d he said.Veterans of the Free Speech Movement of the \u201960s, a seminal moment in the university\u2019s history, are disheartened that Berkeley is now associated with violence and blocking speech instead of promoting it.Ms. Savio sees a clear generational divide. Free speech, she said, was more of an absolute for her husband, who is commemorated outside Sproul Hall at the heart of the campus by the officially designated Mario Savio Steps.\u201cMario took a principled position \u2014 it was free speech for all,\u201d she said. \u201cI think free speech has slipped as a value.\u201dOr rather, it has been gleefully co-opted by some on the right. On his Facebook post announcing his plans for a weeklong visit to Berkeley, Mr. Yiannopoulos said that each day would be \u201cdedicated to a different enemy of free speech, including feminism, Black Lives Matter and Islam.\u201dHe also wrote that he would give a prize to whoever has done the \u201cmost to protect free expression at UC Berkeley and its surrounding area.\u201dHe said it would be called the Mario Savio Award.Thomas Fuller reported from Berkeley, and Stephanie Saul from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Faces Inquiry in China Over App Store Content", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese authorities plan to question Apple about video streaming services available over its app store within the country, in their latest move to intensify pressure on the American technology giant over the content it provides in the vast and crucial market.The inquiry appears to focus on third-party apps available on the company\u2019s app store in China. The report said the authorities had told three Chinese websites to tighten their oversight of online information, livestreaming services and online performance. Some broadcasters, it said, offered live content forbidden by Chinese law, including pornography.The authorities had already met with Apple representatives about livestreaming apps available on its app store in China, Xinhua said, without disclosing details.An Apple spokesman in China declined to comment.The report comes as Chinese authorities put pressure on Apple over the apps and other content it offers its users in China, which in the fiscal quarter that ended Dec. 31 accounted for about one-fifth of its revenue.The moves are part of a broader Chinese effort to regulate internet content. With services like Google, Facebook and Twitter long blocked in China, Apple is a rare foreign-owned company that provides a significant amount of apps and other content through platforms it controls.More recently, Chinese authorities have also ordered app stores in China to register with the government. Because Google\u2019s app store is among that company\u2019s services that are blocked in the country, a considerable number of locally owned third-party app stores have popped up to serve phones running Google\u2019s Android mobile-operating system. That has complicated China\u2019s efforts to control the country\u2019s fast-growing mobile internet business.The Xinhua report on Wednesday said that Apple had been approached by the Beijing offices of three Chinese agencies. They included the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top online regulator, as well as public security officials and a cultural law enforcement group.The report said three Chinese websites \u2014 toutiao.com, huoshanzhibo.com and huajiao.com \u2014 had violated regulations concerning internet information services. Some potential violations, it said, would be referred to the police.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fish That\u2019s Fast, Easy and Sometimes Even Fancy", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetiteThere are excellent reasons to cook a whole fish, rather than fillets. The skin and bones add enormous amounts of flavor to the flesh, and they also keep it from drying out, which gives you a wider margin of error.There are many times, though, when whole fish just can\u2019t be on my menu. Like when I am in the mood for salmon, and the entire animal would be too much for my small family, or when I\u2019m serving people who don\u2019t like to stare down their dinner.But there is a solution that marries the convenience of a fillet with the succulence of a whole fish: butterflied trout.The prep work is simple. Butterflied trout doesn\u2019t have bones to maneuver around, and it needn\u2019t have the head either. (If yours comes with the head still attached, lop it off with a sharp knife.)It does still come wrapped in its skin, though, and because the fillets are thin, there is a high skin-to-flesh ratio. Even if you\u2019re not fond of eating the skin, its presence intensifies the flavor of the fillets and keeps them nice and juicy. And if you are a fish skin fan, there is more of it to savor, preferably when it\u2019s crisp and salty.The technique for broiled butterflied trout is as simple as it gets. Spread the fish open on a baking pan, season with a little salt and pepper and broil as close to your heat source as possible, until the center of the flesh turns opaque and the edges curl and brown.You can mix the herb butter together while the fish is in the oven \u2014 that is, as long as you\u2019ve taken the butter out of the refrigerator in advance so it\u2019s soft and supple. Better yet, keep some butter on the counter so you will always have spreadable butter on hand. (It can last for a week or so without refrigeration.)At this point, all that\u2019s left to do is add a final garnish. For a weeknight meal, capers add a nice, inexpensive pop of salinity and crunch.Or if you want to turn this into something more deluxe for company, sprinkle the fish with trout or salmon roe. The shimmering orange pearls add a similar salty burst but are a lot more elegant \u2014 and it\u2019s just as quick for the cook.And to Drink ...White wine with fish? In this case, yes. Trout, especially wild trout, can be good with light red wines, like an easygoing Burgundy or pinot noir. But this recipe, with herbs, lemon and capers (and possibly even roe), calls out for a gentle white. A delicate kabinett riesling from the Mosel, with a hint of sweetness, would be a delightful spring treat with this dish. For something a bit sturdier, you could try a white Bordeaux; a good one from Pessac-L\u00e9ognan would be a delicious splurge. An Etna Bianco from Sicily, made with the saline carricante grape, would be terrific. You could also try a good albari\u00f1o from the Galicia region of Spain, or, if you insist on a bit of color in your wine, a bone-dry ros\u00e9. ERIC ASIMOVcookingAdvertisement"}

The job is difficult and unglamorous, like many jobs in the food industry. It does not pay well.Mr. Ahmed\u2019s wife had mentioned to him, in passing, the idea of saving up for a family cruise in the Caribbean. It was a luxury that Mr. Ahmed knew they could not afford for their family of six, but for some reason it had stuck with him.Then one reader, Jennifer Nelson, started a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for Mr. Ahmed and his family and their dream vacation.Ms. Nelson, a general manager at Buttermilk Channel, a restaurant in Brooklyn, read the article on Wednesday and posted it to Facebook. \u201cI wrote a comment about how I wish I had money to buy this family a vacation,\u201d she said. \u201cImmediately, people started commenting that they wished they did too.\u201dMany readers felt a connection to Mr. Ahmed, who is one of more than 10,000 people, most of them immigrants, who make a living selling food on the city\u2019s sidewalks.

I had to keep reminding him that I was working, too, and he didn\u2019t have to worry about taking care of me.\u201cWriting stories is a job?\u201d he\u2019d said, teasing me.At the end of the day, after hopping in and out of his 10-foot-long metal cart a hundred times, jotting down notes on his recipes and watching a series of cute dog videos together, Xu and I both felt lucky to be reporting a story about Mr. Ahmed. \u201cIt was like spending a day with my own father,\u201d Xu wrote to me.This past Friday, a couple of weeks after I had spent that day with Mr. Ahmed, I stopped by his cart to show him that the GoFundMe campaign for his family had reached over $5,000. \u201cI cannot believe this, I cannot,\u201d he said.Since the article was published, Mr. Ahmed\u2019s cart has been extra busy, he told me, and everyone seemed to know his name.

This week, China\u2019s government asked Interpol to issue a request for his arrest.On Friday, Facebook suspended Mr. Guo\u2019s account. After Mr. Guo complained publicly, Facebook said the suspension had been a mistake, and his account was restored.The incident comes in the middle of a full-court press by the Chinese government to push back against the accusations from the eccentric billionaire. It highlights a persistent problem for Facebook, which must manage matters as varied as bad manners and high-stakes political battles on a website with nearly two billion users.Just after midnight on Friday morning, Mr. Guo posted a message on Twitter that said his public Facebook account had been suspended.\u201cWhat does this mean, Facebook blocked me?\u201d he wrote in part in the post. \u201cThey must have gotten really scared!

The precise reason for the suspension would be difficult to determine, the spokeswoman said, adding that publicizing the reasons could allow others to manipulate the system.Mr. Guo did not respond to requests for comment.Facebook has previously caused controversy by blocking content from a high-profile Chinese activist that involved nudity and a post by a Tibetan activist that showed a self-immolation.Some Chinese activists have complained about accounts being sporadically suspended on Facebook and other sites without explanation. In response to Mr. Guo\u2019s post on Twitter, some users brought up a theory that China\u2019s government uses a collection of foreign social media accounts to report accounts like Mr. Guo\u2019s so they will be suspended.The Facebook spokeswoman said the company does not remove content based simply on how many times it has been reported.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If You Don\u2019t Want to Know What This Article Is About, Please Look Away Now", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byOn SoccerMANCHESTER, England \u2014 The formula remains the same after all these years, its familiarity a comfort, its consistency its charm.Every Saturday night, about 10:20 p.m., Kate Silverton, the anchor for the BBC\u2019s 10 o\u2019clock news \u2014 the marquee news program of Britain\u2019s national broadcaster, watched by more than four million people \u2014 hands over from the corporation\u2019s home in London to a studio in Salford, where the BBC\u2019s sports arm is based.One of four sports presenters sits waiting. A cheery welcome and short introduction follow. And then, every week, without fail, comes that warning. It is such an intrinsic part of the broadcast, and has been for so long, that it is not far short of a national ritual, one of those few sentences a whole country knows by heart.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to know the scores,\u201d the announcer intones, \u201cplease look away now.\u201dThe reason is that every Saturday for eight months of the year, \u201cMatch of the Day,\u201d the BBC highlights program and a British institution, follows the 10 \u2019clock news.And somehow, even in an age of wall-to-wall soccer coverage on television, internet streams of varying legality and the constant buzz of social media, there are still British soccer fans who settle in blissfully for \u201cMatch of the Day,\u201d willfully ignorant of all that transpired on the nation\u2019s soccer fields that day.\u201cThere is still a section of the audience that does not know the scores,\u201d Paul Royall, the editor of the 10 o\u2019clock news, said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd we do not want to spoil \u2018Match of the Day.\u2019\u201dOn those rare occasions when mistakes are made, viewers make sure Royall and his team are left in no doubt that they have done just that. And so that warning \u2014 or updated variants of it \u2014 remains, even now, a gentle echo of a past otherwise left behind long ago.It does not survive in its original form, of course. Each presenter now has the freedom to extemporize on the warning \u2014 a nonnegotiable requirement of the program\u2019s opening \u2014 but not by much.\u201cOne of my colleagues says, \u2018If you don\u2019t want to know the scores, you know what to do,\u2019\u201d said Karthi Gnanasegaram, who has delivered them for five years. Her own preference is to invite people to \u201cpop out of the room.\u201dThe subtle shift can be explained by the fact that, where once the BBC would simply show a set of results in silence, now the presenter reads the scores as video from the most important games \u2014 of players celebrating; never of the action itself \u2014 is displayed. \u201cIt is ridiculous to say, \u2018Look away now,\u2019 if you\u2019re then going to talk about it,\u201d Gnanasegaram said.Consideration \u2014 in the form of a short pause and a purposefully vague start to the script \u2014 is then afforded to those who might not react as quickly to the warning as they once did. \u201cWe try to give people a fighting chance,\u201d Royall said in a phone interview.Only when enough time has elapsed for the ritual to be respected will the results of a set of games played several hours earlier be revealed to the British public, many of whom, by that stage, will have been fully informed of precisely what happened for some time. It is like NBC\u2019s careful husbandry of what has happened every day at the Olympics, only performed almost every week of every year.It is hard to tell definitively, but the warning itself \u2014 \u201cif you don\u2019t want to know the scores, please look away now\u201d \u2014 is thought to date to the days of David Davies, a BBC broadcaster from the early 1970s to 1994 who went on to work in a number of senior roles for the Football Association.Davies cannot quite pinpoint when he conjured the sentence; he is not, in truth, even entirely sure it was he. \u201cAllegedly, I am responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect I did invent it, but I am quite sanguine about claiming it. Still, I\u2019m happy to be credited with it, if nobody else wants to do so.\u201dIt came about, he said, because the producers of \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d in those days did not want \u201cthe news giving away the results,\u201d fearing it would dissuade viewers from tuning in.Davies regarded it as \u201cna\u00efve\u201d even then to assume that fans would not want to find out their team\u2019s result long before the evening news, but it should be noted that \u201cavoiding the scores\u201d was common enough that in 1973 an entire episode of \u201cWhatever Happened to the Likely Lads?,\u201d a wildly popular sitcom, was devoted to the concept.Na\u00efve or not, the practice stuck. More remarkable, given how the media environment has shifted in the intervening years, it continues. Fans not able to attend matches can now follow their team on their phones and on goal-update shows broadcast by Sky Sports, BT Sport and even the BBC on Saturday afternoons. The day\u2019s results are regularly featured on the home page of the BBC\u2019s website for much of Saturday evening.And yet still, at 10:20 p.m., the warning comes.\u201cWhen you work in football, it is all-consuming on a Saturday,\u201d said Richard Hughes, series editor of \u201cMatch of the Day.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re monitoring the various TV, radio, digital and social media platforms, but you forget that not everyone is doing the same thing.\u201dOut of deference to them, the program\u2019s pundits are reminded frequently \u2014 by the host, Gary Lineker, no less \u2014 that they must not let slip the outcomes of matches that have not yet been shown on that day\u2019s program. \u201cYou\u2019re told to avoid giving away what\u2019s happened on the games that are coming up,\u201d said Jermaine Jenas, a regular guest.Clearly, the producers feel there is enough demand to maintain the mystery. Hughes points out that while there are no figures available to confirm how many people watch the highlights without knowing what happened, \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d is still the only way about two-thirds of the United Kingdom\u2019s soccer audience consumes the Premier League, since only 20 percent of the national population is on Twitter and only 55 percent is on Facebook.\u201cThere is a big focus in TV on younger audiences, but we shouldn\u2019t forget there\u2019s an awful lot of older viewers who perhaps aren\u2019t so glued to smartphones and social media,\u201d he said.Yet anecdotal evidence suggests resisting the temptation to find out the scores is not solely a function of age. Each week, complaints are directed at Lineker on Twitter \u2014 a demographic hardly filled with older adults \u2014 when he puts out the show\u2019s running order, infuriating dedicated fans who believe doing so offers unnecessary clues to the day\u2019s events.\u201cThere is still a decent portion of the audience who get very angry if we don\u2019t give them enough warning on the news,\u201d Royall said. The numbers of complaints received are not huge, he said, but they tend to be what he described as fairly \u201cintense.\u201dRoyall knows, of course, that the whole tradition is something of an anachronism, in an era defined by immediate information and impatient consumption. And there is a sense that it runs, to some extent, against both his and Gnanasegaram\u2019s journalistic instincts to indulge it.But far from dying out, it seems to be catching. The BBC received 700 complaints in 2013 for naming the winner of a Formula One Grand Prix race before the highlights had been broadcast. And that was dwarfed by the torrent of criticism received after the news headlines revealed who had won the Great British Bake Off. Sometimes, even now, people still do not want to know the scores.Advertisement"}

Williams of the Cleveland Police said at a news conference that investigators knew of no other killings.The suspect was identified as Steve Stephens. In a video posted on the Facebook account of Stevie Steve before the shooting, a man was shown holding an ID card, with the name Steve Stephens, from a mental health clinic where he claimed to be a case manager. By late afternoon, the videos had been removed from Facebook and the account was deactivated.As the manhunt proceeded, the Cleveland news media broadcast Mr. Stephens\u2019s description: African-American, 6-foot-1 and 240 pounds, and he has a full beard. The authorities said he was driving a white or cream-colored Ford Fusion. \u201cWe need to bring this to a conclusion today,\u201d Chief Williams said.He appealed to Mr. Stephens to surrender peacefully to either the police or to a clergy member.Chief Williams said the F.B.I. and state and county law enforcement had joined his department in a search for Mr. Stephens that now extended beyond Cleveland. He said investigators had already pursued hundreds of leads, but there had not been a sighting of the suspect since the shooting.In the minute-long shooting video, a driver pulls up close to an older man on a sidewalk. The driver asks the man to say a person\u2019s name, then pulls out a gun and shoots him. Afterward, the victim can be seen lying on the sidewalk, with a streak of what appears to be blood near his head.The police identified the victim as Robert Godwin Sr., 74, and said that he was shot at random.In the video after the shooting, the gunman pledges to kill as many people as he can: \u201cI\u2019m about to keep killing until they catch me.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information from the authorities, referred incorrectly to the video on Facebook. Although initial reports said the murder was broadcast live, Facebook said on Monday that it was uploaded and was viewed after the killing. (The suspect went on Facebook live at another point in the day.) The article, also using information from the authorities, also misspelled the surname of the victim. He was Robert Godwin Sr., not Goodwin.Niraj Chokshi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The data is anonymized, meaning individuals\u2019 names are not attached to the information, and can be used as a proxy for the health of a rival.After the revelation, angry users demanded that Unroll.me explain why the company had gone into their inboxes and betrayed their trust. Late on Sunday, Jojo Hedaya, the chief executive of Unroll.me, apologized in response to the surprised reaction to a practice that he said the company had been open about in the past.What Unroll.me does is far from an anomaly \u2014 it is part of an expansive and largely unregulated world of selling personal data collected by online consumer services. As long as a service like Unroll.me has a privacy policy, adheres to it and does not sell personally identifiable information, like someone\u2019s name, it is fairly free to package and sell the data it collects.Yet privacy advocates said the modern technology of data analytics allowed such fine-grained measurement of a person\u2019s online behavior that the concept of personally identifiable information was all but obsolete.\u201cMany of the services or apps we use for \u2018free\u2019 are monetizing data about us,\u201d said Lee Tien, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization focused on digital rights.Companies like Unroll.me have long acted as intelligence services offering insights to businesses seeking to gain a competitive edge. Both Uber and Lyft pay for information from Slice as well as other data services, according to two people familiar with the companies\u2019 competitive intelligence programs, who asked to remain anonymous because the programs were confidential. Uber and Lyft declined to comment.In 2014, after concluding its investigation, the F.T.C. called on Congress to protect consumers against the unchecked collection and marketing of their digital data. The F.T.C. report detailed how some of the companies classify consumers in data-driven social and demographic groups for marketing purposes with labels like \u201cfinancially challenged,\u201d \u201cdiabetes interest\u201d and \u201csmoker in the household.\u201d The concern is that such classifications could be used to limit fair access to financial services or health insurance.The F.T.C. recommendation, which was endorsed in a separate report by the Obama administration, was not taken up in Congress.Unroll.me bills itself as offering an easy way to \u201cclean up your inbox.\u201d After someone grants the service access to his or her email account, Unroll.me serves up a list of all the subscriptions they are a part of, with the option to quickly opt out of the ones they no longer want to receive. The company also organizes subscription emails and delivers a newsletter-style digest of some subscriptions.Unroll.me discloses its freewheeling use of personal data in its privacy policy, which says that \u201cwe may collect, use, transfer, sell and disclose nonpersonal information for any purpose\u201d and that the data can be used \u201cto build anonymous market research products and services.\u201dYet few people read such policies closely, privacy advocates said. Katharina Kopp, director of policy at the Center for Digital Democracy, said of Unroll.me, \u201cUnder the disguise of being customer friendly and helping their customers to get rid of \u2018email junk,\u2019 they allow the profiling and targeting of their unwitting customers by third parties.\u201dMs. Kopp called the Unroll.me tactic a \u201cparticularly misleading practice,\u201d despite the disclosure in its privacy policy.In its blog post on Sunday, Unroll.me said it had underestimated how many people would be surprised at the methods it used to build its business. The company said it was working on making its business model more transparent to users, with clearer messaging on its website, on its app and in its frequently asked questions section.Some of those who were upset with the practices of Unroll.me chalked it up to a learning experience.Advertisement"}

Jenny Burke, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, which, with Customs and Border Protection, had issued the summons, did not respond to a request for comment.Technology companies and federal officials have frequently clashed over digital privacy.

{"Headline": "Never Mind the Students; Homework Divides Parents", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byInstead, war broke out among the parents. Those who wanted to keep homework accused the anti-worksheet group of trying to force through a policy supported by a select few. Some privately called the plan \u201ceconomically and racially insensitive,\u201d favoring families with time and money to provide their own enrichment. There was a series of contentious PTA meetings and jockeying to get on the school\u2019s leadership team, a board that some schools have had trouble getting parents to join. At least three families left the school.Robin Broshi, a former education technology consultant, a parent of a third grader and one of the architects of the plan, said the changes gave students time to discover the things they were \u201creally passionate about.\u201d Homework time with her son used to be a \u201chuge battle,\u201d she added, but he now spends hours after school with innovative software programs that enthrall him.But Ashley Sierra, an executive assistant and a single mother with three children at the school, said the policy had created an unwelcome burden on her and other less affluent families that could not afford extra workbooks, or software programs to supplement the new policy. \u201cI hate it,\u201d Ms. Sierra said.Researchers who study academic history said they were not surprised that debate over young children and homework had resurfaced now. Education and parenting trends are cyclical, and the nation is coming off a stress-inducing, federally mandated accountability push that has put standardized testing at the center of the national education debate. Further, many parents say that homework has become particularly stressful since the arrival of Common Core, a set of rigorous and often confusing learning goals adopted by many states.\u201cIt\u2019s a small part of a larger conversation about how kids should spend their time,\u201d Professor Hatch said.There is no official tally on the number of the city public elementary schools that are altering their approach to homework. The Department of Education does not mandate amounts of homework, and most plans are cobbled together as part of a shared vision among a school\u2019s principal, parents and teachers.\u201cThey\u2019re not trying to turn kids into calculators on legs,\u201d he said.But Dr. Cooper\u2019s own research is often cited against him. A 2006 meta-analysis he conducted of more than 60 studies of homework\u2019s efficacy showed that doing homework did not necessarily increase an elementary school student\u2019s test scores or grades. Dr. Cooper updated the analysis in 2012, with similar results.But Dr. Cooper said these studies did not take into consideration homework\u2019s obvious, but less trackable, benefits: teaching organization, time management and discipline. Small amounts of enriching and age-appropriate homework in the early grades, he says, serves as a good way for parents to observe their children\u2019s progress and to teach young people that learning doesn\u2019t happen only inside a classroom. He calls parents who seek to abolish after-school work \u201chomework deniers.\u201dToday, though, worry about excessive homework is competing with anxieties about student achievement and global competition. The situation is compounded by an urge among parents \u201cto have as much control over their children as possible,\u201d Dr. Fass said.\u201cWhat you are looking at is the tension between that progressive view that children need to be protected from being adults, and still these parents want their kids to succeed,\u201d she said.The focus for many anti-homework parents is what they see as the quality of work assigned. They object to worksheets, but embrace projects that they believe encourage higher-level thinking. At P.S. 11 in Manhattan, even parents who support the no-homework policy said they often used online resources like Khan Academy, a nonprofit organization that provides free educational videos. The school\u2019s website also includes handwriting exercises, scientific articles, and math and reading lessons. Sophie Mintz, whose son is in second grade at the school, said that the no-homework policy had afforded him more time to build elaborate Lego structures.But parents with fewer means say the new policies don\u2019t take into account their needs and time constraints, and leave them on their own when it comes to building the skills their children need to prepare for the annual state tests.Ms. Sierra, the P.S. 11 parent who opposed the change, said that although the school included test prep materials on its voluntary homework site, she had a hard time getting her children to do the work.\u201cNow I can\u2019t say, \u2018Your teacher wants you to do this,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me.\u2019\u201dGuadalupe Enriquez, another mother at P.S. 11, who works as a housekeeper, said she looked to the school to provide and monitor work at home. \u201cHaving a little bit of homework is good,\u201d she said.At P.S. 118, the school in Park Slope, a homework policy that started last fall replaced required worksheets with voluntary at-home projects. Tensions have arisen there because the projects often turn out to be videos of after-school activities like gardening or science experiments, in which parents take a guiding role. Some children do presentations about family trips. Elizabeth Garraway, the principal, said that some families had expressed concerns that they didn\u2019t have the time and resources for exciting after-school activities or exotic family vacations.She is working hard to dispel the idea that only certain after-school activities deserve attention, she said, and has encouraged families to consider play dates and trips to the park as good topics for presentations.\u201cYou can do a presentation on anything,\u201d she said.At the school on a recent morning, she showed off the results. In one third-grade class, a boy recently wrote, directed and recorded a \u201cfireside chat\u201d with his father, who played President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A girl arrived at school ready to showcase a PowerPoint presentation on Greek mythology. And Mia Bornstein, 8, showed up one morning with a broom handle bearing an oversize scroll that outlined life in ancient Egypt. Mia said she had worked on it with her mother, an artist.How much time had she spent on it? Hours.Advertisement"}

But this is problematic for home builders and real estate agents, who worry about it diminishing the importance of mortgage interest deduction.What\u2019s not included?\u2022 As of Tuesday, there was no $1 trillion infrastructure program, two of the people briefed on the proposal said.\u2022 There was also no border adjustment tax to offset the cost of the tax cuts.The final plans remained in flux as late as midafternoon Tuesday.The biggest unknown? How will it be paid for. The plan puts off the closing of loopholes and other tax increases that could limit the impact on the budget deficit.But the business world has its concerns.The government\u2019s initial report on the economy\u2019s first-quarter performance is due on Friday and it is expected to be weak. And even if the tax overhaul goes through Congress and corporate profits boom, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean economic performance will improve.\u201cIt\u2019s more about closing loopholes than reducing rates because if you just go to 15 percent, you\u2019re going to leave a large hole in the federal budget,\u201d said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago, warning that long-term prospects would be undermined if they were not accompanied by policies leading to faster economic growth.Credit Suisse made a profit of 596 million Swiss francs, or about $599 million, in the first quarter, compared to a loss of 302 million francs a year earlier.\u201cFresh blood is needed to ensure that the board has sufficient independence.

{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Fueling Conspiracy Whisperers\u2019 Falsehoods?", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byRetro ReportItalians have a word for it: dietrologia.Pronounced dee-EH-tro-lo-GEE-ah, it derives from the word for \u201cbehind.\u201d It is the study of what lurks behind everything \u2014 dietro. For many Italians, truth is rarely so careless as to lie on the surface, especially in public affairs. Someone or something must be manipulating events, unseen, as if from behind a curtain.For years, Donald J. Trump carried the torch of \u201cbirtherism,\u201d the baseless premise that President Barack Obama was born outside the United States. In the presidential campaign last year, Mr. Trump claimed to have witnessed what somehow no one else managed to see: thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheering the devastation of Sept. 11, 2001. Ascension to the nation\u2019s highest office has not changed him in this regard. Without offering any evidence, he has insisted, for example, that Mr. Obama wiretapped his telephones and that millions of noncitizens voted illegally for Hillary Clinton.From almost the moment the shots were fired, conspiracy theories flourished: Oswald did not act alone, or was not involved at all. A plot to kill Kennedy was hatched by the Mafia. Or it was by the Central Intelligence Agency. Or by Cubans. Or by Texas oilmen. Or by various Democrats, not least of them the man who was elevated to the presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson. One hypothesis held that the real target was John B. Connally, the Texas governor who was riding in the car with Kennedy.During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump chimed in with a characteristically vague and unsubstantiated suggestion that Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s father, a Cuban immigrant, had a connection to the killing.Suspicion is ever-lurking now. This is a far cry from 1963 America. Opinion polls show a steep decline in public faith in institutions like the news media, academia, corporate boards, Wall Street banking houses and, for sure, the government. During his campaign, Mr. Trump capitalized on the distrust, and inflamed it, with ominous they\u2019re-out-to-get-you warnings. The entire system is \u201crigged,\u201d he said again and again.Of course, modern tools of communication make it possible to spread falsehoods with lightning speed. A line often attributed to Mark Twain held that a lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on. With today\u2019s technology, the lie can make it all the way to Neptune and back.Twain himself had a dietrologia turn of mind. A line in his \u201cTom Sawyer\u2019s Conspiracy\u201d easily holds up amid present-day realities. What makes a successful scheme? Not truth or decency, that\u2019s for sure. \u201cRight hasn\u2019t got anything to do with it,\u201d Tom says. \u201cThe wronger a conspiracy is, the better it is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "United and Pepsi Affairs Force Brands to Respect Social Media", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byWhen Jason Marker, the new chief executive of the company that owns Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s, met with several of his marketing executives this week, one of his first requests was for screens to be installed in the company\u2019s headquarters to display real-time social media conversations about its brands.It is the sort of setup that already exists at the advertising agencies representing Mr. Marker\u2019s company, CKE Restaurants, and that the company has built internally for events like the Super Bowl, said Brandon LaChance, the director of advertising and digital marketing for the chains, who was at the meeting. But now, he added, that information will be available daily to the whole company, which is based in Franklin, Tenn.\u201cIn most organizations, supply chain, H.R., legal or whatever it is \u2014 they\u2019re not exposed to the same kind of stuff as marketing because it\u2019s not traditionally in their area of responsibility,\u201d Mr. LaChance said, comparing the news flow on such screens to the humming activity of stock quotations, chyrons and headline tickers on CNBC. Now, he said, \u201canyone can take a look at that and see how what they do impacts the business.\u201dIn each instance, consumer outrage was amplified after initial responses from the companies were viewed as too slow and unapologetic.\u201cThe beautiful and the scary thing for marketers is that for the first time in history, they now have this open door for a two-way dialogue with consumers,\u201d Mr. LaChance said. \u201cBut when you do open that door to a dialogue, you better be ready to have it with them.\u201dCrises that play out on social media are increasingly being viewed as threats to a company\u2019s profits instead of short public relations episodes, said Leslie Gaines-Ross, chief reputation strategist at the public relations firm Weber Shandwick. \u201cOne tweet, just one dangerous tweet, can really impact your share price,\u201d Ms. Gaines-Ross said.Weber Shandwick uses a tool to simulate crises for executives, inventing a plausible firestorm then running a drill exposing them to a litany of \u201cchallenging media inquiries, news articles, social channel conversations and videos as you witness the immediate implications of your responses (or non-responses),\u201d according to a description online.Maryam Banikarim, Hyatt Hotels\u2019 chief marketing officer, said that while most executives outside the marketing department had long been aware of the impact that social media interactions can have on their companies, the presidential election drove the point solidly home.\u201cObama got a lot of points for engaging with social media and doing things on Saturday Night Live, and that seemed record-breaking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe today have a president that sometimes breaks news on Twitter before he does it anyplace else, and that\u2019s a marked difference from a year ago. If you didn\u2019t understand the power of social media before, how can you not understand it after this election cycle?\u201dThat has placed a renewed focus on how major brands approach their online accounts and handle potentially problematic situations before they reach a fever pitch, particularly when they\u2019re dealing with huge amounts of data from the likes of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google search and Instagram.Hyatt monitors its social networks and mentions of its brands around the clock, usually responding to people in less than 10 minutes, Ms. Banikarim said, adding that employees are trained to respond to everything and to be aware that all interactions are public.\u201cIt used to be that consumers interacted with you through call centers or they wrote you, so it was a one-on-one communication,\u201d Ms. Banikarim said. \u201cNow, you may be responding to one person\u2019s Twitter, but everyone is seeing it, so you have to be conscious you have a public audience.\u201d That includes private messages, she said, noting that screenshots can be taken and shared.Unilever, the consumer goods giant, relies heavily on deep analytics and powerful language processing tools to understand the \u201ctsunami\u201d of data it sees from social media, said Stan Sthanunathan, its executive vice president of consumer and market insights. He said that 25 percent of his team now worked with social media, compared with 5 percent two years ago.While the tools are more often used to listen to consumers online and identify trends that can lead to new products, like Unilever\u2019s recent introduction of Lipton\u2019s Matcha Green Tea, he said, they can also help the company determine when to respond to potential problems.\u201cSometimes silence is golden,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s very, very important to have analytics, because there are situations where somebody says something and you end up overreacting, and by responding to that very quickly, you may actually fuel the whole fire. With analytics, you may actually note it\u2019s tapering off and showing signs of decline.\u201dThe tools used to monitor social media have evolved vastly from their early days as \u201cvery blunt instruments of listening,\u201d when they simply measured the volume of mentions or general sentiment without context, Mr. LaChance of CKE Restaurants said.\u201cAs a brand, we were absolutely prepared for that, and we closely monitored it,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cbut we were able to understand what mentions were adjacent, if you will, versus people really talking about anything substantive of their feelings towards our brands.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tapping an Ancient Grain for a Modern Meal", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byCity KitchenIf you\u2019re looking for a quick, easy and healthful dinner, farro pasta with peas and pancetta is the dish for you. It\u2019s neither tomato-y nor cheesy, but rather light and green \u2014 a celebration of herby sweetness that is just what you want during these lengthening spring days.Pasta with peas is a classic combination, with many variations, some brothy and some creamy. A salty element \u2014 usually pancetta, guanciale, prosciutto \u2014 is often involved.This particular pasta is dressed with cooked fresh green peas (snow, sugar-snap and garden), scallions, sage, parsley, mint and lemon, some crumbled ricotta salata and a little pancetta. (For a vegetarian version, you can use roughly chopped olives instead.) It can be made in about the same amount of time as some other speedy pastas: Once the peas are prepared, it\u2019s ready faster than you can say cacio e pepe.Using frozen peas, it will be done even quicker, but if possible, take the time to find fresh peas. At the store or farmstand, look for garden peas \u2014 often called English peas \u2014 sold in the pod and ready to shuck. A pound of pods will yield about one and a half cups of shucked peas. Choose pods that are not fat and overfilled; they should have some give when you squeeze them, so you know the peas inside are small and tender. For sugar-snap peas, select specimens that are smooth, shiny and unblemished \u2014 the flatter, the better. Snow peas must seem recently picked, firm and crisp.To accompany the verdant peas, I recommend pasta made from farro, an ancient (as in millenniums) grain at the forefront of the history of wheat. Though similar to modern wheat, farro is higher in protein and other nutrients and is sometimes tolerated by diners with wheat allergies.A bit confusingly, when Italians use the word farro, they may be referring to one of three ancient wheat relatives: einkorn, emmer or spelt. Though whole-grain farro may be better known for its use in soups and salads or as an alternative to rice, when it is milled into flour, it makes a beautiful tawny-brown, nutty-tasting pasta. Cooked properly, it retains a pleasant chewiness.It is a lovely contrast to behold and savor: earthy, rustic pasta mingling with beautiful, herb-perfumed sweet peas. But if that is unavailable to you, whole-wheat or buckwheat noodles are quite pea-friendly, too.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Sees Augmented Reality Ecosystem in Facebook", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported bySAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has long rued the day that Apple and Google beat him to building smartphones, which now underpin many people\u2019s digital lives. Ever since, he has searched for the next frontier of modern computing and how to be a part of it from the start.Now, Mr. Zuckerberg is betting he has found it: the real world.On Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg introduced what he positioned as the first mainstream augmented reality platform, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras.But in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s telling, there are few boundaries for how this technology will evolve. He said he envisioned a world in which people could eventually point smartphone cameras at a bowl of cereal and have an app create tiny sharks swimming in the milk. Friends can leave virtual notes for one another on the walls outside their favorite restaurants, noting which menu item is the most delicious.\u201cThink about how many of the things around us don\u2019t actually need to be physical,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in an interview last week. \u201cInstead of a $500 TV sitting in front of us, what\u2019s to keep us from one day having it be a $1 app?\u201dFacebook does not expect to build all of these software experiences itself. At its annual developer conference on Tuesday, it called for computer programmers to help by building augmented-reality-based apps to work with what Facebook calls its Camera Effects Platform. Facebook announced new tools to aid developers and will begin the initiative with a small number of partners in a closed test.Still, Mr. Zuckerberg said he intended to create the next major app ecosystem that would work with Facebook\u2019s in-app camera. If successful, Facebook could be in a position similar to that of Apple, which relies on the hundreds of millions of apps in its store to keep users buying the company\u2019s smartphones and tablets every year. Facebook, in turn, wants developers to build experiences that entice people to visit its website and apps on a daily \u2014 if not hourly \u2014 basis.\u201cJust like Apple built the iPod and iTunes ecosystem before the iPhone, you want to make sure there\u2019s a set of content there, even if there\u2019s not everything,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Facebook has been building toward this goal for some time. Mr. Zuckerberg has spent the last 18 months reorganizing his company and its suite of consumer apps \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 around a new interface, focused almost entirely on the camera. Slowly, the company has played down the role of text inside its apps, instead encouraging people to take and send photos and videos to one another by using the in-app camera features.In time, Facebook hopes that companies like Electronic Arts, Nike and Warner Brothers \u2014 which are part of the initial set of partners \u2014 will be the ones to bring immersive augmented reality experiences to Facebook\u2019s platform.One early partner app is Giphy Thoughts, made by Giphy, a start-up that acts as a search engine for animated GIFs, which play as something like short-form videos. With Giphy Thoughts, for instance, people can place cartoon thought bubbles above the heads of others they view through their Facebook camera lens.\u201cIt goes back to creative expression,\u201d said David Rosenberg, director of business development at Giphy. \u201cFacebook Camera is just going to be this massive audience of people ready to make deeply personal content they can share with their friends.\u201dWhether Facebook can make it worth the time of more developers to create such apps remains a question.\u201cSoftware developers might ask, why would I create something for Facebook\u2019s platform that I am presumably giving away for free?\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst for Jackdaw Research, an industry analysis firm. \u201cAnd then when competitors introduce A.R. offerings, will I have to create it for Facebook and then a different lens for Snapchat? Or do I wait for Apple and Google to release their A.R. platforms?\u201dThen came Facebook\u2019s most aggressive move, the acquisition of Oculus in 2014. Facebook is investing hundreds of millions of dollars more in V.R. content and apps in the hopes that it will mature into a full-fledged ecosystem similar to Apple\u2019s App Store, but sales of the Oculus Rift goggles have been slow.\u201cThey are shaking things up there but haven\u2019t quite found their stride,\u201d said Stephanie Llamas, head of virtual reality and augmented reality strategy at SuperData Research, a game industry research firm.Mr. Zuckerberg has said the efforts with Oculus will take longer than he and his team initially believed, and probably billions of dollars more in investment. But in the interview last week, he said some of the technology acquired in the Oculus purchase had helped produce the seeds of the new augmented reality platform.Another dark horse is Magic Leap, the secretive augmented reality start-up that has an enormous investment from Google and Alibaba and is working on hardware to offer a similar experience. The company has yet to unveil an official product.For the near term, however, Mr. Zuckerberg sees the smartphone camera as the first step forward.\u201cWe want to get to this world in the future where you eventually have glasses or contact lenses where you can mix digital or physical objects in the digital world,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Rides a Market Wave, but Business Looks for Results", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byThe investor enthusiasm that began with President Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in November has burst out anew on Wall Street, even as Washington remains gridlocked and evidence of any real pickup in the economy is scarce.Stocks have surged 5 percent since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. And that is on top of the 6 percent rally that followed his win in November.The cause for bullishness on Tuesday was Mr. Trump\u2019s new call to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent \u2014 deficits, perhaps, be damned.\u201cC.E.O.s are pragmatists,\u201d said Bill George, a Harvard Business School professor who formerly ran Medtronic, the giant medical-device maker. \u201cIf you cut my taxes and ease up on regulations, then I will like you. The bigger question is, can he get anything done?\u201dThe market impact of the Trump presidency is based so far on prospects \u2014 with details and congressional dynamics left to be sorted out \u2014 rather than accomplishments.But plenty of other factors are providing a tailwind for traders, including unexpectedly strong earnings reports from blue-chip companies like Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s and the receding chances that French voters will turn their backs on Europe.Technology giants like Apple, Facebook and Amazon have shown robust growth, lifting the Nasdaq index past 6,000 for the first time on Tuesday, a 26 percent gain from a year ago.Blair Effron, a founder of Centerview Partners, a prominent independent investment bank on Wall Street, said he believed that beyond any immediate policy shift in Washington, investors had taken their cue from signs of healthier growth globally.\u201cEurope and emerging markets are doing better,\u201d Mr. Effron said, \u201cand there is an underpinning of global stability and growth that are having much more of an impact than people think.\u201dNot all the signals domestically are coming in strong, however. The government\u2019s initial report on the economy\u2019s first-quarter performance is due Friday, and it is expected to be weak.And even if Mr. Trump manages to get Congress to pass a tax overhaul, and corporate profits then boom, that will not necessarily translate into better overall economic performance, warned Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago.\u201cWe have to distinguish between pro-profit and pro-growth policies,\u201d she said. \u201cA pro-profit approach increases the share of the pie going to corporate earnings and shareholders. Pro-growth policies increase the size of the pie.\u201dSo far, Ms. Swonk said, the Trump administration seems to favor the former. And while Wall Street will always reward rising corporate profits with higher share prices in the short term, the country\u2019s long-term prospects will be undermined if that trend is not accompanied by policies that lead to faster economic growth.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to cut taxes, but reform is harder,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about closing loopholes than reducing rates because if you just go to 15 percent, you\u2019re going to leave a large hole in the federal budget.\u201dWhile the prospects for a tax overhaul are murky on Capitol Hill, especially in light of the failure of House Republicans in March to agree on a replacement for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, executives say they are encouraged by the business-friendly stance of the White House.Bruce Van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, said he was initially concerned by Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements on trade and immigration when he took office in January.\u201cI feel better because in the first 100 days, the president\u2019s tone on those issues has moderated,\u201d Mr. Van Saun said.At the same time, executive actions, like requiring government agencies to roll back two existing regulations for every new one, have also played well with business leaders, especially in the financial services industry.\u201cThat\u2019s caused some of the regulatory apparatus to pause and appreciate there is a new sheriff in town and the rules of the game are changing,\u201d said Mr. Van Saun, who took over at Citizens, a regional banking chain based in Rhode Island, after more than two decades on Wall Street.What is more, Mr. Van Saun added, \u201cthe commitment to the positive elements of the platform \u2014 lower taxes, less regulation and pro-energy policies \u2014 continues to be there.\u201dEnergy industry executives are hoping that Mr. Trump will deliver on his promises to reduce regulation in their sector and open up new areas for drilling and development.\u201cIf you watch what he does as opposed to the noise around him, so far so good,\u201d said Charif Souki, chairman of Houston-based Tellurian and a leading industry spokesman for increasing natural gas exports from the United States.Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major oil and gas independent, echoed Mr. Souki\u2019s cautiously optimistic assessment of President Trump.\u201cI think generally he\u2019s doing well,\u201d Mr. Sheffield said. \u201cI think the Republicans have to get together and get something done.\u201dTo be sure, Mr. Trump has spent more time listening to business leaders in the first few months of his presidency than actually delivering on what they want.\u201cIn the first 100 days of his presidency, Trump has given more attention to C.E.O.s than Obama did in eight years,\u201d said Mr. George, who is not a supporter of Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat he does is a whole different story. But they do feel like he\u2019s listening, and there\u2019s a lot of ego gratification in having the president listen to you.\u201dIf the president cannot deliver, or the economy fails to pick up speed, investors may be setting themselves up for a fall, warned Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank.A look at the business backgrounds of Trump administration appointees and advisers.\u201cExpectations for the future are wild,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cThere is quite a disconnect between what the data suggests and where the stock market is trading.\u201dStill, even if it looks frothy, the euphoria is not approaching tech-bubble levels circa 2000.\u201cIn 2000, the price-to-earnings ratio for Nasdaq was 170; today it is trading at 26 times,\u201d Charlie Bilello, the director of research at the investment advisory firm Pension Partners, said, referring to a common gauge for measuring stock valuations. \u201cThat is not cheap, but it\u2019s not crazy. We are definitely not at the level where the average guy quits his job to trade stocks.\u201dThat may be true, but there is no doubt that the explosion in the market value of these companies has taken many investment professionals by surprise, even if most investors agree that their corporate fundamentals are solid.With the rollback of the health care law put off and big infrastructure spending plans still up in the air, bulls and bears alike on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms will be focused on the prospects for a tax overhaul in the coming months.But within the business community itself, there are sharp differences between industries that stand to gain and those that stand to lose as the tax code is redrawn.A low overall corporate tax rate would be great but would not be worth giving up provisions like the mortgage interest deduction or homeowners\u2019 ability to write off state and local taxes, said William E. Brown, the president of the National Association of Realtors.At the same time, smaller manufacturers and others worry that they might still be subject to a nearly 40 percent rate even if larger corporations use their political clout to guarantee a hefty cut.Suku V. Radia, the chief executive of Bankers Trust, Iowa\u2019s largest independently owned bank, said he was eager to learn more details, like the impact of a major tax cut on the budget deficit.\u201cIt is obviously a significant drop from where we are currently, and I\u2019d like to at least be able to better understand what do we do to make up for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the loss of revenues going to be, and how are we trying to fill the gap?\u201dWhatever details come out of the White House, getting a tax bill passed will be anything but easy.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is such a thing as \u2018tax simplification,\u2019\u201d Mr. Radia said. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently complicated.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The C.E.O. of H.I.V.", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "FeatureMichael Weinstein\u2019s AIDS Healthcare Foundation treats an enormous number of patients \u2014 and makes an enormous amount of money. Is that why so many activists distrust him?Supported byThe question was met with an awkward silence. Most AIDS organizations do accept grants from pharmaceutical companies \u2014 in some cases large ones. It is widely seen as a symbiotic relationship. AIDS nonprofits depend on funding from drug companies; drug companies depend on the organizations to educate patients about their wares. That arrangement rankled Sanders, who views the pharmaceutical industry as a public menace. In the primary, one of his signature issues was support for California\u2019s Proposition 61, a referendum that sought to control drug prices by barring public insurers from paying any more than the prices charged to the Veterans Health Administration, which traditionally gets a big discount. A few of the AIDS activists gathered in San Bernardino \u2014 along with a number of experts and patient groups \u2014 had strong reservations about the unintended consequences of that initiative. Some worried it would drain R.&D. budgets; others feared it would prod drug companies to jack up prices on veterans. Sanders did not share their reservations about Prop. 61. \u201cDrug companies are ripping off the American people in a big way,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are bad-news people, and they need to be taken on.\u201dThe next day, the Sanders campaign circulated a news release about the meeting, which, to Staley\u2019s shock, focused entirely on Sanders\u2019s support for Prop. 61, and, in Staley\u2019s view, gave the misleading impression that everyone present joined Sanders in endorsing the referendum. After Staley took to Facebook to dispute the account \u2014 \u201cFeeling used and abused by the Sanders campaign right now,\u201d he wrote to 12,000 followers \u2014 the Sanders campaign\u2019s policy director, Warren Gunnels, attacked Staley personally on Twitter. Using scare quotes to insinuate that Staley, who once chained himself to a balcony of the New York Stock Exchange to protest high drug prices, didn\u2019t really deserve to be called an \u201cactivist,\u201d Gunnels claimed that Staley had \u201cmade a fortune from big drug companies.\u201d As evidence, Gunnels linked to a post on a website called Stop Pharma Greed that was teeming with opposition research on some of the biggest names in AIDS activism. The post accused Staley of \u201cshilling for big Pharma\u201d and taking funding from companies like DuPont Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead Sciences. \u201cIn short,\u201d the post concluded, \u201cStaley\u2019s livelihood since the year 2000 ... appears to have been wholly dependent on, or funded directly by, the drug industry.\u201d Staley called the accusation a \u201cTrumpian lie,\u201d noting that he has lived entirely on savings for the last five years. (The tweet was later deleted.)The activists hadn\u2019t known what to make of Sanders\u2019s frostiness, but as soon as they saw Gunnels\u2019s tweet, the fog lifted. Staley believed that someone had goaded the Sanders campaign into going nuclear on him, and he had no doubt about who that someone was. Stop Pharma Greed was funded by Staley\u2019s longtime nemesis, Michael Weinstein, the 64-year-old founder and director of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the world\u2019s largest and most controversial AIDS organization. (The Sanders campaign denied Staley\u2019s claim.) Weinstein was also the financier behind Prop. 61, which would go on to become the most expensive referendum of 2016, thanks to the pharmaceutical industry, which spent $120 million on the campaign, and eventually defeated it with 53 percent of the vote. More money was spent against Prop. 61 than was spent on behalf of any candidate for governor or Senate in 2016.Directors of health care nonprofits are traditionally cautious and courtly, fearful of choking the funding streams that issue from nit-picking grant committees and image-conscious donors. Weinstein, an ex-Trotskyite, is no courtier. He runs his organization as a \u201csocial enterprise,\u201d meaning that it generates most of its revenue not from grants and fund-raising but from adjacent businesses. A.H.F.\u2019s main business is a network of pharmacies and clinics that provide primary care to more than 41,000 patients in the United States, most of whom have their insurance claims paid by government insurance programs like Medicaid. The excess income from these patients helps the AIDS Healthcare Foundation provide free care to more than 700,000 H.I.V. patients internationally \u2014 the greatest reach of any AIDS organization. This prodigiously successful model has both insulated A.H.F. from typical funding woes and helped it to expand at an astonishing clip. Over the last six years, A.H.F.\u2019s budget has grown from $300 million to more than $1.4 billion, about the size of Planned Parenthood. If their projections hold, it will reach $2 billion by 2020, giving A.H.F. \u2014 a private entity effectively under the control of one man \u2014 a budget nearly half the size of the World Health Organization\u2019s.Paradoxically, that projected growth depends in part on whether drug costs remain high. While cutting drug prices is an ideological objective for Weinstein, his pharmacies stand to lose revenue should he succeed in that mission. \u201cMost of the time when people benefit from something, they don\u2019t lobby against it,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cBut we\u2019re Robin Hood. If someone was writing an epitaph for this organization some day, it will be: \u2018Bit the hand that fed it.\u2019\u2009\u201dA.H.F.\u2019s rapid ascent has made Weinstein an object of scorn among his peers, who deplore not only his tactics but also his unorthodox positions on public-health issues. Unlike nearly all other AIDS activists and public-health researchers, Weinstein opposes PrEP, the H.I.V.-prevention pill, which he believes will cause a \u201cpublic-health catastrophe\u201d by triggering a dangerous increase in risky sex. He has also campaigned to make condoms mandatory in adult films, even going so far as to introduce a statewide referendum in California, Proposition 60. Weinstein\u2019s positions have been assailed by peers as counterproductive fearmongering. \u201cIt reminds me very much of the Tea Party people with regard to Obamacare,\u201d Ernest Hopkins, director of legislative affairs for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, told me in 2013, referring to Weinstein\u2019s opposition to PrEP. \u201cIf you\u2019re prepared to say whatever you want and lie and demagogue and misrepresent the facts, then you can get a lot of airtime, and you can also persuade a lot of people.\u201dTo his many critics in AIDS activism, Weinstein is the Koch brothers of public health: a mastermind driven by ideology, accountable to no one, with bottomless funds and an agenda marked by financial opportunism and puritanical extremes. It doesn\u2019t help that A.H.F. has been the subject of near-constant litigation and complaints for questionable business practices, including union-busting, giving kickbacks to patients, overbilling government insurers and bullying funders into denying grants to institutional rivals. (A.H.F. has denied these accusations.)To his faithful, however, Weinstein is not only a provider of superior health care but also an evangelist of moral urgency at a time when prevention efforts are floundering and drug prices are surging. Weinstein seems to view himself in loftier terms, as a holy warrior sent to save the innocent, not only from the scourge of H.I.V. but also from those he views as the virus\u2019s human collaborators: a satanic trifecta of greedy executives, vainglorious activists and incompetent bureaucrats.The first time I visited, in February of last year, Weinstein invited me to sit down without shaking my hand. A lean man with a long forehead, bird-of-prey features and a nerdy, pocket-protector vibe, Weinstein had a formal demeanor but was wearing jeans and a hoodie \u2014 a common outfit for a tech leader but unusual for a health care magnate. Weinstein took me on an abbreviated tour, proudly showing off photos he had taken with celebrities and political figures \u2014 Magic Johnson, Alicia Keys, former Senator Tom Harkin. Above his desk hung an Expressionist portrait of his best friend, with whom he founded A.H.F., Chris Brownlie. By all accounts, Brownlie was the softhearted yin to Weinstein\u2019s gladiatorial yang, as charming and consensus-seeking as Weinstein was splenetic and introverted. Brownlie died from AIDS-related complications in 1989.Weinstein has a long history of militancy. Born in Brooklyn\u2019s Bensonhurst neighborhood to a family of left-wing Jews, at age 13 he volunteered for an antiwar congressional candidate and worked as an equipment mule for his filmmaker sister, toting around a 40-pound battery while she shot footage of protesters burning draft cards in Central Park. The next year, he joined a group of activists occupying a new high-rise development to protest what was not yet known as gentrification. Though he realized he was gay early on, he repressed his sexuality for many years, eventually moving in with an older girlfriend. At age 18, he had his first gay encounter with an upstairs neighbor, also officially straight, who knocked on his door one night when both of their girlfriends were out of town.In 1972, when Weinstein was 19, he traveled to California and joined Los Angeles\u2019s gay activism scene. An outsider among both mainstream gays (for being a Marxist) and Marxists (for being gay), Weinstein decided to start his own group, which he called the Lavender and Red Union. The group eventually merged with a gay-friendly Trotskyite organization in New York called the Spartacist League, which offered Weinstein a leadership position, requiring him to move back to the East Coast. He wasn\u2019t at his new post for long, though, before he fell out with his comrades over an unusual matter: the Roman Polanski sexual-abuse case, in which the director was accused of drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. \u201cThey felt that it was not rape, that the girl knew what she was doing,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s boyfriend at the time, Albert Ruiz, told me. Weinstein believed it was rape and felt strongly enough about the matter, among other disputes, that he resigned.Disillusioned with activism, Weinstein briefly ran a candy business in Los Angeles before returning to politics to face an unlikely antagonist. In 1986, the right-wing conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche introduced a ballot referendum in California that would have enabled employers to fire people with AIDS and empowered the government to quarantine them. Early polling suggested that LaRouche\u2019s initiative had broad support. Along with Brownlie and other friends, Weinstein started his own group to fight LaRouche\u2019s proposition. In a move that anticipated his later shock-marketing campaigns, Weinstein distributed leaflets with the headline \u201cSTOP AIDS CONCENTRATION CAMPS\u201d and organized a torch-lit march on LaRouche\u2019s Silver Lake office. Mainstream gay activists abhorred Weinstein\u2019s strong-arm tactics, fearing he might alienate suburban voters. But after the measure lost in a landslide, with 71 percent opposed, L.A. Weekly named Weinstein \u201cBest Young Activist.\u201d Weinstein determined that there was far greater support for his militant approach than he had realized.As the AIDS crisis intensified, Weinstein watched more and more of his friends grow ill and die. Los Angeles County hospital had barely developed procedures for handling dying AIDS patients, and many were left to expire alone on gurneys in crowded hallways. Doctors and nurses would often refuse to care for AIDS sufferers, and when the untreated patients died, undertakers often turned them away, too. In some parts of the country, the deceased ended up in garbage bags delivered directly to crematories. Weinstein wanted to ensure that AIDS patients could die in a respectful, peaceful atmosphere. In 1989, he and Brownlie founded the precursor of A.H.F. \u2014 the AIDS Hospice Foundation. In 1990, as more AIDS medications became available, Weinstein changed the group\u2019s name to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and shifted its focus to medical care for the living. In the late \u201990s, little by little, A.H.F. expanded from Southern California into Florida and New York. Then, in 2000, A.H.F. made a change that would prove crucial to its business model: It opened its first pharmacy.Pharmacy services are, in Weinstein\u2019s words, A.H.F.\u2019s \u201cjet fuel.\u201d That\u2019s because 70 percent of spending on H.I.V. care consists of drug costs. While H.I.V. patients in the United States skew poor, the costly insurance claims they generate by filling prescriptions make them gold mines, not only for pharmaceutical companies but also for certain pharmacies, like Weinstein\u2019s, that take advantage of a federal program called 340B. Passed in 1991, 340B allows pharmacies attached to medical practices serving underprivileged populations to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at, on average, a 35 percent discount but still be reimbursed by insurers for 100 percent of the wholesale price. In effect, 340B allows pharmacies to keep around 35 percent of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s tab, a roundabout way of subsidizing health care for the poor. As the price of AIDS medications has spiraled upward in recent years, A.H.F.\u2019s coffers have swelled. The cost of the latest first-line H.I.V. treatment \u2014 a combination pill from Gilead called Genvoya \u2014 is about $34,000 per patient per year. When a patient uses an A.H.F. pharmacy, about $22,000 of that bill goes to Gilead, and $12,000 goes to A.H.F. The foundation\u2019s pharmacies serve 50,000 patients in the United States, generating approximately $1 billion each year in revenue \u2014 about $200 million of it surplus. That money subsidizes A.H.F.\u2019s expansion and advocacy as well as the group\u2019s political activities.The pool of potential patients for an organization like A.H.F. is oceanic. In 2014, 37,600 Americans were newly infected with H.I.V. That number has declined only slightly over the last decade, as America\u2019s epidemic has settled into a baleful equilibrium of slow growth and rising costs. The lack of progress is especially disheartening considering that H.I.V. medications, when properly administered, render patients almost totally noninfectious. These medications aren\u2019t new \u2014 they\u2019ve existed for two decades. If every infected American took them, our epidemic would be over. Instead, of the roughly 1.2 million Americans with H.I.V., only 40 percent are on medication, a rate lower than South Africa\u2019s. Weinstein believes that America\u2019s AIDS nonprofits, which he refers to derisively as \u201cAIDS Inc.\u201d \u2014 a label meant to evoke sclerotic incumbents who collect renewable grants and stand only for their own perpetuation \u2014 have been useless in the face of the epidemic. To win, he thinks, \u201cAIDS Inc.\u201d has to be sidelined so that A.H.F. can lead the way.To recruit new patients, sales reps are expected to hold several events each month, most of them in high-risk zones. Events vary by location. On Los Angeles\u2019s Skid Row, for example, reps hand out McDonald\u2019s gift cards to anyone willing to take a rapid H.I.V. test. In South Central, the reps sometimes set up a game called Cash Box, in which contestants who agree to a rapid test enter a plexiglass booth where they try to grab cash as it is blown around at high speeds. In gay neighborhoods, reps may invite passers-by to play Dildo Toss \u2014 a carny-inspired game in which players hurl phalluses of varying colors and sizes into a hole carved out of a plank of wood. \u201cWe give them three chances,\u201d explained Edwin Millan, director of sales for the Western United States, \u201cand if it goes in the hole, they get to spin a wheel and they get a prize.\u201d (In 2015, two former employees filed a whistle-blower suit arguing that A.H.F.\u2019s patient incentives amounted to illegal kickbacks; the lawsuit has not yet reached a resolution, and A.H.F. denies the claims.) In addition to seeking out patients directly, sales reps also cultivate referral sources by hosting lunches for area doctors.The retreat\u2019s kickoff dinner was held in the French Quarter, at Deanie\u2019s Seafood. Tucked away in a back room, the gregarious sales reps kibitzed noisily, slurping crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e as Weinstein, seated at the head of a long table, examined his battalion. Like other divisions at A.H.F., this group was anchored by black women in floral prints and gay men of all races in checkered shirts; many were new hires Weinstein was meeting for the first time. \u201cSometimes I have to pinch myself,\u201d Weinstein whispered to me, marveling at how swiftly his organization had expanded.As the sales reps emptied their plates and hailed waiters for second and third rounds of wine, Weinstein tapped his glass with a fork and called the group to attention. \u201cI\u2019d like to officially welcome you to the Big Easy!\u201d he squawked in his blunt Brooklynese. \u201cDo whatever you want as long as you wake up in the morning.\u201d The reps laughed. \u201cYou know, this is a really powerful force on behalf of the organization \u2014 a powerful force on behalf of the growth. Going out there, pounding the pavement, going after new accounts and clients \u2014 you have to be immune to rejection to be successful, and that\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m pretty bad at it myself!\u201d He wasn\u2019t kidding. Weinstein belies the clich\u00e9 that the best fighters develop a thick skin: He has sustained himself through decades of conflict by salting unhealed wounds, nursing unceasing resentment and preserving grudges in amber.The morning after the dinner, the sales reps reconvened in a dreary conference room with red tablecloths and damask carpeting. Programming for the first day called for an icebreaker in which employees were asked to scribble unusual facts about themselves on pieces of paper tossed into a hat. One man, a bodybuilder from South Beach with silver hair and pumpkin-colored skin, wrote that he used to train with Madonna; a copper-haired woman from San Francisco disclosed that she swam through garbage during an initiation ritual for Semester at Sea. Weinstein\u2019s own fact, the one he always uses for such exercises, was that he dropped out of high school.The icebreaker was followed by an exercise intended to explore how to navigate conversations with A.H.F.\u2019s critics. Weinstein gave volunteers the option of representing the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, leaders of which have been vocally critical of A.H.F., or a \u201cPrEP crazy,\u201d someone incensed by Weinstein\u2019s opposition to the H.I.V.-prevention pill. Another volunteer would play A.H.F.\u201cI\u2019ll be S.F.A.F.!\u201d volunteered the copper-haired woman. Her counterpart was a man whose upper lip was adorned with a sumptuous mustache.\u201cI\u2019m here to talk to you about the services that we provide,\u201d he began.\u201cI know all about A.H.F., actually,\u201d replied the copper-haired woman, her eyes narrowing. \u201cYour reputation precedes you.\u201d\u201cO.K., awesome. Did you know that we started the first AIDS hospice in Los Angeles about 28 years ago?\u201d he asked. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve grown rapidly, primarily overseas.\u201dThe reps laughed; they\u2019d all heard some version of this tirade a thousand times. Weinstein took the floor and concluded the session by telling a little story about a nun he once met. She ran a hospital, which required her to make tough budgetary decisions in the name of helping people. Whenever people criticized her for being harsh, she had a canned response: \u201cNo margin, no mission!\u201d This, according to Weinstein, is what A.H.F.\u2019s critics couldn\u2019t bring themselves to understand. \u201cWe should never be in a position of apologizing for our success,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that we take a business model from the private sector and utilize it on behalf of a nonprofit is a great thing.\u201dAnd then there are the billboards. In major American cities \u2014 and increasingly, around the world \u2014 Weinstein\u2019s most visible impact is his trolling approach to sexual-health messaging. In 2013, he put up signs in several cities with the image of a magma-spewing volcano captioned, \u201cSYPHILIS EXPLOSION.\u201d The following year, in South Central, he posted billboards with two black men spooning in bed alongside the leading question \u201cTrust Him?\u201d Some ads have been humorous and topical \u2014 a sendup of the Netflix logo replaced with the mantra \u201cGet Tested and Chill,\u201d a Bernie Sanders parody with the modified slogan \u201cFeel the Burn?\u201d Others have hectored the public with reproachful questions: \u201cFriends With Benefits?\u201d \u201cSexually Reckless?\u201d \u201cWorried?\u201d One A.H.F. billboard managed to cause a national scandal in Uganda. Unusually for a nonprofit, A.H.F. employs a 15-person in-house creative agency to create its messaging. The expense is justified because the billboards are a marketing channel: They seek to stir dread in the libertine masses, not only to stem what Weinstein sees as a rising tide of promiscuity but also to drive traffic to his clinics.In the press, Weinstein has attracted the most attention for his hostility to PrEP, a once-a-day antiretroviral that reduces the likelihood of contracting H.I.V. by 99 percent. In 2015, the C.D.C. began recommending PrEP for anyone at \u201chigh risk\u201d for H.I.V. infection, including any gay man not in a monogamous relationship who has had sex in the last six months without a condom (1.2 million people, according to the C.D.C.\u2019s estimates). Many hailed it as an era-defining advance. Weinstein, virtually alone among major AIDS figures, has assailed PrEP, calling it a \u201cparty drug\u201d that could lead to a collapse in condom use. In a citizen petition to the Food and Drug Administration following PrEP\u2019s approval in 2012, A.H.F.\u2019s lawyer denounced the treatment as \u201cunsafe and ineffective.\u201d Weinstein called on Margaret Hamburg, the agency\u2019s commissioner, to resign over the issue, suggesting she was part of a pharma-led plot to put millions of Americans on a new medication.Weinstein\u2019s critique of PrEP is a fringe view. According to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, support for PrEP among researchers and regulators is all but universal. \u201cIt\u2019s having an extraordinarily positive impact,\u201d he says. Robert Grant, a professor of medicine at U.C.S.F. and a leading PrEP researcher, credits the treatment with \u201ca plummeting decline\u201d in H.I.V. transmission rates among white gay men in San Francisco.Nevertheless, Weinstein is quoted regularly in articles about the treatment, and his noisy skepticism has reverberated across the internet. Some argue that Weinstein\u2019s grandstanding during public hearings delayed PrEP\u2019s approval by the C.D.C., and that his sowing of doubt about the medication is continuing to suppress its use, especially in black and Latino communities. \u201cWhat I find in my practice,\u201d Grant says, \u201cis that A.H.F.\u2019s propaganda does not impress or influence privileged groups of gay men. They can see right through it. But when I talk to some people of color who are clients in my clinics, I find they\u2019ve heard the A.H.F. message, and it gives them pause, it makes them concerned, it appeals to their sense that this isn\u2019t for them.\u201d Despite the C.D.C.\u2019s efforts, very few people, even now, are on PrEP; according to recent estimates, only about 100,000 people take it.Weinstein\u2019s concerns about PrEP are in line with his other heterodox positions, which often cut against the sexual-liberationist doctrine embraced by other activists. Many issues that have been controversial in the gay community, he claims, like laws that make it illegal to intentionally infect a sexual partner with H.I.V., are no-brainers for ordinary voters. \u201cSome people are so extreme,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a group here in California that wants to reduce intentionally infecting somebody from a felony to a misdemeanor. There\u2019s articles being written basically saying we should be proud to bareback\u201d \u2014 slang for condomless sex. \u201cIn the hothouse environment of the gay community, that point of view is very popular, but it isn\u2019t in the community at large, and it isn\u2019t in the medical community either.\u201dWhat motivates Weinstein to adopt such lonely views? Weinstein\u2019s fiercest critics have often searched for a financial motive, some even going so far as to suggest that he aims to profit from the spread of H.I.V. Those who know him personally dismiss this explanation. Phill Wilson, president of the Black AIDS Institute, first met Weinstein in 1980 when Wilson was dating Chris Brownlie. In fact, the first iteration of A.H.F. was founded in Wilson\u2019s living room. \u201cThis is the mistake that people make when they think about Michael,\u201d Wilson told me. \u201cWhether what he does is good or bad, he does what he believes is in the best interests of people living with H.I.V. or at risk of infection.\u201d Weinstein was \u201cprimarily driven by mission,\u201d Wilson said. Even Peter Staley concedes that point. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the money for him,\u201d he told me, unsurprised to learn that in Weinstein\u2019s most recent annual report, he disclosed a comparatively humble salary of $400,000, low for directors of similarly sized nonprofits. \u201cThe core of the business at A.H.F. is not something that has been scandalous,\u201d Staley says. \u201cIt is an empire worth building. A.H.F.\u2019s problem is that once it created the largest AIDS empire on the planet, it started using that power for nefarious purposes: Michael Weinstein\u2019s twisted political views.\u201dEven so, when I visited Weinstein at his office in February, he showed no sign of disappointment. Discussing recent losses, he wasn\u2019t merely philosophical; he was downright giddy. \u201cI had never been involved with a campaign,\u201d he said, referring to the drug-pricing initiative, \u201cwhere people were so enthusiastic about something that didn\u2019t win.\u201d (He would later use the same line with reporters when his anti-density ordinance went down in flames.) As we chatted, he sipped from a radioactive-looking bottle of apple-melon Isopure; he said he liked his chances for this November, when he would try again with a new drug-pricing initiative, this time in Ohio. The problem in California, he said, was that the drug companies had flooded the airwaves \u2014 \u201ctotal aerial bombardment, 3,500 gross rating points a week\u201d \u2014 but he doubted that kind of \u201crazzmatazz\u201d would work in flyover country. \u201cMidwesterners are kind of square-shouldered, common-sense people. I\u2019d think there\u2019d be a backlash if they dumped $80 million into Ohio.\u201dIf that referendum were to pass, Weinstein figured, then Big Pharma\u2019s citadel \u2014 the American market \u2014 would start to crack. Ohio would be copied by other states, and the V.A.\u2019s price for drugs would become the universal price, as even private insurers would demand to pay the new public rate. Billions would be shaved off pharma\u2019s bottom line, meaning the industry would no longer have the muscle to bully Congress into propping up its international patent regime. Drug prices would plummet across the world, AIDS medications would flow freely and the industry\u2019s lobbying operation would shrink so much that it could be drowned in a bathtub. This sequence of events seemed far-fetched, but Weinstein was nevertheless optimistic about the coming year, win or lose. His equanimity in the face of failure reminded me of something he once said to me about Prop. 60, the condoms-in-porn bill. It lost at the ballot box by an eight-point margin, but Weinstein found a reason to declare victory. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more than 10,000 stories on condoms in porn,\u201d he boasted. \u201cForget about porn: That\u2019s a lot of free advertising for condoms.\u201dWeinstein often consoles himself in moments of defeat by reaffirming his commitment to the long game. This is part of what makes him so frustrating to his critics: It is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to distinguish his cynical ploys from his ideological commitments. In his person, the will to power and the will to change the world seem to fuse. It wasn\u2019t simply that he cared more about fighting than about winning. Eventually, he believes, people will come around to his view. And if they don\u2019t, that\u2019s fine, too: A.H.F. will continue to thrive, even in a fallen world.Christopher Glazek is a freelance writer based in New York and the founder of the Yale AIDS Memorial Project.Advertisement"}

Fifteen women spill their guts.SHARONVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Like heavy metal or Wall Street, horror can seem like a boys\u2019 club. Men make the movies. Women play the victims.For these fans, devotion runs deep. At the convention, two women debated the John Carpenter catalog. One group of teenagers giddily ranked the final girls in the \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d franchise. A mom brought her young child dressed as a knife-wielding Chucky.\u201cI come from a long line of pagans,\u201d said Cassandra Weartz, who plans to pursue a career as a special-effects makeup artist. \u201cA dark kind of spirit has always been in my family for generations back. My grandmother, before she passed away, left my mother a Ouija board. It\u2019s been in my family for about a century. I\u2019m adopted, and my birth grandmother used to use it like a telephone, is what I\u2019m told. She describes it like Facebook Messenger: If you message a stranger, you get a couple responses here and there, but after a time you build a friendship.\u201dA convention organizer said that the event has increasingly attracted female fans and become more family friendly. It\u2019s a change that\u2019s catching up to moviegoing; horror film audiences have been \u201ca 50-50 split, historically\u201d between men and women, said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at comScore, which compiles box-office data.Kimberly Tibbs began to cry as she talked about how \u201cbreaking barriers of gender\u201d as a female horror fan made her keenly empathetic when her transgender son came out.\u201cGrowing up, what was instilled in me by my mom was, don\u2019t let anybody tell you that because you\u2019re a girl, you can\u2019t do something,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. \u201cWhen my son first came out to me, it had just come after a conversation where I told him, I want you to be happy. That was what enabled him, in order to be happy, to say this body that I\u2019m living in is not who I am.\u201dSonya Lynch was less sanguine than other attendees about how female horror movie fans are treated in the world at large.\u201cWe are looked at as manic, as psychotic, that we watch these things and we can relate,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this atmosphere we are accepted. But as a whole, probably not so much.\u201dOne of the few black faces in a sea of white ones at the convention, Ms. Lynch said race had never come into play when she was with other horror fans.\u201cI\u2019m not looking at the skin color or the ethnicity,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at, we are a community of women and men who have the same interest. I\u2019ve never felt more like I belonged than right now at HorrorHound.\u201dA casual observer might have been alarmed to see Falon Marston roaming HorrorHound with a cardboard replica of a television hung around her neck, her 4-year-old daughters Winter (in purple) and Willow (in white) bouncing at her side in nightgowns, clutching blankets. But to the people who kept stopping Ms. Marton to take selfies, the \u201cPoltergeist\u201d-themed looks were evidence not of a deranged mother, but an awesome one.\u201cThere are some neighborhood kids that are having birthdays this weekend,\u201d said Ms. Marston, a stay-at-home mom, whose daughters love \u201cBeetlejuice.\u201d \u201cWe chose to come here instead.\u201d Sasha Mullins, a high school art teacher, said she had a hard time fitting in as a child. Watching Universal horror films with her father changed that.\u201cI\u2019d rather have this makeup done to my face than some pretty, preppy stuff that makes my eyelashes real big,\u201d said A. J. Kirkendall, a high school junior attending HorrorHound with her mother and friends. As she tells it, for a girl to come out as a horror fan is as horrifying as admitting she\u2019s got her boyfriend\u2019s entrails in her backpack.Anna Rigsby comes from a family of horror fans. She and her father watched \u201cChiller Theater,\u201d a TV series that specialized in the campier side of horror films. Her mother\u2019s favorite was \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\u201d \u201cShe would actually cheer when people would get killed,\u201d Ms. Rigsby said. \u201cA little morbid parents, but they were fun.\u201dA retail security manager, Ms. Rigsby said that she was once a \u201ctimid, quiet girl,\u201d but that horror films changed that. \u201cNow I\u2019m a little more aggressive, and my job is a little more aggressive, too,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that makes you feel more empowered.\u201dA special-effects and costume designer, Celeste Marcus said she \u201cbasically ignores\u201d the sexual comments she gets in the real world, when she\u2019s not dressed as a bloody bunny or other characters she cosplays. At HorrorHound, she\u2019s got a more no-nonsense response.\u201cIf it happens here, since I\u2019m already in character, I can just lash out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s to be expected.\u201d\u201cWomen have a different perception of things,\u201d said Penny Mercer, who was at the convention with her female partner of 10 years, Willie Bridges, and their daughters, Savannah and Emily. \u201cA man sees physical. They see blood, the guts, the gore. A woman is already mentally and emotionally processing the whole thing. They aren\u2019t just seeing the blood, the guts, the gore. They\u2019re feeling the pain. They are processing the mental anguish of everything. It\u2019s not just the fact that they got shot. They are imagining the pain of the bullets hitting them. They are feeling the psychological damage of it.\u201dMs. Yount said she found female horror fans to be \u201cmore easygoing and open and nonjudgmental\u201d than some of the women she meets on the job. \u201cThese people come from all walks of life, from different financial statuses,\u201d she said of fellow conventiongoers. \u201cBut when you come here, nobody sees that. It\u2019s like a family.\u201dMany of the women I spoke with said their fathers had introduced them to the genre.\u201cWe would watch movies together, and right when I got really tense, he would jump and try to scare me,\u201d said Ellie Church, an actress. \u201cI locked myself in the bathroom and told him that I hated him once because he scared me so bad. It\u2019s a really great memory.\u201dHow do male fans feel about that?\u201cThey\u2019re like, I really didn\u2019t need to see that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s like, well hey, I would like to see that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very dominant, so I don\u2019t tolerate it,\u201d\u00a0Cherish Harrell-Brooks\u00a0said\u00a0about the catcalls she gets as a female horror cosplayer. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in costume, unfortunately, anything that seems sweeter \u2014 a bunny or something like that \u2014 they feel they can just touch you.\u201dAs a\u00a0frightening\u00a0clown? Not so much.\u201cYou get into the really scary ones, and they\u2019re a little intimidated.\u201dIsabella, whose favorite horror movie is \u201cSilent Hill,\u201d said she has one friend who shares her love of scary movies. Other classmates are less enthused.\u201cThey\u2019re all into kitties and stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m into skulls and bats.\u201d\u201cI believe it was a man\u2019s world one time in horror,\u201d said Karie Scroggs. \u201cI do not believe that anymore, especially right now with \u2014 I hate to bring up the presidency and everything \u2014 but I think females are fighting back so much stronger now.

{"Headline": "Readers React: Dispute Over Gay Clergy", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byThe most prominent case involved Bishop Karen P. Oliveto of Denver, a married lesbian and the first openly gay bishop in the Methodist church. She remains a bishop but now faces further legal challenges. The court also ruled that the New York and Northern Illinois regions were wrong not to weed out gay candidates for ministry.Bishop Karen P. Oliveto, 59, DenverBishop of Mountain Sky Episcopal Area, including 400 congregations in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and a small part of IdahoI am very grateful that I get to return home to the Mountain Sky area to continue the work we\u2019ve begun there. The decision was confusing and I think it reflects the confusion we have in the church regarding human sexuality in general and the role that L.G.B.T.Q. people have in the life of the church. We\u2019re not of one mind. And instead of offering each other grace, and allowing a difference of opinion to exist, we\u2019ve become more rule-bound, which is creating fractures in the United Methodist Church. I think inherent to United Methodism is a grace that allows for tension of differences to exist.I know there are people that are very upset that I\u2019m a bishop in the church, but I\u2019m committed to being a bishop that cares for them and prays for them and loves them. Because one part of the body of Christ cannot tell another, we have no need of you.There\u2019s a lot of people working very hard to make sure the church is big enough for everyone. And we\u2019re not going anywhere. I would say that if you need to leave for your spiritual care, I understand. But I think there\u2019s a love revolution going on in this church._____Scott Faldon, 49, Fort Smith, Ark.Member of Goddard United Methodist ChurchMy great-grandfather was a Methodist preacher, my mother helped found a couple of Methodist churches, and I\u2019ve been a Methodist all my life. A schism has been brewing for a bit now, and this might be the proverbial straw breaking the camel\u2019s back. I just hope we Methodists can find common ground and prevent it from happening.I feel this is very generational. Younger people, and my generation, I don\u2019t think we have that much of a problem with it. But the older generation, the baby boomers, who are still in power in church leadership, they tend to. There are so many churches that skew so much older.For the entire time that I\u2019ve grown up in the church, there have been homosexual members serving in various roles, whether as music leader or Sunday school teacher, or something. So it\u2019s just a matter of admitting that they\u2019ve been a part of the church for decades. There\u2019s no shame in it. They love the Lord and want to serve the Lord and serve their communities._____Stacey Sarnicola, 52, BrooklynMember of Park Slope United Methodist ChurchThe United States and other liberal-minded countries need to split from the African and Asian churches. That is the only resolution I can see. The people in my church have a committee that\u2019s just about going to church conferences and trying to change the policy. Every year they come back disappointed.They\u2019ve been fighting this for the 20 years I\u2019ve been there. Our country is progressing. Most Americans agree with marriage equality and gay rights. So it\u2019s holding us back to be still fighting this. If the United Methodist Church is dwindling in the U.S., that\u2019s why._____Lisa Kindervatter, 60, Newtown, Pa.Member of Washington Crossing United Methodist ChurchI agree with the Judicial Council\u2019s decisions. Unity of message and doctrine and vision between churches is important because it says, \u201cas Methodists, this is what we believe.\u201dI have never heard the pastor of our church speak about homosexuality from the pulpit. I know his general views from one-on-one conversation, which are in line with the conservative viewpoint that the Bible speaks of homosexuality as a sin. The message is always in the context of love, mercy and grace.Understanding that we all bring sins with us when we come to Jesus \u2026 whether it be bad choices, attitudes, addictions either chemical or sexual. As we confront those things when reading the scriptures, we are taught that yes, we must turn from those things, but He will help us and forgive and heal us. We have about 500 members and four services. New believers, not just transfers, are coming on a weekly basis._____Dan Cox, 54, Los AngelesMember of the Hollywood United Methodist ChurchI have served the Methodist church my entire life with my talents, my time and my financial gifts. As of today, I forever leave behind the Methodist church over this thoughtless, divisive decision by a small group of small-minded leaders.It\u2019s been a really traumatic day. I\u2019m getting emergency emails from my church, from my mother. My own church is even saying our response is to wait and pray. And I\u2019m like, NO. I\u2019ve waited 50 years. I\u2019m tired of waiting until they behave like their religion tells them to.One of the emails from a leader of the conference said if the church has hurt you in the past, then we apologize. It seems to be hurting the L.G.B.T. community even worse now.The first dictate of the church is, spread the good news. We\u2019re actually doing the opposite.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Letterman\u2019s Unlikely Archivist", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byCollectorDavid Letterman is one of the greatest entertainers in the history of television, but his legacy is more fragile than you may think.That\u2019s because the late night talk show is an ephemeral form, its hosts forgotten faster than teen idols. Onetime superstars like Steve Allen and Jack Paar have faded into obscurity, primarily because it\u2019s difficult to see their shows, and much of Johnny Carson\u2019s oeuvre was erased. Mr. Letterman\u2019s work is not so hard to find, thanks in large part to Don Giller, a superfan who stumbled into becoming a critical custodian of Mr. Letterman\u2019s comedy.Mr. Giller, who works as a music typesetter for academic journals, has embraced his role as unofficial archivist, but only recently. For decades, he just really liked the show and found that it rewarded his natural obsessiveness.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get it unless you watch a couple weeks and notice the story line \u2014 to me, there\u2019s a story line,\u201d he said in his Upper West Side apartment. \u201cYou start getting his little asides: \u2018Oh, he did that a couple weeks ago. That\u2019s what that\u2019s in reference to.\u2019\u201dThe origins of Mr. Giller\u2019s Letterman library can be traced, like so many other obsessions, to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.Mr. Giller, who grew up in Baltimore the son of an accountant, was in seventh grade in 1963. His uncle gave him a reel-to-reel recorder, and the first thing he recalls taping was news of the death of the president.What began as a diversion turned into a habit. In college, he taped the school marching band, just because, and later he made a point of capturing Academy Awards broadcasts, presidential inaugurations and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d episodes. He recently recorded the inauguration of Donald J. Trump, although the internet makes it exceedingly accessible.But his main focus became \u201cLate Night With David Letterman,\u201d the 12:30 a.m. show that ran on NBC from 1982 to 1993. Mr. Giller recorded it on audio right from its first episode after having enjoyed Mr. Letterman\u2019s short-lived morning show. He later bought a VCR and filled in the holes in his collection through trades with other fans. From the beginning, Mr. Giller took scrupulous notes that formed a Letterman database, with accounts of segments, Top 10 lists, even jokes.Why record everything? \u201cThat\u2019s what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI always liked making lists and trying to get a handle on something that interests me.\u201dHis compulsion became useful to a larger audience in the 1990s, when Mr. Giller joined early internet message boards dedicated to Mr. Letterman. His exhaustive knowledge marked him as an authority, even among superfans.\u201cIt started when someone asked who played Flunky the Clown,\u201d Mr. Giller said, referring to a cigarette-smoking clown who made cameos on \u201cLate Night.\u201d \u201cI said: Jeff Martin. People were like: \u2018Who\u2019s this guy?\u2019\u201dHe became known as the Donz and found friendship in an AOL community made up of what he jokingly described as \u201clike-minded psychotics who are as interested in this guy as I am.\u201d When trolls infiltrated, fans migrated to a private Facebook page, which remains active.People working at \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d which debuted on CBS in 1993, noticed Mr. Giller on message boards and contacted him in 1995. They wanted his help tracking down old Academy Awards broadcasts, to aid Mr. Letterman as he prepared to host the show.Mr. Giller has met Mr. Letterman briefly a few times, the first when he approached him outside the Ed Sullivan Theater in 1994 with a piece of dental floss, a reference to a joke made the night before.\u201cI made one of the biggest mistakes a citizen can make with a comedian: I cracked a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cI blew it.\u201dHe said he hopes to have a longer conversation, but if not, that\u2019s fine. \u201cI\u2019d like him to know what I did,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is: Will he give a crap? I need to be prepared that he won\u2019t and accept that.\u201dMr. Giller said he is not at a loss now that Mr. Letterman is off the air. He is still fielding requests from fans, and hopes to be done digitizing all of \u201cLate Night\u201d by 2018.

While Germany does fall short of allocating 2 percent of its G.D.P. to military spending, that money is not intended to be paid to NATO\u00a0or\u00a0the United States.March 19No false or misleading statements.Mr. Trump went golfing.March 20Mr. Trump overstated the trade deficit. The United States had a total goods trade deficit of $750 billion in 2016, but a services trade surplus of $250 billion\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a net deficit of $500 billion.March 21Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential directive requiring the use of American steel in pipelines\u00a0applies\u00a0only\u00a0to new projects. Construction for the two pipelines had already begun, and the executive orders greenlighting them do not require\u00a0use of\u00a0American steel.March 22March 23March 24Mr. Trump often promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act \u201cimmediately\u201d and listed\u00a0it as a legislative priority in his 100-day plan.March 25March 26A variation on\u00a0one of his most repeated claims, Mr. Trump again took\u00a0outsize\u00a0credit for savings in a contract for F-35 fighter jets. The Defense Department announced $600 million in cuts before Mr. Trump\u00a0had\u00a0jumped into\u00a0the negotiation project.March 27March 28March 29March 30Mr. Trump linked to a New York Post column that argued that a Jan. 20 article in The Times validated his accusation that Mr. Obama\u00a0had\u00a0wiretapped him. This is false.March 31Mr. Trump again touted many companies\u2019 job creation plans as a direct result of his election, but many of the investments were planned or announced before the election.April 1The Fox News report, which was based on one anonymous source, is not evidence for Mr. Trump\u2019s initial accusation that Mr. Obama spied on him. When Americans are caught in surveillance of foreign targets, their names are typically hidden unless a top official asks for the names to be revealed or \u201cunmasked.\u201d This does not mean that the names were leaked publicly.April 2In an interview with\u00a0The Financial Times, Mr. Trump continued to insist falsely that he had been validated because he meant \u201cwiretapped\u201d in a broad sense. Mr. Trump did use the word \u201cwiretap\u201d in quote\u00a0marks in two Twitter posts, but he specifically accused Mr. Obama of ordering his phones to be tapped in two other posts.April 3At a meeting with\u00a0the\u00a0Egyptian\u00a0president,\u00a0Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Mr. Trump again exaggerated his defense budget request.April 4Mr. Trump uttered versions of this claim twice in the same day, and it is misleading. The United States reported an overall trade deficit of about $92 billion in the first two months of 2017, which is on par with the last two months of 2016. Mr. Trump may have been referring to reports that the trade deficit declined by 9.6 percent from January to February\u00a0of this year, but month-to-month fluctuations are common.April 5April 6Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Mr. Trump again claimed\u00a0undue\u00a0credit for over $728 million in savings on F-35 fighter jets.April 7Border apprehensions, the best gauge for border crossings, declined 64 percent from March 2016 to March 2017. But Mr. Trump\u2019s statement gives the impression that he was talking about a month-to-month decrease, which was about 35 percent from February to March 2017.April 8 to April 10No false or misleading statements.Mr. Trump went golfing.April 11April 12A\u00a0personnel shortage is largely his own doing, even by his own account. As of the day of his interview, Mr. Trump had yet to nominate anyone for 478 positions out of more than 533 key appointments. He told Fox News in February he didn\u2019t want to appoint \u201cbecause they\u2019re unnecessary to have.\u201dApril 13During a meeting with emergency medical workers, Mr. Trump boasted that he had done more against the Islamic State than Mr. Obama\u00a0had\u00a0in a fraction of the time. Under the Obama administration, a military coalition recaptured several major cities from the Islamic State and launched more than 17,000 airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration,\u00a0the Islamic State\u00a0had lost no major cities, and the coalition had conducted about 2,000 airstrikes.April 14No false or misleading statements.Mr. Trump went golfing.April 15No false or misleading statements.April 16Tens of thousands across the country took to the streets as part of Tax March to demand Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, which he has not released. Ezra Levin, a member of Tax March\u2019s executive committee, called Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet \u201cbogus and flat-out false.\u201dApril 17This is false. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly promised to declare China a currency manipulator,\u00a0and\u00a0he\u00a0labeled China that in an\u00a0interview with The Financial Times\u00a0in early April. But he told The Wall Street Journal later that month that he would no longer do so.April 18The gang in question, Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, precedes Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency by decades. By 2005, four years before Mr. Obama took office, the F.B.I. reported that MS-13 had 10,000 \u201chardcore members\u201d active, the same number cited by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the day of Mr. Trump\u2019s claim.April 19April 20April 21In an interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Trump misleadingly suggested NATO\u00a0had\u00a0changed after he\u00a0accused\u00a0it\u00a0of\u00a0not focusing on terrorism,\u00a0and cited a Wall Street Journal article from June 2016 about the alliance\u2019s creation of a new counterterrorism position.\u00a0NATO\u00a0has been engaged in counterterrorism efforts since 1980, and the position isn\u2019t considered a significant step.April 22No false or misleading statements.April 23Mr. Trump falsely suggested on Twitter that he had beaten Mrs. Clinton in the popular vote. In the April ABC/Washington Post poll\u00a0referred to\u00a0by Mr. Trump, 46 percent of voters said they voted for\u00a0Mrs.\u00a0Clinton and 43 percent for Mr. Trump. This is similar to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s popular-vote margin\u00a0from November.April 24Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall would not address several modes of drug trafficking from Mexican criminal networks. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s 2016 report, the most common method\u00a0of\u00a0transporting drugs is in concealed compartments in vehicles crossing ports of entry. Other methods\u00a0rely on\u00a0tunnels, drones and commercial cargo trains and buses. None of these\u00a0methods\u00a0would be prevented by a wall.April 25There are at least a dozen countries that have trade deficits with the United States, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil and Egypt.April 26Judge William H. Orrick of the United States\u00a0District Court blocked Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order to withhold money from sanctuary cities. While he is in\u00a0California,\u00a0the same state as the Ninth Circuit, he does not sit on the Ninth.April 27April 28On the eve of his first 100 days in office, Mr. Trump claimed unprecedented progress. Of course, any productivity comparison is subjective, but his claim is off by a few metrics.During Mr. Trump\u2019s first 90 days in office, he signed 28 bills into law and the Senate confirmed his nominee for Supreme Court justice. Mr. Trump had not signed into law any of the 10 pieces of major legislation in his 100-day plan. The White House has also pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s rollback of Obama-era regulations. At the same point, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had signed 76 bills into law, Mr. Obama had enacted a stimulus package and President George W. Bush had enacted major tax cuts.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s cute in a kind of \u201ckid with a god complex playing with his ant farm\u201d sort of way.It\u2019s a reasonable effort, I guess? It seems difficult to shield people from fake facts if some desperately want to believe them, whether or not they\u2019re actually true.I\u2019m a bit biased here because I worked for Walt at AllThingsD and Recode, two tech-focused web publications that he co-founded after leaving a long career at The Wall Street Journal. He was a great boss and mentor, and very generous with his time, especially with young reporters.Eventually, the industry had to change to meet the future that he saw coming. Computers were indeed personal objects, as the cost came down and people brought more of them into their homes \u2014 desktops, laptops, set-top boxes and the like. Soon, computers would rest in the palm of our hands in the form of a phone, and now they\u2019re basically extensions of our bodies.Hey, since you\u2019re a columnist too, what has it been like for you to watch the evolution of personal technology over the years?To me the most amazing thing about Walt is how early he identified computers as a mainstream phenomenon. In the 1980s and 1990s lots of people were writing about tech, but Walt was among the first to understand that this strange new class of nerds would completely change the world, and that they would do so in a way that would affect ordinary people who did not consider themselves techies. In that way he was no less prescient than Steve Jobs and Bill Gates \u2014 who, of course, both came to recognize Walt\u2019s importance as a proponent of the industry\u2019s possibilities.So, my hat\u2019s off to Walt. I hope to someday be half as interesting as he was. I hope you are, too.Advertisement"}

Returning to \u201cAction/Adventure,\u201d the selection under that rubric reflects a wide and arguably generous interpretation of the category. There\u2019s the searing 1980 military saga \u201cBreaker Morant\u201d and the 2001 extreme-gore cult item \u201cIchi the Killer.\u201d There\u2019s John Ford\u2019s seminal \u201cStagecoach\u201d; Ted V.

But thinking about how one of that film\u2019s characters, a street hustler played by Juliet Berto, struggles with identity questions throughout her story line, it occurred to me that perhaps I had been looking at the film narrowly.\u201cWe\u2019re always having interesting arguments internally about genre and tagging systems.\u201d she said. \u201cDoes one category contain too many films or not enough films is one aspect of the discussion. But often times where we place a given film offers an opportunity for conversation with the film community of both subscribers and nonsubscribers who look at the editorial and social part of the site, or on the Facebook page.

{"Headline": "Marvel Will Discipline Artist Who Sneaked Political Messages Into X-Men", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byThe X-Men have battled evil mutants, killer robots and alien invaders, but now one of the most venerable franchises in the Marvel universe has found itself embroiled in a new \u2014 and unexpected \u2014 conflict: the religious and political tensions in Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation.Some images in the comic appeared to refer to hard-line Islamist opposition to Mr. Basuki, who is also known by the nickname Ahok. Others seemed to have less to do with Indonesian politics and more to do with anti-Semitism, the critics said. The artist who sneaked the messages into the images was Ardian Syaf, an Indonesian citizen.Marvel seemed surprised that references to religious intolerance had appeared in the pages of X-Men Gold, the reboot of one of its biggest properties. In a statement, the company said the artwork \u201cwas inserted without knowledge behind its reported meanings.\u201d\u201cThese implied references do not reflect the views of the writer, editors or anyone else at Marvel and are in direct opposition of the inclusiveness of Marvel Comics and what the X-Men have stood for since their creation,\u201d the statement added. \u201cThis artwork will be removed from subsequent printings, digital versions, and trade paperbacks and disciplinary action is being taken.\u201dMarvel did not specify what disciplinary action it would take against Mr. Syaf, a freelance artist who has been penciling comics for Marvel and other companies since 2007, according to his personal website.Those references were specific to the tension in Indonesia; it seems unlikely that someone who did not follow the country\u2019s complicated politics would have understood them.In another panel, the number \u201c212\u201d appears on a store front. Readers in Indonesia said that was a reference to a large anti-Basuki protest held by conservative Islamist groups in Jakarta last December.That same image also depicted the X-Men\u2019s leader, a high-profile Jewish superheroine called Kitty Pryde, in a way that some readers found upsetting. It showed her standing in front of a jewelry store sign so that the letters \u201cJ-E-W\u201d were displayed next to her head.\u201cThis is all to say that Ardian Syaf can keep his garbage philosophy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe has committed career suicide; he will rapidly become irrelevant.

Mr. Tigre said he feared that his brother, Jorge Tigre, 18, was among the victims.\u201cThey all suffered from significant trauma throughout their body,\u201d Mr. Sini said. \u201cIt appears that they were killed with a sharp or edged instrument.\u201dMr. Sini did not identify the victims but said they ranged in age from 16 to 20.Justin Llivicura, 16, was later identified by his uncle Marcelo Llivicura as one of the victims. Mr. Llivicura, a native of Ecuador, said that Justin, who was born in the United States, had been missing a few days. The family had reported him missing on Wednesday, according to the police.\u201cHe was a good boy,\u201d Mr. Llivicura said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe did nothing, no drugs; he was a good student and was working on Saturdays and Sundays.\u201dMr. Llivicura said that the last time the two had spoken, on Tuesday, Justin had said he planned to go to a party. Justin and Jorge Tigre were friends from Bellport High School, which was closed for spring vacation this week.\u201cHe did not have bad friends or anything, and now he died,\u201d Mr. Llivicura said.Jorge Tigre\u2019s family had also reported him missing on Wednesday, according to the police.The bodies were found at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, and Mr. Sini said the killings had \u201coccurred within the past few days.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no question that MS-13 still exists in Suffolk County,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re still engaging in acts of violence, and if this is MS-13, this clearly is an example of that.\u201dIn September, Kayla Cuevas, 16, and Nisa Mickens, 15, were found dead in Brentwood, a neighboring town. The teenagers had been beaten with machetes and baseball bats, the authorities said.The murders prompted an aggressive investigation that led to the skeletal remains of three teenage boys and, eventually, the arrests of more than 125 gang members. In March, the federal authorities charged 13 adult members of MS-13 with a variety of crimes, including racketeering and murder; 10 were undocumented immigrants, prosecutors said.On Monday, four adult MS-13 members charged in the killing of Ms. Cuevas and Ms. Nickens were in court in Central Islip for a hearing on whether they should face the death penalty.

{"Headline": "The Wisdom of Don Rickles", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byOpinionA few months ago, to surprise a friend on his 50th birthday, I took him to see his \u201clast living hero\u201d \u2014 Don Rickles, much beloved in the 1960s and \u201970s as \u201cthe insult comic.\u201dMr. Rickles, who died on Thursday at 90, gave his performance from a wheelchair, crippled by necrotizing fasciitis \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a disease that eats Jews,\u201d he explained. He was like a coelacanth brought up from a bygone geologic era of comedy. When someone in the audience stood up and cheered, fists raised, he snapped: \u201cIt\u2019s not a rally, ya Polack. Siddown.\u201d The last time I heard \u201cPolack\u201d used as a generic insult was circa sixth grade; it was like hearing someone called a \u201cjive turkey\u201d again.When I was a kid, this kind of humor was very much in vogue: \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d whose main character was a grouchy, loudmouthed bigot, was the highest-rated show on American TV; Mel Brooks\u2019s \u201cBlazing Saddles,\u201d a crazed fable about a black sheriff in a frontier town, was one of a handful of films in history to gross over $100 million. I, a little suburban white kid, watched sitcoms about poor black people in the ghetto. Perhaps the most improbable part of all this is that there were ever TV shows about poor people.It seems to me now as if there was a window of just a few years, after the upheavals and victories of the civil rights movement and before the rebranded and gentrified racism of the Reagan era, when racial tensions relaxed slightly, and it felt briefly, exhilaratingly O.K. to make fun of race relations in this country. The fact that Mr. Rickles was able to speak those slurs onstage may be a sign not of his era\u2019s ignorance but of its fleeting liberation. Though let\u2019s bear in mind that I was 8 and possibly not keenly attuned to the sociopolitical zeitgeist.Ours is a more humorless, censorious age. We now live in fear of being \u201ccalled out\u201d \u2014 the American equivalent of being denounced as a counterrevolutionary, except instead of being forced to wear a dunce cap in the town square, you get called names on the internet. I teach at a liberal arts college, pretty much ground zero for the culture of political correctness. None of my students actually seem to like this inhibiting atmosphere, and it isn\u2019t clear who\u2019s enforcing it, but they all have to live in it.Not long ago, one of my students was told by some of her classmates in a writing workshop that some of her jokes might come across as, no offense, a little bit \u201cmean.\u201d She asked me after class, earnestly, whether I thought the lines in question were mean. I told her she was not mean but also broke it to her, as gently as possible, that she was funny, and that regrettably it isn\u2019t possible to be funny without, on some level, being mean. Humor is aggression transmuted into laughter; it is not nice, or polite or genteel. It\u2019s always at someone\u2019s expense, even if it\u2019s your own.Before he was a National Book Award--winning novelist, Charles Johnson drew the funniest cartoons about race I\u2019ve ever seen \u2014 I won\u2019t even try to describe my favorites here, because I know it would just get cut. He recently told me that he and his colleagues would never be able to publish that work today without being reviled by the politically correct left. Eavesdropping on some older second-wave feminists at a party, I was scandalized and thrilled by their raunchy, bitter humor about subjects like rape \u2014 jokes I can\u2019t repeat in print because they would only provoke outraged comments so predictable I could write them myself.Activists and artists of their generation had to develop much harsher, darker senses of humor as calluses against the much rougher struggles they endured. As the left has turned its attention to ever smaller, easier, cheaper fights \u2014 freedom riding through Facebook filter, resisting mircoaggression wherever it rears its thousand tiny heads, prosecuting semantic crimes against humanity \u2014 it seems the only acceptable tone for any discussion of race or gender in America is a solemn rancor.It seems as if the liberal program of attempting to shame and berate people into being more open-minded and tolerant may have backfired. Listening to interviews with Donald Trump\u2019s supporters during his once-implausible rise, I was struck by how many of them mentioned that they admire that \u201che\u2019s not politically correct.\u201d This was often a not-unbreakable code for saying he was a refreshingly unapologetic bigot. But it\u2019s still worth noticing that apparently telling people they\u2019re not allowed to say certain things or feel certain ways, that their opinions aren\u2019t just incorrect but morally wrong, does not, after all, make them better people; it makes them hate your guts.So was Mr. Rickles a bigot or a mensch? The truth, probably, is that he was both. We all are, albeit most of us not in such cartoonishly binary form. Maybe trying to stifle and disown the former makes the latter more brittle and false, more of an act. And maybe it\u2019s venting the former persona onstage, as it were, set off from real life by the quotation marks of humor, that allows us to be more genuinely decent.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the writer Charles Johnson. He has won many awards, including the National Book Award, but not the Pulitzer Prize.Tim Kreider is the author of \u201cWe Learn Nothing,\u201d a collection of essays and cartoons.Advertisement"}

The closest they generally come to drama is the inevitable wait until a final deadline before a deal is announced.Over past week or so, however, President Trump brought some drama to the somnambulant trade world. First his administration used the latest round in an endless lumber dispute with Canada (the first trade story I covered and one my children can likely inherit if they wish) and an obscure dairy dispute to bash Canadian trade policy. That was soon followed up by suggestions that the president was about to sign Nafta\u2019s death warrant.Then that zig was followed by the zag of an announcement that Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t going to rip up Nafta, at least for now, but renegotiate it. The change was partly the result of a coordinated effort by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico.While it\u2019s possible that state of affairs may have spiraled off in yet another direction by the time you read this, it\u2019s more likely that Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government will be focused on figuring out what Canada wants from any talks. We\u2019ve prepared a look at four industries that may become hot points. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s office is also likely hoping that any negotiations will follow the plodding traditions of the past.Here are some other articles from The Times over the last week, not necessarily related to Canada and perhaps overlooked, that I found interesting:Advertisement"}

During his final illness, my wife and I visited him, though it was hard to travel to his remote home. We flew cross-country again to pay our respects at his funeral. But my sister-in-law excluded me from everything. I was refused admission to the pre-service meeting with the clergyman. I was omitted from printed obituaries (though there was room for his dog), and none of the eulogies mentioned a surviving brother. Given this disrespect, how should I behave toward his family?ANONYMOUSI am sorry for your loss. But let\u2019s remember that the disrespect you feel came from a woman who was grieving the fresh loss of her husband and daily companion. I don\u2019t minimize your loss; you grew up with your brother. But after 20 years of more perfunctory contact, your pain is probably more existential than focused on him. Your sister-in-law lost her mate.Your assessment may also be on the money. She may resent your failure to keep in closer touch. (She may also have been exhausted from caretaking during his illness and zonked out with grief.) But after such a long absence from his life, did you really expect a meaningful voice in creating his funeral service? Your omission from his obituary and eulogy seem like more pointed slights. Still, I direct you to the high road.In answer to your question \u2014 \u201chow should I behave?\u201d \u2014 I hope you choose compassion and sympathy, even if your sister-in-law was mean. My first choice is for you to call her and ask how she\u2019s getting along. But I\u2019ll settle for your ripping up that poison-pen letter that you, and many of us, would be composing in our heads.The woman seated next to me on an airplane asked if I would switch seats with her friend, who was in the middle seat of the row behind us, so they could sit together. I had an aisle seat, which I greatly prefer, so I said no. The woman began to yell at me and make a scene. I try to be kind; I would have switched for a parent with a small child. But how much of my convenience should I sacrifice for a stranger? Would you have switched seats?ROBINProbably not. In the micro-economy of airplanes, everyone knows that an aisle seat trumps a middle one. The unpleasant woman next to you asked you to downgrade for her sole convenience. You were not obliged to accommodate her. I too might have acceded to her request if it involved a small child or an elderly person or the prospect of sitting next to Joan Didion. But these exceptions would be ad hoc and require a level of charm in the asking.The moment the woman next to you began raging (or frankly, became even mildly unpleasant), I would have disengaged and pressed the call button for the flight attendant. Flight crew can sometimes be helpful in facilitating multipronged moves that allow friends to sit together, while respecting the economy of aisle-, middle- and window-seat values.I recently took a job, working for a person I\u2019ve known for several years. She recruited me heavily. Now that I\u2019ve been here for six months, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good fit. It\u2019s a new organization, and my responsibilities keep shifting. And I\u2019ve just received an offer that would allow me to live in the same city as my partner (we\u2019ve been living apart since I began graduate school). But I don\u2019t want to leave my boss in a bad spot. Your thoughts?ANONYMOUSTake the job in the city where your partner lives, assuming it\u2019s a better fit with your skills and personality. And use all your might to negotiate the longest notice period possible (or that your boss would like from you). I admire your concern for her, but you are also responsible for developing your career and relationship with your partner. Even if you play this perfectly, your boss may still be annoyed with you. But as long as you behave with integrity, you can\u2019t ask more of yourself.As usual, I went to Passover Seder at my older sister\u2019s house. I love her, but she was as controlling as ever.

May I stop going?JENNYWhile I applaud your personalized dramatization of Passover, I am afraid that I cannot play Moses in leading you out of your sister\u2019s Egypt.

The eggs had been beaten loosely, so flecks of white still showed, and hustled from the pan when patchy bronze. Inside, they were studded with tender nubs of turnip, yielding with a quiet crunch.Nothing else had been added, not even salt. \u201cEverything is in the turnip,\u201d said Mei Lee, the restaurant\u2019s eponymous owner. The root\u2019s briny flavor was diffuse, like a tint of rose in sunglasses. It made me think of surfacing after a plunge in the sea, that half-taste, half-scent of salt.In Taiwan, you would categorize this dish as xiao chi: small eats. It\u2019s not fancy and not meant to be. And still I wanted to write ode upon ode to it.\u201cThis is simple, home-style food,\u201d Ms. Lee insisted. She is a no-nonsense figure in apron and bandanna, comfortingly bossy. Twice, she scolded me gently for ordering too much, concerned for my health.Every meal begins with a generous, free bowl of soup, which, on my visits, was a clear broth made from pork bones that at first tasted of hardly anything and grew deeper with each spoonful.Eventually nearly every table holds a plate of the enormous meatballs known as lion\u2019s heads, rough spheres of ground pork bound by egg and mottled with ginger and garlic. They are seared briefly, then braised for two hours until they emerge as soft as physically possible without falling apart. At the touch of chopsticks, they calve like glaciers.According to legend, three-cup chicken earned its name from a 13th-century recipe improvised for a hero\u2019s last meal, with one cup each of sesame oil, soy sauce and Shaoxing wine. Here, a more complex calibration anoints boneless hunks of dark thigh meat, which acquire a seal the color of caramel in the wok and arrive shining, adorned with garlic and swooning leaves of Thai basil.Salt-and-pepper chicken is sweeter, the skin more fluffy than crackly. As for the chicken roll, listed under Special Dishes, it has no chicken: The filling is fish paste, ground pork and carrots, infiltrated by five-spice, folded inside bean-curd skin, and fried. This also skews sweet, and comes with ketchup. Its appeal remains a mystery to me, but people at other tables seemed to like it just fine.Children bow heads over bowls of lu rou fan: ground pork, tofu and a hard-boiled egg inky from a long braise in soy and Shaoxing wine. Grown-ups want it, too, alongside hotter dishes like strips of flank steak in a swarm of longhorn green peppers, some innocent and bright, others hellbent.Ms. Lee, whose family has roots in northern China, grew up in South Korea; her husband is a native of Taiwan, where she went to college. For years, she said, \u201cI was a housewife.\u201d Then, in 2013, with her son halfway through high school, she spotted this tiny storefront next to a Taiwanese-American church.She runs the kitchen with her uncle Jin Tsai Liu, who was a chef at a Shanghainese restaurant in Rego Park. And every night, her husband, who works for a Chinese-language newspaper, stops by to help her clean up. \u201cWe close the door and walk home together,\u201d she said.The dining room is spare but cheerful, with an orange back wall, taped-up Christmas cards and children\u2019s drawings, and photographs of the Alpine village in Austria where the Lees stayed on a farm and milked cows last summer. \u201cWe enjoy natural things, not big buildings,\u201d she said.Restaurant hours are erratic, so call ahead. The staff members take a \u201crest,\u201d as the sign in the window puts it, from 4 to 5 p.m. On weekends, the food often sells out by 7:30 p.m. If Ms. Lee is not feeling well \u2014 \u201cI used to have good health, but this restaurant gives me lots of pressure\u201d \u2014 she will take the day off. Last year, she closed the restaurant for four months so she could spend time with her parents in South Korea.Ms. Lee is not sure if she wants more people to know that her restaurant exists. \u201cI always tell my customers, \u2018Eat for yourself,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

I needed to participate.\u201dAs a student at Rutgers University, Mr. Hansen majored in American studies and volunteered for various community organizations. But after graduating, he was drawn to the tech scene and learned how to code.By last year, he worked for Shotput, a supply chain logistics start-up based in Oakland, Calif.

He quit Shotput and decided to devote himself to repairing the country\u2019s frayed social fabric.\u201cThis election was a reaction to people not being heard,\u201d Mr. Hansen said. \u201cA lot of that is the failure of state, local and federal governments to communicate with people.\u201dMr. Hansen, who walked away from a nearly six-figure job to develop Hey Mayor, has not yet figured out how to pay himself. \u201cMy programming friends are still making fun of me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think I\u2019m insane.\u201dHis parents, too, have their doubts. \u201cThey\u2019re constantly telling me to get a job at Johnson & Johnson,\u201d he said.Mr. Polisner worked at the software company Oracle for decades, moving up to manage cloud computing accounts, and eventually earning about $200,000 a year.He had always dabbled in liberal politics, organizing\u00a0fund-raisers\u00a0for local Democrats, but that was about it.\u201cI am not with President-elect Trump and I am not here to help him in any way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTherefore I must resign from this once-great company.\u201dInitially, Mr. Polisner didn\u2019t know what he was going to do next.

{"Headline": "Decluttering? Yes, There\u2019s an App", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byWhen Charles Carlini, a jazz impresario, moved recently, he confronted two decades of furniture and accumulated memorabilia \u2014 duplicate copies of signed books, vinyl LPs, reams of publicity photos, a CD rack from Tower Records. But rather than taking it with him to his new apartment, he took the opportunity to declutter the Midtown prewar he was leaving. \u201cThat was part of the reason for the move,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to unload 20-some years of accruing.\u201dIn doing so, Mr. Carlini faced a situation that will be familiar to many New Yorkers. Decluttering may be liberating, but when you live in the city and you have a lot of junk, how do you dispose of it? You can\u2019t hold a yard sale if you don\u2019t have a yard.As it turns out, you don\u2019t need a yard. All you need is the right app or website.Mr. Carlini and others have discovered that there are apps and sites to simplify selling, streamline the posting process, protect buyers and sellers from scams, arrange furniture delivery and handle the exchange of goods and cash, so that sellers and buyers never have to meet face-to-face. As Mr. Carlini put it, referring to the new online options, \u201cIt\u2019s Craigslist on steroids.\u201dAnd, of course, Craigslist, the granddaddy of free online classified listings, has several apps as well. \u201cCraigslist is the workhorse,\u201d Mr. Carlini said. \u201cBut I have been having more success with 5Miles, which I supplemented with OfferUp and LetGo.\u201dIn a single week, he said, he sold a vacuum cleaner, two light fixtures, a mirror, a microwave, a Fender bass soft case, a mini-fridge, a sofa bed and a bookshelf.\u201cI am living like a Zen monk,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m loving it.\u201dBelow are eight apps and websites that will help you dispose of your stuff.5MILESThe app has other fees, though: If you want to use \u201csales tools\u201d like marking an item \u201cmust go\u201d or adding a \u201cclick to call\u201d button that lets prospective buyers call you with one touch, you\u2019ll pay $2 to $5.The app tries to discourage scammers from using multiple identities. By connecting email addresses, phone numbers and Facebook pages \u2014 and requiring two of them for \u201ccertification\u201d \u2014 it makes it easier to confirm that users are who they say they are.This is also one of the few apps that lets users post services as well as goods, so you can sell your fish tank and hire someone to deliver it, all in the same place.The app \u201cseems to be the one that is getting me all of the action,\u201d said Mr. Carlini, who also enjoyed touches like the coin-drop sound the app makes for some notifications. \u201cI was having so much fun with this.\u201dLETGOSeveral of these apps let users connect their posts to social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, as well as to other sales sites like Craigslist and Etsy, but LetGo does it in a novel way: A feature called the \u201ccommercializer\u201d digitally places your item in a parody video \u2014 an action-movie trailer, say, starring Dolph Lundgren \u2014 that you can post on social media or send as a text. And it\u2019s all free.APTDECOWhen you post a product, the site recommends a price based on the original cost, condition, popularity and past sale prices of similar items. Your photos are edited so your items look as if they were shot against a white backdrop.But this level of service comes at a price: The site takes a cut of your sale \u2014 which can be as much as 29 percent \u2014 on top of the delivery fee, which varies depending on size. Extra-large items requiring a team of three or more to move are generally $145; large items like beds and sofas are $95; and small items like lamps are $35.OFFERUPThe app\u2019s \u201cTruYou\u201d program aims to weed out scammers by requiring a photo of your driver\u2019s license and access to your Facebook page. Of course, the downside of sharing your sign-in information is that you\u2019re giving the app access to your public profile, friend list and email addresses. Some users have also reported problems getting certified, and complained about a lack of customer support.POSHMARKPoshmark also holds virtual events with themes like \u201cKate Spade, Tory Burch, J. Crew, Lilly Pulitzer, Anthropologie & Kendra Scott Party.\u201d Members not only host these parties but choose others\u2019 listings to include, and there can be a lot of politicking involved. \u201cIt\u2019s a big honor to be chosen as a host,\u201d said Beth Cooper, a member who lives in Baltimore. She said that other members message the host in an effort to ingratiate themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s high school \u2018Mean Girls\u2019 for clothes, but it works.\u201dKRRBThe app specializes in furniture and home goods listings, which are free. But there is a 10 percent fee for handling credit card transactions; when a sale is complete, funds are transferred to the seller\u2019s bank account. To boost a listing to the top of the queue, the app charges a \u201ccredit,\u201d which can be purchased for 40 cents to $1, depending on how many are bought at once.The app certifies that users are who they say they are with a check mark after they have used a credit card to complete a purchase or buy credits. It also provides a money-back guarantee: If an item doesn\u2019t live up to the description, it is returned to the seller, and the Marketplace pays the shipping both ways.THREDUPBut ThredUp is choosy: It prefers \u201clike new\u201d items from 35,000 specified brands. If items are rejected, sellers can pay a $11 fee to have them returned; otherwise, they will be resold elsewhere or recycled. \u201cNothing ends up in a landfill,\u201d said ThredUp\u2019s chief executive, James Reinhart.ThredUp determines which items sellers will get paid for immediately on receipt, and which will be paid for only after a sale. In either case, sellers receive 5 percent to 80 percent of the price ThredUp initially lists the item for.CHAIRISHIt is also one of the better organized apps, making it comparatively simple for buyers to search by category and refine a search by features like color, price and style.Chairish uses a tiered commission system that takes 20 percent of the first $2,500 of a sale, 12 percent of the next $2,501 to $25,000, and 3 percent of anything above $25,000.The site will arrange flat-rate shipping and charge it to the buyer; the seller also has the option of picking up the tab. The cost ranges from $10 to $300, but for \u201cwhite-glove\u201d shipping \u2014 which includes packing, crating, insuring and cleanup after delivery \u2014 it can top $1,000.An article last Sunday about apps for decluttering misstated the fee that one app, ThredUp, charges sellers to return items it has rejected, and referred imprecisely to the shipping arrangements for the \u201cclean-out bag\u201d that it sends to users to fill with clothes and accessories and return. The fee is $11, not $13, and ThredUp pays the shipping costs for the returned clean-out bag only if the items are donated; it does not cover the costs in all cases. The article also referred incorrectly to the circumstances under which sellers are paid upfront. ThredUp makes that decision withOut regard for the value of the item; it is not the case that items valued at $60 or less will earn the seller an upfront payment.Advertisement"}

In large measure, Cary Leeds was conceived for them \u2014 as a spot that should feel the opposite of second-rate or make-do for children who often are expected to be satisfied with hand-me-downs.The city and New York Junior Tennis split the $26.5 million construction costs. The courts and clubhouse were finished in phases. A ceremony the other day celebrated the completion of the last phase: the two exhibition courts. They make the site a prime spot to stage tournaments.Excavated and terraced, the two courts are rimmed by seating for hundreds of spectators. The architects dug the courts below ground, as they did the lower story of the adjacent clubhouse, partly to preserve sightlines within the park and to take advantage of natural geothermal heating and cooling. On one end is a raised viewing bridge with a perch over the city, and on another end, a balcony.The whole site reveals itself as a lively complex of layers and platforms only after you have passed through the clubhouse onto the balcony, a sequence of compression and release by the architects to enhance the drama and make the center feel like its own precinct or enclave. That aptly suited New York Junior Tennis & Learning.The Cary Leeds Center provides the organization with a flagship home. The other morning, I came across dozens of public school gym teachers from around town taking lessons so that they, in turn, could help students with their backhands before the children hit the books. Gleeful elementary school students played in the park, waiting for their chance with the fledgling instructors.Some 30,000 children live within walking distance of Crotona Park, 3,000 of them in homeless shelters. This stretch of the Bronx is one of the country\u2019s poorest congressional districts. New York Junior Tennis chose to settle here for a reason. Mr. Hartman told me, \u201cThe growing homeless population can more specifically become our focus here.\u201dPeter Gluck, the principal architect for the project, explained, \u201cFor our part, the goal was to make a place as luxurious as possible for kids who are not used to luxurious places.\u201dThe 12,600-square-foot clubhouse acknowledges neighbors\u2019 concerns that the building not overwhelm the park. It reads from outside as a low single-story pavilion, clad in bluestone.But inside, an asymmetrical layout with curtain walls of glass and lots of speeding planes yields a sunny, open space. The shifting tectonics play off the orthogonal grid of courts. Diagonal columns support a triangular roof with a point as sharp as a stiletto. A small shop and offices share the upper floor with a lounge. Downstairs, glassed-in classrooms for New York Junior Tennis spill onto a wedge-shaped courtside patio.It helped that Gluck+ is a design-build practice, handling the construction end of projects, too. This kept the clubhouse budget from skyrocketing and the plan on track. The building ended up costing $500 a square foot, even including a premium for underground construction and waterproofing.Mr. Gluck asked a fair question: \u201cWhy should architects need a rich museum willing to pay $2,000 or $3,000 a square foot to design an exceptional public building?\u201dThey shouldn\u2019t.Follow Michael Kimmelman on Twitter at @kimmelman and on Facebook at facebook.com/michaelkimmelmanAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gilbert Baker, Gay Activist Who Created the Rainbow Flag, Dies at 65", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byGilbert Baker, a self-described \u201cgay Betsy Ross\u201d who in 1978 hand-dyed and stitched together eight strips of vibrantly colored fabric into a rainbow flag, instantly creating an enduring international symbol of gay pride, was found dead on Friday at his home in New York City. He was 65.Cleve Jones, a friend and gay rights activist who confirmed the death, said that Mr. Baker had a stroke several years ago but had not been sick recently.As the gay rights movement spread from San Francisco and New York in the 1970s, Mr. Baker was often asked by friends aware of his creative talents to make banners for protests and marches. His creations, like others during that time, often included the pink triangle, which protesters had claimed as an icon after its initial use by the Nazis to identify gay men in concentration camps during World War II.Before a gay pride parade in 1978 in San Francisco, Harvey Milk, a city supervisor and gay rights leader who was assassinated that year, joined others in asking Mr. Baker to create an emblem to represent the movement.Mr. Baker, with help from volunteers, filled trash cans with dye in the attic of the Gay Community Center in San Francisco and pieced together the first flags, unveiling them in the parade on June 25, 1978.\u201cWe stood there and watched and saw the flags, and their faces lit up,\u201d Mr. Jones said in a phone interview on Friday. \u201cIt needed no explanation. People knew immediately that it was our flag.\u201dThe first flags had eight colors, each stripe carrying its own significance: pink for sex, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sun, green for nature, turquoise for magic, blue for peace and purple for spirit.The flag itself has changed since 1978, going to six colors from eight. Pink fabric was too expensive, Mr. Baker said, so it was removed, and turquoise and blue were combined into one color, royal blue.Gilbert Baker was born on June 2, 1951, in Chanute, Kan., a tiny rural town that was a stop on the Santa Fe Railway. His mother was a teacher, and his father was a lawyer and a judge. Mr. Baker said he was outgoing growing up but had always thought of himself as an outcast because he was gay.Mr. Baker spent a year in college before he was drafted into the Army. He served as a medic and was eventually stationed in San Francisco, where he remained after leaving the Army in 1972.San Francisco was then a center for the women\u2019s rights and civil rights movements, and after a police raid in 1969 at the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan, a gathering spot for gay New Yorkers, more people began coming out as gay.\u201cFor me and, really, a whole generation of people, that was really a defining time,\u201d Mr. Baker said in 2008.After the 1978 parade, Mr. Baker joined a flag company in San Francisco that supported his idea of mass-producing his creation, but he later left for a career in art and design. He was nevertheless always associated with the flag. He created rainbow flags for the recent ABC mini-series \u201cWhen We Rise,\u201d about the gay-rights movement.In recent weeks he had finished creating 39 nine-color flags \u2014 the eight original colors, plus lavender to represent diversity \u2014 to commemorate the 39th anniversary of the first rainbow flag.\u201cHe got up every day and made art,\u201d Charley Beal, a friend who was the art director of the 2008 film \u201cMilk,\u201d about Mr. Milk, said in an interview.Mr. Baker refused to apply for a trademark for his creation. \u201cIt was his gift to the world,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cHe told me when the flag first went up that he knew at that moment that it was his life\u2019s work.\u201dJohn Batteiger contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Herb Deserves Your Attention", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetiteLacking the sun-drenched allure of basil and the practical ubiquity of parsley, tarragon will never win any herbal popularity contests in the United States.It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t like its earthy, licorice flavor. It\u2019s just that most of us don\u2019t think to use it, at least not to the degree that cooks in Europe do. This is especially true in France, where tarragon is everywhere: simmered into soups, steeped in vinegars and mustards, strewed on fish, tossed with salads of soft lettuces.This is a different take, starting with the fact that there is no sauce whatsoever.Instead, the tarragon flavor infuses the chicken through lengthy marinating. Plan on at least six hours. Or better, start marinating the chicken the night before. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours and just gets more delicious as it sits in the pungent mix of tarragon and grated garlic.That\u2019s just about it for the prep, all done in advance. The only chopping left to do is slicing a couple of onions just before cooking, which makes this an ideal after-work meal if you\u2019ve done a little planning.Those onions are roasted in the same pan as the chicken, benefiting both parties. The onions soak up the rendering chicken fat; the chicken absorbs the heady onion steam. A few thyme sprigs scattered on top add their woodsy perfume.As the chicken skin crisps, the onions caramelize, turning golden and very sweet. To balance out their sweetness, add a little acid before serving; that will sharpen things up. You could reach for tarragon vinegar if you have some on hand, and stay within the tarragon theme. But I prefer sherry vinegar, which adds a subtle nuttiness along with the tang. Lemon or lime juices are also nice, adding a clean, fruity sharpness. Then you can use the same vinegar or citrus juice to dress whatever kind of salad you serve alongside the chicken.While you could substitute basil or rosemary here, try this with the tarragon at least once. Then maybe this delightful herb will come to mind a little more often.And to Drink ...Ordinarily, chicken thighs imbued with the mild anise flavor of tarragon would be a good candidate for reds or whites. But the vinegar tang of the onions suggests that a white may work better. A good restrained chardonnay or white Burgundy; an herbal, minerally sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley; a fine white Bordeaux, with its waxy texture; or a dry chenin blanc from Savenni\u00e8res or South Africa would be delicious. If you do prefer a red, I would suggest a St.-Joseph or Crozes-Hermitage, syrah wines from the northern Rh\u00f4ne Valley; an Oregon pinot noir; or perhaps a nebbiolo from the alpine regions of northern Italy, like Valtellina or Carema. Sherry lovers will know that a fine amontillado would also be a great choice. ERIC ASIMOVcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thanks for Your Service, Pothole Warrior", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byI Was MisinformedI am a little on edge because I have been to the Pothole Wars and soon I will have to go back. This is just a short-term PTSD leave after I was ambushed at the Manhattan entrance to the George Washington Bridge last week. I should have seen it coming (it is, after all pothole season) but it was a tight merge, in heavy traffic, and by the time I saw the pothole, I was in it.WHAM! CHOMP!You know how some fish are supposed to have two sets of teeth? If it had been a fish, say the bottom-feeding Black Asphaltus, this jagged-mouth pothole would have been one of those. My Miata, while a dashing little thing, sits 5.3 inches above the ground and is vulnerable to these beasts.Next thing I know, I am on the Palisades Parkway with a flat tire, waiting for AAA to arrange a tow. Let me zoom in on that flat so you can appreciate my anguish, something people so often fail to do:It\u2019s no tidy puncture. It looks as though Jack the Ripper, reincarnated as a radical car-free activist, took a machete and sliced the tire above and below the rim. How I got over the G.W. I cannot imagine.Many things go through your head in such situations, as you watch other drivers heedlessly skimming by: Why me? Why not them?  Where are all those men who see a hot red sports car and flirt when I stop at a red light? Let them see you all flat and needy at the side of the road, and they disappear.  I\u2019ll put a photo up on Facebook so the world will know my pain. How did we handle our emotional needs before Facebook? I guess we had to depend on the faux concern of flesh-and-blood friends. Thank heavens we now have the comfort of emoticons and likes.Excuse me, I see I have an early comment: Why couldn\u2019t you just change the tire yourself? I find your attitude despicable. Machines cannot love, can you? Boycott shrimp.Reply: Yes, a spare tire would\u2019ve been nice but the Miata no longer comes with one and were I to buy a spare and try to jam it in my trunk it would not fit. I\u2019d also lose the space that can now easily accommodate a small makeup bag. Trunk space is frankly my favorite thing about being a sports car owner. If I want to go away with a guy for a dirty weekend, I can say, \u201cPack all the shaving cream you want.\u201dI also have to confess: I don\u2019t know how to change a tire. Somehow in the 50 years I have been driving there was never time, and now the technology has changed and there is this thing called a patch kit. My 2016 Miata\u2019s patch kit comes in a snazzy red package with black trim. That is all I know about it because I carry AAA and I figure that if I have a flat I can call them up and they will fix it. Oh, dear me, here I am on the West Side Highway with a flat from a teeny, easily fixable puncture and nowhere to pull over. No matter, I will just call AAA. Those nice New Yorkers stalled behind me for three miles will understand.The potholes in and around New York City are horrific. Fifteenth and 16th Streets west of Ninth Avenue, my access streets to and from the West Side Highway, have holes that a large dog could bathe in. And with delivery trucks double-parked, you don\u2019t have a lot of room to avoid the potholes or the cyclists who hit them and go flying through the air.\u201cBiker, incoming, swerve!\u201d Get on the Bruckner Expressway or on Interstate 95, where in March the potholes come to breed, and you\u2019re even more likely to damage your tires because you\u2019re going 60 to 70 miles per hour. Often, seeing these ravenous round monsters flying at me like demented Pac-Men, I dream of the \u201cThelma & Louise\u201d maneuver: Maybe I could just gun this baby and fly over them. Although that move did end poorly.Last year during pothole season in Brooklyn one of my rims was dented so deeply it had to be replaced. This year, with damage that would turn out to be a bent rear rim as well as a flayed front tire, it was obvious that pothole season was even worse. But to back up my point of view with statistics, which is after all the journalistic way, I called AAA Northeast and spoke with Robert Sinclair, the manager of media relations.\u201cThis year has been a breeze of a winter,\u201d Mr. Sinclair said. \u201cLast year we were getting a call every four minutes.\u201dMr. Sinclair also said that trendy low-profile tires, which have narrower sidewalls and offer less cushioning on pothole impact \u2014 and are what my car came with \u2014 were \u201ctotally worthless in our area.\u201dWould those run-flat tires with stiff sidewalls help?I don\u2019t know what makes me feel better \u2014 hearing that so many other cars don\u2019t have spares or that an expensive sedan I could never afford got messed up.Not that I could ever go for a BMW 750i.

It\u2019s expected that in two years it will no longer be a part of that European experiment.In Britain, and around the world, the response to the article was swift, if hardly unanimous. Readers, commentators in the British news media, members of Parliament and people across social media weighed in and continued to do so on Thursday.Not everyone was so high-minded. To some people on Twitter, London had already succumbed to immigration, globalization and more. Venom seeped through some Twitter feeds, reminiscent of the anger that surfaced during the vote, to the annoyance of some others.Some readers complained that an American newspaper (if one with a sizable newsroom in London and bureaus around the globe) should not turn its eyes to London and Britain\u2019s planned exit from the union when foreigners could make similar prognostications about the fate of the United States in the wake of a similarly surprising voting result: the election of Donald J. Trump.The metropolis that globalization created may well be the capital of the world. But after the \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum, its future as an international crossroads is far from certain.Some British conservatives and segments of the British news media interpreted the article as a frontal assault by New York itself on the British capital, which might be a surprise to the City of New York.\u201cAs NYC Slams Our Capital...Start Spreading the news: London is top of the heap\u201dSo went the headline to an Op-Ed by Gerard Lyons, a British economist and writer, in which he defended Brexit as good for London and for Britain. To help illustrate the piece, The Sun embedded a small photo of Queen Elizabeth II with the following:We have the Queen. They just have Queens, a grim borough.Ouch, zinger. Jackson Heights and Flushing, rise up.\u201cViral hashtags are a bellwether for the spirit of a city: in the hours after last month\u2019s terrorist attack in Westminster, #WeAreNotAfraid trended on Twitter. It\u2019s characteristic of a city that gets annoyed by attacks on its freedoms.\u201d\u201cHOW DARE THEY! Tory MP Kwasi Kwarteng blasts The New York Times over an article questioning whether London would SURVIVE Brexit.\u201dBeneath all the noise, many readers saw the article as a powerful and melancholy essay for a London that for decades has been a place of opportunity for all Europeans.\u201cLondon is or was sort of the capital of Europe (and by extension the EU) \u2014 at least culturally and economically. I studied in Cambridge in the mid-to-late 90s and my brother and sister studied at the London School of Economics (LSE). They did (or are doing) their Ph.D.s still there. My brother lives in London now with his wife. None of that would have or will now happen. It is an end of an era and a period in time. London will become now again more English and maybe more Asian (or American). EU cosmopolites will be searching for a new place to call their own. Britain will lose massive amounts of money and talent.\u201d \u2014 Pekka Kohonen of Stockholm, commenting via The New York TimesAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York City Firefighter Dies After Falling From Roof", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byA New York City firefighter died on Thursday after falling from the roof of an apartment building while battling a fire in Queens, officials said.The firefighter, William Tolley, a 14-year veteran of the department, was part of a group of firefighters combating a blaze that started in a second-floor apartment in a five-story building in the Ridgewood neighborhood about 2:20 p.m.Mr. Tolley was stationed on the roof to help ventilate the building, a relatively routine maneuver, officials said. But something caused him to fall about 20 minutes after he arrived. The fire was brought under control around 3 p.m.Mayor Bill de Blasio and other city officials rushed to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn, where Mr. Tolley, 42, was taken after his fall.\u201cWe lost another hero today,\u201d the mayor said, \u201ca man dedicated to protecting others. Gave his life to this work.\u201dFire Commissioner Daniel A. Nigro said that Mr. Tolley\u2019s death was a \u201cterrible tragedy\u201d for the department and that the circumstances of his fall would be investigated.\u201cIt was really in the operation that he was performing on the roof, which is a routine operation for us, and somehow he fell from the roof,\u201d Mr. Nigro said.At the site of the fire, inspectors stood on the roof, and the ladder of Mr. Tolley\u2019s company, No. 135, was leaning against the structure. A firefighter\u2019s tank, a helmet and gloves lay on the concrete below.At the station house nearby, memorial candles and flowers crowded the door.An official with knowledge of the matter said that Mr. Tolley was either in or around the bucket at the top of the fire ladder when he fell.Michael T. Vogel, a neighbor, said he had heard a loud noise followed by yelling.\u201cI heard everyone shouting, \u2018Get back, get back,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Vogel. When he went out onto the street, he said, there were at least a dozen firefighters surrounding the man.A red tent was later placed over the area.Three other people were taken to the medical center with minor injuries, officials said.Mr. Tolley, of Bethpage, N.Y., on Long Island, is survived by his wife, Marie, and his 8-year-old daughter, Isabella, officials said.\u201cEveryone is in a state of shock and grief,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cTo his family, we say we will stand with you, not only today but in the days ahead.\u201dJames Slevin, the president of Uniformed Firefighters Association, the union that represents New York City firefighters, said Mr. Tolley was a hero.\u201cHis death is a grim reminder of the dangerous work New York City firefighters do on behalf of our city every single day,\u201d he said in a statement.In addition to his firefighting career, Mr. Tolley was the drummer of a well-known heavy metal band, Internal Bleeding.\u201cThere are ZERO WORDS to describe the loss,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe was a good, decent and honorable man who loved his friends, his family and the people he served. There will never be another like him.\u201dChris Pervelis, a longtime guitar player in the band, wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve lost my best friend and musical soul mate.

{"Headline": "China Tech Investment Flying Under the Radar, Pentagon Warns", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byThere are few restrictions on investing in American start-ups that focus on artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robotics, the report contends, and China has taken advantage. Beijing, the report says, is encouraging its companies to invest for the purpose of pushing the country ahead in its strategic competition with the United States.In some instances, Chinese companies have made under-the-radar investments intended to dodge the oversight of a government agency, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as Cfius.\u201cIf we allow China access to these same technologies concurrently, then not only may we lose our technological superiority, but we may even be facilitating China\u2019s technological superiority,\u201d the report says.The report found that increasingly sophisticated commercial technology had blurred the lines between what was available to military consumers and civilian ones. Often start-ups and leading internet companies like Facebook and Google are working on products as sophisticated as anything the military has at its disposal.\u201cFor example, V.R. for gaming is at a similar level of sophistication as the V.R. used in simulators for our armed forces,\u201d the report said, referring to virtual reality. \u201cFacial recognition and image detection for social networking and online shopping has real application in tracking terrorists or other threats to national security,\u201d the report continued, which added that much of the autonomous vehicle and drone technology of today was developed using grants from the Pentagon.Last summer, the company received a $150 million joint investment from Ford and the Chinese internet giant Baidu. Baidu declined to comment on the investment.A Velodyne spokeswoman said the round represented its first outside investment.\u201cThe company obtained all necessary government clearances relating to the investment as part of the funding process,\u201d the spokeswoman wrote in an email. \u201cNotably, the investments were designed to make advanced LiDAR sensors more accessible to the broader industry, resulting in the development of safer, less expensive autonomous vehicles.\u201dAshton B. Carter, the former secretary of defense, commissioned the report as an urgent review of what senior Pentagon officials have considered China\u2019s alarming penetration of Silicon Valley, particularly in deals that finance nascent technology that has military applications.The report found that American private industry was mostly unaware of Beijing\u2019s efforts \u2014 many of the deals involve relatively small amounts of money \u2014 and that Washington did not have a strong understanding of the scale of the issue.\u201cThe U.S. government does not have a holistic view of how fast this technology transfer is occurring, the level of Chinese investment in U.S. technology, or what technologies we should be protecting,\u201d the report said.Michael A. Brown, the former chief executive of Symantec, led the study, called \u201cHow Chinese Investments in Emerging Technology Enable a Strategic Competitor to Access the Crown Jewels of U.S. Innovation.\u201d The New York Times reviewed a copy of the unclassified report.Mr. Carter declined to comment on the final document issued to cabinet officials last month.The report does not offer examples of American companies that have accepted Chinese investment and then found that their sensitive technologies were transferred to China.But it does take exception to tactics that it says Chinese funds have used to skirt government oversight. For example, it singles out Canyon Bridge, a venture capital firm that it says was formed to buy Lattice Semiconductor, an American microchip company. The firm has Chinese capital and American management expertise. The purpose of creating Canyon Bridge was to obscure the source of capital to \u201cenhance the possibility\u201d that the transaction would be approved by Cfius, the report said.Peter Kuo, a partner at Canyon Bridge, said that the there was never any intention to obscure the source of the fund\u2019s capital, as shown by meetings it had with Cfius before the deal was signed.Chinese investors plowed about $30 billion into early-stage technology through more than 1,000 funding deals between 2010 and 2016. During that time, participation from China rose to about 10 percent of total venture deals, with investment in crucial industries like artificial intelligence, robotics and augmented reality accelerating in 2016, according to the report.Among the investors identified in the report are well-known private firms and funds like Alibaba and Baidu. It also points to government-sponsored investors like Westlake Ventures, a fund in Redwood City, Calif., that is owned by the Hangzhou government, and ZGC Capital, an investor owned by 17 state-owned enterprises with an office in Santa Clara, Calif.The rising trend in venture capital investments has occurred alongside state-directed industrial espionage and online theft, which the American government has been unable to slow, the report says. In the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Silicon Valley field office, only 10 people are dedicated to counterespionage, and F.B.I. officials said in interviews for the report that it \u201chas very limited resources relative to the threat.\u201d\u201cThe scale of the espionage continues to increase,\u201d the authors say. \u201cDespite the rise in convictions, there is no way to know how big this problem really is.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how much money Chinese investors put into American early-stage technology between 2010 and 2016. It was $30 billion, not $620 billion.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Be a Genius, Think Like a 94-Year-Old", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byIn 1946, a 23-year-old Army veteran named John Goodenough headed to the University of Chicago with a dream of studying physics. When he arrived, a professor warned him that he was already too old to succeed in the field.We tend to assume that creativity wanes with age. But Dr. Goodenough\u2019s story suggests that some people actually become more creative as they grow older. Unfortunately, those late-blooming geniuses have to contend with powerful biases against them.\u201cYoung people are just smarter,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg pronounced at an event at Stanford in 2007, when he was the 22-year-old chief executive of Facebook. He added, according to a VentureBeat writer, \u201cI only own a mattress,\u201d and then expounded upon the putative correlation between youth and creative power. His logic didn\u2019t exactly make sense (and he later apologized), but his meaning was perfectly clear: Middle-aged people are encumbered by boring possessions (gutters, dental floss, orthopedic shoes) and stale ideas.Since that speech, Silicon Valley\u2019s youth worship seems to have grown even more feverish. Recently, a 12-year-old inventor named Shubham Banerjee received venture-capital funds from Intel to start his own company.In such a climate, it\u2019s easy for us middle-aged folk to believe that the great imaginative leaps are behind us, and that innovation belongs to the kids.John P. Walsh, one of the professors, joked that the Patent Office should give a \u201csenior discount\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s clear evidence that people with seniority are making important contributions to invention.\u201dThe more I talked to Dr. Goodenough, the more I wondered if his brilliance was directly tied to his age. After all, he has been thinking about energy problems longer than just about anyone else on the planet.He grew up in the early days of the petroleum age, in a Connecticut farmhouse with a kerosene stove and an icebox for food. As a kid he rode in some of the early cars pioneered by Henry Ford. \u201cThe first car the family owned was a Model A,\u201d he told me, with running boards and a lead-acid battery.He believes the lithium-ion battery is too liable to explode, too expensive and too weak to bring us into that future.Years ago, he decided to create a solid battery that would be safer. Of course, in a perfect world, the \u201csolid-state\u201d battery would also be low-cost and lightweight. Then, two years ago, he discovered the work of Maria Helena Braga, a Portuguese physicist who, with the help of a colleague, had created a kind of glass that can replace liquid electrolytes inside batteries.Dr. Goodenough persuaded Dr. Braga to move to Austin and join his lab. \u201cWe did some experiments to make sure the glass was dry. Then we were off to the races,\u201d he said.Some of his colleagues were dubious that he could pull it off. But Dr. Goodenough was not dissuaded. \u201cI\u2019m old enough to know you can\u2019t close your mind to new ideas. You have to test out every possibility if you want something new.\u201dWhen I asked him about his late-life success, he said: \u201cSome of us are turtles; we crawl and struggle along, and we haven\u2019t maybe figured it out by the time we\u2019re 30. But the turtles have to keep on walking.\u201d This crawl through life can be advantageous, he pointed out, particularly if you meander around through different fields, picking up clues as you go along. Dr. Goodenough started in physics and hopped sideways into chemistry and materials science, while also keeping his eye on the social and political trends that could drive a green economy. \u201cYou have to draw on a fair amount of experience in order to be able to put ideas together,\u201d he said.He also credits his faith for keeping him focused on his mission to defeat pollution and ditch petroleum. On the wall of his lab, a tapestry of the Last Supper depicts the apostles in fervent conversation, like scientists at a conference arguing over a controversial theory. The tapestry reminds him of the divine power that fuels his mind. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the doors that have been opened to me in different periods of my life,\u201d he said. He believes the glass battery was just another example of the happy accidents that have come his way: \u201cAt just the right moment, when I was looking for something, it walked in the door.\u201dLast but not least, he credited old age with bringing him a new kind of intellectual freedom. At 94, he said, \u201cYou no longer worry about keeping your job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Attack on Syria Cements Kremlin\u2019s Embrace of Assad", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisEven as the United States condemned Mr. Assad for gassing his own citizens and held Russia partly responsible, given its 2013 promise to rid Syria of chemical weapons, the Kremlin kept denying that Syria had any such capability.By championing Mr. Assad and condemning American \u201caggression,\u201d President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia seemed to be burying the idea that he could somehow cooperate with the Trump administration to end the conflict on his terms.The solidarity with Damascus is likely to cause problems for Russia in the long run, analysts said, although Mr. Putin probably cannot be persuaded to loosen his embrace any time soon.\u201cPutin made a choice \u2014 to underline that Assad is his ally,\u201d said Aleksandr Morozov, an independent political analyst. \u201cThis will lead to Russia\u2019s further isolation, but Putin will stand his ground.\u201dRussia and Iran sharply criticized U.S. missile strikes on a Syrian airfield on Thursday night, while European countries have been broadly supportive so far.Mr. Morozov and other analysts consider the policy problematic for various reasons.First, Mr. Trump and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, have painted Russia as at least partially responsible for the carnage among civilians that was fomented by the Assad government.He added, \u201cThey have said that Russia is responsible for Assad\u2019s actions and that it didn\u2019t fulfill its responsibilities in terms of chemical weapons disarmament.\u201dThe United States responded by firing almost 60 cruise missiles at the air base, which housed the warplanes used in the chemical attack. The local governor said five military men and two civilians died.That risks dragging out a war that Mr. Putin has depicted at home as quick, cheap and easy at a time when many Russians have been struggling economically. Trying to keep the length and cost of the war down is a crucial reason that the Russians will avoid escalating any conflict with the United States, analysts said.\u201cRussia wants to end the conflict and to diminish its military and economic presence,\u201d said Andrei Frolov, a defense analyst and the managing editor of the Moscow Defense Brief.With the next Russian presidential campaign scheduled to start by the end of the year, he said, \u201cthere is no need to continue a war outside the country with a weak explanation for the Russian people why Russia is staying there.\u201dA poll by the independent Levada center in March found that almost 20 percent of Russians already believed that the country\u2019s military involvement in Syria made no sense.Third, the Assad alliance could undermine one of Mr. Putin\u2019s main goals for entering the war: to try to make Russia a player on the world stage again as the indispensable broker in the Middle East.Protecting Mr. Assad could further repulse countries that Moscow has been courting, like Turkey and Israel, analysts said \u2014 not to mention much of the world.In the months immediately after Russia deployed its military in Syria, Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, used to say things like, \u201cWe don\u2019t support Assad; what is important for us is to preserve Syrian statehood.\u201dAfter the attack, the ministry cranked out a statement lauding Syria for its \u201cfierce battle\u201d against \u201cinternational terrorism.\u201dAleksei V. Makarkin, the deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, a think tank based in Moscow, said, \u201cThe longer Russia supports Assad, the more dependent it is on him.\u201d\u201cAt the beginning, there was some talk about replacing him, even if gradually,\u201d he said, but that talk has evaporated.The ostensible reason that Mr. Putin deployed his military in Syria in September 2015 was to fight terrorism, but that is often dismissed as the sound-bite logic. Other goals, especially shoring up Mr. Assad, proved more important.Mr. Putin wanted to resurrect Moscow\u2019s old Soviet reputation as a global military power. Syria proved a showcase for new Russian weapons, and Russia has established two rare overseas bases there.\u201cRussia will continue to support Assad because he is the only guarantor of Russia\u2019s military presence in Syria and hence of Russia\u2019s military presence in the Middle East over all,\u201d Mr. Makarkin said.In addition, Mr. Putin was appalled by the way Western leaders had abandoned former allies like President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Col. Muammar Qadhafi of Libya.Mr. Putin was determined to prove that Russia would stick by its friends and oppose \u201cregime change\u201d rooted in outside intervention.Russia faults the United States for destabilizing countries like Iraq and Libya \u2014 which some think has provided an opening for Islamic extremists \u2014 a scenario Mr. Putin was determined to avoid in Syria.Finally, of course, Syria presented Russia with an opportunity to break out of the isolation that resulted from sanctions imposed by the West for its 2014 annexation of Crimea and destabilization of Ukraine.The Kremlin thought that forging an alliance with the West on Syria would render illogical the idea of maintaining the economic sanctions.Mr. Trump, during his campaign, seemed to champion the idea, as well, questioning the need for sanctions, suggesting that Crimea probably did belong to Russia and repeatedly praising Mr. Putin as a strong leader. He endorsed the idea that the two countries together fight the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS.While that raised suspicions in the United States of collusion, it was welcomed in Russia as a new dawn in relations.The illusions began fading as Mr. Trump or his allies reversed many of those positions one by one, and the attack on Syria pretty much buried them.On Friday, the rubric on Rossiya 24, the state satellite news channel, for some of the coverage of the attack was \u201cKaptain Amerika\u201d imposed over a zombielike figure with dead eyes.\u201cThe rest of the pre-election fog has melted away,\u201d Dmitri Medvedev, Russia\u2019s prime minister, wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cInstead of the mass-circulated narrative about a joint fight against our main enemy, ISIL, the Trump administration has demonstrated that it will be fiercely fighting the legitimate government of Syria.\u201d(That Mr. Medvedev responded publicly, but not Mr. Putin, seemed to indicate moderate anger.)The first consequence on the ground, analysts said, is that Syria and the Russian military will feel less restricted than ever in attacking forces they think are aligned with the West and that they have accused of being terrorists.Some Syrian rebel groups subsidized by the United States and its regional allies have formed battlefield alliances with fighters from Al Nusra, the affiliate of Al Qaeda in Syria.\u201cNow Russia in Syria can oppress and destroy opposition forces without regard to the United States and its position,\u201d Mr. Frolov, the defense analyst, said.Oleg Matsnev and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It was online for about 20 hours.The gruesome case is the latest in a string of violent crimes that have been broadcast over Facebook to a wide audience, sometimes of millions. The killing raised debate in Thailand and is likely to bring further pressure on Facebook, which has struggled to manage the huge number of broadcasts on its site.In an emailed statement, a Facebook spokesman called the case \u201cappalling,\u201d adding, \u201cThere is absolutely no place for content of this kind on Facebook, and it has now been removed.\u201dIn Thailand, there was broad anger over the crime, which the police said appeared to have been driven by jealousy. Mr. Wongtalay had fought with his wife the night before the killing after searching her phone and accusing her of having another relationship.The video showed Mr. Wongtalay fixing a noose around his daughter\u2019s neck and then dropping her off the side of a building. After a burst of crying, he climbed over the side to retrieve her body. His subsequent suicide was not shown online.A second video of the police taking both of the bodies down that night remained on Facebook.The deaths in Thailand highlight the global scope of the problem. As Facebook has pushed to further ensconce itself in the lives of its users, it has urged them to share their most intimate experiences on its site. That has resulted in a flood of posts and videos in different languages, cultural contexts and time zones across the world. Accidents and crimes have also occasionally shown up, and patrolling that has proved difficult.Facebook has said it is working on using artificial intelligence and a better reporting system to ensure that such content can be flagged faster. The company has also introduced tools to help with suicide prevention and assigned review teams to deal with reports that come in.Still, as the Thailand case showed, some posts can slip by.After major news outlets in Thailand broadcast the videos, prompting viewer complaints, the country\u2019s News Broadcasting Council issued a statement instructing the news media not to run the clips because it could lead to copycat violence.Ryn Jirenuwat contributed reporting from Bangkok.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Georgia Vote Nears, G.O.P. Asks if Ideological Purity Matters Anymore", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byATLANTA \u2014 When Michael Fitzgerald, a local Republican leader, took a break from packing up the signs after a candidate forum here last week, he appeared momentarily flummoxed about the state of his party under President Trump.Early voting has already begun in a closely watched special House election to replace former Representative Tom Price, who became Mr. Trump\u2019s health secretary, but in the suburbs north of Atlanta, few seem quite sure what exactly the party stands for now.\u201cThere are shades,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald finally said as he considered what it now meant to be a Republican. \u201cCan I point to an individual and say, \u2018Here\u2019s your ideal conservative\u2019?\u201d He did not answer his own question, but he did not need to.Mr. Trump\u2019s takeover of the Republican Party has blurred the bright-line ideological distinctions that defined the right for the past eight years. Driven more by personal loyalty and a ravenous appetite to win than by any fixed political philosophy, the deal-cutting president has been received warmly by some mainstream conservatives. At the same time, even ideological hard-liners who share the president\u2019s pugilism but not his pragmatism have stuck by him because Mr. Trump has made the right enemies \u2014 and gleefully ridiculed them with public insults rarely heard from a president.\u201cBecause of the loyalty that the most conservative voters in our base have to Trump, there\u2019s a pull there that\u2019s scrambling the ideological lines,\u201d said Andy Sere, a Republican ad man who has been heavily engaged in the party\u2019s internecine wars. \u201cHe wants wins on the board, and that\u2019s traditionally been the goal of the pragmatists.\u201dThe shifting conservative fault lines are on display in the affluent and mall-dotted northern suburbs of Atlanta, which were at the front end of the South\u2019s political realignment in the 1970s when they turned away from their Democratic roots and elected a loquacious young college professor named Newt Gingrich to Congress.But the way the Republican hopefuls are running is just as instructive. Even as they try to win over the sort of conservative activists dedicated enough to participate in a rare April election, the Republicans are casting themselves more as can-do pragmatists in the spirit of Mr. Trump than unwavering ideologues. At the forum and in individual interviews afterward, three of the Republicans in the 18-person field invoked some variation of Ronald Reagan\u2019s maxim that it is better to get 80 percent of what you want than nothing at all.One of the leading Republican candidates, Karen Handel, even wore her practicality as a badge of honor, citing not just Reagan but also Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u201crelentless incrementalism\u201d credo.Bob Gray, who calls himself an outsider and is a businessman supported by the conservative Club for Growth, played to type at the forum as he twice criticized Speaker Paul D. Ryan for having \u201cfailed\u201d on the health care legislation. But in an interview, Mr. Gray allowed that he would have backed the House-drafted bill (which the Club for Growth opposed), shied away from the Tea Party label and sounded more like a furrowed-brow centrist than a fire-breathing conservative.\u201cThis is the problem with D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has retreated to their political corners with a jersey on. We need people like President Trump who want to go to D.C. and change the way they do business. The American people are tired of the bickering.\u201dSuch remarks from a Club for Growth-backed candidate would have been jarring only three years ago, but one Tea Party leader here said the change was the inevitable result of last year\u2019s presidential campaign.\u201cThe Republican primary voters rejected a purist ideologue when they chose Donald Trump over Ted Cruz,\u201d said Debbie Dooley, chairwoman of the Atlanta Tea Party Patriots.Ms. Dooley\u2019s frequently updated Facebook page is the stuff of a political scientist\u2019s dreams, a nearly real-time look at the shifting sands of the Republican Party at the outset of the Trump era.\u201cPeople began to want results, not platitudes,\u201d Ms. Dooley said, conceding her own \u201cevolution,\u201d as she called it. \u201cYou still have some who are still purists, but the Trump train has left the station.\u201dRepublican swords have been sheathed well beyond this House race. Nine Republican senators are up for re-election next year, but there is little talk of the sort of primaries that terrified Republican lawmakers and convulsed the party during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. What talk there is has come from Mr. Trump\u2019s backers, and is based on a perceived lack of fidelity to the president rather than on any ideological apostasy.Nowhere has the newly muddled nature of the party been more evident than in the fallout from the Republican failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Activists are angry over the display of dysfunction, but they are uncertain whom to turn their guns on. They will not blame Mr. Trump, because to fault him is to link arms with the left and an adversarial news media, a nonstarter in an era of tribal politics.Some on the right are tempted to point a finger at Mr. Ryan, a pillar of the pre-Trump party establishment, but that approach has been complicated by Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to align himself with the speaker, both on the health care issue and more broadly.This leaves the Freedom Caucus. But these lawmakers, backed by an array of right-leaning outside groups, are some of the most dependably conservative members of Congress and were hailed for their steadfast opposition in the Obama years.\u201cFor eight years, the heroes in this movement were the Freedom Caucus members, and now they\u2019re suddenly in the bad camp?\u201d asked the Republican strategist Chip Lake, a touch of wonder in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s really confusing right now as a Republican to figure out who\u2019s on first.\u201dTo Republican veterans, the turn toward half-a-loaf politics on the right does not represent any sort of great awakening, just activists aligning themselves with the preferences of a new president. The longer-term question is just how much Mr. Trump can tug the Republican electorate along with him if he decides to go further toward the center (or even left) than any of his Republican predecessors.For now, Ralph Reed, a longtime Republican strategist who lives just outside this congressional district, said the bedrock of the Republican base will not abandon Mr. Trump.\u201cThe guy who is enemy of our enemy can\u2019t be our enemy,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is the only game in town.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Run.\u201dPerhaps it was the muted background music: an eerie melody that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place in a Batman movie.But many residents of Lake County seemed to respond positively, thanking the sheriff for drawing attention to a deadly scourge that has altered communities beyond recognition.In the 95-second clip, Sheriff Grinnell, who was elected in November, stood at a podium flanked by four deputies wearing black face coverings. The sheriff addressed his Lake County constituents, saying he was aware of the \u201cserious issue\u201d of heroin abuse in the area. He encouraged people to call the office with tips.He added: \u201cTo the dealers that are pushing this poison, I have a message for you.\u201d And the camera began to zoom in.The sheriff warned drug dealers that the police were waiting for some arrest warrants to be finalized.\u201cEnjoy trying to sleep tonight, wondering if tonight\u2019s the night our SWAT team blows your front door off the hinges,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are coming for you. If our agents can show the nexus between you, the pusher of poison, and the person that overdoses and dies, we will charge you with murder. We are coming for you. Run.\u201dAt the end of the video, Sheriff Grinnell and the four others walked offscreen in a silent, single file.\u201cIt makes the Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Department look like they\u2019re about to go to battle in Falluja,\u201d said Ezekiel Edwards, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Criminal Law Reform Project.SWAT teams, he added, should be used only when there is an imminent threat to human life. \u201cThat video suggested that they are using SWAT inappropriately, and in a way that is going to escalate violence and danger to all involved.\u201dBut Lt. John Herrell, a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s office, said responses from residents had been positive.\u201cI would say that the critics are off the mark and have missed the whole point of the message,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sheriff wanted to let the community know that he\u2019s aware of this problem.\u201dLt. Herrell added that the video\u2019s tough tone was aimed at dealers, not addicts. And as for the men in black masks, he explained: \u201cThey are undercover deputies, and state statutes require that their identities be protected.\u201dKim Mousette, 52, said it was time for the police to take a tougher approach to heroin abuse in the county. She said her neighborhood in Pine Lakes, once a quiet refuge, had lately become a haven for drug users where people no longer felt safe leaving their doors unlocked.\u201cWe were in one of the most pristine, protected areas of Florida, and now this is going on,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cYou could be walking along and have a syringe go through your foot.\u201dMs. Mousette, who said the police had largely been unresponsive to complaints, voted for Sheriff Grinnell last year. Now, she feels she made the right choice. \u201cI was very happy to see that video,\u201d she said.The opioid scourge is national in scope; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that nearly 13,000 people died of heroin overdoses across the country in 2015, up 20.6 percent from 2014.Audrianna Nicole Boone, 27, watched family members suffer from addiction in her hometown, Lady Lake. She moved to North Carolina in 2012, and has long felt that the Lake County police never did enough to fight opioid abuse.\u201cWhen I see this video, it\u2019s kind of like the sheriff\u2019s office declaring war on the drug addiction and the criminals,\u201d she said. \u201cI love it, and I hope it continues to go viral.\u201dStill, she added, the video was only a starting point. \u201cInstead of arresting these people for the drug use, how about enacting some type of system that helps these people get clean and reintroduces these people to society?\u201d she said.Mr. Edwards of the A.C.L.U. acknowledged that opioid addiction was a serious issue in need of redress \u2014 but not like this.\u201cEven though it\u2019s just one local video, it does, in a very short amount of time, encapsulate much of what is wrong with policing today: militarization, using force inappropriately, and continuing to fight a drug war that has proved to be a failure,\u201d he said.Some in Lake County agreed.\u201cIt\u2019s a good example of how overly militarized police in the U.S. are,\u201d said Robert Vibert, 35, who lives in the town of Tavares, where the county sheriff\u2019s office is.He said he found the video overly dramatic, as if Sheriff Grinnell were trying to make a name for himself. \u201cI\u2019m sure he means well, but his approach is lackluster and a waste if he doesn\u2019t tackle the totality of the problem,\u201d Mr. Vibert said. \u201cWithout attacking supply lines, and helping addicts and users get clean, it won\u2019t ever really solve the problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Pushes Outside Law Firms to Become More Diverse", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "Supported byLike other Silicon Valley giants, Facebook has faced criticism over whether its work force and board are too white and too male. Last year, the social media behemoth started a new push on diversity in hiring and retention.Now, it is extending its efforts into another corner: the outside lawyers who represent the company in legal matters.Facebook is requiring that women and ethnic minorities account for at least 33 percent of law firm teams working on its matters.Numbers alone, however, are not enough, under a policy that went in effect on Saturday. Law firms must also show that they \u201cactively identify and create clear and measurable leadership opportunities for women and minorities\u201d when they represent the company in litigation and other legal matters.Those opportunities \u201cinclude serving as relationship managers and representing Facebook in the courtroom,\u201d Facebook\u2019s general counsel, Colin Stretch, said in an interview. The legal department, he said, has for the last few years been working on increasing diversity at all levels.\u201cFirms typically do what their clients want,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we want to see them win our cases and create opportunities for women and people of color. We think the firms are ready \u2014 our articulation gives not just permission but a mandate.\u201dFor Facebook, the move on outside lawyers is happening even as the company\u2019s efforts at improving diversity in its own work force have so far shown little progress.According to statistics released last year, blacks and Hispanics last July accounted for only 3 percent each of senior leadership, and women made up an additional 27 percent. Hiring for the 12 months beginning with July 2015 showed something of an improvement: Of those newly recruited to senior leadership posts, 9 percent were black, 5 percent were Hispanic and 29 percent were women.To improve those numbers, Facebook announced last year that it would focus on recruiting and retention. The company is also establishing programs to help underrepresented college students, as well as younger students in public schools nationwide, develop interests in coding and engineering. In addition, Facebook is reaching out to families who want to learn more about programming.And when it comes to improving diversity among its outside lawyers, Facebook is part of a growing trend.A number of general counsels across corporate America are pressing their outside firms to make their teams more diverse \u2014 in terms of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and even disability \u2014 at all levels of seniority, not just among junior associates.MetLife says it is announcing a new policy this month; HP in February adopted a more stringent program. The moves are an acknowledgment that the numbers of women and minorities at law firms have barely budged over the past 20 years.\u201cLaw is the least diverse white-collar profession,\u201d said Jean Lee, the chief executive of the Minority Corporate Counsel Association, an organization that focuses on the hiring, retention and promotion of diverse lawyers. \u201cA lot of companies made a concerted effort to increase diversity internally, and now they are demanding diversity at the firms they use.\u201d\u201cOne of the challenges in the legal profession is that, despite all of the focus, the lack of diversity is a stubborn and persistent problem,\u201d said Kim Rivera, HP\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe think we can help if we can be clear and unambiguous and hold firms financially accountable.\u201dHP now requires its outside law firms to have at least one diverse so-called relationship partner or at least one \u201cwoman and one racially/ethnically diverse attorney each performing at least 10 percent of the billable hours worked on HP matters.\u201d (A woman who is also a minority will cover the requirements as long as she bills the requisite 10 percent.)Failure to comply, under the policy, would result in a 10 percent \u201cdiversity holdback\u201d of fees, but with a one-year grace period.Ms. Rivera said the reaction to the new policy had been positive. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten dozens of calls and meeting requests largely asking how to partner with us to have the program succeed,\u201d she said.Zakiyyah Salim-Williams, the chief diversity officer for Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which counts both HP and Facebook among its clients, said she was not fazed by the new requirements.\u201cWe have a large number of diverse lawyers and we always try to staff our teams to reflect that,\u201d she said.Mr. Stretch of Facebook says its legal department will work with outside law firms in their efforts, tracking results, not surprisingly, through a variety of metrics.It\u2019s not just tech companies that are pushing their outside counsel. MetLife\u2019s general counsel, Ricardo Anzaldua, will meet this month with representatives of some of the 50 firms the company retains to review an initiative to spur retention and sponsorship of women and diverse lawyers.Under the program, the firms \u201cmust make sure that the junior diverse talent has sponsorship among the senior lawyers and that they get the best coaching and nurturing they can provide.\u201d MetLife will evaluate the results in 2018; underperforming firms will have six months to improve or be dropped.Mr. Anzaldua\u2019s mandate echoes his own in-house initiatives. \u201cA few years ago we began to identify and coach those with high potential to become the future leadership pipeline,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the initiative doesn\u2019t exclude white men, the proportion of women and people of color in that pipeline is more than 60 percent, reflecting the fact that we have an influx of talented women and people of color in the lower ranks.\u201dSome companies take a more fluid approach. While Verizon Communications has no numerical target, its general counsel, Craig Silliman, said, \u201cdiversity of the team is one of the specific criteria we use when we bid out a matter,\u201d in addition to strategic approach, cost and other factors.Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief legal officer, Eric Grossman, in addition to encouraging diverse teams, also annually names one of its outside law firms as the recipient of a leadership award in diversity and inclusion. Firms vie for the award, which depend on a variety of factors.\u201cWe put a lot of weight not just on the diverse and female attorneys who work on Morgan Stanley matters, but also on how many diverse lawyers they have in the firm and the depth of their sponsorship programs they have to promote overall diversity. We recognize that it just doesn\u2019t happen on its own,\u201d he said.The possibility of a fee reduction or being dropped from the roster of approved firms could be an effective tool to make it happen.\u201cCompanies are now using a carrot and stick approach because the carrot approach alone didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Ms. Lee of the Minority Corporate Counsel Association.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uganda Tries to Commit Critic of President to Mental Institution", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byIn Uganda, criticizing the president may not just be illegal. It could also be used as proof of insanity.Uganda\u2019s top prosecutor sought this week to crack down further on dissent, trying to use a colonial-era law, once used by the British to quash African resistance, to commit a prominent critic of the president to a mental institution.This time, Stella Nyanzi, who until recently was a research fellow at Makerere University in Kampala, the capital, was charged on Monday with \u201ccyberharassment\u201d and \u201coffensive communication\u201d after a series of Facebook posts this year, particularly one in which she described Mr. Museveni as a \u201cpair of buttocks.\u201dIn addition to the charges, State Attorney Jonathan Muwaganya, a lawyer educated in the United States, submitted an application to commit Ms. Nyanzi to a psychiatric hospital for two weeks so that doctors could \u201cdetermine\u201d her mental health.\u201cCalling a renowned researcher insane for exercising a legitimate right of protest and free speech is in itself insane,\u201d Ms. Nyanzi\u2019s lawyer, Nicholas Opiyo, said in a telephone interview.Ms. Nyanzi\u2019s case has produced widespread anger in the country, which prides itself on its vibrant civil society but is increasingly frustrated with Mr. Museveni\u2019s despotic tendencies \u2014 an about-face from his earlier years when he restored political stability after the horrors of Idi Amin and promised not to overstay his time in power.Last year, an army general who complained about Mr. Museveni\u2019s length in office was promptly jailed. Several people were arrested in 2015 for posting critical comments on Facebook and uploading photos depicting the president as dead.Ms. Nyanzi\u2019s Facebook posts contain profanity-laced vitriol about the president and his wife (whom Ms. Nyanzi describes as having a \u201ctiny brain\u201d the size of a sexual organ), as well as academic studies of \u201cRadical Rudeness\u201d and the \u201cNecessity of Political Vulgarity\u201d \u2014 political tactics Ugandans once used to resist British imperialism. \u201cKnow our rich history before you think I am the first fighter with words,\u201d Ms. Nyanzi wrote in one post.But last week, the authorities seemed to have had enough.Security forces detained Ms. Nyanzi on Friday as she left a Rotary Club event in Kampala, where she had given a talk on providing schoolgirls with sanitary pads, a subject over which she has publicly argued with Mr. Museveni\u2019s wife, Janet, who is the education minister.Ms. Nyanzi was held for 18 hours and beaten, said Mr. Opiyo, her lawyer. When he was finally allowed to see her, he said, \u201cher clothes had been torn, and though she was menstruating, she was not given napkins.\u201d\u201cShe was left to bleed,\u201d he added.Ms. Nyanzi, 43, was defiant in court. \u201cHow many times has Museveni offended Ugandans?\u201d she said in the packed courtroom. \u201cI am ready to take on the mantle of insanity if the regime is going to be told for the first time about how it has offended Ugandans. Yes, your honor, I have written a lot about those who rule us, nepotism. However, I am not guilty of offensive communication.\u201dHer case was taken up on social media, with #FreeStellaNyanzi trending on Twitter on Tuesday. Activists posted Twitter messages about the conditions under which she had been held at Luzira prison. Shawn Mubiru, an associate at the Great Lakes Institute for Strategic Studies in Kampala, posted that two male psychiatrists had been seen at the prison, and quoted Ms. Nyanzi as saying she was being pushed up against the wall \u201cto make her snap.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It has also introduced teenagers like Daniel Sanchez, 17, to a relic of the analog age.Earlier this month, Mr. Sanchez was walking through a Walmart near his home in Hayward, Calif., when he spotted a display of cassette tapes, which gave him the sort of big idea he had been hoping for.He sat down with the oldfangled equipment and recorded his fondest memories of his times with Ms. Cerda, who is also 17. To make the promposal hang together, Mr. Sanchez made a sign, \u201c13 Reasons Why You Should Go To Prom w/ Me?\u201dHer post ignited a fiery discussion, with some arguing that the promproposal was trivializing a serious issue.Ms. Cerda defended the gesture: \u201cThis promposal is not causing any harm, just shutup and get over it.\u201dThe online response took her boyfriend by surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate this kind of a reaction,\u201d Mr. Sanchez said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think of the show as about suicide. We thought of it as entertainment. Then I read an article about how the show didn\u2019t do a good job making that clear and that it glorified things. Now I\u2019m thinking about things a little differently.\u201dThe prom took place last weekend, and Ms. Cerda re-upped the promposal tweet with a photo of the couple, in school-dance attire, standing in front of a Mustang, the kind of car driven by one of the characters on the show.Ms. Cerda, a senior who plans to attend the University of California, Davis, in the fall, said she and her boyfriend were not diminishing the seriousness of depression and suicide. \u201cIt\u2019s entertainment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend. It\u2019s popular. No one really is going to die. It\u2019s a promposal.\u201dEndless threads on teenagers\u2019 Facebook feeds delve into whether Hannah is to blame for her own misery. And it can be a challenge to scroll through social media and not come upon the new dis, \u201cWelcome to your tape.\u201d\u201cWe were hate-bingeing the show,\u201d Ms. Urick said. \u201cI didn\u2019t care for it. I yelled at the TV.\u201dShe was annoyed by details she found unrealistic (\u201cWhy do 10th graders have so many tattoos?\u201d) and the lack of context for the plight of its protagonist. \u201cIt was about misplaced blame,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was not much in it about the role of depression and mental illness.\u201dBut to build a sizable Instagram following, Ms. Urick must attract adolescents. As she put it: \u201cThere are a huge number of slime accounts there, and the majority of people who seem interested in slime seem younger.\u201dShe included in the caption to her \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d-related video a suicide-prevention link: \u201cIf you or someone you know is in danger, please visit www.13reasonswhy.info to find out more.\u201dOne impassioned online detractor of the show is Joshua Christmas, an 18-year-old high school junior in San Antonio. Given the issues at the heart of \u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d he found the response, including Mr. Sanchez\u2019s promposal, to be inappropriately lighthearted.\u201cI doubt they had ill intentions,\u201d Mr. Christmas said of the promposaler, \u201cbut suicide is a really serious subject and it doesn\u2019t get talked about in a productive light and this doesn\u2019t help the conversation.\u201dHe added that he himself hadn\u2019t watched the show or read the novel on which it is based, but he has read the character analyses and other discussions on his peers\u2019 Instagram and Twitter feeds.The show is also a big topic among parents. Robyn Seiferheld, 44, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said she first heard about it via a group-text message sent by the mother of a girl who studies dance with Ms. Seiferheld\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Zoe. The mothers were grappling with whether \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d was appropriate for their kids.\u201cI had never heard of it, so I assumed Zoe hadn\u2019t seen it,\u201d Ms. Seiferheld said. \u201cI asked her when she got home from school, and she said: \u2018Mom, I\u2019m almost done with the whole series. All my friends watch it, too.\u2019 It just goes to show you how much they do behind our backs.\u201dMs. Seiferheld watched it herself so that she could discuss it with her daughter. As an adult who still thinks about a cousin who killed herself when they were both young, Ms. Seiferheld considers the show \u201cvery well done,\u201d she said, though too graphic for the young people who are attracted to it.\u201cSome of it, I\u2019m worried, is glamorizing of suicide, but if Zoe is talking to me about it, it makes me feel better,\u201d said Ms. Seiferheld, who recounted that her daughter sobbed her eyes out after watching the sad and shocking final episode.Zoe said she was glad her mother saw the show.\u201cI like talking about it with her,\u201d she said. \u201cMostly, we talk about the bullying and how some of the characters are really mean for not good reasons or no reason at all, and I don\u2019t understand why. My mom said you have to be careful what you say, because saying one thing you don\u2019t think is a big deal could have big impact on someone\u2019s life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Because I know exactly what I would do if I were you: I would take my father aside and explain that failing to protect innocent children\u2019s rights to use the bathroom of their choice is wrong and unfair and un-American.\u201dAt gay and transgender benefits around town, Ms. Rose arrived in her Isabel Marant trousers and the Row blazers, and was greeted almost like a folk hero \u2014 a Jessica Chastain look-alike who had spoken truth to power and put her social position at risk on behalf of a cause that needs powerful allies.Darting around Lower Manhattan, Ms. Rose was amiable and self-deprecating about what she has been through. At a benefit for the Family Equality Council, one of the hosts began talking about how miraculous having children is. \u201cExcept when they\u2019re unbelievably annoying,\u201d Ms. Rose interjected.She noted that what is most remarkable about her family is how unremarkable they are; that change (or what she calls the \u201creversal of expectations\u201d) is simply the most reliable fact of life.\u201cI don\u2019t understand the tendency to catastrophize,\u201d she said. \u201cI see it and the only conclusion I draw is that it produces adrenaline. It makes people excited.\u201dFriends marvel at what they view to be her bravery, as she proudly and unapologetically offered her unconditional love and support to Sadie. The sight of that child, happy and free, is pretty good evidence Ms. Rose has done something right.Even for Ms. Rose \u2014 a person with wealth and privilege \u2014 there are relatives who have not always been comfortable with the choices she made. Not to mention people on the right, who are excoriating her for what they believe is the ultimate act of indulgence.Then, questions remain about how she will balance the public demands of being an activist with the private responsibilities of being a parent.How does she talk honestly about her child without opening her up to danger, and without making her into a representative she is not yet ready to be?Ms. Rose also has ambitions and desires of her own. Those can sometimes be hard to separate from the brand of activism she has chosen to pursue. She is, after all, a person who proudly calls herself \u201cthe second cousin twice removed of a drag queen\u201d \u2014 a woman who requires no orchestra to break into song. And that comes with attendant complications too.\u201cTechnicolor,\u201d she corrects.Of course, in real life, Ms. Rose did not grow up in Queens but on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.Her father, Elihu, is a real estate scion and retired professor of military history at New York University who serves as the chairman of the Park Avenue Armory.His family manages rental buildings all over Manhattan as well as in Queens, and much of their fortune has gone back to local cultural organizations such as the New York Public Library, Carnegie Hall, the Museum of Natural History and Lincoln Center, all of which have areas named after them.Even at Central Synagogue \u2014 the congregation frequented by prominent families like the Lauders and Tisches \u2014 they loomed large, from the checks they wrote, to their black-tie seders.As parents to Isabel, Mr. Rose and his wife, Susan, were determined to be completely supportive. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is with all of our children,\u201d Susan said in a phone interview this week. \u201cThere was never any other way.\u201dStill, there was no question, that Isabel \u2014 despite her diplomas from Yale (summa cum laude) and Bennington (master\u2019s degree in writing) \u2014 was an unusual family member.Roses, apparently, are quiet.\u201cWe don\u2019t like publicness,\u201d Susan said.In 1998, Ms. Rose married an investment banker at the Plaza, then split with him a year after their daughter, Lily Ezrow, was born.In a case of art imitating life, much of this struggle informed \u201cAnything but Love,\u201d in which the showgirl heroine leaves a flush financial type at the altar and runs off with her lowly accompanist.Guess who?In 2008, Ms. Rose connected with Jeffrey Fagen, a tattooed Penn graduate who spent years trying to be Robert Smith and now runs a clothing company called Panda Diplomacy.First came a chat on JDate, in which Mr. Fagen recalled spotting her years before at the Williamstown Theater Festival. After that were drinks at Art Bar in the West Village.On the fourth date, he asked her to marry him.She got pregnant and said yes, trading the Plaza for the Park in West Chelsea, where she and Mr. Fagen performed a rendition of the \u201cGrease\u201d anthem \u201cWe Go Together\u201d and were united in holy matrimony by Rabbi Angela Warnick Buchdahl of Central Synagogue, whom Mr. Fagen affectionately describes as the \u201conly Korean woman rabbi in the world.\u201dAfter the ceremony, Ms. Rose practically went into palpitations as a \u201csenior member\u201d of her clan said he was getting up to go to the bathroom, and she realized he was about to unzip at a urinal shaped like a male appendage.\u201cIt was just like, \u2018Nooooooooo,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Rose, reaching her arm out, like a movie character in slow motion.As fervent gay rights activists, Ms. Rose and Mr. Fagen joked to friends that evening that they were going to raise their baby gay but would \u201clove him all just the same\u201d if he turned out straight.\u201cWhat we weren\u2019t predicting was door No. 3,\u201d Mr. Fagen said.It wasn\u2019t just that their son, Samuel, wanted to play mermaids at age 2, which led Ms. Rose online to numerous articles that described this as a typical predictor of \u201cgender dysphoria,\u201d the mental state typically used to describe pre-transitioners.It was also Samuel\u2019s refusal to smile for photographs with Lily and the violent tantrums that transpired while getting suited up for a relative\u2019s bar mitzvah.\u201cI\u2019m a girl, Mommy,\u201d Ms. Rose recalled being told, over and over.Friends didn\u2019t really know at first what the exact nature of the problem was. They simply saw a child, according to Mr. Fagen\u2019s close friend Mitch Epner, who was \u201ctotally withdrawn.\u201dWhen Ms. Rose began to express the belief that Samuel might be transgender, friends doubted her. (More than a few also wondered privately: Why does the dramatic stuff always happen to her? \u201cIsn\u2019t that the question,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d)Even Mr. Fagen did a certain amount of blaming his wife, which she found surprising given that he was, as she described it, \u201ca rocker with a master\u2019s degree in poetry.\u201d\u201cAll I can tell you is that I went through all the permutations people go through,\u201d he said.So Ms. Rose took the good-cop role, becoming the confidante her husband wasn\u2019t ready to be.On vacation in Palm Beach, Fla., she took Samuel, then around 4, to the Lilly Pulitzer shop and watched with curiosity as pink poplin turned a depressed child turn into a happy nymph. Back in New York, they watched David Bowie videos and went to the set of Ms. Rose\u2019s video, where the first introductions to drag queens like Hedda Lettuce were made.Ms. Rose hoped to show her son there were many ways one could be a boy, from wearing metallic face paint to putting on green wigs and high heels.Unfortunately, this didn\u2019t really work with Samuel, who was alarmed by Ms. Rose\u2019s compatriots and utterly uninterested in Bowie. Nor did it assuage the concerns of friends and relatives who argued at the time that Ms. Rose was \u201cindulging\u201d her child and pushing ever closer to the great trans abyss.Throughout, Ms. Rose waded through confusing studies and heard troubling statistics about trans people attempting suicide. Attending another bar mitzvah, in Huntington, N.Y., in March 2014, the concern became more immediate.Before the reception, the family was in their hotel room and Ms. Rose went to take a nap. When she woke up, Samuel was in front of the mirror crying and Mr. Fagen was on his knee, asking what was wrong.The response: \u201cI want to burn my face off.\u201d\u201cUntil that moment, I never really understood the profound discomfort,\u201d Mr. Fagen said. \u201cHow does any child that young learn to hate themselves so much? After that it was, whatever it takes.\u201dThe first person they were going to have to come out to was Ms. Rose\u2019s eldest daughter, Lily, who was then 12 and had been somewhat in the dark about all of this.But thanks to an iPhone and the miracles of family sharing plans, she learned the extent of their dilemma without even being told.\u201cMy mom and I have the same photo stream,\u201d Lily, now 15, said one day after school a few weeks ago, while seated across from Ms. Rose in the den of the family\u2019s 5,000-square-foot sun-drenched apartment underneath a giant Marilyn Minter portrait of a high heel. \u201cI was going through the pictures and I saw some of my clothes, but it wasn\u2019t me. So I was a little confused.\u201dMaybe angry too.\u201cI was in middle school,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to be normal and fit in. So I had to take a step back and say, you know what, this is not about me.\u201dOne early concern for Ms. Rose and Mr. Fagen was how to embrace their child\u2019s transition and not have her become a Real Housewife in miniature.When the girl formerly known as Samuel suggested that the new name be Jasmine, a line was drawn.At this point, Mr. Fagen was arguing that if parents get to name their son at birth, they ought also to be able to pick the second one five years later when she emerges as their transgender daughter. Then his child approached with the name Sadie, and Ms. Rose was able to broker a peace offering.As Sadie\u2019s hair grew out, Ms. Rose felt it was time to clear things up quickly and definitively.First, she placed a photo on Facebook of Sadie attending her first ballet class and allowed people to talk among themselves. Then, she took her daughter to Central Synagogue, where Rabbi Buchdahl announced that the two were coming up to the bimah to sing.As Ms. Rose saw it, this was a good way to say: \u201cYes. Done.\u201d But it also was embraced by the synagogue\u2019s leadership, who thought standing behind the family sent a powerful message about what religious institutions can be.\u201cI don\u2019t want the religious right to be able to speak for God with a monolithic voice,\u201d Rabbi Buchdahl said. \u201cI understand that there will be interpretations of certain sacred texts that make this challenging for some people to accept, but I think it\u2019s important that we interpret the revelations with the moral compass of our day. And my understanding of our sacred texts is of a God who loves children, in all the ways they are made.\u201dSometimes, people ask whether Sadie\u2019s \u201ctransitioning\u201d means she has already begun surgery or taking hormones.Mr. Fagen patiently explains that those issues are years away, and that for now what has changed are \u201cwardrobe and pronouns.\u201dGiven the confidence Ms. Rose showed at temple and on Facebook, perhaps the letter she published on Medium shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise.But it did to Susan and Elihu Rose.\u201cWell, that was crazy,\u201d Susan said, chuckling. \u201cEli and I were down in D.C. We came home from the Smithsonian museum of African-American history, we were totally pooped, and I said: \u2018My God. Look at this amazing letter.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know Isabel was writing it. I didn\u2019t know anything about it. Then Eli said, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 and he mentioned that he knew someone who knew Ivanka and maybe they could pass it to her. The next morning I sent it out to friends, especially friends with marginalized children who might be gay or transgender. I think it\u2019s just an inspiration.\u201dLily had a more complicated reaction. She asked her mother if she realized she had outed Sadie.While the administration at Sadie\u2019s elementary school accepted her last year with the awareness that she is transgender, there hasn\u2019t been an explicit conversation with members of her class.Mr. Fagen, asked whether he worries about his wife\u2019s openness with the world, and all the publicity about their daughter, said: \u201cAbsolutely. Every day.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you sometimes have to tie my string to the chair,\u201d Ms. Rose said.Which was keenly self-aware, though it doesn\u2019t really answer the question of what might happen should Sadie decide as an adult that she wants her medical history to be private. How will she feel about what is for the world a mere Google search away?Alternatively, if she decides she does want to talk about it publicly, will she feel the power of her story has been blunted by all of the adults who saw fit to tell it before she could?But that\u2019s later.For now, Sadie is merely a second-grade girl who loves science, likes math, thinks English is O.K. and hates history. She wants her mother to come home earlier, she wants her dog to sit still and let her pull its tail, and she wants to appear in the family photo with everyone this afternoon.And that didn\u2019t used to be the case.Also, a cupcake would be nice. From Billy\u2019s.An article last Sunday about the New York real estate heiress Isabel Rose and her daughter\u2019s gender transition misidentified the university that Ms. Rose\u2019s husband, Jeffrey Fagen, attended. It is the University of Pennsylvania, not Dartmouth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Become a Disciple of Duck Wings", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byWith chicken, I covet the wings. With duck, not really; they tend to be sinewy and dry, without chicken\u2019s succulence \u2014 or so I thought.The fried wings from that first encounter a little over two years ago, made by the chef Justin Smillie, combined crisp skin, rich meat and gamy flavor emboldened by Asian seasonings.All of this makes for satisfying eating, especially as a bar snack with a cocktail or a first course. But what about preparing them at home? \u201cThey\u2019re fun things, a quick nosh and great for parties,\u201d Mr. Smillie said.I can buy all the chicken wings I want. Duck wings are a different story; even Chinatown butcher shops, where duck is easy to find, tend not to have them readily available. They are sold online, though, and at $3 to $4 a pound (around three wings, depending on the size), they will not break the bank.So I asked Mr. Smillie to share his technique. It\u2019s a three-step project, mostly unattended.First, you cure the wings (having defrosted them if they were frozen) with a generous rub of salt, some sugar and spices. Mr. Smillie uses coriander, Aleppo pepper, fennel seeds and granulated garlic; I opted for Chinese five-spice with salt and sugar.Leave them in the refrigerator for 24 to 36 hours. Then rinse and dry them and give them the confit treatment. Mr. Smillie poaches them in duck fat for three hours. I accomplished much the same by arranging them in a single layer in a large roasting pan, covering the pan with foil, and letting them bake at 225 degrees for three hours.I then removed them from the pan and refrigerated them, first draining all excess fat back into the pan. I strained the fat and refrigerated it for future use, like frying potatoes. While the wings were still warm, I peeled off and discarded the skin, which can be rubbery when you fry or grill them at home.At this point, they are ready for the final treatment. Or, as Mr. Smillie suggested, they can be set aside in the refrigerator or freezer to finish cooking and serve later.\u201cThey hold up to various cooking techniques,\u201d he said. \u201cI fry them, but I\u2019ve also done them on the grill and hot-roasted them.\u201dI tried frying and, now on the cusp of the outdoor season, grilling. For effective frying, you really need a professional flash fryer. When I fried them in an inch of hot duck fat, the wings were not as crisp as in restaurants.Without a doubt, the home cook\u2019s route to success is swabbing them with a tangy barbecue marinade and searing them on the grill.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Technology Has Failed to Improve Your Airline Experience", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut I come to you as a technology columnist to tell you that technology, too, has failed you.People in Silicon Valley pride themselves on their capacity to upend entrenched industries. Uber defeated taxi cartels. Airbnb made getting a room cheaper and more accessible. Streaming services are undoing the cable business. Yet the airline industry has not just stubbornly resisted innovation to improve customer service \u2014 in many ways, technology has only fueled the industry\u2019s race to the bottom.Travel search engines rank airlines based on price rather than friendliness or quality of service. Online check-in, airport kiosks and apps allow airlines to serve customers with fewer and fewer workers. What we are witnessing is the basest, ugliest form of tech-abetted, bottom-seeking capitalism \u2014 one concerned with prices and profits above all else, with little regard for quality of service, for friendliness, or even for the dignity of customers.\u201cThe airline industry has been on a steady downward trajectory when it comes to customer service for nearly 40 years,\u201d said Henry H. Harteveldt, the president of the Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry research firm. He noted that American carriers were improving on some metrics \u2014 on-time service is up, baggage loss is down and prices keep getting better.\u201cConsumers have shown that they\u2019re willing to put up with an awful lot, including lack of legroom, lack of amenities, mediocre or worse customer service, dirty airplanes and more to save money,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. \u201cAnd the airline industry has evolved to meet that desire\u201d for cheap fares.Part of the problem is how we buy tickets today. The whole system is mercilessly transactional. When you search online, you look for price and travel times, and perhaps you consider some airline loyalty program. Customer service \u2014 that is, how the airline treats you \u2014 isn\u2019t often part of the transaction.As a result, airlines have little incentive to reform themselves.\u201cAirline executives will tell you they don\u2019t view themselves as being service companies,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. \u201cThey want Wall Street to view them as industrial companies, and they want consumers to view them as transportation providers. Customer service is just not what the airlines are about.\u201dCan technology improve how airlines work? Some people have ideas for how that may happen.Emirates and Singapore Airlines are rated the best in the world; two American airlines, JetBlue and Alaska, made TripAdvisor\u2019s Top 10 list. But Delta was the only major American airline to receive TripAdvisor\u2019s seal of approval. United and American Airlines did not meet the site\u2019s minimum threshold, though Bryan Saltzburg, senior vice president for TripAdvisor\u2019s global flight business, said that the two had been improving.One can imagine how such reviews could prompt improvements in airlines. If instead of just price, travel search engines included prominent warnings from reviewers \u2014 \u201cThis airline might give you a bloody lip while kicking you from your seat, 1-star!\u201d \u2014 that could alter travelers\u2019 calculations in booking.\u201cThat would be a good idea \u2014 a filter on travel search that says, \u2018Click this filter and it might cost you a few dollars more, but we\u2019ll bias you towards airlines that treat their customers well,\u2019 \u201d said Paul English, the co-founder of the travel search company Kayak who now runs another travel start-up, Lola.That is small potatoes, though. A bigger disruption would come from altering how we pay for airfares. In the same way that Netflix changed the DVD business by charging a monthly fee, some consultants argue that a membership fee could radically improve flying.\u201cWe\u2019ve prototyped a subscription airline in the past, and it basically gets the airline out of the business of reducing service for offering the lowest fares,\u201d said Devin Liddell, the principal brand strategist for Teague, a design firm that works with Boeing and other transportation companies.You might wonder why an airline would dare try such a thing. After all, airlines are doing well; profits are up across the globe, despite your annoyance about flying.But Mr. Liddell warned of long-term competition from other kinds of transportation. If self-driving cars make driving easier and more comfortable, midrange flights would face competition. Counting the time it takes to clear airport security and get to and from the airport, it takes just as long to drive between some places \u2014 Los Angeles to San Francisco, say \u2014 as to fly. If self-driving technology makes driving much more comfortable, too, lots of people might abandon planes for cars, Mr. Liddell said.For now, though, none of that hurts the commercial air business. Airlines are safe from self-driving cars and the Hyperloop. They are content to feed you ever-worse service for lower prices, because that is what the web wants.Your only technological hope for better service is your smartphone camera and the viral push of social networks. If you are violently kicked off your flight, at least your fellow passengers will post a video to Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Glenn O\u2019Brien\u2019s Friends Remember a \u2018Successful Maniac\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byOral HistoryHere, some of those who knew him well share their memories:Glenn arrived at the Factory after Andy was shot and it had moved to Union Square. Let me say this: It was different. It wasn\u2019t funky and the world wasn\u2019t funky. And here came the new generation. And there was Glenn. He looked like this perfect Catholic young gentleman. And if he was the spearhead of the new generation to inherit this culture, there was this sense that it would be O.K.He was going to move to Mott Street. He and his girlfriend didn\u2019t have a credit card, so he asked me if I could rent them a car to move their stuff. And I did it, no problem. Later, I\u2019m asleep, and a police officer calls me, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve impounded your car.\u201d It turned out that Glenn and Jean-Michel had gone up to Harlem in this van to buy drugs and they got stopped. The cops stopped them and then they couldn\u2019t prove why they had this car. I had him arrested. I also sued him in small claims court. And our friendship was never dented.We had this crazy, endless day, around 1982. We were smoking pot in the car and it was all good. It was still early in the day, and we were in the East Village, so we decided to cop some drugs. I went to the A.T.M. machine and went further east into Alphabet City, and of course I got mugged and they took all my money.Sire Records had moved uptown to a high-rise since they\u2019d discovered Talking Heads and the Ramones. Since I had friends there, I would get records. Went up the elevator, came down with a stack of records, went back downtown to Sounds records. Sold all these brand-new records. Got more money. Went over to Alphabet City. Successfully got our drugs. Mission accomplished. Later that night he was spinning records upstairs at the Mudd Club.I remember he was doing stand-up comedy. It might have been at Tramps, and Keith Richards was there with his wife and this actress, Lois Chiles. She was on \u201cDallas,\u201d and Glenn had this big crush on her. He\u2019s doing his routine and he stops the show to yell at Keith Richards: \u201cHey! Keep it down, up front.\u201d I thought that was funny \u2014 to look dead in the eye of Keith Richards and tell him to keep it down.He went on a vacation with Bryan Ferry and I think the art dealer Paul Kasmin. They\u2019d all rented a house in Provence, or maybe Cap d\u2019Antibes, somewhere glamorous. It was a jolly bunch except for Bryan Ferry, who just sat in a lawn chair and was reading P. G. Wodehouse books and chuckling to himself. This irritated Glenn so much that he just went over and took the book out of Bryan\u2019s hands and threw it over the sea wall. Which really irritated Bryan Ferry, who didn\u2019t think it was funny at all. I said to him, \u201cYou actually did that?\u201d He said: \u201cYeah, it was so annoying. We\u2019re all trying to have some fun and then there\u2019s Bryan Ferry chuckling to himself.\u201dGlenn was smart and honest and didn\u2019t care if people didn\u2019t like what he had to say. He spoke the truth.One day in the mid-2000s, Glenn and I were sitting in a conference room at GQ, going over a feature he had written. It was December, the thick of holiday-party season, and Glenn had been out the past three nights and was talking about what he had on tap that evening and the next. I asked, How could a 60-year-old guy have that kind of stamina? He looked at me, almost incredulously, and said, \u201cAdam, it\u2019s my job.\u201d I had never thought of it like that. Glenn could be effortlessly charming and elegant. But in reality, Glenn was a hustler, one of the hardest working guys in the biz. He woke up every single morning, on what I imagine were really nice sheets, and punched the clock.The year we relaunched Interview, 2008, was a notoriously difficult year for magazines. But Glenn made it feel that we were starting out on a gorgeous dawn. Whenever the subject arose of why a certain celebrity would want to appear on the cover or why a certain brand would want to advertise, Glenn would respond with a deeply bewildered expression, as if the questioner were on heavy pills. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d he\u2019d answer, as if it were self-evident. Glenn had a trait known to geniuses: the confidence to assume that whatever he spent his time working on was the best and baddest thing going down. Unless some of those brands or celebrities made demands we couldn\u2019t fulfill. Then he would say, \u201cTell them we\u2019re just a little hippie magazine doing what we can to get by.\u201dHe could be prickly. Maybe a year ago, he called me up and said, \u201cLet\u2019s meet for breakfast.\u201d We made a plan to meet at the Smile, which is across the street from his house. For some reason, I got there 10 minutes late. I walked in and said, \u201cGlenn, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d And he said, \u201cUh huh.\u201d He just froze me out. He said, \u201cI could have slept an extra 10 minutes.\u201d I said: \u201cGlenn, you literally rolled out of bed. You literally have your slippers on.\u201d And he says, \u201cUh huh,\u201d and he starts moving things around the table. And I asked, \u201cAre we really doing this?\u201d He said: \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I think that was like the father in him, where he\u2019d never be afraid to take you on. He had this way of tapping into my own lost father thing. He stepped into that role and scared the hell out of me. Like, \u201cDad\u2019s mad at me.\u201d At the same time he was a kindly priest for all of us. And someone who could draw your confessions from you.\u201cA man is a successful maniac\u201d is one of Glenn\u2019s many pearls of wisdom. He also taught me that what I\u2019ve been doing all my life was as much sympathetic magic as it is sculpture. On his deathbed, he quoted the third law of thermodynamics, which was about stasis and the stopping of entropy in a perfect crystal as the temperatures approach absolute zero. Somehow, even coming to terms with what was going on with his own life ending, he confirmed for me with authority that art is about writing your own rules.I am hapless when it comes to dressing myself. I have no talent for it. Blue suit and a white shirt. So when I got a call from Glenn to come over early one night before a dinner party \u2014 he had been losing weight and he had some pants he thought would fit me better than they fit him \u2014 I was thrilled at an offer of pants from the Style Guy. He brought me three bags of pants and shorts from one of his favorite shops, Supreme, that indeed all fit me well. I told him to hold on to them in case he put the weight back on, but he refused. He was telling me two things, but only one was on the page and I would only let that one register: Wear better pants.I will miss his wonderful wit and way with words.

{"Headline": "Why You Should Read Books You Hate", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byOpinionHere\u2019s a reading challenge: Pick up a book you\u2019re pretty sure you won\u2019t like \u2014 the style is wrong, the taste not your own, the author bio unappealing. You might even take it one step further. Pick up a book you think you will hate, of a genre you\u2019ve dismissed since high school, written by an author you\u2019re inclined to avoid. Now read it to the last bitter page.Sound like hell? You\u2019re off to a good start.This is not about reading a book you know is bad, a pleasure in its own right, like an exceptionally dashing villain. It\u2019s about finding a book that affronts you, and staring it down to the last word.At a time when people are siloed into narrow sources of information according to their particular tinted worldview \u2014 those they follow on Twitter, the evening shoutfest they choose, AM talk radio or NPR \u2014 it\u2019s no surprise most of us also read books we\u2019re inclined to favor. Reading is a pleasure and a time-consuming one. Why bother reading something you dislike?But reading what you hate helps you refine what it is you value, whether it\u2019s a style, a story line or an argument. Because books are long-form, they require more of the writer and the reader than a talk show or Facebook link. You can finish watching a movie in two hours and forget about it; not so a novel. Sticking it out for 300 pages means immersing yourself in another person\u2019s world and discovering how it feels. That\u2019s part of what makes books you despise so hard to dismiss. Rather than toss the book aside, turn to the next page and wrestle with its ideas. What about them makes you so uncomfortable?My taste for hate reading began with \u201cThe Fountainhead,\u201d which I opened in a state of complete ignorance as bonus material for a college class on 20th-century architecture. I knew nothing of Ayn Rand or of objectivism. I thought it was a book about building things. I even showed it off to a French friend, an architect and a die-hard socialist, thinking he\u2019d be impressed.\u201cHow could you bring that into our house?\u201d he asked in disgust. \u201cBut it\u2019s about architecture,\u201d I replied weakly. Or was it? Within pages, I found myself suffering at the hands of its tyrannical egomaniac of a protagonist, Howard Roark, forever plunging a fist into soil and holding forth. The lead female character, Dominique, who naturally took second place to the godlike Roark, kept striding across rooms in long, column-like gowns.Still, I persisted. A hundred pages later, I was more of a French socialist than I\u2019d ever been before or since. I finished every wretched page of \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d in alternating states of fury and despair, and when it was finally over, I tried to leave the vague echo of Dominique, stomping around in her evening gowns, behind. What stuck was the abiding knowledge that I was not, nor would I ever be, a libertarian.In earlier, blithe days, I\u2019d simply allowed the contents of books to gather agreeably in my head as I read and then file out when I was done. Either I enjoyed a book or I didn\u2019t. It was only by burrowing through books that I hated, books that provoked feelings of outrage and indignation, that I truly learned how to read. Defensiveness makes you a better reader, a closer, more skeptical reader: a critic. Arguing with the author in your head forces you to gather opposing evidence. You may find yourself turning to other texts with determination, stowing away facts, fighting against the book at hand. You may find yourself developing a point of view.As debaters know, sometimes you figure out your position only in opposition. All it takes is for me to read a book by Howard Zinn or Paul Johnson, each gleefully hate-worthy in its own polarizing way, to locate my own interpretation of history. This is what\u2019s so invigorating about hate-reading. To actively grapple with your assumptions and defend your conclusions gives you a sense of purpose. You come to know where you stand, even if that means standing apart.I\u2019ve hated my way through many books, thinking, I will read you no matter how hard you make it. But as I go on, I often find that loathing is mixed with other emotions \u2014 fear, perverse attraction, even complicated strains of sympathy. This is, in part, what makes negative book reviews so compelling.One of the most scathing reviews I\u2019ve ever written was for this newspaper as a freelancer. The book I\u2019d been assigned was a parenting book. I wanted to like the book. I agreed with much of the book. But the authors were too credulous of certain research, and in ways that served their thesis. As I put it in the review, the authors\u2019 \u201cpenchant for describing psychological studies and research projects as if they were chemistry experiments, with phrases like \u2018the test of scientific analysis\u2019 and \u2018the science of peer relations,\u2019 conjure up the image of Thomas Dolby repeatedly exhorting \u2018Science!\u2019 \u201dIt came across as manipulative, and I felt betrayed both personally (I had written a parenting book and bristled at seeing the genre compromised) and on behalf of readers who might not have the background to parse the data. New parents are a susceptible lot \u2014 I know because I used to be one.It can be interesting, and instructive, when a book provokes animosity. It may tell you more about a subject or about yourself, as a reader, than you think you know. It might even, on occasion, challenge you to change your mind.Of course, many hateful books simply clarify and confirm. I can tell you straight out what I loathed about the novel \u201cFlashman,\u201d by George MacDonald Fraser, though I read it nearly 15 years ago. \u201cFlashman\u201d is a cult novel, which didn\u2019t bode well for me when I picked it up at the suggestion of a new boyfriend. For whatever reason, when it comes to cult fiction, I am never part of the cult. Beloved in the same way Wodehouse is beloved but by fewer people, \u201cFlashman,\u201d published in 1969, is the first in a series whose subsequent titles each felt like a slap in the face (e.g., \u201cFlashman and the Redskins,\u201d \u201cFlashman\u2019s Lady\u201d). The cover of \u201cFlashman, Volume I\u201d featured a swaggering bloke in uniform with a bare-breasted maiden of \u201cexotic\u201d background, in, of course, the background. Sometimes you can tell a book by its cover.But I went in anyway. There, I met the title character, Harry Paget Flashman, who romps across the British Empire, landing variously in Scotland, India and Afghanistan. Accompanying him are minor figures from British history \u2014 Lord Auckland, governor-general of India; Thomas Arnold, headmaster at the Rugby School; and the like. But the main action concerns Flashman, a light dragoon and a womanizing drunkard who skips from duel to romp to \u201cforceful seduction.\u201d Most of the time, he frequents prostitutes, but he also enjoys raping an Afghan dancing girl. I have nothing against a good antihero, but I didn\u2019t even enjoy hating this guy. I just wanted to get away from him. Also, it turned out, I wanted to get away from the boyfriend who\u2019d recommended him. This was a perfectly useful takeaway.Yet hate reading can actually bring readers together. Sure, it\u2019s nice when people like the books you like. But an even more stimulating excitement comes from finding someone else who hates the same book as much as you do (welcome, fellow \u201cPickwick Papers\u201d loathers). This is why book critics love commiserating. Some of the most spirited discussions I\u2019ve had with other readers have been over just how despicable or disheartening we\u2019ve found something we\u2019ve read.So go ahead, bond over what you hate. Or hate it all on your own, knowing that someone, somewhere wants to throw that same miserable book against the wall. Just please finish reading it before you do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Leave a Mark on People", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byJoe Toscano and I worked at Incarnation summer camp in Connecticut a few decades ago. Joe went on to become an extremely loving father of five and a fireman in Watertown, Mass. Joe was a community-building guy \u2014 serving his town, organizing events like fishing derbies for bevies of kids, radiating infectious and neighborly joy.Joe collapsed and died while fighting a two-alarm fire last month. When Joe died, the Incarnation community reached out with a fierce urgency to support his family and each other. One of our number served as a eulogist at the funeral. Everybody started posting old photos of Joe on Facebook. Somebody posted a picture of 250 Incarnation alumni at a reunion, with the caption, \u201cMy Family.\u201dSome organizations are thick, and some are thin. Some leave a mark on you, and some you pass through with scarcely a memory. I haven\u2019t worked at Incarnation for 30 years, but it remains one of the four or five thick institutions in my life, and in so many other lives.Which raises two questions: What makes an institution thick? If you were setting out consciously to create a thick institution, what features would it include?A thick institution is not one that people use instrumentally, to get a degree or to earn a salary. A thick institution becomes part of a person\u2019s identity and engages the whole person: head, hands, heart and soul. So thick institutions have a physical location, often cramped, where members meet face to face on a regular basis, like a dinner table or a packed gym or assembly hall.Such institutions have a set of collective rituals \u2014 fasting or reciting or standing in formation. They have shared tasks, which often involve members closely watching one another, the way hockey teammates have to observe everybody else on the ice. In such institutions people occasionally sleep overnight in the same retreat center or facility, so that everybody can see each other\u2019s real self, before makeup and after dinner.Such organizations often tell and retell a sacred origin story about themselves. Many experienced a moment when they nearly failed, and they celebrate the heroes who pulled them from the brink. They incorporate music into daily life, because it is hard not to become bonded with someone you have sung and danced with. They have a common ideal \u2014 encapsulated, for example, in the Semper Fi motto for the Marines.It\u2019s also important to have an idiosyncratic local culture. Too many colleges, for example, feel like one another. But the ones that really leave a mark on their students (St. John\u2019s, Morehouse, Wheaton, the University of Chicago) have the courage to be distinct. You can love or hate such places. But when you meet a graduate you know it, and when they meet each other, even decades hence, they know they have something important in common.As I was thinking about my list of traits, Angela Duckworth of the University of Pennsylvania shared with me a similar list, titled, \u201cWhat causes individuals to adopt the identity of their microculture?\u201d She had a lot of my items but more, such as a shared goal, like winning the Super Bowl or saving the environment; initiation rituals, especially those that are difficult; a sacred guidebook or object passed down from generation to generation; distinct jargon and phrases that are spoken inside the culture but misunderstood outside it; a label, like being a KIPPster for a KIPP school student; and finally uniforms or other emblems, such as flags, rings, bracelets or even secret underwear.Thick institutions have a different moral ecology. People tend to like the version of themselves that is called forth by such places. James Davison Hunter and Ryan Olson of the University of Virginia study thick and thin moral frameworks. They point to the fact that thin organizations look to take advantage of people\u2019s strengths and treat people as resources to be marshaled. Thick organizations think in terms of virtue and vice. They take advantage of people\u2019s desire to do good and arouse their higher longings.In other words, thin institutions tend to see themselves horizontally. People are members for mutual benefit. Thick organizations often see themselves on a vertical axis. People are members so they can collectively serve the same higher good.In the former, there\u2019s an ever-present utilitarian calculus \u2014 Is this working for me? Am I getting more out than I\u2019m putting in? \u2014 that creates a distance between people and the organization. In the latter, there\u2019s an intimacy and identity borne out of common love. Think of a bunch of teachers watching a student shine onstage or a bunch of engineers adoring the same elegant solution.I never got to see Joey T. fight a fire. But I watched him run a bunch of the camp reunion fishing derbies. If you\u2019d asked him, are you doing this for the kids or for yourself, I\u2019m not sure the question would have made sense. In a thick organization selfishness and selflessness marry. It fulfills your purpose to help others have a good day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Single Most Important Ingredient", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byI never added it to food, or saw Maman add it. When my aunt Ziba sprinkled it onto her saffron rice at the table each night, my brothers and I giggled. We thought it was the strangest, funniest thing in the world.I associated salt with the beach, where I spent my childhood seasoned with it. There were the endless hours in the Pacific near our home in San Diego, swallowing mouthfuls of ocean water when I misjudged the waves. Tidepooling at twilight, my friends and I often fell victim to the saltwater spray while we poked at anemones.Maman kept our swimsuits in the back of our blue Volvo station wagon, because the beach was always where we wanted to be. She was deft with the umbrella and blankets, setting them up while she shooed the three of us into the sea. We would stay in the water until we were starving, scanning the beach for the sun-faded coral-and-white umbrella, the landmark that would lead us back to her.She always knew exactly what would taste best when we emerged: Persian cucumbers topped with sheep\u2019s milk feta cheese, rolled together in lavash bread. We chased the sandwiches with handfuls of ice-cold grapes or wedges of watermelon to quench our thirst.It was there that Chris Lee, a chef who took me under his wing, suggested I pay attention to the language the chefs used in the kitchen, how they knew when something was right \u2014 these were clues for how to become a better cook. Most often, when a dish fell flat, the answer lay in adjusting the salt. Sometimes it was in the form of salt crystals, but other times it meant a grating of cheese, some pounded anchovies, a few olives or a sprinkling of capers. I began to see that there was no better guide in the kitchen than thoughtful tasting, and that nothing was more important to taste thoughtfully for than salt.One day, as a young cook in the prep kitchen, I was tasked with cooking polenta. Milled from an heirloom variety of corn, the polenta at Chez Panisse tasted of sweetness and earth. The chef, Cal Peternell, talked me through the steps for making it, and I began cooking. Consumed by the fear of scorching and ruining the entire pot \u2014 a mistake I had seen other cooks make \u2014 I stirred maniacally.After an hour and a half, I brought Cal a spoonful of the creamy porridge to taste, looking up at him with equal parts respect and terror. \u201cIt needs more salt,\u201d he deadpanned. Dutifully, I returned to the pot and sprinkled in a few grains of salt, treating them with the preciousness I might afford, say, gold leaf. I thought it tasted pretty good, so I returned to him with a spoonful of my adjusted polenta.This time he marched me back to the pot and added not one but three enormous palmfuls of kosher salt. The perfectionist in me was horrified. I\u2019d wanted so badly to do that polenta justice, and the degree to which I\u2019d been off was exponential. Three palmfuls!Cal grabbed spoons and together we tasted. The corn was somehow sweeter, the butter richer. All of the flavors were more pronounced. I had been certain he had ruined the pot and turned my polenta into a salt lick, but the term salty did not apply to what I tasted. All I felt was a satisfying zing with each mouthful.Having experienced the transformative power of salt, I wanted to learn how to get that zing every time I cooked. I thought about the foods I loved to eat growing up \u2014 and that bite of seaside cucumber and feta, in particular. I realized then why it had tasted so good. It was properly salted.James Beard, the father of modern American cookery, once asked, \u201cWhere would we be without salt?\u201d I know the answer: adrift in a sea of blandness. Salt has a greater impact on flavor than any other ingredient. Learn to use it well, and food will taste good.Salt\u2019s relationship to flavor is multidimensional: It has its own particular taste, and it both balances and enhances the flavor of other ingredients. Imagine taking a bite of a rich espresso brownie sprinkled with flaky sea salt. The salt minimizes the espresso\u2019s bitterness, intensifies the flavor of the chocolate and offers a savory contrast to the sugar\u2019s sweetness.Does this mean you should simply use more salt? No. It means use salt better. Add it in the right amount, at the right time, in the right form. A smaller amount of salt applied while cooking will often do more to improve flavor than a larger amount added at the table. Seasoning a buttermilk-marinated chicken the night before you plan to cook it will give salt ample time to diffuse throughout the meat and enhance the flavor of every bite. And unless you have been told by your doctor to limit salt consumption, you can relax about your sodium intake from home-cooked food. In almost every case, anything you cook for yourself is lower in sodium than restaurant food.Though all salt crystals are produced by evaporating water from saltwater brine, the pace of evaporation determines the shape those crystals take. These varying shapes and sizes can make a big difference in your cooking. A tablespoon of fine salt will pack more tightly and can be two or three times \u201csaltier\u201d than a tablespoon of coarser salt.There are three main kinds of salt you will see at the store.Common table salt is small and dense, making it very salty. Unless otherwise noted, iodine has been added to it, which makes everything taste slightly metallic. It also often contains anticaking agents to prevent clumps from forming, or dextrose, a form of sugar, to stabilize the iodine. Though neither of these additives is harmful, there is no reason to put them in your food. If you have only table salt, go get yourself some kosher or sea salt.Inexpensive and forgiving, kosher salt is fantastic for everyday cooking and tastes pure. There are two major producers of kosher salt \u2014 Diamond Crystal and Morton \u2014 and they are vastly different. While Diamond Crystal\u2019s light, hollow flakes readily adhere to foods and crumble easily, Morton\u2019s thin flakes are much denser and almost twice as salty by volume.I didn\u2019t understand the nuances of salting until I began paying attention to the various ways cooks used salt in different situations.There was the way we salted pots of water for blanching vegetables or pasta, adding palmful after palmful, lightly skimming a finger across the rolling boil to taste, and often adding more.Then there was the way we seasoned trays of vegetables, duck legs butchered for confit and focaccia ready for the oven. This was done by lightly grasping the salt in an upturned palm, then letting it shower down with a flowing wag of the wrist. This is the best way to distribute salt evenly and efficiently over a large surface. Practice the wrist wag to get used to the way the salt falls from your hands; experience the illicit thrill of using so much of something we\u2019ve all been taught to fear.Use a pinch when you want to make sure each bite is salted just so: slices of avocado, hard-cooked eggs or tiny caramels. But try to attack a chicken with the pinch and your wrist will give out long before you\u2019re done.From capers to bacon to miso paste to cheese, there are many sources of salt beyond crystals. Working more than one form of salt into a dish is what I call layering salt, and it\u2019s a terrific way to build flavor.Caesar dressing, for example, has several salty ingredients: anchovies, Parmesan, Worcestershire sauce and salt itself. Garlic, which I like to pound with salt into a smooth paste, is a fifth source.First, make a stiff, unsalted mayonnaise by whisking oil into egg yolks. Next, work in initial amounts of anchovies, garlic, grated cheese and Worcestershire. Then add vinegar and lemon. Taste; it will need salt. But does it need more anchovy, cheese, garlic or Worcestershire? If so, add salt in the form of any of those ingredients.

{"Headline": "Putting the Tender in Pork Tenderloin", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetiteWhen it comes to pork, I\u2019ll happily eat the ears. I\u2019ll linger over the liver, fricassee the feet, chomp on the chops. I\u2019d even figure out how to cook the oink if I could get my hands on it.The only cut that has ever left me cold is the tenderloin.But that\u2019s only if you don\u2019t overcook it.The cut contains very little fat, so overcooking can happen in the mere seconds it takes to dig your meat thermometer out of the drawer, turning a potentially juicy piece of pork into something dry and tough.For years I avoided the tenderloin, choosing the fattier options.But at a friend\u2019s suggestion, I recently gave it another go. After all, pork tenderloin is easy to find and fast to cook, making it extremely weeknight friendly. My goal was to come up with a surefire recipe that helps preserve the moisture of the meat.One solution is to stuff the meat with something that will keep its moisture and zip up its inherently mild character. A pungent mix of shallots, capers and herbs accomplishes both.The best way to stuff a pork tenderloin is to butterfly it \u2014 that is, cut it in half lengthwise, but not quite all the way through, keeping the two pieces attached so you can open the cut like a book. This gives you maximum space for stuffing. Then all you have to do is close it up, tying it with some kitchen twine to so the filling doesn\u2019t escape in the pan.A bonus of tying up the meat is that you can form it into an evenly shaped cylinder. Untied, the tenderloin tapers at one end, which means either the thinner side or the thicker side \u2014 but not both \u2014 can be cooked to pink perfection. Tying it solves this problem; simply fold the thinner end up over itself to make the roast thicker, and secure it.And about the word \u201cpink\u201d: You should take your pork off the heat while it\u2019s still a little pink on the inside. An internal temperature of 145 degrees will give you succulent meat that lives up to its name, a tender loin that is flavorful, too.And to Drink ...With this zesty, herbal tenderloin roast, my first choice would be a riesling. While almost any riesling in the range of dry to moderately sweet will go well, this dish also presents an opportunity to drink a really good riesling, like one from a top vineyard in the Wachau region of Austria; a balanced, dry riesling from Alsace or Germany; or, if you don\u2019t fear sweetness, a sp\u00e4tlese riesling from the Mosel or Nahe regions of Germany. Other white options? A chenin blanc from Savenni\u00e8res or Saumur-Champigny would go brilliantly, as would a Chablis or a Sancerre. For a red, I would try something fairly light: a straightforward Valpolicella, a cru Beaujolais or a village Burgundy. ERIC ASIMOVcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Invokes Internet Freedom While Trying to Kill It", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byEditorialHere we go again. The Federal Communications Commission, now led by an anti-regulation ideologue appointed by President Trump, wants to gut the net neutrality rules that keep powerful broadband companies from calling the shots on the internet, at the expense of consumers.Under the cynical guise of \u201crestoring internet freedom,\u201d the new F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, wants to give big telecom companies carte blanche to treat the content of their subsidiaries and partners more favorably than information from other companies \u2014 a practice that AT&T, Comcast and Verizon are already starting to employ. They would also be able to demand fees from companies like Netflix and YouTube to deliver videos and other content to customers.If the commission, which has a 2-to-1 Republican majority, approves Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, there will be little stopping the broadband industry from squelching competition, limiting consumer choice and raising prices. The previous F.C.C. chairman, Tom Wheeler, helped put the rules Mr. Pai is attacking in place in 2015, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld them last year.Large telecommunications companies have been raking in profits in recent years. And they have been making multibillion-dollar acquisitions \u2014 not something you see from an industry that is withering from senseless regulations. Charter spent more than $65 billion last year to buy Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. AT&T bought DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015 and is trying to buy Time Warner, the media company, for $85 billion.Not only is Mr. Pai\u2019s lament for the broadband industry based on alternative facts, it misses the bigger point. Net neutrality is meant to benefit the internet and the economy broadly, not just the broadband industry. That means the commission ought to consider the impact the regulations have on consumers and businesses. In particular, the commission has a responsibility to protect people with few or no choices; most Americans have access to just one or two companies for residential service and just four big operators for wireless.Mr. Pai argues that if the Wheeler rules are revoked, some safeguards will remain. For example, he says, broadband companies would refrain from blocking or slowing the content of competitors. He has not said how he would ensure that. But the F.C.C. is considering using voluntary commitments from the industry.Under that approach, officials at the Federal Trade Commission would have the power to fine or sue companies that make pledges and then fail to uphold them. But it is hard to believe that voluntary standards would be strong enough. It also puts the onus on individuals and small businesses to complain to regulators and request investigations.Big internet businesses like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix will probably be fine under Mr. Pai\u2019s plans, because they are well established and have the money to cut special deals with broadband companies.Smaller firms and start-ups \u2014 some of which may never get started \u2014 will not be as lucky.Ultimately, though, the real losers will be all Americans, because there will be fewer choices and less innovation.Advertisement"}

By the time his shy nephew, Myles Hass, finished high school two decades later, the little company, Erotic Image (\u201cgive the gift that unwraps itself\u201d), was a scorching success \u2014 so much so that Mr. Hass hatched a spinoff plan.Nude dudes.Mr. Hass spotted bachelorette parties as a growing market for male strippers. (Credit \u201cSex and the City.\u201d) And he started to fantasize: What about creating a full-fledged male revue? Competing with the bow-tie-wearing Chippendales or the globe-trotting Thunder From Down Under was too much to dream. But he could probably book Michigan clubs. Detroit. Grand Rapids. Maybe even Kalamazoo.\u201cSomething quality, with real showmanship,\u201d Mr. Hass told me over drinks at the W Hollywood hotel recently. \u201cNot a traveling group of man whores.\u201dHis publicist, seated beside him, shifted uncomfortably, but Mr. Hass, 28, has nothing to be embarrassed about. Last year, his touring revue, Magic Men Live, sold roughly $5 million worth of tickets at 148 shows in North America. Mr. Hass, who will introduce a new-and-improved Magic Men on Tuesday in Rapid City, S.D., thinks attendance could double in the coming years.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, either, to be honest with you,\u201d said Mr. Hass, who moved to Los Angeles from Detroit a few months ago. \u201cWhen we started out, we were literally driving our own cars, four guys to a vehicle, sleeping on each other in uncomfortable positions.\u201d He added: \u201cI started this company while living with my parents. From my childhood bedroom. Now women arrive by the thousands. It\u2019s like, \u2018Here we go, boys!\u2019\u201dThe Chippendales are not only still grinding away in Las Vegas (\u201ctrou-dropping goodness,\u201d the website promises). Their global tours also attract a growing audience; roughly two million people (again, mostly women) went to see a Chippendales show last year, according to Michael Caprio, a spokesman. Competitors include Thunder From Down Under and Hunk-O-Mania.You may think that the young upstart of Magic Men would be sweating Magic Mike\u2019s arrival. After all, Mr. Hass \u2014 even in his no-longer-shy, worked-out state \u2014 is just a guy from Detroit, while Mr. Tatum has all the resources of a major celebrity.But Mr. Hass does not seem worried.\u201cThey will do their thing, and we will do ours,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see us as competing. We tour. They stay in Vegas.\u201d His new Magic Men show, he added, \u201chas nothing to do with those movies except for us paying our respects to them.\u201d Mr. Hass declined to say how \u201cMagic Mike\u201d would be incorporated into his revamped show. \u201cHe wants to be able to surprise the fans,\u201d his publicist, Andy Keown, wrote in an email.Despite different packaging and a few unique niches \u2014 the Chippendales also sing, for instance \u2014 these shows are fairly interchangeable. A striptease is a striptease. Just switch out the abs, put on some dance music and add fake fog.Mr. Hass, who arrived for our interview wearing a leather jacket and a backward baseball hat, has a boyish charm and manscaped eyebrows. He performs in Magic Men as the M.C., warming up the crowd and introducing dancers who go by names like Cowboy Christian and Boy Toy Troy. He employs 25 people, including 10 dancers, and tours with two sleeper buses and an 18-wheeler to carry sound and lighting equipment.Part of his success appears to come from a savvy use of geography: Magic Men mostly visits smaller cities, bringing a style of entertainment not often seen in spots like Bismarck, N.D., and Owensboro, Ky. Troupe members regularly interact with fans on Snapchat and Instagram. Magic Men has 1.1 million followers on Facebook; Chippendales has about 803,300.\u201cOne of my friends was following them on Snapchat, and she kind of got me hooked,\u201d Johnelle Allen, 28, told me by phone from her home in Albuquerque. Ms. Allen, a single mother, has been to five Magic Men shows over the last year, posting about her experiences online and trading messages with the dancers on Snapchat.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think they would be down-to-earth, but they are,\u201d she said. \u201cThey make us feel like we\u2019re all friends.\u201dMs. Allen said she enjoyed the escape that Magic Men performances provided from her everyday life. Watching the men strip down to \u201cthe smallest boxer briefs you have ever seen in your life\u201d is less titillating than funny, she said. At one of the last performances she saw, a dancer started his routine wearing a furry, full-body Elmo costume. Putting a \u201cSesame Street\u201d character into a sexually charged setting, she said, made the audience really hoot and howl.\u201cThey have multiple stops in one area, so we also went to see them in Amarillo and El Paso,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a boy band.\u201dExcept without as many clothes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is It Time to Break Up Google?", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byOpinionIn just 10 years, the world\u2019s five largest companies by market capitalization have all changed, save for one: Microsoft. Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Citigroup and Shell Oil are out and Apple, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon and Facebook have taken their place.They\u2019re all tech companies, and each dominates its corner of the industry: Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising, Facebook (and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic and Amazon has a 74 percent share in the e-book market. In classic economic terms, all three are monopolies.We have been transported back to the early 20th century, when arguments about \u201cthe curse of bigness\u201d were advanced by President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s counselor, Louis Brandeis, before Wilson appointed him to the Supreme Court. Brandeis wanted to eliminate monopolies, because (in the words of his biographer Melvin Urofsky) \u201cin a democratic society the existence of large centers of private power is dangerous to the continuing vitality of a free people.\u201d We need look no further than the conduct of the largest banks in the 2008 financial crisis or the role that Facebook and Google play in the \u201cfake news\u201d business to know that Brandeis was right.While Brandeis generally opposed regulation \u2014 which, he worried, inevitably led to the corruption of the regulator \u2014 and instead advocated breaking up \u201cbigness,\u201d he made an exception for \u201cnatural\u201d monopolies, like telephone, water and power companies and railroads, where it made sense to have one or a few companies in control of an industry.Could it be that these companies \u2014 and Google in particular \u2014 have become natural monopolies by supplying an entire market\u2019s demand for a service, at a price lower than what would be offered by two competing firms? And if so, is it time to regulate them like public utilities?Consider a historical analogy: the early days of telecommunications.In 1895 a photograph of the business district of a large city might have shown 20 phone wires attached to most buildings. Each wire was owned by a different phone company, and none of them worked with the others. Without network effects, the networks themselves were almost useless.The solution was for a single company, American Telephone and Telegraph, to consolidate the industry by buying up all the small operators and creating a single network \u2014 a natural monopoly. The government permitted it, but then regulated this monopoly through the Federal Communications Commission.In a 1956 consent decree in which the Justice Department allowed AT&T to maintain its phone monopoly, the government extracted a huge concession: All past patents were licensed (to any American company) royalty-free, and all future patents were to be licensed for a small fee. These licenses led to the creation of Texas Instruments, Motorola, Fairchild Semiconductor and many other start-ups.True, the internet never had the same problems of interoperability. And Google\u2019s route to dominance is different from the Bell System\u2019s. Nevertheless it still has all of the characteristics of a public utility.We are going to have to decide fairly soon whether Google, Facebook and Amazon are the kinds of natural monopolies that need to be regulated, or whether we allow the status quo to continue, pretending that unfettered monoliths don\u2019t inflict damage on our privacy and democracy.It is impossible to deny that Facebook, Google and Amazon have stymied innovation on a broad scale. To begin with, the platforms of Google and Facebook are the point of access to all media for the majority of Americans. While profits at Google, Facebook and Amazon have soared, revenues in media businesses like newspaper publishing or the music business have, since 2001, fallen by 70 percent.There are a few obvious regulations to start with. Monopoly is made by acquisition \u2014 Google buying AdMob and DoubleClick, Facebook buying Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon buying, to name just a few, Audible, Twitch, Zappos and Alexa. At a minimum, these companies should not be allowed to acquire other major firms, like Spotify or Snapchat.The second alternative is to regulate a company like Google as a public utility, requiring it to license out patents, for a nominal fee, for its search algorithms, advertising exchanges and other key innovations.The third alternative is to remove the \u201csafe harbor\u201d clause in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which allows companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube to free ride on the content produced by others. The reason there are 40,000 Islamic State videos on YouTube, many with ads that yield revenue for those who posted them, is that YouTube does not have to take responsibility for the content on its network. Facebook, Google and Twitter claim that policing their networks would be too onerous. But that\u2019s preposterous: They already police their networks for pornography, and quite well.Removing the safe harbor provision would also force social networks to pay for the content posted on their sites. A simple example: One million downloads of a song on iTunes would yield the performer and his record label about $900,000. One million streams of that same song on YouTube would earn them about $900.I\u2019m under no delusion that, with libertarian tech moguls like Peter Thiel in President Trump\u2019s inner circle, antitrust regulation of the internet monopolies will be a priority. Ultimately we may have to wait four years, at which time the monopolies will be so dominant that the only remedy will be to break them up. Force Google to sell DoubleClick. Force Facebook to sell WhatsApp and Instagram.Woodrow Wilson was right when he said in 1913, \u201cIf monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of the government.\u201d We ignore his words at our peril.Jonathan Taplin is the director emeritus of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Google, Facebook and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The election of Mr. Trump, a master self-promoter, has imbued members of his social circle with the perception of juice that comes with proximity to power.\u201cIt was kind of innocent,\u201d Mr. Lombardi said of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s January visit, as he sat next to a whirring Boca Freeze soft ice cream machine in the Mar-a-Lago beach house as Secret Service agents lounged outside, looking out over the Atlantic.Ms. Le Pen, in America at his invitation, he said, had suggested a coffee in the lobby of Mr. Trump\u2019s building, where he conceded, \u201cthere was always a remote possibility\u201d of seeing the then president-elect. \u201cI said, \u2018Listen, Marine, you know there is all the media there,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lombardi recalled, saying Ms. Le Pen insisted no one would recognize her. \u201cAnd sure enough: Bang.\u201d (A spokesman for Ms. Le Pen did not return a call for comment.)Born in Geneva, Mr. Lombardi has also introduced himself as Count de Canevaro and wears a gold ring bearing his family\u2019s coat of arms. In the library at Mar-a-Lago he walked from a painting of Mr. Trump in tennis whites to a 1750 oil painting of Benedetto Saluzzo Della Manta, who he claimed came from the same region as a distant ancestor.Ms. Lahainer, a former office worker from Trieste who had married the real estate mogul Frank Lahainer, was already a friend and neighbor of Mr. Trump, having bought one of the first condos in Trump Tower. When Mr. Trump first considered buying Mar-a-Lago in 1985, she warned him about the noise pollution from plane traffic over the estate, prompting him to renegotiate the price.Mr. Lombardi said that in reality his wife could not immediately procure permits to send her husband\u2019s body back to his Italian birthplace, but the story amounted to \u201cgood advertising.\u201dWhile his second wife introduced him to Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago circle, Mr. Lombardi acted as an unofficial (\u201calways unofficial\u201d) representative in the United States of Italy\u2019s anti-immigrant Northern League, often called The Lega in Italy. He said he first met Ms. Le Pen in the early 1990s in Brussels through a friend in the European Parliament.\u201cI told her right away, \u2018Marine, dump your dad. He is just a dead weight. And anyway you have to make a choice. You are either with the Jews or you are with the Muslims. You can\u2019t be with both.\u2019\u201dMr. Lombardi expresses fondness for the Jewish people, \u201cour curly friends,\u201d he said referring to the orthodox party that had rented Mar-a-Lago out that afternoon. The specter of the Nazis fuels his preferred, and somewhat tortured, historical parallel.He envisions the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin, as the champion of the spiritual descendants of World War II resistance fighters. \u201cLe Pen, Geert, Lega, Grillo, all the resistance is fighting the Nazi Islamists,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, Ms. Merkel \u2014 You are Jewish, aren\u2019t you? Come on! She\u2019s the one who brought in all these Muslims more than anybody else. Why? Because they never lost their bad habits.\u201dMr. Lombardi wanted to be of service to Mr. Trump again when he ran for president. The day after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy, Mr. Lombardi asked his neighbor if he really intended to run and then offered to organize support for him on social media.Mr. Trump assented and Mr. Lombardi, who had no professional social media experience, began setting up a network of Facebook groups to organize support for Mr. Trump and antagonism toward Mrs. Clinton. He said he received many appeals to be an administrator of Facebook groups.Congressional investigators are examining whether Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters coordinated with Russians to promote stories that helped Mr. Trump. Mr. Lombardi said he had no relationship with Russia and dismissed any suggestion that his groups passed around stories pushed by Moscow-affiliated news media outlets or web robots. \u201cI\u2019m not a troll,\u201d he said.Instead, Mr. Lombardi expressed pride in his social media work. As Barron, shadowed by the Secret Service agent, kicked a soccer ball with a couple of children on a nearby lawn, Mr. Lombardi scrolled through hundreds of Facebook groups on his phone, including an icon that read, in Italian, \u201cFriends of Putin\u2019s Russia.\u201d (\u201cThey ask me if I wanted to be an administrator,\u201d he explained.) Then Mr. Lombardi dragged the screen to an icon he particularly liked.\u201cPeople Front for the Liberation of Europe. This one I created it. That\u2019s my group. Sounds like me, no?\u201d he said, listing the European anti-establishment leaders the group promoted. \u201cAll my friends.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Book Pins Corporate Greed on a Lust Bred at Harvard", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byDealBookIf you were to look for one ingredient that binds together the nation\u2019s chief executives, top managers and boards of directors, you\u2019d find a remarkably consistent commonality, now and in generations past: A disproportionate number of them are graduates of Harvard Business School.An M.B.A. from H.B.S., as those in the know refer to it, has long been the ultimate Good Housekeeping stamp of approval on any r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook \u2014 and the list goes on and on. The number of Fortune 500 chief executives who earned their business degrees at Harvard is three times the total from the next most popular business school, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.It is hard to overstate the school\u2019s influence on corporate America.That\u2019s why a new, exhaustive history of the school is causing a stir before it is even out. The book, \u201cThe Golden Passport,\u201d by the veteran business journalist Duff McDonald, is a richly reported indictment of the school as a leading reason that corporate America is disdained by much of the country.\u201cThe Harvard Business School became (and remains) so intoxicated with its own importance that it blithely assumed away one of the most important questions it could ask, which was whether the capitalist system it was uniquely positioned to help improve was designed properly for the long term,\u201d Mr. McDonald writes in the book, to be released in two weeks.His answer? \u201cWith economic inequality at a hundred-year high and meaningful progress on climate change and other social and environmental issues embarrassingly paltry, the answer to that question is obvious. It is not.\u201dCiting a report from the Aspen Institute, Mr. McDonald explains that \u201cwhen students enter business school, they believe that the purpose of a corporation is to produce goods and services for the benefit of society.\u201d\u201cWhen they graduate,\u201d he continues, \u201cthey believe that it is to maximize shareholder value.\u201dMr. McDonald brilliantly tells the story of the school\u2019s creation in 1908, when its mission was to educate the next generation of business managers. Edwin Gay, its first dean, defined business as the \u201cactivity of making things to sell at a profit \u2014 decently.\u201dBut, the author says, somewhere during the mid-1980s, something went very wrong: \u201cThe money got too good.\u201dThe money he refers to is the tsunami of job offers that Harvard students received from Wall Street, and the funding the school raked in from its well-heeled alumni.In fairness, Harvard Business School makes an easy punching bag, given its stature as the top feeder for big business. This is hardly the first time the institution has been criticized.And it is too much to paint all 76,000-plus alumni as being ethically challenged, as Mr. McDonald appears to imply. Indeed, many of the school\u2019s vaunted alumni are among the most talented executives in the country, and many are trying to think about stakeholders holistically.Yet in example after example, Mr. McDonald sets out his thesis that money and influence have distorted both the school\u2019s curriculum and the worldview espoused by its professors, who themselves are on the payroll of corporate America as part-time advisers and consultants.Mr. McDonald describes Mr. Jensen\u2019s arrival as \u201cthe moment of peak paradox for H.B.S.,\u201d contending that Mr. Jensen\u2019s \u201cideologically driven hijacking of the study of finance served as a cynical repudiation of everything that had come before him at the school.\u201dWith the elevation of Mr. Jensen, Mr. McDonald writes, \u201cH.B.S. had nurtured the professional manager from his birth and then helped to kill him.\u201dThe book is filled with anecdotal evidence of Mr. McDonald\u2019s argument. In once instance, he draws from a paper Mr. Jensen co-wrote in which the professor recounted a well-known story about the playwright George Bernard Shaw. As the story goes, Shaw had asked \u201can actress if she would sleep with him for a million dollars,\u201d Mr. McDonald writes. \u201cWhen she agreed, he changed his offer to $10, to which she responded with outrage, asking him what kind of woman he thought she was. His reply: \u2018We\u2019ve already established that. Now we\u2019re just haggling about the price.\u2019\u201dTo Mr. McDonald, Harvard teaches its students that \u201cwe\u2019re all whores.\u201dContinuing his train of logic, he writes: \u201cIf everybody assumes you\u2019re a whore, you might as well grab as much money as possible while you\u2019re still in demand.\u201dMr. McDonald\u2019s book also makes a provocative argument that Harvard Business School, and, by extension, the American business school complex, is responsible for out-of-whack compensation schemes for top management.\u201cWe benefit financially from it as well,\u201d the quotation continues. \u201cClearly, the fees we can charge M.B.A. students are correlated with the salaries they can get when they go get jobs.\u201dIn the end, Mr. McDonald acknowledges that \u201cone shouldn\u2019t expect Harvard Business School to be teaching courses on how to overthrow the capitalist economy.\u201dBut Mr. McDonald does raise enough salient questions that maybe the school should be asking: Should we create a case study about ourselves?A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the city in Massachusetts where Baker Library at the Harvard Business School is located.

A proposal to roll back net neutrality rules is expected as soon as this month.The efforts by Mr. Pai are an affirmative response to intense lobbying by telecom firms like AT&T and broadcast television companies such as Sinclair and CBS. Corporate lobbyists have recently flooded the F.C.C. and the offices of lawmakers urging a rollback of Obama-era rules that they view as having become too burdensome on their businesses.Mr. Pai\u2019s effort to deregulate price caps on business-to-business internet service, known as business data services, is a stark example of his drastic change of direction from the previous administration. The estimated $45 billion market for business data services is crucial for wireless carriers and is behind credit card swipes, charges at gas pumps and the transfer of medical records from hospitals.Efforts to regulate prices began in 2005, before President Barack Obama took office. Under Mr. Obama, the F.C.C. pushed for stronger limits on telecom firms that provide business data services by imposing stricter standards on connection rates in less competitive markets.The F.C.C. chairman in the Obama administration, Tom Wheeler, had said there was a lack of competition among telecom firms, making small businesses, such as gas stations and retailers, and major wireless carriers like Sprint vulnerable to price increases.Those increases are passed on to consumers as the businesses raise prices for goods and services to recoup the cost of higher internet connection fees, Mr. Berenbroick said.Mr. Wheeler was unable to get his proposal approved before the presidential election in November, and once Mr. Pai was named to run the agency, the proposal was killed.Late last month, after intense lobbying by AT&T and telecom trade groups, Mr. Pai introduced a plan to loosen the standards for rate regulations in business data services.Mr. Pai declined to comment on the proposal.In more than 10 meetings with F.C.C. officials since the November election and in dozens of other meetings last year, AT&T\u2019s top lobbyists argued that the market was competitive, with cable companies also serving business customers.Small businesses criticized Mr. Pai\u2019s deregulatory efforts, saying they were introduced without a period of public comment. The businesses also said cable operators did not serve all business customers and often did not provide the same robust connectivity that telecom companies do for wholesale connections to the internet.This month, the Small Business Administration\u2019s independent office of advocacy met with officials at the F.C.C. to ask for a delay in the vote.The proposed competitive market test \u201cmay result in reduced choices for small businesses,\u201d S.B.A. officials said in a public filing about the meeting.The other vote on Thursday involves lifting a limit on the amount of certain airwaves any one television broadcasting company can own throughout the country. Mr. Pai has argued that media ownership rules are outdated and ignore the increased competition that media firms face from Facebook, Netflix and other internet companies.But without the limits, which were introduced in 2013 by Mignon L. Clyburn, then the acting F.C.C. commissioner and now the sole Democrat on the commission, the agency may be paving the way for industry consolidation, giving too much power to media corporations that can influence public opinion, some Democrats and consumer groups warn.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, wrote a letter to Mr. Pai this week criticizing the proposal. She singled out the possibility that Sinclair would buy Tribune Broadcasting after the F.C.C.\u2019s vote.\u201cThat would be bad news for consumers in Tribune\u2019s markets in two ways,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst, consumers would lose an independent voice in their media market, and second, consumers could see their cable bills go up because Sinclair charges cable operators more than Tribune for retransmission consent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Vin Diesel Formula: Brains, Brawn and Heart", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Styles Q. and A.The former bouncer and current action hero decided to make himself a movie star after Hollywood didn\u2019t give him a chance.Supported byImprobable as it may seem, now that he is the anchor of three action franchises, Vin Diesel, 49, started out as an artsy downtown New York kid. He first hit the stage when he was 7, at the Theater for the New City in Greenwich Village.Years later, after he filled out physically, he worked for a decade as a bouncer at the Tunnel and other clubs. But beneath the brawny surface was a Dungeons & Dragons enthusiast who idolized Sidney Lumet and wanted to dedicate himself to the arts.Frustrated with his inability to make it past the gatekeepers, Mr. Diesel directed and starred in a short film, \u201cMulti-Facial,\u201d which was shown at Cannes in 1995. His next effort as director and star, the full-length work \u201cStrays,\u201d made the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. If his apprenticeship sounds more Lena Dunham than Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mr. Diesel would say you\u2019re exactly right.\u201cMulti-Facial\u201d impressed Steven Spielberg, who cast him in \u201cSaving Private Ryan.\u201d Soon after that, Mr. Diesel\u2019s career took off: He played the killer Riddick in \u201cPitch Black,\u201d the street racer Dominic Toretto in \u201cThe Fast and the Furious\u201d and the lethal superspy Xander Cage in \u201cXXX.\u201d All three have spawned sequels and video games.Vin Diesel was born Mark Sinclair in Alameda County, Calif., in 1967. He says he does not know his biological father. His mother, Delora Sheeran Vincent, an astrologer, married Irving Vincent, a New York theater manager, director and acting teacher, who became Mr. Diesel\u2019s stepfather.Mr. Diesel discussed his unlikely rise in a telephone interview from his home in Los Angeles, where he lives with his girlfriend, Paloma Jimenez, and their three children.When you first became an actor, what kind did you think you would be?I thought I was going to be a dramatic actor. I started acting when I was 7. I grew up in the city, in artist housing on the Lower West Side. My father was a theater director. When I first started acting, the whole idea of an action hero was relatively new. It didn\u2019t hit me even as my years as a bouncer were changing the way I looked. I was hellbent on working with Sidney Lumet.Eventually you went west. What was your first impression of Hollywood?Well, the first time I went to Hollywood, I couldn\u2019t even get an agent. I remember leaving my bouncing job and saying, \u201cSee you, suckers.\u201d They asked me, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I said: \u201cI\u2019ve been acting my whole life. I\u2019m going to Hollywood to be a movie star.\u201d I got to L.A. and I auditioned a bunch, but I couldn\u2019t get an agent. I ended up telemarketing \u2014 selling tools over the phone.Where did you go from there?But I couldn\u2019t get the money to make \u201cStrays\u201d then. This was 1995 and I did eventually complete it, and it was selected for competition at Sundance in \u201997. So I went by a phrase very successful people say: \u201cIf you can\u2019t do it all, do what you can.\u201d I wrote and filmed a short film called \u201cMulti-Facial.\u201d It was, in essence, my story about how hard it was to get roles as a multiracial actor.To write my first script, I went to an early electronics store called the Wiz that was on 14th Street. They had a policy where you could return anything within 30 days, no questions asked. So I went to the Wiz and bought this $600 word processor on my student credit card. I stayed up all night, every night. And at the end of the 30 days I returned it.Then I went out and rented a 16-millimeter camera on a Friday, because I didn\u2019t have to return it until Monday, so I was able to shoot for three days. Cut to my mom watching me roll an old 16-millimeter Steenbeck into my little room. I was cutting and splicing \u201cMulti-Facial\u201d old-school style. This was before computers, really. It was a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful time. A lot of people say they want to be successful, to be at the top. That\u2019s not where the fun is. The fun is the journey.When did you get your break? Or is there not really such a thing as one big break?That\u2019s true, there wasn\u2019t just one break. One of my big breaks is \u201cMulti-Facial.\u201dIn January of \u201995, I screened it at Anthology Film Archives. It was the only place that had a 16-millimeter projector. No one had ever seen my film. Everyone just thought I was the bouncer who did theater on Off Off Broadway. Then I showed the movie and 20 minutes later, when the movie ended, the whole audience never looked at me the same. Friends from my neighborhood, friends who bounced with me, even my own parents, they looked at me so differently. I can\u2019t even describe it.Another break was after \u201cStrays\u201d played at Sundance. About a month after, I got a call from Steven Spielberg and he wrote a brand-new role for me in \u201cSaving Private Ryan.\u201dDo you think you\u2019ve been underestimated because of your looks?Sidney Lumet used to say the same thing. While we were doing \u201cFind Me Guilty,\u201d he told me: \u201cYou will suffer what beautiful women have suffered in this industry for 100 years. You will suffer for your action-hero physique.\u201dMy Facebook page is also where my relationship with Mark Zuckerberg started.Do you have a dialogue with Zuckerberg?Of course! I love him. He\u2019s such a great guy and he\u2019s a fan of my work. He probably encouraged me more than anyone else to return to Xander Cage. We were hanging out up at Facebook about two years ago, and I was excited about \u201cFast 7.\u201d He said, \u201cYou know what movie I\u2019d most like to see is the return of Xander Cage.\u201d It\u2019s at a point where if Mark and I are together and if I quote a line from a character I played and I do it slightly wrong, he\u2019ll correct me. It\u2019s embarrassing!What place do action heroes occupy in Hollywood?Does the action hero really exist? That would be my question if we were killing it at a bar and getting really intense into the discussion. I feel like there are movies that have action in it and they might have comedy and romance moments as well. There isn\u2019t a school you go to to become an action hero. If you had to go back to 1939, and you watch \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d there was action there but you wouldn\u2019t call Clark Gable an action hero. Or if it\u2019s \u201cRebel Without a Cause,\u201d you\u2019re not going to call James Dean an action hero.Maybe the term was invented by Hollywood, to focus on the physique of Arnold or something, as opposed to seeing whether he could credibly pull off a film in what was his second language. Does the term truly exist or is it journalist shorthand?For someone with questionable acting skills?Yes! The best part of \u201cFast and Furious\u201d is not the big explosions. It\u2019s the heart. When you think about the brotherhood of Dom and Brian, that\u2019s what carries through so many films. And no characters in history have carried on a love affair that is so captivating and kept your attention for as long as Dom and Letty.It\u2019s to the point where a kiss from another woman \u2014 Charlize Theron in \u201cFast 8\u201d \u2014 is the biggest action sequence in the trailer. \u201cFast 8\u201d has the highest viewed trailer in history, meaning it\u2019s officially the most anticipated in film history. But what is the core of the trailer? It\u2019s something as familiar and simple as a kiss.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of Vin Diesel\u2019s character in the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d series. It is Dominic Toretto, not Dominic Tortello.Advertisement"}

Now, 20 years later, \u201cJourney to the Past\u201d is back. And this time, the song is on Broadway.In the film opening\u2019s scene, the princess, who goes by Anya after forgetting her identity, leaves an orphanage outside St. Petersburg in search of her grandmother, who survived the revolution. She has only fuzzy memories, of gilded palaces and a jeweled music box. Trudging through the snow, she sings \u201cJourney to the Past,\u201d a number at once twinkling and rousing, about moving forward by diving into history.The song\u2019s runaway success shocked its composers. \u201cWe had another song for that scene,\u201d said Mr. Flaherty, sitting with Ms. Ahrens at a cafe near the Broadhurst. \u201cIn the other song, Anya was on a bicycle. But, in Hollywood, you always have to write three songs for every scene. \u2018Journey\u2019 was the last one we came up with, late at night.\u201dMs. Ahrens laughed, and added: \u201cMy mother, who I call the pinprick in the bubble of joy, said it\u2019s an honor just to be nominated. What she meant was, you\u2019re going to lose.\u201d\u201cShe was so lovely to work with,\u201d Mr. Flaherty said of Aaliyah. \u201cThe morning we were nominated, we got a call from her. No one ever thanks the songwriters, but she did. I will always remember that.\u201dThough Aaliyah made the song popular on radio, the version that most fans cling to was sung by Ms. Callaway, a Broadway regular who was originally hired to sing only the demo tapes for the film but won the job after studio executives became enchanted with her voice. Ms. Callaway said that she still recalls the moment Mr. Flaherty played it for her.\u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s the song,\u2019\u201d Ms. Callaway said. \u201c I wanted to record it that same night. We stayed up until 1 in the morning, and no one left until it was done.\u201dChristy Altomare, who plays Anya on Broadway, said she had a similar moment of late-night communion. When recording the cast album, she asked to sing \u201cJourney to the Past\u201d last, so that she could \u201cwalk out into the streets of New York having just sung it,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere is an energy to those last 32 bars that is indescribable \u2014 the hopefulness, the longing.\u201dThe \u201cAnastasia\u201d creative team, which includes the book writer Terrence McNally and the director Darko Tresnjak, is banking on the song\u2019s appeal to fill seats. So far it may be working: In a recent week, the show brought in $1.2 million at the box office, a healthy haul before its official opening.Promotional materials, including a teaser trailer that amassed over 12 million views on Facebook, all feature the twinkling opening bars of \u201cJourney to the Past,\u201d a kind of instant aural nostalgia trip designed for maximum throwback swooning. (Ms. Ahrens calls it the \u201cshimmer.\u201d)\u201cI\u2019ve imagined this for YEARS!\u201d one fan wrote under the YouTube video. Another: \u201cI\u2019m crying right now, this is my childhood! I wish I could go, but is really hard because I live in Argentina.\u201dSvala Bjorgvinsdottir, an Icelandic singer and the daughter of the Reykjavik rock star Bjorgvin Halldorsson, recorded the song when she was 18 and already famous in her home country. Twenty years on, she still performs it \u201cin big arena concerts all over Iceland, including my father\u2019s Christmas Stadium Gala,\u201d she said by email. \u201cThe lyrics are beautiful in Icelandic.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve sung it in China, I\u2019ve sung it in France, and everyone knows this song,\u201d she said. \u201cI have had people burst into tears when they hear me sing it, saying it is their childhood rushing back to them.\u201dCaroline Benson, 23, a self-described \u201cAnastasia superfan\u201d currently studying musical theater at Auburn University, said that she views \u201cJourney\u201d as a kind of empowerment anthem for women.\u201cMy mom bought me the VHS when I was about 6,\u201d she said. \u201cI always appreciated Anya as a strong feminist character who knew what she wanted and never took no for an answer. As a person who is in a transition period, this song really speaks to going out into the unknown and taking life by the horns.\u201dWhile the composers are grateful for the \u201cFanastasias\u201d who express affection for the movie, they worry that the stage version could shock the most devoted among them. Gone on Broadway are Rasputin \u2014 the villain of the film \u2014 and Bartok the albino bat, his scheming animal sidekick.The story still centers on Anya and her love interest, Dmitry (Derek Klena), a ruffian from St. Petersburg who persuades her to pretend to be Romanov royalty to escape Russia and find riches in Paris. (Surprise: She was the princess all along!) The main villain is a stern revolutionary named Gleb (Ramin Karimloo), who pursues Anya across Europe out of a sense of patriotism.\u201cA song like \u2018Journey,\u2019 even though it dealt with indecision, couldn\u2019t be the start of a character arc,\u201d Mr. Flaherty said. \u201cThis is a woman with a past, and we needed to lay the groundwork for this moment.\u201dMr. Flaherty and Ms. Ahrens say they are flattered that new generations continue to find the song. \u201cA British boy group called Collabro just put a cover of it on their latest record,\u201d Mr. Flaherty said. \u201cIt keeps popping up in the strangest places.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The attendant, whose name was not released by the airline, grabbed the stroller from the woman, who was carrying 15-month-old twins, a passenger who was nearby said.A video that circulated on social media showed the attendant nearly coming to blows with another passenger who threatened him after the altercation with the woman.\u201cWhat we see on this video does not reflect our values or how we care for our customers,\u201d the airline said in a statement. \u201cThe actions of our team member captured here do not appear to reflect patience or empathy, two values necessary for customer care. In short, we are disappointed by these actions.\u201dThe American Airlines episode began when the plane was at the gate in San Francisco before a scheduled 1 p.m. departure to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

{"Headline": "A Day in the Life of a Food Vendor", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s 6 on a Wednesday morning, and Kabir Ahmed has snoozed his alarm one too many times. He steps softly, barefoot, around his small, second-story apartment in Jamaica, Queens, creaking through the green and pink hall.He is late, but careful not to wake his wife and their three children, or his mother, who will be up in an hour to say prayers and cook breakfast. He puts on his baseball hat, slides his feet into rubber clogs and hurries out without coffee.Mr. Ahmed, 46, is in the business of chicken and rice. He immigrated from Bangladesh 23 years ago, and is now one of two partners in a halal food cart that sets up on Greenwich Street close to the World Trade Center, all year long, rain or shine. He is also one of more than 10,000 people, most of them immigrants, who make a living selling food on the city\u2019s sidewalks: pork tamales, hot dogs, rolled rice noodles, jerk chicken.These vendors are a fixture of New York\u2019s streets and New Yorkers\u2019 routines, vital to the culture of the city. But day to day, they struggle to do business against a host of challenges: byzantine city codes and regulations on street vending, exorbitant fines for small violations (like setting up an inch too close to the curb) and the occasional rage of brick-and-mortar businesses or residents. Not to mention the weather, the whims of transit and foot traffic, and the trials of standing for hours, often alone, with no real shelter or private space.\u201cWhat\u2019s hard about this job?\u201d Mr. Ahmed says. \u201cEverything is hard. If I get old, I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201dBut today, Mr. Ahmed checks his email first, hoping for news from one of the preschools processing the application of his youngest child, Karen. Nothing yet.By 7:15 a.m., he has reached his usual spot, which he found three years ago by word of mouth: a wide swath of sidewalk in front of the BNY Mellon building that gets hectic around noon when those in the financial district crowd \u2014 a mix of Wall Street bankers and construction workers, students and tourists \u2014 are all looking to spend $5 or $6 on a fast, hot lunch.\u201cGood morning, neighbor!\u201d is his standard, sunny greeting for the half-dozen other carts on his block.Like many cart owners, Mr. Ahmed hires someone to deliver the cart to him every morning and return it to a garage each night. (Other owners hitch the carts to their cars and drive them in, then face the ordeal of finding a parking spot.)But by 7:40, Mr. Ahmed is getting antsy; the driver is late. \u201cMaybe he has a flat tire,\u201d he says. He stays calm, though sometimes he can\u2019t help but imagine the worst. Mr. Ahmed was a New Yorker on 9/11, and this part of the city holds meaning for him. \u201cMany people, they went to work like me, they thought it was an ordinary day,\u201d he says.It\u2019s cloudy and cold for April, and Mr. Ahmed is still sleepy, but he won\u2019t be tempted by the hot jolt of a second coffee. He knows he can\u2019t leave the cart to go to the bathroom (at the Target across the street, or the Whole Foods a few blocks away) until his partner shows up hours from now. Another coffee, this early in the day, would be way too risky.The driver pulls up with Mr. Ahmed\u2019s cart at 7:52, and the two men work quickly to wheel it into place. Inside, the cart is cold, clean and packed with boxes of ingredients.The food comes from a commissary kitchen attached to the garage in Long Island City, Queens; the city requires that food carts be serviced and supplied by a commissary, and there are many of them, of varying sizes, with different owners, all around New York.At an extra cost, this one has provided everything Mr. Ahmed needs for the day: heads of lettuce, a few dozen tomatoes and potatoes, ready-sliced halal lamb, several bags of boneless chicken thighs, two 12-pound bags of basmati rice, four large plastic containers of potable water for cooking and washing, clamshell containers and napkins.Mr. Ahmed ties on his apron and pushes a few boxes underneath the cart so he can squeeze inside and get to work. Any boxes peeking out beyond the cart\u2019s footprint could result in a fine (penalties can run up to $1,000), as could parking his cart closer than six inches to the curb, or 20 feet to the building entrance. Mr. Ahmed knows all the rules by heart.He connects the 40-pound propane tank and turns on the flattop grill and burners. He cuts lettuce and tomatoes, browns lamb and vast amounts of chicken. He takes care, in the cramped kitchen space, to keep his vegetarian cooking separate. For a long time, Mr. Ahmed chops onions in silence.\u201cIf I play music or anything, I get distracted,\u201d he says. \u201cI forget the salt.\u201dAlthough Mr. Ahmed had little cooking experience when he started, his wife, Sheren Akter, says his food is better than that at most other carts \u2014 less greasy, more flavorful, well seasoned.His menu consists of about 20 dishes, most of them cooked to order, but regulars know to ask for the chicken biryani, flecked with fried onion and cilantro, garnished with half a hard-boiled egg, all for $6, with a drink. He\u2019d like to raise the price, but worries that he would lose customers.To make the biryani, Mr. Ahmed fries the onion until it\u2019s translucent. He drops in whole cinnamon, star anise, green cardamom pods and bay leaves. Before the chicken goes in, he adds garlic paste and a spoonful of ghee. He cooks the rice in the same simmering pot, adding water and a prepared spice mixture that includes dried papaya and plums. All the passers-by, those with travel mugs and employee ID badges, or those walking their dogs or pushing their strollers, inhale the familiar perfume of Mr. Ahmed\u2019s chicken biryani.Salman Akhtar, a pre-med student at Borough of Manhattan Community College, is Mr. Ahmed\u2019s first customer of the day, at 9:30. The men chat in Bangla, and when Mr. Ahmed speaks in Bangla, he is louder and faster, quicker to tell a joke.Mr. Ahmed came to New York alone, at age 23. He had studied accounting and commerce at Dhaka College, but in Queens, it took him a few months to find a job. By then, he owed his roommates in Sunnyside almost $3,000.He worked off the debt, busing tables and driving cars. But later, after Mr. Ahmed married and had children, he dreamed of a small business that he could expand.He applied for a food vendor\u2019s license, took a required health and safety class, bought a used cart and took it for an inspection by city officials. (The health department inspects carts at least once a year, and more frequently if a violation is reported.)Mr. Ahmed still needed a food-vending permit, though, and because of a cap on permits imposed in the 1980s, only 4,000 or so circulate. He acquired his from a permit owner who has charged him and his partner $25,000 for two-year leases (for a permit that cost the owner just $200), which they are still paying off.\u201cThe system is totally crazy,\u201d Mr. Ahmed says. \u201cWhoever has a license, give them a permit. It\u2019s good for all of us.\u201dOnce the lunch rush starts around 11:30, Mr. Ahmed can\u2019t budge from the cart. These hours blur together. He is no longer alone; by noon, he is joined by two more men in the 10-foot-long space \u2014 his partner and an assistant \u2014 working efficiently around the grill, fryer and steam table, finding their rhythm in the surges of orders as clusters of people appear.On a good day, after paying the driver and the garage, and splitting the cash proceeds with his colleagues, Mr. Ahmed earns about $125. For a cart owner, that sum is not unusual.He could make more, working longer hours alone, but he won\u2019t. Mr. Ahmed likes to tell the cautionary tale of a pushcart vendor who made the best food \u2014 so good he once netted $3,000 in one day. That vendor worked alone, and worked himself so hard, Mr. Ahmed says, that he got sick. Now he can\u2019t take care of anyone and has no one to take care of him.Mr. Ahmed\u2019s son, Kowshik, who dreams of working for NASA, will be a high school senior in the fall, and Mr. Ahmed wants all his children to go to college. \u201cBut now I cannot get sick,\u201d Mr. Ahmed says, \u201cand I cannot stop working.\u201dAt 3:30 p.m., Mr. Ahmed\u2019s shift ends and he walks back to the subway; his partner will stay until the cart closes at 8.By now, Mr. Ahmed\u2019s feet are sore and his back is aching. Lately, his back is always aching. The F train is delayed, but Mr. Ahmed, who likes to keep up on all the latest memes, and has been deprived of internet access for the duration of his shift, doesn\u2019t mind. He passes this time catching up on funny videos.By 5, he is home, where he makes a few phone calls and takes a shower. Ms. Akter, who works part time as a cashier at a nearby Key Food, is also home. She makes a pot of coffee and warms up the food that Mr. Ahmed\u2019s mother cooked earlier: beef curry, potatoes in broth, shredded bitter melon saut\u00e9ed with onions, a cucumber and tomato salad, and two kinds of rice.It\u2019s a feast, set up on the narrow table in the living room, where a soap opera plays on TV. As they catch up, Karen climbs onto the sofa to snuggle, and Ms. Akter fixes her hair.After work on Fridays, Mr. Ahmed goes to mosque, but not today. In just a few hours, it will be time to watch the news, turn in and start it all again.Every year, they save money so Ms. Akter can take the children to visit relatives in Dhaka in the summer. But last week, she suggested that they plan a Caribbean cruise for the six of them instead. Mr. Ahmed didn\u2019t think they could afford that kind of vacation, not to mention so much time away from his cart.But riding the E train today, peeling potatoes, changing out the empty propane tank, he\u2019d been thinking about it all the same. What would it be like to go on a cruise, he wondered. To board a big ship with your family, to vacation as they do in the movies, to fall asleep at night without setting an alarm.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

Outright cheerleading is clearly premature, and many women remain skeptical that they will be heard or protected if they come forward with tales of what they\u2019ve had to endure in the work force. But it may be that the power women wield outside their own places of employment helps even the game.Judging from more than 950 comments posted on Facebook after The New York Times asked women for their assessment of Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s departure, many doubted that this heralded a new era for Fox or would encourage more women to report sexual harassment.\u201cI\u2019m glad pressure was put on the network but no... this does not show men in power will be held accountable. It shows that Fox was losing money,\u201d Elizabeth Gibbons Woodhouse wrote. \u201cThis was a financial decision. Accountability would have been thoroughly investigating the multiple complaints, not just allowing O\u2019Reilly to throw money at them to keep them quiet.\u201dAnd Mairead O\u2019Grady commented: \u201cThe issue of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace will not be resolved until we have a diverse work force \u2014 at all levels of the corporate world. There is little hope that claims of mistreatment will be handled fairly with the astonishing imbalance of power between men and women at work. When you know that reporting an issue puts your career at risk, exposes you to possible retaliatory actions, and potentially could sideline you at that organization you think twice about whether it\u2019s worth it.\u201dSome women defended Mr. O\u2019Reilly, sensing a liberal conspiracy and saying the accusations were unproven. Others said they remained discouraged that a man who boasted of forcing himself on women had been elected president. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really a win for women,\u201d said Lynn Thompson. \u201cThis was done to satisfy advertisers, not because it was the right thing to do. Men in powerful positions will continue to taken advantage of women and women will be seen as liars if they report it. We elected a man who admitted to assaulting women and much of the public doesn\u2019t care. Kind of speaks for itself.\u201dMany women recounted their own experiences of sexual harassment in the workplace.\u201cI\u2019m in the ad industry, and things haven\u2019t changed all that much,\u201d Michelle Barlow Dickens wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s still Mad Men, only a little more covert.\u201d Patty Ryan told of witnessing a judge press women against a wall and stick his tongue in their mouths.Fox was forced to act in the end because its treatment of women was exacting a cost it could not bear. The more than 50 advertisers who pulled ads did so, they said, because they could not afford to alienate women and their considerable purchasing power. It was bad for their brands to be associated with Mr. O\u2019Reilly. 21st Century Fox\u2019s stock price fell 6 percent during the O\u2019Reilly scandal. It\u2019s not that Fox\u2019s revenue suffered \u2014 Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s viewers remained loyal and many advertisers redirected their ads to other Fox shows \u2014 but investors feared longer term reputational damage.Some women were heartened that they could redress the power imbalance. \u201cWhen we as consumers and voters exercise our power we can force change,\u201d Geneta Miles wrote. \u201cIf corporations and politicians understand that women today will no longer accept these deplorable behaviors, they will change or be defeated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After all, Mrs. Clinton knows that her every move in public is being watched and parsed for meaning. And she has a long history with clothing issues, good and bad. Which means that she knows that wearing the shoes is going to be seen as an endorsement, and she is wearing them for a reason.And that is?The reaction tells part of the story.The comparison isn\u2019t really correct. Mrs. Clinton is not benefiting financially from the Katy Perry relationship, though the very public choice of a somewhat wacky shoe is indubitably something of an image-changer: a declaration of independence from expectations and tradition, a visual statement that goes with her new haircut.Mrs. Clinton, after all, has had a famously conflicted relationship with fashion, chafing against the idea that she would in any way be defined, or identified, by what she wore as first lady or as a Senate candidate, seeing it as gender prejudice; then relaxing into her own uniform; and then using fashion as a tool to increase her relatability, by making jokes about her pantsuits and hair.

{"Headline": "Villagers Hold Officials Hostage in Vietnam Land Dispute", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byDONG TAM, Vietnam \u2014 Residents of Dong Tam, a village on the outskirts of Vietnam\u2019s capital, have been holding hostages for nearly a week to protest a government attempt to evict villagers from disputed land. The standoff has riveted a nation where farmers\u2019 land is often taken from them for development.Some of the more than three dozen officials and police officers taken hostage last weekend were later released, but others were still being held in Dong Tam on Friday, according to rights activists and state news outlets. Residents had erected barbed-wire barricades to block access to a part of the village where the hostages were said to be held.The episode has developed into one of the more dramatic confrontations in recent years between ordinary Vietnamese and their authoritarian government. The top city official in Hanoi, the capital, was expected to meet with villagers on Friday. State-run news outlets reported that officials had promised to review the underlying reasons for the land dispute, and to refrain from using violence.A blogger near Dong Tam who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said people simply wanted to return to normal life.The blogger was among a group of villagers protesting the land seizure in coordination with the people holding the hostages. He said 19 officials were still being held inside the barricades, a claim that could not be independently verified.Activists in Hanoi said that the dispute began last weekend, when police officers and plainclothes security forces entered Dong Tam, which sits among rice paddies about 25 miles south of Hanoi, to evict the villagers from the land. The villagers resisted and managed to capture 38 of the police officers and security officials in the process, the activists said.After news of the uprising spread online, some activists visited the village, said Doan Trang, a journalist in Hanoi who does not work for the state-controlled news media. But security was later tightened, and several human rights activists from Hanoi were placed under house arrest, she said.Experts and activists said the dispute was a vivid reminder of a quandary that Vietnam has wrestled with for decades: how to allocate land in a Communist country that allows quasi-private ownership rights but still considers all land to be state property.\u201cThings will not stop at Dong Tam,\u201d said Le Dung Vova, a prominent Vietnamese activist and writer. \u201cSimilar incidents will keep happening everywhere, with different levels of intensity, especially as land resources become more scarce.\u201dLand disputes are common on the fringes of Vietnamese urban areas, where land values are often high; villagers are typically compensated at prices well below market rates for agricultural land that is later rezoned for other uses. John Gillespie, a professor at Monash University in Australia who is an expert on land reform in Vietnam, said in an interview that the disputes tended to be more violent when villagers perceived that business interests outweighed public ones.Videos of confrontations between villagers and the riot police in rural Vietnam are widely shared on YouTube and Facebook, which are not blocked in the country. Some villagers are supported by networks of urban activists as they campaign against the officials or the state-affiliated companies behind the evictions.The disputes occasionally turn violent, forcing provincial or even national officials to intervene. In 2012, for example, after a farmer shot at police officers who were trying to evict him from his land in the northern port city of Haiphong, the prime minister at the time, Nguyen Tan Dung, stepped in to say that the eviction had been illegal.In 2013, Vietnam tweaked its land law in ways meant to introduce more transparency into eminent domain cases. A United Nations-financed survey of public administration in Vietnam later found that the percentage of citizens who reported land seizures in Vietnam had declined slightly, to 6.8 percent of respondents in 2016 from over 9 percent in 2013, suggesting that the law may have helped reduce land seizures by local officials.But experts say land disputes continue, in part, because the 2013 revisions do not allow private ownership or set clear definitions of what qualifies as the public interest in eminent domain cases.The Dong Tam conflict is not exceptional, said Andrew Wells-Dang, a senior governance adviser at Oxfam Vietnam who has worked on land policy in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s simply been large and gotten a lot of attention,\u201d he said.Embassy officers from some Western countries met with Hanoi officials this week and asked them to refrain from using violence in Dong Tam, said a Western diplomat in Hanoi who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing official protocol.There was no visible police presence.The blogger in Dong Tam said by telephone on Friday that about 20 journalists were waiting there for the top official of Hanoi, Nguyen Duc Chung, to arrive for expected talks with the villagers.It appeared that violence would be averted for at least another day because of the talks, Ms. Trang said. But the farmers, she said, will almost certainly be punished once the conflict has settled down.\u201cThat\u2019s the police\u2019s tradition,\u201d she said. \u201cNever in history do they concede to the citizens.\u201dChau Doan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

President Trump has surrounded himself with an extraordinarily wealthy group of advisers, who have sprawling assets and income sources. Here are some intriguing highlights from their financial disclosure forms:The director of the National Economic Council and a former Goldman Sachs executive, he is among the wealthiest of the president\u2019s advisers, with assets worth as much as $611 million. He owns stock in Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, McDonald\u2019s and the food giant Kraft Heinz, and has at least $191.1 million in Goldman-related holdings. He and his wife reported at least $48 million to $78 million in income last year.She is best known for her once-ubiquitous cable television appearances, but Ms. Conway has earned significant money through speechmaking and consulting. Among the groups that paid her last year were the National RIfle Association, the National Right to Life Committee, the Tea Party Patriots and the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group that gained notoriety in 2015 when it secretly recorded a video that purported to show Planned Parenthood officials trying to profit from the sale of fetal tissue. She and her husband, a lawyer, are worth at least $11 million to $44 million, the records show.His real estate interests are vast \u2014 with properties in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana and Maryland \u2014 but he still carries a lot of debt. Mr. Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, has at least $19 million worth of debt from various banks, as well as $115,000 worth of debt on two Visa credit cards, at a 13.74 percent interest rate. He and his wife, Ivanka Trump, are beneficiaries of a real estate and investment portfolio worth as much as $740 million.

{"Headline": "Revival for the Notekillers, Still Noisy After All These Years", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byThe student and the teacher faced each other on plain black foldout chairs. It was past 9 on a windy night, and this was David First\u2019s last guitar lesson of the day. The student, Karen D\u2019Ambrosi, a shy 28-year-old marketing manager at Etsy, began strumming one of Mr. First\u2019s electric guitars. He joined in, gently plucking a melody over her chords.In the next room, Mr. First\u2019s wife, Mira Gwincinska Hirsch, listened in the dark, eating a piece of pumpkin pie. A small table lamp illuminated a jasmine flower in a red vase.The scene was surprisingly tranquil considering that Mr. First, 63, is something of a lost noise-rock legend. In the late 1970s, his avant-rock band, the Notekillers, performed at clubs that now exist only as urban myths, like CBGB and Hurrah. Their songs were fast, jagged and wordless. They shared stages with volatile performers from Glenn Branca to the Misfits.Before the lesson, Mr. First sat at his kitchen table with a mug of piping tea, clearly aware that his sedate appearance \u2014 cargo pants, button-down shirt, tea \u2014 belied his punk credentials.\u201c\u2018The Zipper\u2019 was one of the Top 10 documents for me at the time,\u201d Thurston Moore, singer and guitarist for Sonic Youth, said in an interview recently. \u201cIt was emblematic of the guitar music that inspired me. I mean, this guy was shredding like Hendrix.\u201dBut in those pre-internet days, the Notekillers\u2019 obscurity wasn\u2019t a badge of honor. It was proof to the band that it had failed. One day in 1981, after four years together shuttling back and forth from the Lower East Side to their native Philadelphia, the trio (Mr. First, along with the bassist Stephen Bilenky and the drummer Barry Halkin) took the New Jersey Turnpike home and gave up on the New York music scene.\u201cWe really weren\u2019t connecting with people,\u201d Mr. First said impassively.Now, more than 30 years after inspiring Sonic Youth, the Notekillers are coming somewhat closer to having a moment.The past 12 months have been a kind of renaissance for Mr. First, who released two solo records in addition to a new Notekillers album. He has just returned from performing at the Tate Modern in London as part of an exhibition of the experimental artist Phill Niblock. And he just released an album of pop songs, under the name Star Ballads.\u201cI\u2019ve always thought David was one of the most underrated musicians,\u201d said Kyle Gann, a Bard College professor and composer, who befriended Mr. First after years of covering his live performances for The Village Voice. Mr. Gann\u2019s son, Bernard, formed the metal band Liturgy after taking guitar lessons from Mr. First. (He also plays bass on the Star Ballads record.)\u201cDavid\u2019s music is amazing,\u201d said Mr. Gann, who included Mr. First in his book, \u201cAmerican Music in the Twentieth Century.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll start strangely out of tune and then it just goes haywire in slow and gradual ways. He\u2019s made the hair on the back of my neck stand up many times.\u201dRecognition was a long time coming, but one day Mr. First woke up and his fate changed.About 15 years ago, Mr. First got a phone call from Barry Halkin, the drummer in the Notekillers. The glossy British music magazine Mojo published an article about the musicians who inspired the guitar innovations of Sonic Youth. Among more celebrated favorites, Mr. Moore singled out the Notekillers.\u201cHonestly, I assumed it was a mistake,\u201d Mr. First said. But he sent a note to Mr. Moore, just to double-check.The astonishment was mutual.\u201cI was blown away when David emailed me,\u201d Mr. Moore, 58, said with boyish exuberance. Mr. Moore immediately wrote back and offered to release a Notekillers compilation on his own record label.\u201cFor 25 years, I just thought we had no impact,\u201d Mr. First said. \u201cSo to find out that we had a major influence \u2014 let alone on Sonic Youth \u2014 that was pretty huge.\u201dMr. First rang his former bandmates to gauge their interest in playing again. The drummer had become a successful architectural photographer. The bassist designed custom-made bicycles.\u201cI said to them, \u2018Maybe the world\u2019s finally ready for us.\u2019\u201dThe compilation Mr. Moore released in 2004 catalyzed the Notekillers\u2019 reunion after 23 years. They released a record in 2010 (\u201cWe\u2019re Here to Help\u201d) and another last year, \u201cSongs and Jams Vol. 1.\u201dThe Notekillers \u2014 all of whom are 63 \u2014 now do gigs at Brooklyn sites with rock bands half their age.\u201cTo think that we\u2019re still doing this at all,\u201d Mr. First said, his voice trailing off. \u201cNot to mention doing it better than we did it the first time, is still unreal to me.\u201dMr. First grew up in a middle-class neighborhood in Philadelphia. His parents encouraged him creatively by letting his band, three Grateful Dead-worshiping teenagers (who later became the Notekillers), rehearse in their basement. By 1976, the Notekillers, already entrenched in Philadelphia punk clubs, were drawn by New York\u2019s thriving avant-garde music scene.But they found the downtown scene was difficult to crack.\u201cBack then, nobody really knew how to play guitar in a traditional sense,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cAnd if you did, it was an anomaly.\u201dBefore forming Sonic Youth, Mr. Moore said that his band, the Coachmen, also failed to emerge from the same scene.By 1984, the Notekillers were over, and Mr. First relocated permanently to Manhattan, working part time as the manager of a cookie store in Midtown. He paid $75 a week to live in a transient hotel, chaining his guitar to his bed before going to work.A year later, he was laid off from another job, as the manager of an ice cream shop. This was not a setback but a windfall. During six months of paid unemployment, Mr. First finally had time to do music full time, playing solo and with other ensembles he formed. And, critically, he amassed a cadre of students to teach guitar for extra cash when necessary. He never worked a 9-to-5 job again.As a free musician, Mr. First has flourished. Now he is considered a beacon of futuristic sound among experimental composers.Though much of his music is heavily electronic, at a recent performance at the Roulette theater in Downtown Brooklyn, Mr. First switched among very traditional acoustic instruments during a suite of improvisations: a crimson sitar, a scalloped-neck electric guitar from Vietnam and a harmonica (just the regular kind). His ensemble partners were equally diverse: a violist, a trombonist and a percussionist.\u201cPeople who know me in these contexts would be very surprised to find out I\u2019d been in this crazy rock band,\u201d Mr. First said.As are his students. Today, Mr. First composes and records from his Greenpoint apartment thanks to an amalgam of creative grants and commissions. Through it all, he has maintained his side gig as a guitar teacher.Ms. D\u2019Ambrosi, the Etsy employee, asked Mr. First for guitar lessons through a mutual musician friend five years ago. \u201cI remember seeing on Facebook that he was in this band, but we didn\u2019t really discuss it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just play Bob Dylan and Neil Young.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kashmir Shuts Down Social Networks for a Month", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byIn the order, the government notified internet service providers to block the transmission of messages on 22 social networking services, including Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter, for a month, or until further orders were issued.The move illuminated a government increasingly vexed by civilian protests, by a newly budding homegrown militancy in south Kashmir and by a series of video clips, distributed on social media, depicting confrontations between civilians and Indian security forces.The order, signed by the principal secretary in the state\u2019s Home Department, contended that social media was being used by \u201canti-national and subversive elements\u201d for \u201cvitiating peace and tranquillity\u201d in the state.The internet is often restricted in Kashmir \u2014 to prevent election interference and to quell protests and strikes, which often turn violent when police and security officers clash with civilians. From 2012 to 2016, it was blocked at least 31 times, the Software Freedom Law Center reported, often through mobile phones.But the scope of Wednesday\u2019s order was far broader, reflecting the government\u2019s determination to stem the anger of a population that is growing increasingly difficult to control.In recent days, the valley has seen angry protests from students rebelling against the heavy-handed tactics employed by the police and security forces in subduing demonstrators demanding greater autonomy or outright independence. On April 9, separatist leaders called for a boycott of a vote for a parliamentary seat representing Srinagar, leading to protests and clashes with security forces. Eight people were killed in the violence.Nitish Kumar, a senior police official, said in a phone interview that the order would help the police check the spread of rumors over Facebook and WhatsApp.\u201cIt will give us that time to manage the situation,\u201d he said, calling social networking sites the \u201cmain platform\u201d used by protesters.On Wednesday, young people in Srinagar spoke out against the order.\u201cThe government has to understand that there is a sentiment which forces students to come out on the streets: it is not the internet, it is not Facebook or any other social media platform,\u201d said Aqib Shah, a 19-year-old student at Amar Singh College, who has been participating in protests in Srinagar for the last several days. \u201cIt is because of the overwhelming presence of forces that are deployed here.\u201dImran Arshad, a student at Sri Pratap College in Srinagar, the site of several recent protests, said that the government\u2019s order would eventually fail.\u201cThey can stop the internet, they can shut down schools, but the anger remains in our hearts and minds.\u201dSameer Yasir contributed reporting from Srinagar, Kashmir, and Hari Kumar from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Red, Ripe and Renegade: Berries That Break All the Rules", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byOXNARD, Calif. \u2014 It ought to be easy to find a single ripe strawberry to sample in a 20-acre field. But Rick Gean picked two bright-red specimens and looked dubious.\u201cThis one should be O.K.,\u201d he said, sounding not quite convinced. Then again, his definition of ripe is more stringent than most.The Geans grow Gaviota and Seascape strawberries, known for sweetness and flavor but not for productivity or the ability to survive shipping and days in a supermarket produce department. Until five years ago, the only place to find Harry\u2019s Berries was at Southern California farmers\u2019 markets \u2014 and today, the markets still make up 70 percent of the farm\u2019s sales.The berries are grown organically, despite initial skepticism from Mrs. Gean\u2019s father, who founded the farm and swore that the unconventional approach wouldn\u2019t work. And each section of the field is harvested only once every five days, to give the fruit enough time to reach its flavorful peak. Large-scale growers typically pick every three days.Ripeness is all: When the berries run out, they run out, because the Geans would rather send a customer home empty-handed than with a berry that doesn\u2019t meet their standards. That accounts for the lines that form an hour before the area\u2019s biggest market, in Santa Monica, opens for business.The farm, which this year celebrates its 50th anniversary and more than 30 years at the markets, has been a shrine for generations of berry lovers, both professional chefs and customers who ate their first berry as toddlers and now push strollers of their own. Bucking tradition has worked out well: Last year, the Geans sold 500,000 pounds of strawberries.Perfection doesn\u2019t come cheap \u2014 a pint costs $8 \u2014 but the lines are long even when berries are plentiful, as they are now at the start of the peak season.Mr. Fox sometimes identifies the berry\u2019s provenance on the menu, for a dish like the strawberry Pavlova with yogurt and black pepper. Ms. Silverton, on the other hand, assumes that by now most of her customers know exactly where the berries come from.Ms. Silverton and Mr. Fox rhapsodized about the fuller, sweeter berry taste, the juice-dribbling texture (compared with the chalky innards of some commercial berries) and an aroma that wafts toward marketgoers before they reach the stall. When they ran out of superlatives, they both settled on a single adjective: \u201cred,\u201d summing up all a strawberry should be.The farm didn\u2019t start out this way. In 1967, Mrs. Gean\u2019s father, Harry Iwamoto, a Japanese immigrant, leased 120 acres in Oxnard and planted what the Geans refer to as \u201ccommodity\u201d berries, a hardy strain picked when they are still partly white inside, to extend their shelf life. They didn\u2019t taste like fully ripe berries, but that was beside the point. They made it to the grocery store intact.Mrs. Gean grew up on that farm, and married Mr. Gean, her high school sweetheart. In 1986, she was running a Harry\u2019s Berries roadside stand and he was driving a beer truck when they heard about a new farmers\u2019 market in nearby Ventura. They drove out to take a look.Mr. Gean was smitten. \u201cI\u2019m quitting my job,\u201d he said, ready to trade his truck route for the chance to develop an offshoot of the family business: working the farmers\u2019 markets, where they could meet customers and cut out the wholesale middleman.Mrs. Gean, though similarly tempted, suggested they might want to try it first. They started at two markets, added three more, and applied for a stall at the biggest, oldest market in Southern California, the Wednesday market in Santa Monica. Then they waited. A year. Two.When they finally secured a slot, Mr. Gean announced again that he wanted to quit. \u201cI saw it as an upgrade,\u201d he said of swapping beer for berries. \u201cNobody ever got in a car accident from eating too many strawberries.\u201d This time, his wife agreed.At first, they sold the same commercial berries they had always grown. But in 1993, the farm lost its lease to a water conservation project, and the family stood at a fork in the road: They could find another large parcel to sustain their wholesale operation, or they could downsize and become farmers\u2019 market purveyors, period.They went small, in fairly drastic fashion \u2014 leasing a 20-acre plot across the road from the original farm, planting new strains and abandoning the wholesale business. As their market business grew, they leased an adjacent 27 acres, and in 2008 bought a 10-acre parcel.\u201cWe stepped off the traditional success track at a fortuitous moment,\u201d Mrs. Gean said. \u201cThe farmers\u2019 markets enabled us to become what we are, to make a profit.\u201dThey told him it wouldn\u2019t work \u2014 berries as ripe as theirs would never survive shipping \u2014 but Mr. Murphy persisted. \u201cI\u2019ll have my truck there,\u201d he recalled telling them. \u201cJust give my guy berries, and I\u2019ll pay for them no matter what.\u201d All the Geans had to do was build a new cooler that chills the berries more quickly, and pack them in sturdy plastic clamshell containers.\u201cThe truck pulls in, they load up the berries, the truck pulls out,\u201d Mr. Gean said. The fruit arrives in East Coast restaurant kitchens and on market shelves within 36 to 48 hours of being picked.In 2012, they shipped about two dozen 80-pound flats twice a week. This season, at peak volume, Baldor will distribute as many as 860 flats every week.This is big enough, by Mrs. Gean\u2019s measure: Gaviotas and Seascapes alongside two new Spanish varieties, a one-acre patch of even more delicate French berries called Mara des Bois, tomatoes, green beans and products made from anything that comes back from the market unsold, including tomato salsa, fruit jam and pickled beans. Harry\u2019s Berries, she says, is done expanding.Three generations live on the property \u2014 the Geans in a house they built out of metal shipping containers, along with their three grown children, who work the markets; their spouses; and seven grandchildren, ages 20 years down to 5 months. Mrs. Gean makes dinner for 15 every Tuesday night, when dessert could be strawberry pie from a family recipe, or Ms. Silverton\u2019s strawberry shortcake, or strawberry ice cream produced in a barter arrangement with a local producer.The farm itself is as good as Disneyland as far as Mrs. Gean, 60, is concerned. Mr. Gean, 63, creates oversize junk-art sculptures that are scattered around the property, and they have installed a party room, outdoor dance floor, aboveground swimming pool, swing set, trampoline and playhouse.A framed set of old photographs hangs on the exterior wall of a small, one-story office \u2014 of Mr. Iwamoto, who died in 1993, just as the new farm was taking shape, and his wife, Yayoi, who died in January. Mrs. Gean\u2019s next project is a Japanese tea garden to honor her parents, which she describes to her grandchildren as \u201csort of a museum of your great-grandparents.\u201d\u201cSomeone will continue,\u201d she said, imagining Harry\u2019s Berries as a fourth-generation farm someday. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not just a farm. It\u2019s a family tradition.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of Harry Iwamoto\u2019s late wife. She was Yayoi Iwamoto, not Yoyai.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

He has warned investors that turnarounds take time, and he has appointed new heads of product and engineering to assist him in overhauling the company.The goal for Twitter is to translate its enormous impact on media and culture, and the preferred means for President Trump to communicate, into a booming business, something that has eluded it so far.\u201cBy Wall Street standards, Twitter\u2019s a diving joke.

{"Headline": "How Six Degrees Became a Forever Meme", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byWhile the idea that we\u2019re all connected may seem old hat in the age of the internet, fascination with it has yielded its own rich web of associations over the years. On the eve of the play\u2019s first Broadway revival, which opens on Tuesday, April 25, here\u2019s an unscientific look at a concept that links, among other things, the first issue of Psychology Today, the star of \u201cFootloose\u201d and a shirtless J. J. Abrams.Mr. Guare, in a recent interview, said he first encountered the six-degrees concept in 1967, in the inaugural issue of Psychology Today, which featured a cover story about the psychologist Stanley Milgram\u2019s \u201csmall world\u201d experiment. The experiment involved giving a letter to random people in Omaha and Wichita, Kan., with instructions to give it to someone who could give it to someone who would help it reach a designated individual in Boston.Evidently, Ouisa Kittredge, one half of the couple in Mr. Guare\u2019s play, saw the same article.The phrase is often seen as an inspiring, even mystical symbol. But the speech, Mr. Guare notes, was meant ironically, as a comment on racial exclusion and social stratification in America.\u201cThe nightmare of the play becomes finding the right six people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can find everyone in the world, but you can\u2019t find one black man whose name you don\u2019t know.\u201dMr. Guare said he was \u201ctickled\u201d when he started seeing the phrase \u201csix degrees of separation\u201d in different contexts: an ad for Air France, a newspaper article about the 1992 presidential election. And then came Kevin Bacon.The three friends performed their parlor trick on \u201cThe Jon Stewart Show\u201d on MTV a few months later. Next came a book (with an introduction by Mr. Bacon) and a board game.\u201cPeople would come up to me and touch me and say, \u2018I\u2019m one degree!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what was going on.\u201d\u201cI did it mainly for myself and my friends,\u201d Mr. Tjaden, now a professor at James Madison University, said in a phone interview. \u201cThey sent the link to their friends, who sent it to a couple of their friends, and before too long it was famous.\u201dThe Oracle of Bacon still has about 10,000 visitors on an average day, according to Patrick Reynolds, a software engineer in Florida who runs it.\u201cTo me, it says that a meme never really goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything lives forever until you pull the plug.\u201dThe article, which was later adapted for Mr. Gladwell\u2019s monster best seller \u201cThe Tipping Point,\u201d dug into research by Milgram, Mark Granovetter (who developed the concept of strong versus weak social ties) and others. But the big ideas, Mr. Gladwell said in a phone interview, came second.\u201cShe was kind of a hilarious person, and I wanted an excuse to hang out with her,\u201d he said. \u201cThe article was really a delivery vehicle for Lois Weisberg.\u201dThe article popularized the idea of \u201cconnectors\u201d: people who know unusually large numbers of people and are unusually given to making introductions, the rough equivalent of hubs in a computer network.\u201cNot all degrees are created equal,\u201d Mr. Gladwell wrote. The article\u2019s teaser summary put it even more dramatically: \u201cShe\u2019s a grandmother, she lives in a big house in Chicago, and you\u2019ve never heard of her. Does she run the world?\u201d\u201cI think I made her life a little difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t interested in celebrity of any kind.\u201dThe play, Mr. Guare said, is \u201can antique piece.\u201d Nowadays, a quick Google search \u2014 or text message to the Kittredges\u2019 children, whom Paul supposedly knows from Harvard \u2014 would have blown Paul\u2019s cover immediately.On the other hand, social media has made it possible to be \u201cfriends\u201d with people you don\u2019t actually know, while also providing vast data sets for calculating the number of links separating people scattered around the world.The six-degrees idea has a cosmic undertow that writers and directors have been happy to ride. The movies \u201cBabel\u201d and \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d as well as \u201cLost,\u201d the head-scratching television series cocreated by J. J.

The movies \u201cCrash\u201d and \u201cMagnolia\u201d (both set in Los Angeles) and the short-lived ABC series \u201cSix Degrees\u201d (another Abrams project, set in New York) offered more localized versions.But here\u2019s a real coincidence for you: Back in 1993, Mr. Abrams was an aspiring actor whose film credits included \u2026 a small part in the film adaptation of \u201cSix Degrees of Separation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019ve personally realized tonight that it is possible to strongly oppose a leader overall, yet support specific actions. Tonight, I proudly support the United State\u2019s leadership, specifically POTUS, in our stand against Assad.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s tough not to want to bomb the Assad regime into the stone age for all of the atrocities it\u2019s committed.

There is never a 0 percent chance of civilian casualties.\u201d\u201cTrump doesn\u2019t give a hoot about the Syrian people. There are only two reasons he would undertake a military response: (1) to distract from the net of investigations that are currently swirling and tightening around the neck of the White House; and (2) to appeal to his base of small-minded supporters who will eat this tough guy act up and turn out in droves for Trump\u2019s victory tour once we\u2019ve bombed the hell of Syria.\u201d\u201cIf the U.S. intelligence community is right in its analysis, then this is a course of action that should be supported to an extent.\u201cIf their assessment is correct, as long as it\u2019s limited in nature, striking the Syrian Air Force units responsible for the massacre will send a message to the world, and to the Assad regime in particular, that using W.M.D.s against civilians \u2014 including women, children and the elderly \u2014 is utterly unacceptable to the international community of nations, which is what the Assad regime has been doing to its own people for years with total impunity.\u201cThe world simply cannot allow such breaches of international law regarding W.M.D.s to go unnoticed. That would just encourage both current and future war criminals to do the same.\u201d\u201cI genuinely liked most of Mr. Obama\u2019s domestic policies, but his foreign policy lacked moral and personal courage. I am confident enough to praise President Trump for his quick and decisive (and in my mind totally justified) military action.\u201cThe deliberate use of chemical weapons against civilian targets disqualifies a government from the community of nations.\u201d\u201cAssad has shown that he will not respond to reason. Allowing him to continue attacking civilians would set a terrible precedent on the world stage. Platitudes such as \u2018violence only begets violence\u2019 have no use when the initial perpetrator has exhibited irrational evil. There must be consequences for such horrific actions. Although I thought I\u2019d never write this, Donald Trump did the right thing.\u201d\u201cTrump doesn\u2019t care enough about suffering Syrian babies to give them refuge in the U.S., so why does he suddenly care about dead ones?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t these the same children that Trump and the White House are shutting the door on?\u201d\u201cAll the U.S. needs to do is set up and defend safe havens near the Syrian borders and save as many civilians as possible without directly engaging.

{"Headline": "Why Instagram Is Becoming Facebook\u2019s Next Facebook", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAt a recent all-hands meeting with employees, Kevin Systrom, a founder and chief executive of Instagram, showed off one of his favorite charts: Days to Reach the Next 100 Million Users.\u201cIt\u2019s the only graph in the company that we celebrate when it declines,\u201d Mr. Systrom said in an interview last week at Instagram\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.Not long ago, the Facebook-owned photo-based social network grew at a steady clip. Every nine months, without fail, Instagram added another 100 million users somewhere in the world. Then, last year, it began racking up more new users every day. It grew to 600 million users from 500 million in only six months.On Wednesday, just four months after reaching that milestone, the company announced it had reached another: About 700 million people now use Instagram every month, with about 400 million of them checking in daily.I had come to visit Mr. Systrom because I\u2019m one of the new 100 million. I technically joined Instagram years ago but used it only occasionally. In the past few months, however, I began diving in more often, and now I check it several times a day. As I used Instagram more, I realized something about the photo-sharing app: It\u2019s becoming Facebook\u2019s next Facebook.But once I started using Instagram, I discovered something surprising: Instagram has improved on the features it took from Snapchat. Over much of the past year it has added lots of other features, too. Among them are a feed ranked by personalization algorithms rather than by chronology, live streaming, the ability to post photo galleries and a (controversial) new app design and logo.Instagram is now substantially changing the daily experience of using the service at a speed that would ordinarily feel reckless for a network of its size. But rather than alienating existing users, its confident moves seem to be paying off.This is difficult to quantify. My subjective experience may not match yours (lots of people, for example, say they hate the new ranked feed). But for me, Instagram\u2019s many changes have made for a social network that feels more useful, interesting and fun than it was last year. Part of it is the new features themselves, but a bigger reason is the greater use that the features have inspired. Networks are better when more people use them more often; the more I\u2019ve used Instagram recently, the more stuff I\u2019ve seen from more people, and the more I want to use it some more.In some ways, this is not surprising. Instagram has been growing like crazy essentially since it went live in 2010, and under Facebook \u2014 which bought the company for $1 billion five years ago \u2014 it has had ample resources to keep that up. But with 700 million users, it\u2019s in virtually uncharted territory.There are bigger networks: Facebook has nearly two billion users a month, and two instant-messaging apps owned by Facebook, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, have grown past the one-billion-user mark. In China, WeChat also has more users.But last year, you might have said there was a question whether a picture-based service like Instagram could have reached similar scale \u2014 whether it was universal enough, whether there were enough people whose phones could handle it, whether it could survive greater competition from newer photo networks like Snapchat. Maybe those problems or others will rear up in the future, and growth could yet stall. But for now, Instagram seems to have overcome any perceived hurdles. It seems to have reached escape velocity.Mr. Systrom said this plan to rapidly speed up Instagram\u2019s pace of change to attract more users was deliberate.\u201cThe primary reason we\u2019ve scaled more quickly in the last 100 million is that we\u2019ve figured out that as we\u2019ve scaled, we\u2019ve had to unbreak ourselves,\u201d he said. What he meant was that Instagram systematically analyzed all the bottlenecks to its service and tried to eliminate them. Then it looked for potential opportunities to better serve users and tried to put them in place as fast as possible.This sounds trivial \u2014 aren\u2019t all companies looking to constantly improve? \u2014 but social networks are sometimes held hostage by their most loyal users, who tend to hate change (cough, Twitter, cough). Facebook bucked that trend; as it grew, it constantly adapted its features to become more things to more people. Mr. Systrom is following the same playbook.\u201cMy favorite thing to ask the team is, how large do you think Instagram will be eventually?\u201d he said. \u201cUsually you get to some large number, and it\u2019s definitely more than two times the size we are now. So I can confidently say that most of the people who\u2019ll eventually use Instagram don\u2019t use Instagram now.\u201dMr. Systrom is a fan of academic business theories, especially Clay Christensen\u2019s, whose \u201cInnovator\u2019s Dilemma\u201d addresses the tension between serving an incumbent audience at the expense of a much greater potential one. The realization that Instagram could become much bigger than it is now was freeing, Mr. Systrom said; it gives the company the confidence to keep changing.Some of the bottlenecks the company has addressed in the past year are internal. For example, Mr. Systrom and his co-founder, Mike Krieger, realized that one of the primary holdups was their own decision-making. So in the past three months, they started holding meetings in which they just make a bunch of decisions.\u201cWe have a doc in which we list out the inventory of decisions on products \u2014 as if it\u2019s stacked up in front of a machine, waiting to be processed,\u201d Mr. Systrom said. \u201cAnd then we have sessions where we sit down and we decide. You just work through the decisions.\u201d\u201cWe consistently find that performance improvements lead to usage improvements at the level of what a new feature would add,\u201d Mr. Krieger said.And then there\u2019s Instagram\u2019s decision to incorporate features developed by Snapchat, about which Mr. Systrom was unapologetic. He credited Snapchat with creating Stories, but argued that Stories was no mere feature, but instead a brand-new digital format \u2014 something like digital feeds (for instance, Facebook\u2019s News Feed or Twitter\u2019s stream of tweets) \u2014 that could be broadly reinterpreted across different products.\u201cI don\u2019t know much about the history of cars, but let\u2019s say the Model T was the first car,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what do you think the first car company other than Ford was thinking? Are we copying Ford, or is this a new mode of transportation that everyone is going to have different takes on?\u201dThis can sound a little too defensive, but it\u2019s not exactly wrong. If you compare how Stories works on Instagram with how it works on Snapchat, they are indeed similar. But the context of the two apps \u2014 the fact that Instagram tends to foster larger, more public networks in which people maintain a more polished profile, while Snapchat encourages a smaller, more intimate network \u2014 does change the nature of the format. Stories on Instagram feels different from Stories on Snapchat because there are different people on both networks using it for different purposes.And for me, the Instagram version often offers a superior experience for one obvious reason: I know more people there, and you most likely do, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Fertile Mind of Sophie Calle", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "France\u2019s most famous conceptual artist might finally be getting the attention she deserves \u2014 in America.Supported byIT\u2019S POURING WHEN the taxi leaves me in front of Sophie Calle\u2019s building in Malakoff, a working-class suburb 10 minutes from Paris. At first I question the address: The building \u2014 gray and nondescript \u2014 is as dreary as the day. It\u2019s not the home you\u2019d expect for a conceptual artist whose work can be uncommonly frisky. But inside, there\u2019s a leafy courtyard ringed by ateliers, one of which is blazing with light. I spot the artist through her studio\u2019s floor-to-ceiling windows. She meets me at the door looking classic kooky-sexy Calle: low-cut black cocktail dress, elaborately crocheted black tights, massive tinted glasses and sheepskin slippers.She is smiling broadly and caressing her stomach. Judging by its shape and size, she\u2019s eight months pregnant. Calle is 63, so this is surprising. On the other hand, given her affection for the flagrantly absurd, it is not surprising at all. After we exchange kisses, she ushers me in, explaining that she has turned the photo shoot for this story into an opportunity to fulfill a project she never got around to: giving birth to her beloved cat, Souris (\u201cMouse\u201d), who died three years ago. This makes sense: Calle\u2019s work is famously first person; why not manipulate this situation into a piece of art?As we settle in her living area, Calle springs up to adjust logs in the fireplace, cradling her belly, nearly forgetting that it is a conceit. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to stay like this for a month,\u201d she says. \u201cI find it attractive. I want people to give me a seat on the bus.\u201d Later, she will lift her dress to reveal a fur collar stuffed inside her movie prop belly and specially constructed underpants.As with many artists, you either get her or you don\u2019t. To detractors, her voyeurism and life-as-art approach are the definition of TMI \u2014 exploitative, invasive, silly if not simply crazy. (One male critic likened her aesthetic to that of a \u201cmental disorder.\u201d) For others, Calle\u2019s freewheeling imagination, coupled with an ability to turn emotional chaos into compelling narratives, is thrilling. So too is her disregard of gender limitations; her fearless lack of vanity and indifference to what is considered appropriate is reminiscent of her fellow countrywoman Isabelle Huppert. \u201cSophie gives me a sense that there\u2019s room for me in the world,\u201d says Miranda July, a writer and artist who has taken similar hits for her so-called strangeness.The Fort Mason exhibition is extensive, yet given Calle\u2019s international stardom and aesthetic reach, it is puzzling that she has never had a full-career retrospective here. America has, to some extent, kept Calle at a distance. I suspect she is too cerebral, that her work is too reliant on text. (You can spend hours at her shows, soaking up every word on the walls.) And yet her art, in various ways, has predicted our current cultural moment, from the staged intimacy of reality TV and the faux intimacy of social media to the autofiction of Karl Ove Knausgard and Chris Kraus. Even Taylor Swift\u2019s boyfriend-dishing pop songs owe something to Calle. Consciously or not, her influence is everywhere.5 Photos\u201cTHAT\u2019S MY BOYFRIEND,\u201d says Calle, pointing to a stuffed spider monkey dangling from the horn of a bull\u2019s head over the fireplace. She means that the monkey is named for the architect she has been seeing for 12 years because \u201che is very sweet like that, skinny also.\u201dTaxidermy animals take pride of place in Calle\u2019s home. By the dining table is a startling tableau, a grouping of beautifully preserved animals \u2014 foxes, kittens, dogs, a bear cub, a baby zebra, some tricked out with jewelry. \u201cHow you start collecting, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says with a shrug. \u201cBut then I start to give them names of friends \u2014 Dominique, Florence, Rafael. Every time I have a new friend I have to find an animal that looks like them.\u201d The effect of all these stuffed creatures is incongruously cheerful, perhaps because, as Calle says, to her they are \u201ctotally alive, people I see every day.\u201d Well, most are. \u201cMy father has since died,\u201d she says, pointing to a tiger wearing a crown. (A giraffe, named for her mother, reigns over the studio.)With her parents gone and a distant relationship with her brother, Antoine, Calle\u2019s life now revolves around her friends. She has a lot of them. \u201cI would be quite lonely otherwise,\u201d she says. I ask what is missing from her life. \u201cChildren \u2014 for the good,\u201d she says. \u201cI am very happy that is missing \u2014 the trouble of children.\u201d She finds the expectation that she would want them \u2014 from women in particular \u2014 a kind of tyranny. \u201cI hate when people take out photos of their children at dinner!\u201d she says, and often responds by sharing shots of her cat. Are there children that she likes? \u201cWhen they are 18, rarely before.\u201dCalle\u2019s work often features family and friends. A fear of being forgotten on her birthday prompted 13 years of elaborate dinners in which she would invite the number of people that equaled her age. (The fear disappeared at 40 and so did the dinners.) Guests were directed to bring a gift, to be displayed permanently in a vitrine, resulting in the sculpture series \u201cThe Birthday Ceremony,\u201d from 1998. Her mother, Monique Sindler \u2014 described by Calle as a \u201ccoquette,\u201d and notably quixotic \u2014 would invariably give her something practical, like a stove. \u201cI think because she knew it wouldn\u2019t fit in the vitrine,\u201d Calle says. \u201cIt was like a game, outwitting me.\u201dYou are like your mother, I offer. \u201cI like rituals, to make games, not only in my work but my life, so I took this from her,\u201d she agrees. What about humor? \u201cI\u2019m not as funny as my mother,\u201d Calle says, \u201cnot by far.\u201dOf her parents she says, \u201cThey really were my life.\u201d In the 2012 documentary \u201cUntitled,\u201d directed by Victoria Clay Mendoza, Calle is seen buying a plot in the cemetery of Bolinas, Calif., where she lived at 18; it was here that she began her career, photographing the words \u201cMother\u201d and \u201cFather\u201d on two engraved headstones. Mendoza asks her what she would want on her own headstone. Calle pauses before answering, \u201cDaughter.\u201dWhy not \u201cFriend\u201d or \u201cArtist,\u201d I ask. Calle thought of those, too, \u201cbut \u2018Daughter, Friend, Artist\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s becoming a bit much, no?\u201dAnyway, there is time for epitaphs. \u201cI don\u2019t feel close enough,\u201d she says, though she adds that a friend recently sent her the perfect one-phrase biography. It was \u201csomething a person had written on Instagram or Facebook: \u2018Sophie Calle, artist without a child by choice.\u2019\u2009\u201d She laughs. \u201cI would never dare to do this, but I loved it.\u201dCALLE\u2019S NEAT TRICK is to create art as a way of distancing herself from emotion while provoking great tides of it in viewers. She does this by tackling themes that anyone can relate to, but her approach, with its rigorous exclusion of sentimentality, has something to do with it, too. Calle specifically asked the women responding for the project \u201cTake Care of Yourself\u201d to avoid pathos or pathology, to analyze rather than vent, resulting in a work that champions imagination, and is all the more moving for its lack of negativity or bitterness. For \u201cVoir la mer,\u201d what Calle calls her \u201cfirst silent work,\u201d she abandoned text altogether, limiting the project to digital films. Calle\u2019s idea was to transport poor Turkish men, women and children to the sea for the first time in their lives. \u201cThey were too moved [for me] to ask questions,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd what can you say about the sea? Even speaking very well they would say banalities. The horror was that they\u2019ve never seen the sea, not what they think of it.\u201d\u201cRachel Monique,\u201d which has evolved over the years (and will be included in the Fort Mason show), debuted at the 2007 Venice Biennale, and is as powerful an evocation of the complex mother-daughter relationship as I have ever seen. The 2012 Avignon Festival included a marathon performance by Calle: a 30-hour reading of 20-years\u2019 worth of her mother\u2019s diaries. She didn\u2019t look at them before and she has never read them again. \u201cI knew the only way to read it was in public, in a performance,\u201d she says, \u201cotherwise my heart would have stopped.\u201d There was also an 11-minute video, \u201cCouldn\u2019t Capture Death,\u201d recording the last moments of Monique\u2019s life. For those offended by this, Calle says, \u201cThey didn\u2019t know my mother. I asked everyone who was close to her if they thought this was O.K. All of them said she would like it. She knew what I was doing; she gave me the diaries, she knew the camera was there.\u201d Indeed, when it was installed at the foot of what would be her death bed, Monique \u2014 who had always wanted to be a character in her daughter\u2019s work \u2014 said, \u201cAt last!\u201dGiven this, I wonder if Monique might have been jealous of her daughter\u2019s fame. \u201cNo, no, not at all,\u201d Calle says. She tells me about an opening in 1991, for the group show \u201cDislocations\u201d at MoMA. For Calle\u2019s contribution, \u201cGhosts,\u201d she asked the museum to remove paintings from their usual locations, then had members of the staff describe them from memory. At the opening, Monique turned to her daughter and said, \u201c\u2009\u2018You fool them all!\u2019 Which meant,\u201d Calle clarifies, \u201cthat she thought what I did was not real artistic work, that I was so bright that I had manipulated people into thinking it was art. She was not jealous, she was super proud.\u201d This strikes me as a pretty backhanded compliment. \u201cDid you agree?\u201d I ask. \u201cNo, no,\u201d Calle says. \u201cMy work is my work. The goal was the wall, the quality of the work, not to have fun.\u201d Eventually, she adds, her mother came to see her as a \u201cserious artist.\u201dHer father, Robert, a doctor and early collector of Pop and Conceptual art, never needed to be convinced. For Calle, her career, from the start, was a way \u201cto do something he would love. I looked at what he had on his walls and did what he liked.\u201d Her parents separated when she was young; she lived with her mother in Paris and saw her father every Sunday. \u201cHe was much more serious \u2014 a hard worker, practical, thoughtful. I don\u2019t even know how they spent one day together.\u201dAfter Robert died, at 94 in 2014, Calle suffered a heart attack. \u201cFor two years I was with no ideas. I was paralyzed,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt fine about it, but my boyfriend says I was not so fine. He could feel I\u2019d lost something.\u201d To her mind there was a logic to her work ending with her father\u2019s death. \u201cI\u2019d lost my eye,\u201d she says. \u201cNo need to seduce anyone anymore. I thought, I\u2019ve accomplished a few things. It\u2019s O.K.\u201dThen the ideas started coming again. \u201cI realized, it\u2019s not true, because I was getting excited. Maybe I was slowly falling asleep.\u201dCALLE IS DIGGING through the piles of books stacked on her dining room table. She finds what she\u2019s looking for \u2014 the catalog for the B\u00f6rse prize. She wants me to read the artist Laurie Anderson\u2019s essay about her. The two met at the Telluride Film Festival, at a 1996 screening of the film \u201cNo Sex Last Night (Double Blind),\u201d Calle\u2019s collaboration with the American artist Greg Shephard. (A document of the couple\u2019s cross-country trip and high-concept marriage at a drive-in church in Vegas \u2014 they later divorced \u2014 it has the prickly wit and poignancy of one of Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cBefore\u201d films.) Anderson was riveted by the short feature, and the two became great friends and traveling companions, to the point of exchanging mock vows at a San Francisco church in 2015.So, Anderson\u2019s essay: \u201cRead it,\u201d Calle says. \u201cIt\u2019s funny.\u201d Whenever I laugh, she looks up expectantly. \u201cWhat?\u201d she says. I read Anderson\u2019s description of Calle\u2019s methods for cheering her up: \u201cI would say sometimes that I don\u2019t have any energy. I keep getting lost and I don\u2019t know where my work is going. \u2018Of course you\u2019re depressed,\u2019 Sophie would say. \u2018You look [awful].\u2019 And off we\u2019d go to Century 21.\u201d Calle laughs hardest when I read this bit: \u201cWhen Sophie tries out her American accent with \u2018Enjoy,\u2019 or \u2018Have a nice day,\u2019 her mouth looks like it\u2019s full of battery acid and nails.\u201dCalle, who has lived in America at various points, is perplexed by aspects of it, like our obsession with social niceties. Currently she is irritated by young women speaking in high, childlike voices. \u201cI don\u2019t know where they invented this,\u201d she says, after making a hilarious squawking sound. \u201cWomen weren\u2019t talking like that when I first lived there at 18. Where does it come from? That confuse me completely \u2014 an invention that is so not sexy and yet is so fashionable and which is a construction.\u201d If a waitress speaks like that, Calle can\u2019t ask for food and won\u2019t return to the restaurant.As I go, Calle points out Souris\u2019s grave in the garden. Why hasn\u2019t she gotten another cat? \u201cBecause I discovered complete freedom,\u201d she says. Last year she spent four months in Bolinas. \u201cI could not have done that with a cat, or when my father was old.\u201d His death, she says, has proved less painful than she thought it might be. \u201cI lived most of my life with the fear of not being able to accept it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m more fearless now.\u201dCalle speaks of the logistics of death with typical pragmatism. \u201cI have no idea what happens,\u201d she says. On the other hand, it would offer an opportunity for new rules and another game. \u201cIf I managed to get one in Montparnasse,\u201d she says, \u201cmaybe it should be the start of a new cycle. I\u2019ll get one in every place I love. And then the problem will be for my friends. Maybe they can put my hair somewhere, and my hand in another place.\u201d Calle laughs. \u201cI think I should leave them with the trouble, that way they have to spend a little time around me.\u201dAn article on Page 114 this weekend about the quirky, unconventional work of the French artist Sophie Calle, which blurs the distinction between art and life, misidentifies the medium in which her \u201cThe Birthday Ceremony\u201d series and her \u201cVoir la mer\u201d series were made. \u201cThe Birthday Ceremony\u201d is comprised of sculptures, not photographs, and \u201cVoir la mer\u201d is comprised of digital films, not photographs. The article also omits part of the title of a Calle show. It is \u201cMy Mother, My Cat, My Father, in that order\u201d \u2014 not merely \u201cMy Mother, My Cat, My Father.\u201d In addition, the article misstates the year a show by Calle will open at the Mus\u00e9e de la Chasse et de la Nature. It will be shown starting in October 2017, not 2018. The article also misstates part of the name of the organization curating Calle\u2019s upcoming show \u201cSophie Calle: Missing.\u201d It is Ars Citizen, not Arts Citizen. And, finally, the article refers incorrectly to Calle\u2019s connection to a burial plot at Green-Wood cemetery in Brooklyn. She was offered the plot as part of a site-specific project she is making there; she has not bought a burial plot there.All artwork \u00a9 2017 Sophie Calle / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / ADAGP, ParisAdvertisement"}

On the other side are those who see only news that fits with their suburban or rural viewpoints. People who buy designer clothes and pretend to do hard work versus people who actually get their hands (or jeans) dirty.\u201cIf Facebook were to take more significant action, like hiring human editors, creating a reputational system or paying journalists, the company would become something it has long resisted: a media company rather than a neutral tech platform,\u201d Farhad writes.That\u2019s exactly what some critics have said Facebook should do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Haiti\u2019s Violent Politics Are Taken to Court. In Boston.", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byA mysterious death, a decade-old murder and a human rights lawsuit in federal court in Boston are casting a light on the patronage politics of Haiti and its culture of impunity.The lawsuit stems from a 2008 attack on a radio station run by a local government opposition party in Les Irois, Haiti, in which one man was left blind in one eye and another, Nissage Martyr, lost his leg. The suit also accused the mayor there of orchestrating a murder in the middle of a street and ordering thugs to burn down an entire community.In an interview in late March, Mr. Martyr said that during the raid, the mayor, Jean M. Viliena, had put a foot on his chest and a 9-millimeter handgun to his ear, beaten him and ordered someone else to shoot. The gunshot wound led to the loss of his leg.Mr. Viliena was indicted in the attack, but was released from jail and fled Haiti, moving to suburban Boston, where he became a school bus driver and drove for Uber.\u201cI am still scared, because I don\u2019t know what can happen,\u201d Mr. Martyr said in a phone interview from Les Irois. \u201cEven though he\u2019s not in Haiti, he is still very powerful. He can call his supporters at any time and order them to kill anyone, even me. So as long as I don\u2019t find justice, as long as this guy is not in jail, yes, I will be scared.\u201dLast month, Mr. Martyr and two other men filed the human rights lawsuit. But the next day, March 24, the case took another twist when Mr. Martyr suddenly became violently ill and died while watching a soccer match with his neighbors. He was 56 and had been in good health, his lawyers said. His lawyers are demanding an autopsy and a full investigation, but the authorities have not responded, and his body remains at the morgue.Reached by telephone, Mr. Viliena said his lawyer had advised him not to comment.Haiti has long been roiled by political turmoil. Government leaders ruled with the freedom to kill political opponents and silence dissent. The United States and other countries have poured millions of dollars into strengthening Haiti\u2019s rule of law, but experts say it remains difficult to file criminal charges against people in power or their associates. The plaintiffs in the human rights case have already filed eight complaints with local and international agencies, the lawsuit says.Haiti\u2019s president, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, took office in February. He is the handpicked successor of the former president Michel Martelly, whose term was marred by a weak, corruptible judiciary and ties to human rights abusers, drug traffickers and kidnappers who avoided jail time. One of Mr. Martelly\u2019s loyalists is Mr. Viliena.When the country failed to hold elections for over a year, Mr. Martelly ruled the nation by decree with the power to appoint every officer-holder in the country. Among Mr. Martelly\u2019s moves was to name Mr. Viliena, the former mayor, to be the top executive of Les Irois \u2014 even though by then he lived in Malden, Mass., and had an open murder charge against him.\u201cA common sentiment in Haiti is that justice is something for sale to the highest and most powerful bidder,\u201d said Robert E. Maguire, a Georgetown University professor who has testified as an expert witness in other civil cases filed in American federal courts against Haitian officials. \u201cThe judiciary is weak and insecure, and usually subservient to the country\u2019s president.\u201dTo Mr. Martyr\u2019s lawyers, the question is whether this history will repeat itself.\u201cWith Martelly, it\u2019s easy to say that there has been a pattern of impunity, not just with Viliena but with various officials accused of crimes or human rights abuses who have been treated as untouchable \u2014 that was the M.O.,\u201d said Scott Gilmore, a lawyer at the Center for Justice and Accountability, which filed Mr. Martyr\u2019s suit. \u201cThis case is going to represent a bit of a test case for them to see if they continue in that pattern Martelly followed or make a clean break.\u201dNeither the current nor former president responded to a request for comment.The federal lawsuit is based on the 1991 Torture Victim Protection Act, which allows victims of human rights abuses overseas to seek compensation for their injuries from people who were acting in an official capacity. But the victims also want Mr. Viliena, who has said he is innocent, to be tried in Haiti on the charges involving the raid.Other defendants, including Mr. Viliena\u2019s father, have been convicted there on charges including murder and complicity in murder, but were released from prison early, Mr. Gilmore said.\u201cThe irony is that extradition isn\u2019t necessary, because he travels\u201d back and forth to Haiti, Mr. Gilmore said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to extradite. They need to arrest him the next time he\u2019s in the country.\u201dMr. Viliena has demanded on Facebook that his associates be released from jail. \u201cGod saved my life, because there was a big plot manufactured against me,\u201d he wrote in 2015, when his associates\u2019 trial took place in Haiti.Jean Richardson Philippe, a lawyer who represented Mr. Viliena in Haiti, said Haitian law allowed a judge to stay court proceedings and release suspects, as happened in Mr. Viliena\u2019s case.\u201cThere were no politics involved here,\u201d Mr. Philippe said in a telephone interview. \u201cObviously he denied it. If he had admitted it, they would have locked him up.\u201dWhen the human rights lawsuit became public, Uber barred Mr. Viliena, and his bus driver\u2019s license in the Boston suburbs was suspended.The suit contends that the human rights violations were made possible because a power vacuum after a 2004 coup in Haiti gave rise to politically aligned militias. The one in Les Irois, where Mr. Martyr lived, became closely tied to Mr. Martelly, the former president. In another episode, the mayor is accused instructing associates to burn down the homes of his political opponents.In 2007, a former Haitian Army colonel, Carl Dorelien, was sued in Florida under the Torture Victim Protection Act over the torture of a labor leader and the death of a man in a massacre in Raboteau, Haiti. Mr. Dorelien had won $3.2 million in the Florida lottery and was forced to pay his victims.In 2006, the center won a case in New York against Emmanuel Constant, the leader of a paramilitary group who was accused of killing and torturing supporters of the former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. He remains imprisoned on an unrelated matter.In the lawsuit against Mr. Viliena, a victory would be largely symbolic, because an apparently unemployed school bus driver is unlikely to have many assets. If Mr. Viliena is not a United States citizen, he could be deported, as has occurred in other cases involving foreigners accused of atrocities. A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the agency could not speak about individual cases.Nicole Phillips, a lawyer at the Institute for Justice and Democracy, a Boston-based group that helped prepare the lawsuit against Mr. Viliena, said the witnesses and plaintiffs were in peril.\u201cTheir lives are still in danger,\u201d Ms. Phillips said a few days before Mr. Martyr\u2019s death. \u201cNone of them have slept through the night.\u201dJess Bidgood contributed reporting, and Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Roundup: Facebook Loses Fight on New York Warrant Order", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byBitsInternet civil liberties advocates did not get the news they wanted from New York\u2019s top court on Tuesday.Facebook hit the end of the line in a long fight with New York prosecutors when the State Court of Appeals, in a 5-to-1 ruling, upheld lower court rulings that New York law does not allow a social media company to appeal a judge\u2019s decision to issue search warrants in a criminal case.This is a concern for big internet companies that hold information for billions of users. In recent years, prosecutors have become more aggressive about asking for so-called bulk warrant orders. These sometimes come with open-ended requests for access to users\u2019 data, meaning there is little or no time limit involved.Internet companies argue that these open-ended requests, which often come with gag orders prohibiting the companies from informing users about the warrants, are excessive. But law enforcement officials argue that the companies, as service providers, have no standing in court to argue against the warrants. In addition, prosecutors say they often need the gag orders to prevent their targets from learning that they are under investigation.For now, at least, the courts are siding with law enforcement.Advertisement"}

Immigration agents were said to be planning a raid. They could come any minute.In this fraying, blue-collar city, where a quarter of the 95,000 residents are foreign born, word whipped across social media. Children were kept home from school. Families sorted through plans for what to do in case one among them was swept up.Waves of panic have become familiar since Donald J. Trump, who has promised wide-scale deportations of illegal immigrants, became president. Federal agents have made scores of publicized arrests around the nation.As communities wrestle with the administration\u2019s new policy, they face another challenge, too: distinguishing between verifiable reports of arrests and empty rumors driven by fear.In New York, there was talk of raids on trains headed to the Bronx and in Queens, and of checkpoints on Long Island \u2014 all later deemed false. In Kansas City, unsubstantiated word of roundups outside churches kept some people from going to Mass.\u201cAny smidgen of information just spreads like wildfire,\u201d said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group based in Washington.This is the story of one such report, and how it spread, hour by hour. It is based on interviews with local activists, officials and residents, many of whom refused to be identified because they or their family members are not here legally or they fear retribution.What was certain: a conversation overheard in a restaurant was quickly amplified and eventually sent much of this community into full-scale panic.What no one knew for sure was whether it was true.A woman from Guatemala who works in a Brockton restaurant overhears customers say that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are planning a raid Tuesday or Wednesday, according to Isabel Lopez, a community organizer who works in Brockton and knows the woman.The restaurant worker, who is also an advocate for immigrants, attends a community meeting at the United Methodist Church and talks about what she heard. The group discusses getting the information out via Facebook and text messages.A longtime local resident originally from Puerto Rico who had attended the meeting at the church posts on Facebook in Spanish: \u201cDear Friends. If you have nothing to do in the streets, don\u2019t come out, as ICE will be having presence in Brockton on Wed.\u201d She has since deleted the post.Word has started spreading. A naturalized Brazilian immigrant is on her way to work when she sees her mother, who is just home from an overnight shift at a Brockton bakery.\u201cShe was like, you know, everybody at work is going crazy, because they\u2019re saying ICE is coming,\u201d the woman says.During the day, reports of a possible raid flood her social media feeds. \u201cEven people on Snapchat were talking about it,\u201d she says, recalling one of the messages: \u201c\u2018Guys, be careful. ICE is out in Brockton.\u2019\u201dShe adds: \u201cI got the following information from my friend in the Latin community: \u2018I have a message for the immigrant community of Brockton. Please be careful on Wednesday 29. ICE will be in Brockton on that day.\u2019\u201dIn an interview later, Ms. DuBois said she had heard about the expected raid from multiple people and saw the Spanish-language Facebook post before posting her own warning.Ms. Lopez, the community organizer, sends a text to members of the clergy saying she has heard the rumor that ICE would be in Brockton. She urges the immigrant community\u2019s Rapid Response team, watchdogs who alert one another when they see arrests or other activities that cause them concern, to be vigilant.Carlha Toussaint, an organizer with the Coalition for Social Justice in Brockton, starts receiving phone calls from worried immigrants. She sets in motion a \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d campaign, with field workers making phone calls. They also go to public housing developments to drop off small red laminated cards that list immigrants\u2019 rights, such as not having to open their doors to agents unless they have warrants.Shawn Neudauer, the public affairs officer for ICE in New England, receives the first of several calls from news organizations asking about the reports. In an interview later, he said there had been no \u201coperational activity as was suggested\u201d in Brockton. ICE, he said, does not conduct indiscriminate raids or sweeps, but rather, \u201ctargeted enforcement\u201d in which agents look for specific people but may also arrest other undocumented people they encounter.\u201cRoutine immigration enforcement,\u201d he adds, \u201chappens every day.\u201dBy now, fear is saturating the neighborhoods and prompting many immigrants to stay out of public view.A 31-year-old mental health counselor from Haiti says her cousin calls to tell her to stay inside because ICE is coming. \u201cI was terrified,\u201d she says. She keeps her daughter, 4, home from school and leaves only to pick up her husband from work.Ms. DuBois updates her Facebook post, saying she has been inundated with \u201cugly and threatening posts.\u201d She does not back down from the reports of raids \u2014 although she now calls them \u201crumors\u201d \u2014 saying people in Brockton and elsewhere are \u201cterrified.\u201d But she insists her post was to help ICE, not to undermine it, because it would allow ICE to change the date of the raid. Her critics say she is absurdly trying to have it both ways.An undocumented Mexican immigrant living in Brockton checks her Facebook messages, where a friend has alerted her about a possible raid.She and her husband review the plans recommended at a training session. Among the guidelines: \u201cDon\u2019t open the door, say nothing.\u201dThe rumors create a dilemma for educators: How can they acknowledge the real fears of students without stoking the frenzy? The district\u2019s 25 schools teach 17,446 students from 51 nations, with sizable populations from Cape Verde, Ecuador, Haiti and West Africa.An email from the school superintendent, Kathleen A. Smith, is sent to the principals after school is dismissed, encouraging them to watch for students who appear concerned.School officials report that attendance appears to be down.\u201cIn one kindergarten classroom, 5 out of 12 kids were out,\u201d says Michele Morgan Bolton, the district spokeswoman. Another first-grade class is missing 8 of its 22 students, and a second-grade class is missing 7 of 25 students.Sheriff Hodgson, who has drawn cheers and jeers from around the country, appears on Fox and calls for Ms. DuBois\u2019s resignation. Ms. DuBois begins to use the controversy to raise money. \u201cWe have seen the alt-right\u2019s national attack campaign against Michelle and we need to help her fight back,\u201d says her fund-raising appeal.Mr. Neudauer, the ICE spokesman, announces five arrests the previous day in Lawrence, Mass., 60 miles to the north and far from the frenzy of speculation.All week, residents share word of possible sightings of ICE agents in Brockton, but Mr. Neudauer says there have been no immigration raids or arrests here.\u201cNothing that a fifth-generation American can write,\u201d she says, \u201cis going to incite any more fear than is already in the hearts of all these people.\u201dLiz Robbins contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "That Ghostly, Glowing Light Above Canada? It\u2019s Just Steve", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byIf you happen to be in Canada on a clear night, look to the stars and maybe you\u2019ll see it: a strip of light stretching from east to west, all the way from the banks of Hudson Bay to the fjords of British Columbia.Actually, it\u2019s none of the above. Scientists are still working to figure out exactly what they\u2019re dealing with.And until that day, they\u2019re going to call it Steve.What sets Steve apart is not just its charmingly banal name. It\u2019s also the way it has been \u2014 and is still being \u2014 discovered, said Eric Donovan, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Calgary.The story started with a group of Canadians who were enthusiastic about finding and photographing the most stunning displays of the aurora borealis, or northern lights. They formed a Facebook group called Alberta Aurora Chasers to share information about the best and brightest displays. A few years ago, some began to notice that Steve \u2014 a strip of light that appeared a bit farther south than the northern lights \u2014 was something special.After that, scientists began to take notice.\u201cThe really cool thing about this is the social media providing a nice bridge between the scientific community and these amateurs, who are incredibly talented observers of the night sky,\u201d Dr. Donovan said.He explained that Steve is a strip of ionized gas moving through the air at about four miles per second, with temperatures as high as 10,800 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 as hot as the earth\u2019s core. It is about 16 miles wide and thousands of miles long, flowing from east to west across Canada.Photographs of the phenomenon, most of which show Steve as a glowing ribbon of neon light, have captivated aurora borealis enthusiasts in Canada and far beyond.But to the naked eye, Steve doesn\u2019t look like this. It usually appears as an ethereal wisp of white that pales in comparison to the northern lights, faint enough that photographers in the Facebook group originally mistook it for the contrails of a plane.But soon enough, they started looking at Steve through their camera lenses. It was only then \u2014 with help from slow shutter speeds and photo editing to dial up the color saturation \u2014 that the aurora enthusiasts could show Steve in all its pink, purple and green glory.\u201cWe could see that it was self-illuminated,\u201d said Chris Ratzlaff, a photographer who is the Facebook group\u2019s administrator. \u201cNot like a contrail, which is lit from below.\u201dFor a while, the Alberta Aurora Chasers assumed they were looking at a proton aurora, which is made of energized protons from the magnetosphere (as opposed to the energized electrons that make up the northern lights as we see them). But last year, a group of the aurora chasers went to hear the aurora borealis expert and NASA scientist Elizabeth MacDonald speak at the University of Calgary.After the event, they retired to a nearby pub with Dr. Donovan, where a brief debate broke out. They insisted they had taken photographs of the proton aurora. Dr. Donovan doubted it, since that phenomenon is not visible to the human eye.\u201cI said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you show me?\u2019\u201d Dr. Donovan said. \u201cThey pulled up this beautiful photograph of this thing. And I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what that is, but it\u2019s not the proton aurora.\u2019\u201dAt Dr. Donovan\u2019s urging, Mr. Ratzlaff \u2014 who takes his science seriously \u2014 knew he could not erroneously call it a proton aurora any longer. So the next day, he came up with the name Steve.He admitted, somewhat reluctantly, that the idea came from a scene in the 2006 animated movie \u201cOver the Hedge,\u201d in which a group of forest animals are confronted with the sudden appearance of a towering row of shrubs.\u201cI would be a lot less afraid of it if I just knew what it was called,\u201d says a computer-generated porcupine. A red squirrel pipes up: \u201cLet\u2019s call it Steve. It\u2019s a pretty name.\u201d And so they do.Dr. Donovan\u2019s next step was to gather data on the phenomenon, which he did with help from Swarm, a constellation of satellites run by the European Space Agency.\u201cThis is not something you anticipate when you build a mission,\u201d said Roger Haagmans, Swarm\u2019s mission scientist. \u201cIt just happens, and then you try to provide the right data to the community.\u201dThat\u2019s how Dr. Donovan got his data on Steve\u2019s temperature and velocity, but other questions remain, like why the stream exists in the first place, and what makes it so hot.In a matter of months, he said, he hopes to publish a study that will explain exactly what Steve is.And once that is figured out, the phenomenon might get an official name \u2014 but, Mr. Ratzlaff said, the public isn\u2019t likely to forget the original label. \u201cI think the name Steve is here to stay.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At F.C.C., Obama-Era Rules on Chopping Block", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byThe next target is net neutrality, which is the guarantee that all internet content is equally accessible. That could be followed by cuts in broadband subsidies for low-income households and a relaxation in rules preventing media consolidation in local markets.\u201cThere was a good bit of overreach by the past F.C.C. that caused a lot of confusion,\u201d said Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, who was vice chairwoman for President Trump\u2019s transition. \u201cWe are going to have technology and telecommunications policy that is light touch.\u201dIn a major philosophical shift from the Obama administration, Republican leaders have said they will look for proof of harm before creating new regulations for telecom firms. They believe antitrust and consumer protection laws suffice for government oversight of the sector.\u201cThe F.C.C. needs a more evidence-based approach,\u201d said Roslyn Layton, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who was on Mr. Trump\u2019s F.C.C. transition team. \u201cNo one is writing in and asking for Title 2 reclassification of broadband. Consumers are complaining about unwanted calls and billing problems.\u201dThe changes have been a boon for telecommunications and cable firms that had for years fought unsuccessfully against a Democratic-led F.C.C.They have cheered Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to renominate Mr. Pai after his term ends in June. They want to overturn net neutrality and other rules so they can start offering new business plans that consumer groups have protested.\u201cThe repeal of net neutrality would be a clear positive for broadband network providers,\u201d analysts at Pacific Crest Securities wrote in a research note after the election. Internet service providers \u201cwould be able to charge for access to the network and for \u2018fast lanes,\u2019 which would increase potential monetization.\u201dMomentum is with the Republicans. Last month, they voted to overturn privacy rules (scheduled to take effect later this year) that required internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast to get permission from a customer before tracking and selling data browsing and app activity. Mr. Trump signed the measure on April 3.Lawmakers said the F.C.C.\u2019s rules were much stricter than any privacy requirements placed on web firms like Google and Facebook. They argued that the privacy watchdog duties should fall to the Federal Trade Commission, which does not have strong privacy regulations but requires companies to self-police the privacy policies they promise to customers.Republicans lawmakers moved against the privacy rules under the Congressional Review Act, a procedure used to overturn new agency rules.The lawmakers say their next target is the F.C.C.\u2019s declaration in 2015 that broadband should be treated like a common carrier service, such as the phone. That utility-like categorization strapped new rules on broadband providers.The F.C.C. chairman and lawmakers have promised to undo those rules soon. Ms. Blackburn said in an interview that the F.C.C. will likely create an order to overturn them.Democrats and consumer groups have protested, saying the internet has become essential for work, education and commerce, and needs greater oversight.\u201cThe recent weeks are prologue, and I am fearful that we are moving in a direction that will unravel and undo some incredible gains we\u2019ve made for consumers,\u201d said Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democratic commissioner at the F.C.C.The reclassification of broadband also served in 2015 as the foundation for the F.C.C.\u2019s net neutrality rules, which ban broadband providers from blocking or slowing down of traffic on the internet. Google, Facebook and Netflix have been the strongest corporate backers of net neutrality, but smaller start-ups could be most affected.Without strong net neutrality rules, an internet service provider like Verizon or Charter could give preference to certain content, making it harder for an independent streaming service like Vimeo to compete.An example is AT&T\u2019s free service offering mobile streaming of DirecTV videos to customers that does not count against data limits. Consumer groups have balked, saying the practice puts competing video providers at a disadvantage because their videos do count against those customers\u2019 monthly data limits.Mr. Pai has already signaled his approval of such \u201czero rating\u201d programs, saying they did not appear to violate net neutrality \u2014 and that they are popular with consumers. In January, he closed an investigation into zero-rating promotional streaming programs by AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile.Republicans will also look for ways to cut fat in programs they deem wasteful or abused. One target could be the Lifeline broadband subsidy for low-income households. Mr. Pai prevented nine providers from offering the subsidy weeks into his role at the F.C.C.He has also pointed to longtime media ownership rules that prevent a local TV station from also owning a newspaper in the same town. F.C.C. rules also prevent sharing of resources between TV stations. Mr. Pai has said the convergence of tech and media have made such rules too outdated. Companies like Netflix and Google are a bigger threat to broadcast television stations than media consolidation, Mr. Pai said.The greatest uncertainty surrounds telecom and tech mergers. AT&T\u2019s proposed $85 billion merger with Time Warner is being reviewed by antitrust officials at the Justice Department. Republicans are expected to be generally more permissive of mergers, but Mr. Trump remains the wild card.The president has said he would not allow the merger, and analysts say his complaints about news coverage by CNN, which is owned by Time Warner, could complicate the approval. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said he would not be influenced by politics in decisions at the agency.\u201cThis will be the first big test,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, who leads the investment firm Tusk Ventures. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t in Trump\u2019s wheelhouse, expect to get a more traditional Republican look at mergers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Arkansas Community Looks for an Execution to End Its Ache", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported bySTAR CITY, Ark. \u2014 James Hawkins, the affable local coroner, has long performed a grim duty on execution nights: He pronounces the deaths of the condemned prisoners. He has done it more than two dozen times.Mr. Hawkins declared another man dead on Thursday night, when Arkansas executed its fourth prisoner in seven days. Seventeen years after pronouncing the death of a murder victim and family friend, Cecil Boren, Mr. Hawkins did the same for Mr. Boren\u2019s killer, Kenneth D. Williams.\u201cIt\u2019s a satisfying moment,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said in an interview at a funeral home in this largely rural patch of southeast Arkansas, where prisons and produce are about all that power the local economy. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard nonstop in this community \u2014 this entire community \u2014 is: \u2018This is the one we\u2019re waiting on.\u2019\u201dMr. Williams was executed at 11:05 p.m. after the United States Supreme Court rejected an appeal from his lawyers, who sought to block the execution on the grounds that their client was intellectually disabled and ineligible for the death penalty. Prison officials said that he requested holy communion as his last meal.The death chamber in nearby Varner is Arkansas\u2019s ultimate clearinghouse for capital cases, the site of all of the state\u2019s executions in the modern era of the American death penalty. The area is one of the country\u2019s sparsely populated death chamber locales, places of peculiar notoriety whose very names can be statewide shorthand for capital punishment and hard prison time: Angola, La.; Parchman, Miss.; Raiford, Fla.\u201cI personally know part of the Boren family, and, of course, naturally we empathize with them,\u201d said Charles R. Knight, the mayor of nearby Grady, where the city limits end just a few miles from prison watchtowers. \u201cBut we empathize for all of the families involved, and being Christian, we also empathize with the inmates as well. From my standpoint, I look at it as, this is the law, this is what the law has allotted and this is what we do.\u201dThe state built its death chamber in 1978, and Mr. Williams was born the next year. In 1998, he emptied a revolver after a robbery in neighboring Jefferson County, killing a 19-year-old woman, Dominique Nicole Hurd. When Mr. Williams was spared the death penalty and sentenced to life in prison, he mocked Ms. Hurd\u2019s relatives, turning to them and saying, \u201cYou thought I was going to die, didn\u2019t you?\u201dHe was sent to Cummins and, weeks after his arrival, escaped by hiding inside a 500-gallon tank that was brimming with hog slop. Mr. Boren was in his yard, working while his wife was at church, when Mr. Williams arrived. The fugitive entered the house, stole one of Mr. Boren\u2019s guns, shot him seven times, seized his victim\u2019s wallet and drove off in his truck.Eight Arkansas inmates have filed multiple lawsuits to halt their executions, which had been scheduled to occur in a span of 10 days this month.In Missouri the next day, Mr. Williams led the police on a high-speed pursuit that ended when he struck a water truck, killing its driver. Sentenced to death for Mr. Boren\u2019s murder, Mr. Williams later wrote a letter to The Pine Bluff Commercial, an Arkansas newspaper, and confessed to another killing that had been unsolved.\u201cI don\u2019t want to make any excuses or shift the blame,\u201d Mr. Williams said in the 2005 letter. \u201cI just want to be honest and accept responsibility for my actions.\u201dThe confession, as well as Mr. Williams\u2019s professed religious transformation, had no discernible effect on the Arkansas Parole Board, which ruled this month that his application for clemency was \u201cwithout merit.\u201dThe daughter of Michael Greenwood, the man killed during the pursuit in Missouri, urged Gov. Asa Hutchinson to stop the execution. \u201cWe are in no way asking you to ignore the pain felt by the victims of Mr. Williams\u2019s other crimes,\u201d Kayla Greenwood wrote in a letter this week. \u201cWe know what they are going through, but ours is a pain that we have decided not to try and cure by seeking an execution.\u201dAt Carla\u2019s Cafe, a lunch spot in Star City, the county seat, that was just fine. On Wednesday afternoon, when grilled pork chop was a lunch special, residents expressed little concern for Mr. Williams, whose lawyers argue he is intellectually disabled.\u201cWhen they apprehended him in Missouri, they should have shot him down and killed that sucker,\u201d Wayne Harmon, 66, said.But the police did not, so people like Mr. Harmon were left to worry that some court somewhere would step in to save Mr. Williams\u2019s life days before the expiration of one of Arkansas\u2019s lethal injection drugs.\u201cWe\u2019ve got some of the sorriest judges, leaders and men,\u201d Ed Hardin, 73, said. \u201cI got tickled the other night when the governor said this was the hardest thing he had to do. Hell, if you can\u2019t be no better governor than that, you don\u2019t need to be governor.\u201dIn hotels and in restaurants, in the governor\u2019s mansion and on Main Streets, the executions in Arkansas have occupied a large segment of conversation. Residents have debated execution methods \u2014 electrocution is still enshrined in Arkansas law as a future possibility \u2014 and analyzed last meals. Some here have committed details of the crimes to memory and recalled executions even before Mr. Hawkins\u2019s tenure as coroner, which began in 1991. Facebook feeds have been filled with posts about \u2014 and pleas for \u2014 the state\u2019s original plan to put eight men to death this month. (Four of the executions have been postponed indefinitely.)Polling suggests that more than 70 percent of the state\u2019s residents support the death penalty, but, because of drug supply issues, it is not clear when Arkansas will be able to put anyone to death again.In this area, people welcomed the fact that Mr. Williams died just before the expected onset of an informal moratorium.Emotions here are rarely so vivid for executions at Cummins, but, Mr. Hawkins noted, \u201cWhen it hits your home, it\u2019s a little different.\u201dMr. Boren\u2019s widow declined to be interviewed. Her family opposed clemency for Mr. Williams.Vickie Williams, Ms. Hurd\u2019s mother and no relation to Mr. Williams, said her daughter had ambitions of being a neonatologist as a biology and premedical student at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, where she was known as Nicky. Ms. Williams said she did not plan to attend the execution, but she supported it.\u201cHe did not receive the death penalty for killing Nicky,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cIf proper justice was served, others may not have lost their lives. The justice system is very confusing. Everyone has rights except for the families of victims.\u201dRodney Kennedy, a local resident, said Mr. Williams cut across his parents\u2019 1,500-acre property after he fled from Cummins.\u201cI think they\u2019re doing the right thing executing him,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cHe could always escape again and kill again.\u201dAfter the execution, Mr. Boren\u2019s daughter, Jodie Efird, said her mother\u2019s \u201cpeace will come later.\u201d\u201cHer peace will come every time we\u2019re driving down this road,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not here anymore.\u201dAlan Blinder reported from Star City, and Manny Fernandez from Houston.Advertisement"}

The block would be accessible for vehicles from Fifth Avenue only, reducing traffic.If it\u2019s approved by Community Board 5 tomorrow evening, the shared street would be completed over the summer, the department said, and would be accompanied by a campaign to explain how it works.\u201cAnd if we feel this has been a success,\u201d Mr. Quinn said, \u201cwe\u2019d start looking for others places in the city where this could be rolled out.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:The sky is also sharing space today, with two weather patterns.First up: a moody morning, an overcast afternoon and a chance of rain and thunderstorms through lunch.Judges are looking for something eye-catching and original with a strong message pertaining to voting in New York City. At minimum, the design must include the text \u201cI Voted\u201d and fit within a circle two inches in diameter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Jamaica Trip With the Ultimate Travel Amenity: A Nanny", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byFrugal FamilyIt was our second night in Jamaica, and I was sitting at a picnic table on a small, rocky beach in Runaway Bay. We were eating a buffet dinner and watching a talent show that combined sideshow stunts by performers \u2014 walking on nails and blowing flames into the sky \u2014 with gymnastics and G-rated jokes by guests, who included children and a few brave parents. When the crowd applauded, my 18-month-old daughter, Roxie, clapped excitedly with them. In the show\u2019s final act, an otherwise dignified Canadian father with Justin Trudeau-like good looks thrust his pelvis across the makeshift stage as if possessed by the spirit of Elvis Presley.I had somehow stepped into a scene from \u201cDirty Dancing,\u201d transported to a Catskills resort, circa 1963. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time, during our five-day stay, that I\u2019d feel this sense of generational disorientation \u2014 of being not so much in another country as in another era.Though my husband, Tim, Roxie and I had already been on the island for two days, we had not yet left the walled confines of our resort. Not only that: We had no plans to leave. Not even once.It wasn\u2019t that we weren\u2019t interested in seeing the island, birthplace of Rastafarianism, home of reggae and land of rum cake and jerk chicken. But as the parents of an increasingly energetic (and exhausting) toddler, our primary motivation for this trip \u2014 I\u2019m embarrassed to admit \u2014 was not culture or music or even the lush expanse of the Blue Mountains.It was babysitting. Affordable, reliable child care and the possibility, at least, of a vacation that actually felt like a vacation.To that end, we had maxed out our modest travel budget on airfare ($430 per flight) and four all-inclusive nights ($340 per night) before we even arrived. If the trip went as planned, we wouldn\u2019t spend another dollar \u2014 beyond tips, of course \u2014 after takeoff from New York\u2019s Kennedy International Airport.The obvious question, and the one that invariably nagged at me when I considered an all-inclusive: Why bother traveling to another country if you\u2019re going to spend the entire time at your hotel? It was a question I didn\u2019t have an answer to.Then we met Lisa Dixon, our \u201cvacation nanny.\u201d And I had my answer.I had known, of course, that child care was part of the F.D.R. package. But I didn\u2019t understand how it would work. Would I just leave my child with a stranger and somehow relax? I couldn\u2019t imagine it. A year and a half into parenthood, Tim and I had hired a babysitter only once. A nanny \u2014 a word I associate with British period dramas \u2014 seemed impossibly luxurious, as out of reach for two working writers as a personal chef or a private plane. But at F.D.R., Ms. Dixon\u2019s time and expertise was included in the price of our stay.Having descended from a matrilineal line of women who were paid to care for other people\u2019s children, I felt deeply conflicted about the \u201cvacation nanny\u201d concept before we arrived. I worried that it undervalued the work of women like my mother and grandmother. It seemed potentially exploitative.But the balance between cost and convenience is something with which every parent on a budget must grapple. Most of us make choices, at least occasionally, that we aren\u2019t entirely comfortable with \u2014 that raise questions we don\u2019t have easy answers to.I expected to feel uncomfortable in the hermetically sealed bubble of the resort, but the disorientation came as soon as we were on the airport shuttle bus. I felt uneasy at taking a vacation in another country with no intention of engaging with the people or culture, history or environment \u2014 or even just day-to-day life \u2014 of that place.There I was, watching Jamaica from a shuttle window. The driver, doing his best to engage his passengers\u2019 interest in the country they were visiting, performed a perfunctory call and response, quizzing us on the colors of the national flag: \u201cgold for the sunshine\u201d; \u201cgreen for vegetation, including the ganja\u201d; and \u201cblack.\u201d \u201cWhat is black for? Black is for the people,\u201d he said proudly. His audience of sun-seeking Canadian and American tourists seemed disinterested.After delivering passengers to three other resorts, we arrived at F.D.R., named for its owner, Franklyn, not the president. The place was compact and cheerfully bright. Unlike the towering white behemoths we\u2019d passed, it was just three stories tall, with 78 rooms, cobalt blue shutters and turquoise and lemon yellow piers jutting into the ocean. Narrow walkways wound through gardens planted in Christmas palms, lantana and hibiscus. The beach was piled with kayaks and paddleboards. The staff seemed to outnumber the guests.Our very first night, tempted by the prospect of a dinner date, I broke my own rule and spent $18 to hire Ms. Dixon to return for a two-hour babysitting stint outside her normal 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. shift. Ms. Dixon had short cropped hair, an unaffected smile and a 14-year-old daughter of her own. She had worked at F.D.R. for 16 years. She was about my age, and it was clear she took her job seriously.The $9-an-hour splurge was worth it, not to be stuck in the room \u2014 a pleasant, but spare two-room suite with floral bed spreads and tropical prints on the walls \u2014 after Roxie\u2019s usual 7 p.m. bedtime. Tim and I sat at a patio table above the beach, ate escovitch fish and eavesdropped on the neighboring table\u2019s political conversation about the recent United States presidential election before joining in ourselves. The two families, from Montreal and the Washington, D.C., area, had both been coming to the resort for years and had become friends.Having worked with hundreds of children over the years, Ms. Dixon was almost certainly a more competent caregiver than I, a first-time parent, not yet two years in. Still, I had to force myself to step back, let Ms. Dixon do her job and not feel guilty about sitting at the open-air bar, sipping a rum and pineapple, watching Roxie on a beach cluttered with primary-colored play structures, content among the other children and their respective nannies.During our first two days on the island, the weather was moody. But having narrowly escaped a New York nor\u2019easter, we were unbothered by the choppy surf and darkened skies that kept us from the ocean. Tim and I, slowly getting used to being freed from child care, did childish things. He joined a ragtag collection of guests and played beach volleyball for the first time in his life, bloodying his knees diving for the ball. I rediscovered my love of water slides, racing up the wooden stairs to Big Blue again and again.When the sun finally came out and the wind relented, we outfitted Roxie in the smallest life vest we could find and climbed aboard F.D.R.\u2019s glass-bottomed boat \u2014 a shabby vessel with a picture frame bottom. After days of stormy weather, the water was cloudy, but Roxie was nonetheless enamored by her undersea view of the sandy bottom, occasional head of coral and hungry schools of shimmering fish, which jumped and churned for dinner rolls tossed overboard.Our tall, sinewy captain called himself Jack Sparrow and, in a running narration that veered into magical realism, referred to the fish as his \u201cbabies\u201d and melded characters from the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d with local legends about sunken ships and crashed airplanes. This was a man who enjoyed his job.That night, our last at F.D.R., was Friday and dinner came with a show. Footsie, \u201cthe one-man band,\u201d played techno remixes of wedding party classics like \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d on a synthesizer as blue, green and red lights pulsed overhead. The elaborately costumed \u201cBridgette\u201d exhorted the audience for volunteers. The performer wore a bustle and heavy makeup that may have blended into a crowd raucously celebrating Caribbean Carnival festivities but felt cringingly out of context in front of our small, seated audience of clapping foreigners.Despite lifelong stage fright, I bowed to pressure when I was summoned to the center of the room. With dinner guests looking on, I followed Bridgette\u2019s instructions, popping my hips forward and back on her one-two-one-two command. Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted Tim recording the mortifying moment on his cellphone \u2014 in case, presumably, he ever needed to blackmail me. My performance was clumsy and embarrassing, but also strangely exhilarating. It made me realize how long it had been since I was forced outside my comfort zone and how the resort bubble itself offered something valuable \u2014 it offered focused, undistracted time. Time alone, time together as a couple, and time as a family.Advertisement"}

People became more conscious of what was going on in the food world.\u201dMr. Hauck shut the restaurant down for three months and gave the interior a thorough update. Gone were the formal tablecloths and many of the German knickknacks, along with the Christmas decorations that hung year round. The menu retained staples like sauerbraten and Wiener schnitzel, but added modern takes on German fare like bread spread with herbed lard and sauerkraut fritters.It was a hard sell.\u201cPeople here are very resistant to change, and especially when it\u2019s with something so traditional like Karl Ratzsch,\u201d said Ann Christenson, the longtime dining editor at Milwaukee Magazine. \u201cPeople were critical.

{"Headline": "Can Facebook Fix Its Own Worst Bug?", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "FeatureMark Zuckerberg now acknowledges the dangerous side of the social revolution he helped start. But is the most powerful tool for connection in human history capable of adapting to the world it created?Supported byZuckerberg used to be a nervous speaker, but he has become much less so. He speaks quickly but often unloads full paragraphs of thought, and sometimes his arguments are so polished that they sound rehearsed, which happened often that morning. \u201c2016 was an interesting year for us,\u201d he said as the three of us, plus a P.R. executive, sat around a couple of couches in the glass-walled conference room where he conducts many of his meetings. (There are many perks to working at Facebook, but no one, not even Zuckerberg, has a private office.) It was an understatement and a nod to the obvious: Facebook, once a mere app on your phone, had become a global political and cultural force, and the full implications of that transformation had begun to come into view last year. \u201cIf you look at the history of Facebook, when we started off, there really wasn\u2019t news as part of it,\u201d Zuckerberg went on. But as Facebook grew and became a bigger part of how people learn about the world, the company had been slow to adjust to its new place in people\u2019s lives. The events of 2016, he said, \u201cset off a number of conversations that we\u2019re still in the middle of.\u201dAfter the election, Zuckerberg offered a few pat defenses of Facebook\u2019s role. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite proud of the impact that we were able to have on civic discourse over all,\u201d he said when we spoke in January. Misinformation on Facebook was not as big a problem as some believed it was, but Facebook nevertheless would do more to battle it, he pledged. Echo chambers were a concern, but if the source was people\u2019s own confirmation bias, was it really Facebook\u2019s problem to solve?It was hard to tell how seriously Zuckerberg took the criticisms of his service and its increasingly paradoxical role in the world. He had spent much of his life building a magnificent machine to bring people together. By the most literal measures, he\u2019d succeeded spectacularly, but what had that connection wrought? Across the globe, Facebook now seems to benefit actors who want to undermine the global vision at its foundation. Supporters of Trump and the European right-wing nationalists who aim to turn their nations inward and dissolve alliances, trolls sowing cross-border paranoia, even ISIS with its skillful social-media recruiting and propagandizing \u2014 all of them have sought in their own ways to split the Zuckerbergian world apart. And they are using his own machine to do it.Underneath it all was a nagging feeling of complicity. Trump had benefited from a media environment that is now shaped by Facebook \u2014 and, more to the point, shaped by a single Facebook feature, the same one to which the company owes its remarkable ascent to social-media hegemony: the computationally determined list of updates you see every time you open the app. The list has a formal name, News Feed. But most users are apt to think of it as Facebook itself.If it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that News Feed has become the most influential source of information in the history of civilization, it is only slightly so. Facebook created News Feed in 2006 to solve a problem: In the social-media age, people suddenly had too many friends to keep up with. At the time, Facebook was just a collection of profiles, lacking any kind of central organization. To figure out what any of your connections were up to, you had to visit each of their profiles to see if anything had changed. News Feed fixed that. Every time you open Facebook, it hunts through the network, collecting every post from every connection \u2014 information that, for most Facebook users, would be too overwhelming to process themselves. Then it weighs the merits of each post before presenting you with a feed sorted in order of importance: a hyperpersonalized front page designed just for you.Scholars and critics have been warning of the solipsistic irresistibility of algorithmic news at least since 2001, when the constitutional-law professor Cass R. Sunstein warned, in his book \u201cRepublic.com,\u201d of the urgent risks posed to democracy \u201cby any situation in which thousands or perhaps millions or even tens of millions of people are mainly listening to louder echoes of their own voices.\u201d (In 2008, I piled on with my own book, \u201cTrue Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society.\u201d) In 2011, the digital activist and entrepreneur Eli Pariser, looking at similar issues, gave this phenomenon a memorable name in the title of his own book: \u201cThe Filter Bubble.\u201dEmployees got the same message. \u201cWhen Facebook cares about something, they spin up teams to address it, and Zuck will come out and talk about it all the time,\u201d one former executive told me. \u201cI have never heard of anything close to that on the filter bubble. I never sensed that this was a problem he wanted us to tackle. It was always positioned as an interesting intellectual question but not something that we\u2019re going to go focus on.\u201dFacebook, under criticism, reinstated the picture, but the photo incident stuck with Zuckerberg. He would bring it up unbidden to staff members and to reporters. It highlighted, for him, the difficulty of building a policy framework for what Facebook was trying to do. Zuckerberg wanted to become a global news distributor that is run by machines, rather than by humans who would try to look at every last bit of content and exercise considered judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s something I think we\u2019re still figuring out,\u201d he told me in January. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to do here than what we\u2019ve done. And I think we\u2019re starting to realize this now as well.\u201dIt struck me as an unsatisfying answer, and it later became apparent that Zuckerberg seemed to feel the same way. On a Sunday morning about a month after the first meeting, I got a call from a Facebook spokesman. Zuckerberg wanted to chat again. Could Mike and I come back on Monday afternoon?What\u2019s striking about that 2012 letter, read through the prism of 2017, is its certainty that a more \u201copen and connected\u201d world is by definition a better one. \u201cWhen I started Facebook, the idea of connecting the world was not controversial,\u201d Zuckerberg said now. \u201cThe default assumption was that the world was incrementally just moving in that direction. So I thought we can connect some people and do our part in helping move in that direction.\u201d But now, he said, whether it was wise to connect the world was \u201cactually a real question.\u201dZuckerberg\u2019s new manifesto never quite accepts blame for any of the global ills that have been laid at Facebook\u2019s feet. Yet by the standards of a company release, it is remarkable for the way it concedes that the company\u2019s chief goal \u2014 wiring the globe \u2014 is controversial. \u201cThere are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone,\u201d Zuckerberg writes, \u201cand whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course.\u201d He also confesses misgivings about Facebook\u2019s role in the news. \u201cGiving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality.\u201dAt the time of our second interview, the manifesto was still only a draft, and I was surprised by how unsure Zuckerberg seemed about it in person. He had almost as many questions for us \u2014 about whether we understood what he was trying to say, how we thought it would land in the media \u2014 as we had for him. When I suggested that it might be perceived as an attack on Trump, he looked dismayed. He noted several times that he had been noodling over these ideas since long before November. A few weeks earlier, there was media speculation, fueled by a postelection tour of America by Zuckerberg and his wife, that he was laying the groundwork to run against Trump in 2020, and in this meeting he took pains to shoot down the rumors. When I asked if he had chatted with Obama about the former president\u2019s critique of Facebook, Zuckerberg paused for several seconds, nearly to the point of awkwardness, before answering that he had.Facebook\u2019s spokespeople later called to stress that Obama was only one of many people to whom he had spoken. In other words: Don\u2019t read this as a partisan anti-Trump manifesto. But if the company pursues the admittedly airy aims outlined in \u201cBuilding Global Community,\u201d the changes will echo across media and politics, and some are bound to be considered partisan. The risks are especially clear for changes aimed at adding layers of journalistic ethics across News Feed, which could transform the public\u2019s perception of Facebook, not to mention shake the foundations of its business.For the typical user, Cox explained when I met him on a morning in October at MPK20, News Feed is computing the relative merits of about 2,000 potential posts in your network every time you open the app. In sorting these posts, Facebook does not optimize for any single metric: not clicks or reading time or likes. Instead, he said, \u201cwhat you really want to get to is whether somebody, at the end of the day, would say, \u2018Hey, my experience today was meaningful.\u2019\u2009\u201d Personalizing News Feed, in other words, is a very big \u201cmath problem,\u201d incorporating countless metrics in extraordinarily complicated ways. Zuckerberg calls it \u201ca modern A.I. problem.\u201dLast summer, I sat in on two meetings in another glass-walled MPK20 conference room, in which News Feed\u2019s engineers, designers, user-research experts and managers debated several small alterations to how News Feed displays certain kinds of posts. The conversations were far from exciting \u2014 people in jeans on couches looking at PowerPoints, talking quietly about numbers \u2014 and yet I found them mesmerizing, a demonstration of the profound cultural differences between how news companies like The Times work and how Facebook does. The first surprise was how slowly things move, contrary to the freewheeling culture of \u201cthe hacker way.\u201d In one meeting, the team spent several minutes discussing the merits of bold text in a certain News Feed design. One blessing of making social software is that you can gauge any potential change to your product by seeing how your users react to it. That is also the curse: At Facebook, virtually every change to the app, no matter how small or obviously beneficial, is thoroughly tested on different segments of the audience before it\u2019s rolled out to everyone.The people who work on News Feed aren\u2019t making decisions that turn on fuzzy human ideas like ethics, judgment, intuition or seniority. They are concerned only with quantifiable outcomes about people\u2019s actions on the site. That data, at Facebook, is the only real truth. And it is a particular kind of truth: The News Feed team\u2019s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want \u2014 what they find \u201cmeaningful,\u201d to use Cox and Zuckerberg\u2019s preferred term \u2014 and to give them more of that.This ideal runs so deep that the people who make News Feed often have to put aside their own notions of what\u2019s best. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve all learned over the years is that our intuition can be wrong a fair amount of the time,\u201d John Hegeman, the vice president of product management and a News Feed team member, told me. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t expect will happen. And we learn a lot from that process: Why didn\u2019t that happen, and what might that mean?\u201d But it is precisely this ideal that conflicts with attempts to wrangle the feed in the way press critics have called for. The whole purpose of editorial guidelines and ethics is often to suppress individual instincts in favor of some larger social goal. Facebook finds it very hard to suppress anything that its users\u2019 actions say they want. In some cases, it has been easier for the company to seek out evidence that, in fact, users don\u2019t want these things at all.If a human editor ran News Feed, she would look at the clickbait scourge and make simple, intuitive fixes: Turn down the Upworthy knob. But Facebook approaches the feed as an engineering project rather than an editorial one. When it makes alterations in the code that powers News Feed, it\u2019s often only because it has found some clear signal in its data that users are demanding the change. In this sense, clickbait was a riddle. In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them? Was there something Facebook\u2019s algorithm was missing, some signal that would show that despite the clicks, clickbait was really sickening users?To answer these questions, Cox and his team hired survey panels of more than a thousand paid \u201cprofessional raters\u201d around the world who answer questions about how well News Feed is working. Starting in 2013, Facebook began adding first dozens and then hundreds and then thousands of data points that were meant to teach the artificial-intelligence system that runs News Feed how people were reacting to their feeds. Facebook noticed that people would sometimes click open a clickbaity story but spend very little time on it. In other cases, lots of people would click on a story but few would share or Like it. Headlines on stories that people seemed to reject often contained a set of signature phrases (\u201cyou\u2019ll never believe,\u201d \u201cthis one trick,\u201d etc.) or they came from a set of repeat-offender publishers.This approach \u2014 looking for signs of user dissatisfaction \u2014 could curb stories that constitute the most egregious examples of misinformation. Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s vice president in charge of News Feed, says that Facebook has begun testing an algorithm change that would look at whether people share an article after reading it. If few of the people who click on a story decide to share it, that might suggest people feel misled by it and it would get lower billing in the feed.But the solution to the broader misinformation dilemma \u2014 the pervasive climate of rumor, propaganda and conspiracy theories that Facebook has inadvertently incubated \u2014 may require something that Facebook has never done: ignoring the likes and dislikes of its users. Facebook believes the pope-endorses-Trump type of made-up news stories are only a tiny minority of pieces that appear in News Feed; they account for a fraction of 1 percent of the posts, according to Mosseri. The question the company faces now is whether the misinformation problem resembles clickbait at all, and whether its solutions will align as neatly with Facebook\u2019s worldview. Facebook\u2019s entire project, when it comes to news, rests on the assumption that people\u2019s individual preferences ultimately coincide with the public good, and that if it doesn\u2019t appear that way at first, you\u2019re not delving deeply enough into the data. By contrast, decades of social-science research shows that most of us simply prefer stuff that feels true to our worldview even if it isn\u2019t true at all and that the mining of all those preference signals is likely to lead us deeper into bubbles rather than out of them.\u201cAt some point, if they really want to address this, they have to say, \u2018This is good information\u2019 and \u2018This is bad information,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Emily Bell, the director for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School. \u201cThey have to say, \u2018These are the kinds of information sources that we want to privilege, and these others are not going to be banned from the platform, but they are not going to thrive.\u2019 In other words, they have to create a hierarchy, and they\u2019re going to have to decide how they\u2019re going to transfer wealth into the publishing market.\u201dDuring our first meeting in January, I posed this question to Zuckerberg: \u201cWhen you see various problems in the media, do you say to yourself, \u2018I run Facebook, I can solve that?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cUm,\u201d he started, and then paused, weighing his words as carefully as American presidents once did. \u201cNot usually.\u201d He argued that some of Facebook\u2019s critics\u2019 proposed fixes for news on the service, such as hiring editors, were impractical due to Facebook\u2019s scale and global diversity. Personalization, he said, remained a central tenet. \u201cIt really gets back to, like, what do people want at a deep level,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this oversimplified narrative that a company can get very successful by just scratching a very superficial itch, and I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s right over the long term.\u201dYet by our second meeting, Zuckerberg\u2019s position seemed to have evolved. Facebook had by then announced plans for the Facebook Journalism Project, in which the company would collaborate with news companies on new products. Facebook also created a project to promote \u201cnews literacy\u201d among its users, and it hired the former CNN news anchor Campbell Brown to manage the partnership between it and news companies. Zuckerberg\u2019s tone toward critics of Facebook\u2019s approach to news had also grown far more conciliatory. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to get to the core of the actual problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI also really think that the core social thing that needs to happen is that a common understanding needs to exist. And misinformation I view as one of the things that can possibly erode common understanding. But sensationalism and polarization and other things, I actually think, are probably even stronger and more prolific effects. And we have to work on all these things. I think we need to listen to all the feedback on this.\u201dStill, in both our conversation and his new manifesto, Zuckerberg remained preoccupied with the kind of problems that could be solved by the kind of hyperconnectivity he believed in, not the ones caused by it. \u201cThere\u2019s a social infrastructure that needs to get built for modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving more people oriented not just toward short-term things but toward building the long-term social infrastructure that needs to get built across all these things in order to enable people to come together is going to be a really important thing over the next decades.\u201d By way of example, he pointed to Safety Check, Facebook\u2019s system for letting people tell their friends that they\u2019ve survived some kind of dangerous event, like a natural disaster or terrorist attack.\u201cWe\u2019re getting to a point where the biggest opportunities I think in the world ... problems like preventing pandemics from spreading or ending terrorism, all these things, they require a level of coordination and connection that I don\u2019t think can only be solved by the current systems that we have,\u201d Zuckerberg told me. What\u2019s needed, he argues, is some global superstructure to advance humanity.This is not an especially controversial idea; Zuckerberg is arguing for a kind of digital-era version of the global institution-building that the Western world engaged in after World War II. But because he is a chief executive and not an elected president, there is something frightening about his project. He is positioning Facebook \u2014 and, considering that he commands absolute voting control of the company, he is positioning himself \u2014 as a critical enabler of the next generation of human society. A minor problem with his mission is that it drips with megalomania, albeit of a particularly sincere sort. With his wife, Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg has pledged to give away nearly all of his wealth to a variety of charitable causes, including a long-term medical-research project to cure all disease. His desire to take on global social problems through digital connectivity, and specifically through Facebook, feels like part of the same impulse.Yet Zuckerberg is often blas\u00e9 about the messiness of the transition between the world we\u2019re in and the one he wants to create through software. Building new \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d usually involves tearing older infrastructure down. If you manage the demolition poorly, you might undermine what comes next. In the case of the shattering media landscape, Zuckerberg seems finally to have at least noticed this problem and may yet come up with fixes for it. But in the meantime, Facebook rushes headlong into murky new areas, uncovering new dystopian possibilities at every turn.Just as quickly, though, Zuckerberg then pivoted to Facebook\u2019s next marvel, a system for digitally augmenting your pictures and videos. The technical term for this is \u201caugmented reality.\u201d The name bursts with dystopian possibilities \u2014 fake news on video rather than just text \u2014 but Zuckerberg never mentioned them.

{"Headline": "Following Your DNA Trail", "Date": null, "News": "Supported bySo will we. We\u2019re planning more coverage on ancestry and origins, but this issue is devoted to your stories. We selected a few from hundreds, and edited them for clarity and space.\u00a0I had my DNA tested about five years ago to determine my ethnic genetic background. Earlier, I had found evidence from the National Archives that my great-grandfather was a member of the United States Colored Troops, and on that record it listed his prior slave owner. After the test results came in, I matched as fourth cousins with a woman in Charleston, S.C., who was a direct descendant of the slave owner. Thus, my great-great grandfather was a slave owner who owned my great-grandfather but was also his father.My daughter and I learned that I am .6 percent sub-Saharan African and she is .3 percent. My mother learned that she is 1 percent Sub-Saharan African. I traced our ancestry back ten generations and it clearly shows that Edward Mozingo is our ancestor, and that he was an African who married an English woman while it was still legal for him to do so.There were few parts of my ancestry that I was rather sure of, but others were completely a mystery. My father was born and raised in Nigeria, with both of his parents coming from the Yoruba tribe. My mother is African-American and knows very little about her ancestry. Due to her fairer skin and loose curl pattern, people often would ask her: \u201cWhat are you mixed with?\u201d I\u2019m a genealogist, and six years ago had my DNA done. I have my paper tree going back many generations with only a few brick walls. I am a white woman from Jackson County, Fla., which borders Alabama, and almost all of my family has lived in South Alabama since the early 1800s. My mother and I are very light skinned, with light eyes. My father was hazel eyed, with darker complexion and black hair. His family was known to have Jewish blood and Native American from Kentucky. They self-described as \u201cLittle Black Dutch\u201d even as late as the 1950s. The large majority of my DNA was Moroccan Berber, Turkish and Spanish/French. The majority of Moroccan Berber was the great inexplicable mystery, though Alabama relatives moved there in the 1820s from coastal South Carolina, where the Spanish were known to have \u201cMoorish\u201d slaves. I do have a small amount of Native American DNA, but the Moroccans won this round.My paternal great-grandmother was 100 percent Cherokee and her family had been moved with the Trail of Tears. Imagine my surprise when I discovered I couldn\u2019t be whiter: 100 percent Northern European.I called my Dad and let him know that Grandma was not a Cherokee princess. He countered with her tan as evidence. So, for my stepmother\u2019s birthday. I sent them both the kit., too. We are anxiously awaiting the results, but I suspect that the only color in our family is going to be in the tales we apparently tell.I was adopted at birth to a wonderful family, but always wondered about my ancestry. Should I go to an Irish festival? Can I buy a kilt? Do I have an excuse to eat excessive amounts of paczki? I am fairly pale, so I always assumed I was Irish/Scottish/Polish/Finnish/etc. or some other very white European nationality. I was adopted from South Korea as an infant, and I traveled to Seoul last year to do a birth family search. I had been in contact through letters and photos with my birth family \u2014 Mom, Dad, two older sisters \u2014 before arriving. We met and had an incredibly emotional reunion. A couple of weeks later, after getting our DNA test results back to confirm that we were in fact biological family, we found out that we were not related. I am a 55-year-old American male of African descent. I have a dark complexion and grew up in rural East Tennessee with my mother\u2019s relatives. I wanted to have DNA testing done to confirm rumors of my Native American heritage. To my surprise, my results were 84 percent West African, 14 percent European, and 2 percent East Asian.My bigger dilemma is: How do I embrace my European origins? It\u2019s assumed that the European DNA was obtained by force during slavery. I think that is most likely. But what if my European ancestors were indentured servants who worked closely with African slaves and a real romance evolved, despite the cultural norms of that time, and now here I am?If I am true to myself and the scientific evidence that provides richness to the DNA I\u2019ve inherited, I now need to figure out a way to honor all of me and those who survived to make me possible.

In the past, Obama used to say only words; Trump said and acted.\u201dAt the same time, he said, many residents were still hiding in shelters, fearful that Mr. Assad\u2019s forces would send their own message of defiance with another attack on the town.Othman al-Khani, an anti-Assad activist from Khan Sheikhoun, said Mr. Trump \u201cfinally broke the longstanding silence of the Obama administration\u201d on American entanglement in the Syrian conflict. \u201cThis response is good in a way, but we can\u2019t say that it is enough,\u201d he said.Some in Khan Sheikhoun were cynical, saying Mr. Assad\u2019s behavior would not change.\u201cWe were all happy until they said that America gave Russia notice. That means that they probably emptied the airport of all the working planes,\u201d said Refaat Youssef, who lost 26 relatives in the chemical attack. \u201cThis is a tranquilizer shot. If you really want to put an end to the suffering, hit all the airports.\u201dThe extent of damage could not be independently verified, but anti-Assad activists felt some vindication regardless.\u201cHoms is more beautiful without the airport of death,\u201d Osama Mohammed Ali, a resident of a besieged area near Homs, said in a posted message. He urged the United States to launch \u201cTomahawks on all the airports of death, the airports of killing and extermination and displacement in Syria.\u201dMohamed Khaldiyeh, an anti-Assad activist who lives near the airfield, said residents had often awakened to audio alerts about impending takeoffs of warplanes on bombing missions. \u201cThis base was the main reason of the huge destruction in Homs and the displacements of our families,\u201d he said, and on Friday, people \u201cwoke up to the news of its destruction.\u201d\u201cPraise God,\u201d he added.Syrians in other besieged parts of the country, learning about the American airstrike, reacted with a mix of gratification and worry.\u201cThe hit on Bashar al-Assad should have happened three years ago, from the beginning, when Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons,\u201d said Hala Abdulwahab, a teacher in Madaya, a besieged city. \u201cChildren are choking and dying. Entire families are dying.\u201dWissam Zarqa, an English teacher from the northern city of Aleppo who now lives in Idlib Province, called the missile strike a positive step. But like others in Syria and elsewhere, he questioned whether it signaled the beginning of a stronger American military strategy in Syria.\u201cOne killing tool was targeted, which is good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope more steps would follow to punish Assad for all attacks against civilians, whether chemical or not.\u201dMalek Al Shimali, an anti-Assad activist displaced from his home in Aleppo a few months ago and now staying in Turkey, expressed mixed feelings about the missile strike. \u201cI feel the ecstasy of revenge now,\u201d he said in a Facebook message.

According to Spins, a Chicago-based consulting company, sales of natural body care products \u2014 which do not contain artificial colors, preservatives, flavors or sweeteners and are minimally processed \u2014 jumped 10.6 percent, to $1.1 billion, for the year that ended March 19.In addition, according to the Organic Trade Association, organic personal care products \u2014 defined as those containing at least 70 percent organic ingredients, as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture \u2014 are \u201cstill only 1.25 percent of total U.S. sales of personal care products, so there\u2019s lots of room to grow.\u201dAfter its first foray into TV, when it advertised lip balm flavors, Burt\u2019s Bees subsequently began advertising new lines of 100 percent natural lipsticks and tinted lip oils. Until recently, it worked with Baldwin&, an agency based in Raleigh, N.C.; it now works with the New York office of McGarryBowen.According to Jim Geikie, the general manager of Burt\u2019s Bees, the company\u2019s target market is \u201chealthy living advocates,\u201d who he said are American women who are \u201creally interested in a holistic lifestyle conducive to health and wellness.\u201d\u201cThey look for products that are more natural and less processed,\u201d he said, adding that they cut \u201cacross all ages\u201d and tend to be better educated.The company also introduced a \u201cbring back the bees\u201d campaign last year to raise awareness about the decline of bees and other pollinators. This spring, that campaign is featuring the YouTube star Megan Batoon and the actresses Troian Bellisario, Taylor Schilling and Zosia Mamet and encourages people to purchase limited-edition lip balms and take \u201cselfless selfies.\u201d For each purchase and each selfie, the Burt\u2019s Bees Foundation will donate funds to plant 5,000 wildflower seeds, with a goal of planting two billion bee-nourishing wildflowers.What is common to all of Burt\u2019s Bees\u2019 messaging, Mr. Geikie said, is a \u201ccombination of efficacy with authenticity.\u201d The company, he continued, tries to \u201chelp people connect with the wisdom, power and beauty of nature.\u201dThe most visually striking of the new campaigns is that of \u00c9clair Naturals, which began selling its hair, skin and personal care products last year.The centerpiece of the campaign, created by the Pittsburgh-based Marc USA, is an almost four-minute video featuring \u00c9clair\u2019s founder and chief executive, John Matise; Hadley King, a dermatologist who was paid for her appearance; Kayla Jacobs, the beauty and style editor of mindbodygreen.com, where \u00c9clair advertises; and models. All discussed the general lack of transparency surrounding ingredients used in most bath and body care products.The video also shows Joanne Gair, a body-painting artist whose work has appeared in many Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues, using vegetable-based paints to write the names of nonnatural ingredients \u2014 of which there are \u201cnever any\u201d in \u00c9clair products \u2014 on the bodies of three nude models.Another component of the campaign, which was shot by the fashion photographer Ruven Afanador, says \u00c9clair dares \u201cto bare what we never stand for.\u201d The end of the video asks consumers what they oppose, stating: \u201cHow about you? #NeverAnyJudgement. #NeverAnyViolenceAgainstWomen. #NeverAnyFear. #NeverAnyDiscrimination. #NeverAnyCorruption. What\u2019s your #NeverAny?\u201dIn addition to running on the \u00c9clair Naturals website, the video and a 30-second version of it are running on social media and in digital advertising. Full-page print ads with the painted models are running in April through September issues of women\u2019s magazines such as InStyle, Cosmopolitan and Harper\u2019s Bazaar.The video says that although Canada and European countries have banned nearly 2,000 chemicals from personal care products in the past decade, the United States has prohibited only 10 and has not passed a major federal law to regulate ingredients in such products since 1938.The new brand campaign of Honest Company \u2014 which sells over 100 baby, beauty, personal care and household products \u2014 is called \u201cHonest Moments.\u201d It includes a black and white spot in 60- and 30-second versions, featuring women filmed giving birth.

{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported by Letters Fighting In The Captain\u2019s TowerTo the Editor:Anyone questioning the Nobel award in literature to Bob Dylan will be convinced that the Swedish Academy did the right thing once they read David Orr\u2019s paean of academic and cultural superiority, \u201cThe Lyrics Laureate\u201d (On Poetry, March 26). Beginning with references to his hero Robert Frost, a cheap shot at a Swedish poet Nobel Prize winner and vague generalities about \u201cvarious English-language novelists\u201d who might be annoyed about Dylan\u2019s award, Orr goes on to an originalist interpretation of literary awards that would be admired by Antonin Scalia. He further bemoans the widespread use of the word \u201cpoetry\u201d in our everyday descriptions of beauty, be it about blancmange or a shovel pass, particularly by those having \u201climited experience with poems.\u201dIs this essay really about Dylan\u2019s poetry or about the critic\u2019s own superior language and lofty perspective? The only sample we get of Dylan\u2019s writing is a throwaway line under an old photo. Mr. Orr, the times began changing a long time back, and Dylan was there to help us on the way. John Ashbery probably likes his work too.JOHN AUNENYACK, N.Y.\u2b25To the Editor:David Orr makes some excellent points in his wonderful column about Bob Dylan\u2019s winning the Nobel Prize in Literature. But the award to Dylan comes down to a technicality: It is not the Nobel Prize in Poetry or the Nobel Prize in Novels; it is for literature. And as Alfred Nobel specifically stated in his will, the prize is intended for the person who, in the literary field, had produced \u201cthe most outstanding work in an ideal direction.\u201d In addition, the laureate would be determined by \u201cthe Academy in Stockholm,\u201d which was specified by the statutes of the Nobel Foundation to mean the Swedish Academy. Those statutes defined literature as \u201cnot only belles-lettres, but also other writings which, by virtue of their form and style, possess literary value.\u201dSo, worthy as Orr\u2019s analysis of the relationship between song-lyric writing and poetry may be, the bottom line in terms of whether Dylan qualified for the prize is not whether his lyrics are poetry. What is required is that the lyrics possess literary value, and that the author singularly distinguishes himself, in the field of all literature, in their creation. It would be hard to argue with the academy\u2019s determination that Dylan succeeded in meeting those criteria.RICHARD MARGOLINCHERRY HILL, N.J.\u2b25To the Editor:David Orr perpetuates the mistaken notion that Dylan is the first songwriter/musician to win the Nobel literature prize. In 1913, the prize was awarded to the Bengali songwriter/poet/playwright/novelist/artist Rabindranath Tagore, the first non-Western Nobelist.The book that made his reputation in the West, and for which he was awarded the Nobel, was \u201cGitanjali,\u201d a collection of more than 100 songs composed by Tagore. Since the lyrics were not published with music (though Tagore composed music for over 2,000 songs), they were called poems by Western critics, despite the translated title \u201cSong Offerings\u201d printed on the title page of the English edition of the book.Tagore wrote so many songs (and yes, he also was a musician) that they became a musical genre in themselves, rabindrasangeet. Two of his songs were chosen as the national anthems of India and Bangladesh. A century after his Nobel, Tagore\u2019s songs are sung throughout the Indian subcontinent by rich and poor alike. I hope Bob Dylan will be humbled by being the second songwriter to win the Nobel Prize.JOHN MCGUIGANBLOOMINGTON, IND.\u2b25To the Editor:ADAM CHRISTINGLA HABRA, CALIF.The writer\u2019s forthcoming book is \u201cBob Dylan Can Change Your Life.\u201d\u2b25\u2018Lower Ed\u2019 To the Editor:Your review of Tressie McMillan Cottom\u2019s \u201cLower Ed: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy\u201d (March 12) missed the book\u2019s key flaw: Cottom universalizes the experience of Atlanta-area, mostly African-American, low- and middle-income students to conclude that all students make a \u201csavvy\u201d choice to enroll in high-cost, low-quality colleges, and she glosses over the role consumer fraud plays in these choices.What we Senate staff members saw in our 2012 investigation, and what we see now resolving complaints and providing legal assistance at the nonprofit Veterans Education Success, are students who have been lied to about the real cost of tuition and loans taken out in their names, the quality of education offered, the school\u2019s accreditation, their eventual job prospects and eligibility to work in licensed occupations, and more. These lies are also why state attorneys general and federal agencies are suing for-profit colleges.Cottom\u2019s focus on student choice leads her to discount the importance of the Education Department\u2019s job placement data and the gainful employment rule\u2019s data-driven limitations on the worst-performing programs.CARRIE WOFFORDCHEVY CHASE, MD.\u2b25Hair in the Age of TrumpTo the Editor:Nice interview with Chris Hayes (By the Book, March 19).

We prefer the more polite modern term: \u201cfandom.\u201d When it comes to the objects of our own fascination, we are proud citizens under that flag.We were both noisy fans of Neil Gaiman well before we had the good fortune to meet him. (And it is a good fortune to meet Neil, to chat with him, to grow quiet in that chat and let the natural storyteller in him take over to beguile you with swirling half-sung sentences until a polite minder of the time taps him on the shoulder as he is expected elsewhere shortly, most likely the airport.) We had both bought multiple copies of his books, to lose, to lend, or just to have on that bookshelf too. We both very much wanted to see his indelible novel, \"American Gods,\" adapted into a television series worthy of its originality, visuals and voice.To be given the opportunity to adapt it ourselves is a level of deep-sea fandom few get to experience. Sometimes you make a show just because you want to sit back and see it.If that borders on obsession we welcome the water. We dive in head first.Humans have always sought to protect themselves from the dangers of an uncertain world, finding support in family, community and shared tradition. They have also created powerful allies: gods that they believe provide prosperity and safety in exchange for their worshippers\u2019 devotion. In \u201cAmerican Gods,\u201d the Starz TV series based on Neil Gaiman\u2019s acclaimed novel, these deities are very real, living amongst us in secret, their influence waxing and waning with society\u2019s changing views. If America had only one god in its short history, it would likely be capitalism. In the decade following the 1848 discovery of gold in the California territory, prospectors from across the country became obsessed with striking it rich out West. Early on, the daily wage for miners was 20 dollars \u2014 a powerful draw for workers elsewhere, like those earning just 88 cents a day building the Erie Canal. To new arrivals \u2014 many of whom had spent their life savings to get there \u2014 the territory\u2019s freedom from government was an added incentive. But this lax society had an inevitable downside: Thievery and violence were commonplace, as were illicit industries that sprang up catering to the influx of forty-niners. The effect of the Gold Rush was quickly apparent. California\u2019s population swelled from less than 8,000 in 1846 to 380,000 by 1860. Eventually, the Gold Rush faded, but the Golden State has retained its place in the American imagination as a beacon of new opportunities.Today, mining for data is more valuable than finding gold. Now it\u2019s engineers, entrepreneurs and computer scientists who seek fortunes in the West to become the new gods of Silicon Valley. The Bay Area is full of modern prospectors trying to get a taste of what the gold miners were searching for \u2014 and today, many actually do win big. When Google went public in 2004, over 900 employees instantly became millionaires. Similar stories abound at Facebook, Twitter and other former startups. And often striking it rich once isn\u2019t enough: Serial entrepreneurs sometimes have multiple successes or equally spectacular failures. Also, like its predecessor, today\u2019s gold rush has been riven with epic battles, betrayals, windfalls and scams \u2014 but contracts and lawsuits have generally replaced violence as tools for revenge.

{"Headline": "Panicked Borrowers, and the Education Department\u2019s Unsettling Silence", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyBut the panic among borrowers that the newfound uncertainty unleashed helps illuminate an additional problem with the public service loan forgiveness program: Many people who believe that they qualify \u2014 and entered graduate school, borrowed piles of money and chose employers accordingly \u2014 may not realize that they are not making qualifying payments or that certain loans are not eligible for forgiveness.The program, which began in 2007, was enacted with what was supposed to be a clear-cut proposition: People who worked for 10 years in public service jobs and made regular payments would have the remainder of their federal student loans forgiven. A wide variety of jobs were supposed to qualify, from nonprofit work to teaching in a public school or practicing medicine at a public hospital.But now, 10 years later, the legal filing has sown all manner of confusion \u2014 which itself comes in the wake of a disheartening amount of misdirection given to borrowers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau receives plenty of complaints about loan servicers offering incorrect information. And well-meaning employers may also pass along bad advice.\u201cThis is one of the most complex programs ever concocted by Congress,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, a former Education Department employee who also served as the student loan ombudsman for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cSo many people who are counting on getting some help are going to be flatly rejected on a technicality.\u201dPeople who are in the loan forgiveness program, who think they are or who are contemplating trying to enter it ought to use this scare as an opportunity to step back and double-check their assumptions.At least four basic things need to happen for someone to get in the program and stay in: He or she must make payments in the right way, have the right kind of employer, be in the right loan category and have the right kind of payment plan.Let\u2019s take those four requirements in order:The lawsuit involved some employers with more esoteric nonprofit statuses, and the Education Department\u2019s filing in response declared that approval of an employment certification form \u201cdoes not reflect agency action on the borrower\u2019s qualifications\u201d for the public service loan forgiveness program. Additionally, the brief said that borrowers should not expect a truly final decision until after their 120 payments were made.Cross your fingers, everybody! And cue the justifiable panic. Dr. Jordan Chanler-Berat, 33, an emergency room physician at a nonprofit hospital in New York City, fired off a letter to the Education Department demanding final word now about the fate of his more than $300,000 in student loans. While he had previously received letters saying that his employer qualified, he was primed to be wary. At one point, his human resources person mistakenly told him that his hospital might not qualify.\u201cI was going to throw up,\u201d he said.So when she heard the news about the lawsuit, she posted the following on Facebook: \u201cTHIS IS TERRIFYING.\u201dShe has asked for her servicer\u2019s blessing on the eligibility of her nonprofit, and has not heard back yet.Since the legal filing, the Education Department has told reporters that it cannot comment on pending litigation. I didn\u2019t ask about that. Instead, I simply asked if its servicer\u2019s letters about whether an employer was eligible were something that borrowers should believe. Its three spokesmen did not answer by my deadline for this article.Let\u2019s call the Education Department\u2019s refusal to clarify the matter exactly what it is: meanness. If the department has made mistakes with the litigants and misclassified their employers, it can fix them quickly and settle the suit without freaking out untold numbers of other borrowers.When Dr. Darius Amjadi, a 49-year-old pathologist and Iraq war veteran in Portland, Ore., began his work with a veterans\u2019 hospital, he thought he had a shot at loan forgiveness from the Veterans Affairs Department\u2019s own program. At the same time, his employer informed him that his loans would be eligible for public service loan forgiveness.But the department\u2019s forgiveness has not come through. And it turns out he had not been in the right kind of federal loan to qualify for forgiveness under the public service program, despite what his employer said. \u201cIf anyone had said, \u2018Check your loans,\u2019 it would have put me on notice,\u201d Dr. Amjadi said. Now, he\u2019s got a balance of $40,000 and has missed out on years of eligibility for forgiveness.A standard repayment term for student loans is 10 years, or 120 payments. Those payments may be technically eligible if you have the right employer, but if you\u2019re making them in full (and not on an income-driven plan), you\u2019ll have paid off the loan in 10 years and there won\u2019t be any loan left to forgive.Mr. Chopra worries about people working for eligible employers and making payments in something called graduated or extended repayment plans that are not income driven. If you think that sounds like you, call your servicer and ask, then ask again at a different time to be sure.My inquiries to the Education Department about this matter yielded no replies.To review, we\u2019ve promised to help our public servants by forgiving their student loan payments after a decade. But the program is confusing, the government\u2019s legal filings contradict its websites, and its representatives aren\u2019t answering questions.This is no way to treat the people who do some of the most important work in our country. But it\u2019s also yet another reminder that as we build more complexity into our financial systems, we\u2019re sending the message to those who must navigate them that they are on their own.It\u2019s a shameful message at any time, but it\u2019s particularly galling when it\u2019s firefighters, librarians and nurses on the receiving end.Stacy Cowley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Murder Posted on Facebook Prompts Outrage and Questions Over Responsibility", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Easter, Steve Stephens drove around downtown Cleveland on what he said was a mission to commit murder \u2014 and soon he had an audience of millions for his shooting of Robert Godwin Sr., 74, which he recorded and posted on Facebook, the police in Cleveland said.On Monday, the authorities nationwide were looking for Mr. Stephens, 37, with the police as far away as Philadelphia saying they had received calls about sightings of him in that area.Now Facebook is facing a backlash over the shooting video, as it grapples with its role in policing content on its global platform.The situation is increasingly fraught for Facebook. Even as it has become a forum for more sensational events, live and otherwise, it has said it does not want to be a media company that overly arbitrates what is posted on its site. But the more reluctant it is to intervene or the slower it is to respond, the more it may open itself to the posting of killings, sexual assaults and other crimes.\u201cAny of these platforms \u2014 especially live ones \u2014 encourages users to perform,\u201d said Elizabeth Joh, a law professor at the University of California, Davis. \u201cShould Facebook have a duty to rescue a crime victim? Should we, or is it O.K. for thousands or millions of people to watch a crime unfold without doing anything except sharing it?\u201d\u201cIt was a horrific crime \u2014 one that has no place on Facebook, and goes against our policies and everything we stand for,\u201d Mr. Osofsky wrote.But the attention is often focused on Facebook because of its nearly two billion users and global influence. It is an issue that is bedeviling Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive. Facebook has encouraged users to post more \u2014 it has spent the last two years emphasizing its push into photographs and video, underpinned by a thesis that cameras have become more important in how people share moments of their lives with their friends.The problems have been compounded by the issue of fake news \u2014 false stories across the social network that some Facebook users have taken as true and that may have swayed thinking in events like elections. Mr. Zuckerberg has had to address the fake news problem several times in recent months, including working more closely with fact-checking organizations and beginning efforts to teach Facebook users how to discern what is or is not a real news story.Initiatives such as Facebook Live have been embraced by Facebook users and advertisers. Video advertising, one of the largest growth areas for Facebook and others, commands a premium compared with traditional photo and text ad formats. The more users acclimate to posting and viewing video content across these platforms, the easier it will be for the companies to sell higher-priced advertisements against them.Yet monitoring the content is imperfect. Because Facebook\u2019s network of users is so vast, the company relies on a combination of artificial intelligence, human moderators and alerts from users to flag objectionable content. If many people report an instance of offensive or harmful content at once, Facebook\u2019s algorithms will show the post to a global team of human content moderators, who will review it and decide if it violates Facebook\u2019s terms of service.\u201cThe more users are posting every aspect of their lives online, including criminally heinous conduct, the more companies have to take a proactive approach to content moderation rather than relying just on users to flag content for review,\u201d said Hemanshu Nigam, founder of SSP Blue, an advisory company for online safety, security and privacy.\u201cFacebook does, however, work well with law enforcement, as is clear from the ongoing investigation and their active support in it,\u201d he said.Mr. Stephens\u2019s video on Facebook, which lasts about a minute, shows a driver pulling up to an older man on a sidewalk. The driver asks the man to say a person\u2019s name, then pulls out a gun and shoots the man. Afterward, the victim can be seen on the sidewalk, with a streak of what appears to be blood near his head.The police originally said that Mr. Stephens had broadcast the shooting on Facebook Live, but Facebook said that while he had posted a live video at some point on Sunday, the shooting itself was not live. By late Sunday afternoon, the video had been removed from Facebook and the account had been deactivated.In a second video that was posted on Facebook, Mr. Stephens explained his actions by saying, \u201cI\u2019m at the point where I snapped.\u201dA warrant was issued for Mr. Stephens on a charge of aggravated murder, and the police asked people in Indiana, Michigan, New York, northeast Ohio and Pennsylvania to be on alert. A $50,000 reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Christopher Mele from New York. Reporting was contributed by Niraj Chokshi and Matt Stevens from New York, Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ham or Lamb? The Easter Choice May Be Changing", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byFor Easter cooks, there is one fundamental question: Is yours a lamb family or a ham family?Like most Americans, mine are ham people. My mother grew up on a dairy farm in northern Wisconsin. When the weather turned cold, they slaughtered a few pigs and hung the hams in the curing room. In the spring, after a long Lenten diet of self-denial, they pulled out a ham and it became Easter dinner.We should have probably been a lamb family. My parents\u2019 roots are in Italy and Norway. Italians do all kinds of great things with spring lamb, some of the best of it coming from Abruzzo, the region my maternal grandparents were from. The Norwegians go wild for lamb and oranges at Easter.But the family tree never came into play. (And I\u2019m sure they had no idea that some scholars link Easter ham to an ancient Babylonian myth about a god named Tammuz who was killed by a pig.) For my older relatives, the choice was simply a matter of economics and agriculture. Like most of their neighbors, they raised pigs for the family table, not sheep.My mom married my dad, and they eventually moved to the suburbs. Each Easter, she would reach into the refrigerator case at the supermarket for a ham that had been sweetened and smoked through the miracle of modern food science.These were big hams, even for a family with five kids. In the days and weeks after Easter, ham starred in scalloped potatoes, filled our sandwiches for school and, finally, became the only reason to make pea soup. And every year, it afforded my father the opportunity to tell a favorite joke: You know the definition of eternity? Two people and a ham.Lately, though, I\u2019ve been thinking that lamb is perhaps the better move at Easter. It\u2019s partly because I love an underdog.Although sheep brought by Spanish colonists were adopted by Native American tribes in the Southwest, and other breeds became essential to British colonists in the East, pigs and cattle have long been the preferred meat animals for the Northern Europeans whose culture came to dominate America. Still, lamb (from a sheep that is about a year old or younger) and mutton (which comes from mature sheep) used to be more common when wool was in higher demand. In the 1940s, there were 56 million sheep in the United States. Now there are about six million.The need for wool ebbed with the rise of synthetic fabrics and the end of World War II, when wool manufacturers were no longer pressed to make uniforms. The war also helped kill America\u2019s appetite for meat from sheep: Canned mutton was included in military rations, Ms. Wortman said, and soldiers came home vowing never to eat it again.Lamb chops remained a luxury item, reserved for a restaurant meal or a special dinner at home. A leg of lamb, with its varying muscle groups, was trickier to cook than a ham. Home cooks broke out the mint jelly and hoped for the best.Today, the American taste for lamb is changing, in part because both new immigrants and more adventurous younger eaters are changing the American palate. Good-tasting, well-raised lamb is becoming more available. Since 2009, lamb sales have jumped by about 28 percent, rising to 59 million pounds in 2016 from 46 million pounds, according to a study of store scanner data. (The numbers do not include stores like Costco or lamb sold to restaurants.)Braised lamb neck, lamb burgers and lamb ribs are on an increasing number of menus. About 10 percent of all lamb sales are now ground lamb, a product that was impossible to find a decade ago, Ms. Wortman said.\u201cAround here we always eat a lot of lamb in the spring because it\u2019s lambing season, but for some reason its always ham on Easter,\u201d Ms. Michel said. Her Easter guests invariably eat twice as much ham as lamb, she said. She prefers ham, too.\u201cI grew up thinking about how Jesus is the lamb of God, so it would be weird to devour lamb on Easter,\u201d she said.Still, his is not a big operation. On average, he sells only about 2,000 pounds a week. Part of the problem is logistics. Although there are close to 80,000 lamb producers in the country, there aren\u2019t nearly enough processing centers or distributors.\u201cIf someone called me today and wanted 20 legs for Easter, I couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI have animals, but the slaughterhouses are jammed.\u201dAs Mr. Edwards and his family rebuild the business, lamb hams will return, Mr. Rogers said. But for the American lamb business to flourish, the supply needs to become more consistent and its production methods more uniform.I took a spinoff of Ms. Hazan\u2019s recipe for Roman spring lamb braised with vinegar, rosemary and anchovy and topped it with a crunchy sugar snap pea salad charged with Calabrian chiles that I picked up from Whitney Otawka, who cooks at the Greyfield Inn on Cumberland Island in Georgia. It converted a few of my lamb-skeptical friends.So if you\u2019re a ham family, maybe this is the year to jump the fence. Good lamb can be found at an increasing number of quality grocery stores and \u2014 for those with the cash and the proximity \u2014 from boutique shepherds like Mr. Rogers.\u201cWhen I first started, people would try my lamb and say they never liked lamb before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that so many people, especially the older generation like myself, don\u2019t like lamb because they don\u2019t know lamb.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

But it was only recently that I encountered its more flamboyant cousin, the ambrosia cake.One of my friends spooned up a hefty portion, explaining that it reminded her of her granny. It also came with a warning: \u201cIf your granny didn\u2019t make it, it might not be your thing.\u201dMy granny didn\u2019t make it, and it isn\u2019t my thing.But those same elements combined in a cake?

Some add the likes of pecans, maraschino cherries and miniature marshmallows. All have some kind of white frosting and a liberal coating of shredded coconut.In my version, I opt for fewer elements and use them in several ways. I skip pineapple and bananas and stick with citrus, choosing seedless clementines over mandarins and oranges. Some are juiced and stirred into a tangy curd to slather between the layers. I cut others into sections to add a fresh burst of fruit. If you miss the pineapple and bananas, feel free to add some to the filling.Similarly, the coconut appears in the cake itself (as coconut milk, oil and, if you would like, coconut rum or extract), and again in a shredded form in the filling and as a garnish.You can use either sweetened or unsweetened shredded coconut. Sweetened is the more traditional choice. But with its abundance of marshmallowlike meringue frosting, this cake doesn\u2019t need the extra sugar. But I go for sweetened coconut every time.

Nobody has done that before.\u201dMaurizio Folini, a pilot with a local helicopter company who brought Mr. Steck\u2019s body to Kathmandu, said that it had been windy on Sunday and that Mr. Steck had fallen more than 3,280 feet.

{"Headline": "Guess Who\u2019s for a Carbon Tax Now", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byFixesBut Michael Crothers doesn\u2019t work for an environmental organization. He\u2019s the president of Shell Canada. Steve Williams is head of Suncor, Canada\u2019s largest oil company. Ben van Beurden is chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell. Bob Dudley is chief executive of BP.All of these energy companies favor a tax on every ton of carbon emissions, which is one of two ways to price emissions. The other way is called \u201ccap and trade\u201d \u2014 creating a market in emissions by imposing a maximum. Companies who want to exceed the level can buy the right from others who pollute less.Let\u2019s assume for now that this support for a carbon tax is genuine. (More about this later.) In the age of Trump, this is a gift that shouldn\u2019t be wasted.Could it actually happen?The organization claims that if the plan is fully implemented, it would alone achieve twice the reductions of all Obama-era regulations combined, allowing America to meet the high end of its obligations under the Paris climate accord. So the plan would scrap the Clean Power Plan and other regulations it says would become superfluous.Oil companies that support a carbon tax do so because they are also gas companies, and carbon pricing would help gas replace coal in the power generation business.They also know that the likely alternative is a patchwork of regulations. \u201cIf you accept that society is going to deal with this problem, you want approaches you can understand, manage and work,\u201d said Nicolette Bartlett, director of carbon pricing at CDP, a global organization through which companies disclose their environmental impacts. \u201cMarket-based approaches give you this.\u201dAs for Exxon Mobil, now would be a great time to show that its endorsement means something. Tillerson\u2019s support for a tax in 2009 was aimed in part at killing a cap-and-trade bill in Congress, and Exxon Mobil pours money into the campaigns of legislators who vote against carbon pricing.Other American companies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips don\u2019t even bother with the public relations.One lesson from these countries, however, is that carbon taxes can be hard to sustain. Australia began one in 2012 \u2014 and ended it in 2014. The tax successfully cut emissions. But Australians hated paying more for electricity, and only some tax money returned to them as compensation for the increase. When the tax vanished, emissions took a sharp turn up again.But it\u2019s not working now. A new provincial government has kept it frozen since 2012, with no increases. Not coincidentally, 2012 was the year that emissions started creeping up again.The lesson: Carbon taxes don\u2019t work if they\u2019re too low to affect economic behavior. And they certainly don\u2019t work if they are repealed.That challenge has something basic in common with others that hinder climate change action. \u201cAdvocates are trying to convince their fellow citizens to make short-term sacrifices now for the benefit of other people, in other countries, in 40 years,\u201d said Halstead. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take into account human nature.\u201dAmericans love some taxes \u2014 the Social Security tax, for one. They think of it as a benefit, not a tax, and the connection between what they pay and what they later collect is clear.To avoid penalizing American business, the leadership council proposes border adjustments \u2014 extra fees on imports from countries with no carbon tax, and tax rebates to American companies that export to countries with no carbon tax. This would also encourage other countries to adopt a tax.There\u2019s much here for environmentalists to dislike. It would repeal the Clean Power Plan (which President Trump has already vowed to do) and phase out other federal regulations on emissions.The plan would also protect fossil fuel companies from lawsuits: \u201cRobust carbon taxes would also make possible an end to federal and state tort liability for emitters,\u201d said the Leadership Council.This likely will mean \u2026 whatever oil companies want it to mean. Halstead argues that it\u2019s necessary to win Republican support. And he\u2019s right that a climate change activist wants to punish oil companies that lied about climate change, he or she probably wants something else even more: to drastically cut our carbon emissions.Since the public\u2019s support would come from the dividends, the tax money would not be subsidizing clean technologies. Neither would it be helping those harmed by climate change or the fossil fuel industry. Nor retraining coal miners or helping workers adjust to a greener economy. And labor union insistence on what it calls a \u201cjust transition\u201d is so strong that it helped defeat a Washington State proposal for a carbon tax last year. (The Koch brothers were the other major opponent. Go figure.)A year ago, no one who cared about the environment would have considered trading all this away. But climate policy is in the hands of climate deniers now, and we are staring at catastrophe. The only path is for businesses, especially oil companies, to seize the lobbying machinery they have used to deny climate change and block regulation, and throw it behind the carbon tax that at least the largest of them claims to support. What an irony that the best hope for the climate right now seems to be for Exxon Mobil to lead the charge.Advertisement"}

What happens when they lose? Dr. Zhang\u2019s position remains that his gambit will ultimately lead to more discussion of infertility generally and reveal how vast the community of couples struggling with the issue really is.

{"Headline": "American Brandy Is Surging, Even in Whiskey Country", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Three years ago, Joe Heron, a pharmaceutical executive turned beverage-industry entrepreneur, moved here from Minneapolis to open a distillery. But unlike the dozens of other would-be whiskey barons setting up shop in Kentucky these days, Mr. Heron and his wife, Lesley, weren\u2019t interested in making bourbon. They wanted to make brandy.Brandy has become a quiet giant of the liquor industry. More than 13 million cases were sold domestically in 2016, outpacing gin, Scotch and Irish whiskey, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. And most of that \u2014 eight million cases \u2014 was American brandy.\u201cPeople ask, \u2018Is it hot?\u2019 I say, \u2018It\u2019s about to get white hot,\u2019\u201d Mr. Heron said on a recent tour of his distillery, a converted warehouse in this city\u2019s Butchertown district, just east of downtown.Though overshadowed by the bourbon boom, domestic brandy has a growing appeal. Adventurous young consumers, weaned on craft whiskey and beer, are eager to try something new. Bartenders love it because many classic cocktail recipes call for brandy, and new American expressions like Copper & Kings emphasize flavor and power over the more subtle notes found in Old World brandies like Cognac.Broadly speaking, brandy is simply fermented, distilled fruit juice, and any fruit will do. Until Prohibition, apple, peach and pear brandies were some of the most popular drinks in America, though hundreds of distilleries made grape brandy (essentially, distilled wine) as well. Since then, American brandy has been dominated, and defined, by a few brands \u2014 Christian Brothers, E&J, Korbel \u2014 and their thick, super-sweet style.Perhaps the most famous brandy isn\u2019t American at all: Cognac, which must be distilled and aged in the Cognac region of France. (Armagnac, another kind of French brandy, is made in Gascony.) Cognac producers follow strict rules, including a limited choice of varietals \u2014 primarily ugni blanc, a mild grape also known as trebbiano.American brandy faces none of those constraints. That freedom is drawing craft distillers who feel crowded out of the whiskey market and, at the same time, see an opportunity to remake American brandy as something other than a syrupy-sweet concoction.If there is a single definition of American brandy, it is a style built around robust flavors, in contrast to the muted elegance of Cognac.\u201cIn Cognac, the soil is dominant, and they use a neutral grape, so all the character comes from the soil,\u201d said Hubert Germain-Robin, widely considered the godfather of modern American brandy. He grew up in an old Cognac-producing family in France, but as a young man, he took his skills to California. There, in 1982, he helped found the Germain-Robin distillery, where he turned out a series of cult-favorite brandies (coveted by, among others, Ronald Reagan).\u201cEspecially on the West Coast,\u201d Mr. Germain-Robin said, \u201cthe fruit is very dominant.\u201dThere are two clear camps among American brandy distillers: the innovators and the traditionalists.\u201cWe don\u2019t play by the old rules,\u201d Mr. Heron said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for the finesse of a brandy with the muscle of a whiskey.\u201dMr. Tate, 42, of Tate & Company in Texas, takes a similar approach. A self-taught coppersmith, he makes his own stills, with added features to personalize his brandy. (In fact, he earns extra money building stills for other companies.) And he embraces locally grown grapes; for the moment, his favorite is zinfandel, a choice unheard-of, let alone legal, in France.\u201cI don\u2019t want to use the term irreverence, but distilling is inherently an artistic endeavor,\u201d Mr. Tate said, adding, \u201cWe just step out and try something new,\u201d and hope that it won\u2019t disappoint.A much different story is being told in California by a geophysicist-turned-distiller named Daniel Farber. An erudite former New Yorker and former professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Mr. Farber, 54, took up distilling as a hobby in the 1980s, though he didn\u2019t start selling brandy, under the Osocalis label, until 2002. Even today, he makes just two expressions, Rare and XO (along with an apple brandy), and he recently planted his own vineyards.If Copper & Kings is punk rock, Osocalis is classical. Mr. Farber uses French-built Charentais stills, the same as Cognac makers, and he ages his brandy exclusively in French oak. For him, a good American brandy is a matter of interpretation and translation: taking Old World techniques and figuring out how they work in New World soils and climates, with New World grapes.\u201cI really love Cognac, Armagnac and Calvados,\u201d he said, referring to a French style of apple brandy. \u201cSo for me it\u2019s really about understanding the quality factors of traditional brandy and trying to obtain these qualities with the fruit, climate and soils we have in California.\u201dIf there is any hesitation about American brandy, particularly among old-timers, it\u2019s that they have seen this excitement before.But there is reason to believe this time is different. In the \u201980s, the liquor market hadn\u2019t been primed by a decade of rapid growth in brown spirits and craft distilling. Palates hadn\u2019t been trained for the nuances of a complex domestic spirit. And brandy, though always a solid sell in regional markets, was just a blip in the spirits business, compared with where it is today.It is also increasingly popular with bartenders. Many popular classic cocktail recipes, like the Sidecar, call for brandy, but Cognac is expensive, and many American brands are too sweet. The new generation of craft brandies solves both problems.The truly exciting thing about American brandy, though, is the range of variables \u2014 grape variety, yeast, soil, barrel, climate \u2014 that can combine to produce a vast range of styles.\u201cIt\u2019s still in the infancy of American brandy,\u201d Mr. Germain-Robin said. \u201cIt has so much potential. If people are distilling in the Finger Lakes or Virginia, we\u2019re going to have many varieties. It\u2019s unbelievable what we\u2019re going to be able to do over time.\u201dAmerican brandies are nowhere near as well known as their French cousins. Here are some bottles that offer a good introduction.A blend of varietals with a heavy dose of pinot noir, s\u00e9millon and colombard, aged for about six years. Citrus and spice notes dominate.A monster spirit drawn from a wide variety of grapes, bottled at cask strength and redolent of dark fruits and caramel.Made from a blend of Virginia-grown grapes and aged for at least two years in French oak barrels, it is the most whiskeylike of the bunch, with notes of vanilla, spices and stewed cherries.Made from upstate New York grapes and aged in used American oak barrels, with hints of vanilla, stone fruits and raisins.One of the oldest, and priciest, American brandies, No. 89 \u2014 named for 1989, the year it was distilled \u2014 is made from pinot noir and sauvignon blanc. It offers notes of banana, toasted coconut and cloves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Has Coffee Gotten Too Fancy?", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The $1 cup of coffee is divisive, as drinks go.For some, it\u2019s a staple of the American morning: a comforting routine, a good deal. Anything that costs more than $1 is needlessly expensive, a waste of money \u2014 the coffee from a deli, diner or doughnut cart is all you need to start the day. For others, the $1 cup is suspiciously cheap. Maybe it tastes bad, or its production does harm to the land and is unfair to laborers. If you have to pay more, then that is probably a reflection of a drink\u2019s true cost.Locol\u2019s stated mission is to bring wholesome, affordable food to underserved neighborhoods. The coffee delivers. Obtained and roasted according to the same lofty standards found at Intelligentsia Coffee, Stumptown Coffee Roasters or any of the small, innovative companies that have transformed the high end of the industry in the past decade, Locol\u2019s coffee is clean and flavorful.But unlike those shops, where a cup can cost $3 or more, Locol charges just $1 for a 12-ounce coffee, or $1.50 if you want milk and sugar. Rather than offer free condiments and pass on the cost to all customers, those who want milky, sweet coffee pay for their pleasures, while drinkers of black coffee get a break. As for getting it chilled, that\u2019s on the house: Iced coffee costs the same as hot.\u201cThere\u2019s an extreme democratization that I really want to make happen in coffee,\u201d said Tony Konecny, the head of Locol\u2019s coffee operation, who goes by Tonx. Good coffee, he said, should be brought to a broad audience, not just a \u201cself-selecting group\u201d of epicures.\u201cCoffee still thinks that mass appeal is a sign of selling out and inauthenticity, but everybody wears Levi\u2019s,\u201d he said of the culture. \u201cI think contemporary coffee has failed to find the consumers it should be finding.\u201dA few of those consumers were lingering at the Locol in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles on a recent bright day. Some were nursing aguas frescas, others were holding court while R&B played at block-party volume from an array of speakers embedded in the ceiling. One person was sorting through a small tower of paperwork.There is, of course, another fast-food chain that is known for its coffee: McDonald\u2019s. The company has embarked on a project to make all of its coffee sustainable by 2020 by innovating at every level of its supply chain \u2014 investing in its farmers, for instance, as many of the much smaller high-end coffee companies do. (Coffee sold at McDonald\u2019s restaurants in Europe already meets the company\u2019s sustainability standards.)The scale of McDonald\u2019s business is vastly different from Locol\u2019s, but the consumer experience isn\u2019t, not when it comes to coffee: Both offer a cup that is cheap and approachable.The efficiencies of the fast-food model are what allow Mr. Konecny to buy high-quality beans for about three times the price of commodity coffee and still sell it for $1. The coffee comes from Red Fox Coffee Merchants, a boutique importer that supplies some of the country\u2019s most exacting roasters; Mr. Konecny coordinates closely with their buyer, who in turn works with farmers to finance them and determine best practices for growing the beans.The coffee is brewed by Locol\u2019s kitchen staff, and when a new batch is prepared the old batch is cooled and mixed in with cold-brew coffee to be served on ice: There is no waste. Black coffee is easy to scale up; stand-alone coffee shops, with their intricate menus (cortados, almond milk lattes, iced matcha spritzers) can\u2019t compete.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t run a coffee shop selling coffee for a dollar,\u201d Mr. Konecny said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a sustainable business.\u201dJonathan Rubinstein, an owner of Joe, a coffee chain based in New York with 14 locations, agrees that the numbers would not work. Joe\u2019s shops are in some of the most expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan, including Greenwich Village and the Upper East Side. Next month, a Joe will open in the World Trade Center. Mr. Rubinstein pays as much as $25,000 per month in rent \u2014 he estimates that the average is $15,000 per month \u2014 along with labor, materials, utilities, insurance and the many other expenses that are the cost of doing business.\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is interesting, and what fun to try to do it out of a window \u2014 if you sold nothing else,\u201d he said of Mr. Konecny. \u201cBut what a volume you would have to do.\u201dStill, Mr. Rubinstein says that Mr. Konecny makes a good point. \u201cKudos to him for trying something so out of the box,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes you think about all the restaurants that are doing exactly what he\u2019s doing, and literally are charging five times what he\u2019s charging.\u201dMr. Konecny\u2019s ambitions for Yes Plz go beyond selling a high-quality cup of coffee at that magic price point, though he knows that it sends a powerful message. What he wants to do is shift the very nature of coffee culture. He has no patience for what he calls the \u201cculinary burlesque\u201d of pour-over bars, with their solemn baristas and potted succulents. \u201cIt\u2019s dress-up,\u201d he said.Those settings and presentations, he said, send the wrong message: that good coffee must also be expensive and fetishized.\u201cWe have become overly focused on this ingredient preciousness, single-origin puritanism,\u201d he said. As a result, he added, coffee just keeps getting \u201cfancier and fancier.\u201dIn a sense, Mr. Konecny is facing off with his own history. A respected veteran of \u201cspecialty\u201d coffee, the industry term for the high-end market, he worked for Victrola Coffee Roasters in Seattle starting in 2002, when the company was a hive of innovation. He was then hired by Intelligentsia Coffee to help direct its expansion to Los Angeles, and later started his own roaster, Tonx, which he sold to Blue Bottle Coffee in 2014.\u201cA lot of my colleagues don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing here,\u201d he said.The mistake, in his view, was for independent coffee shops to define themselves in opposition to Starbucks and other chains, and to create \u2014 inadvertently \u2014 a culture of nerdy superiority.\u201cYou throw at all your customers that coffee is this delicate, special thing that has to be done exactly right on exactly this equipment,\u201d he said.But does the $1 price go too far? \u201cMy worry is that this will reinforce the idea that specialty coffee is inherently overpriced, when it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d said Charles Babinski, a co-owner of G&B Coffee and Go Get Em Tiger, in Los Angeles. \u201cThe best coffees in the world cost nothing when you compare it to the best beers or a fancy glass of wine, and the margins that businesses take on coffee are smaller than you\u2019re going to find in a bar.\u201d\u201cThe difference between O.K. coffee \u2014 what we all drink with friends at diners and those times when we just need coffee \u2014 and exceptional coffee takes a lot of work,\u201d said Mr. Barr. He also pointed out that pushing any product to its highest end required more investment. You pay a premium for that extra grade of quality.Verve, which is based in Santa Cruz, Calif., also has locations in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo, each one airy, laid back and elegant, in California style. The setting is a part of Verve\u2019s equation: It signal that the coffee is premium, and also gives customers a nice place to sit.Mr. Konecny is following a different formula. If Verve and other high-end shops identify with the world of gastronomy, Locol looks to street culture. \u201cThere\u2019s something about street wear in particular, where a kid from around here and a billionaire getting off a private jet are both wearing the same thing,\u201d he said. His vision is for Yes Plz to be the shaded part on a Venn diagram where the tastes of wildly different demographics converge.That\u2019s why there is no gastro-sermonizing at Locol, no talk of farms or varieties. The coffee on the menu is either hot or cold, and served with a cheerful lack of ceremony.Still, the information is there for those who want it: A dedicated Twitter feed will relay details of that week\u2019s coffees. \u201cPeople who want to go down the rabbit hole can, but it\u2019s not what we put on the bag,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to buy into a set of conceits about how to buy or understand coffee to enjoy it.\u201dThe way Mr. Konecny sees it, good, inexpensive coffee can and should be everywhere, and not just at Locol: \u201cWhat we know about coffee sourcing, coffee roasting, coffee brewing, coffee service \u2014 there\u2019s really no reason why you couldn\u2019t make the coffee at every bodega taste good.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Non-Techies Can Get With the Programming", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byWhen the Georgetown University Law Center offered computer programming last year, it was an experiment, a single class for about 20 students. It was filled almost instantly, and the waitlist swelled to 130. This semester, the law school has five programming classes, and the waitlist still overflowed.\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to become programmers, but they realize these are skills that will make them better lawyers,\u201d said Paul Ohm, the Georgetown law professor who teaches the course. His students, for example, learn to write short, tailored programs that can identify clusters of words and concepts in Supreme Court rulings more accurately than a Google search or standard legal software.It\u2019s the same in every field, from marketing to manufacturing to medicine. Code, it seems, is the lingua franca of the modern economy.So you have no plans to become a computer engineer, no dreams of being code wizard at Google or Facebook. But you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time to pick up practical technology knowledge and skills, including writing some code. There are options aplenty, in college classes, online courses and boot camps. The offerings range widely in terms of time required, skills mastered and price tag, from free to more than $20,000 for some six-month programs.Enrollment in computer science courses has exploded in recent years, with both majors and nonmajors fueling the surge \u2014 so much so that many schools now restrict enrollment by nonmajors.One recent institutional adaptation is the creation of so-called CS+X initiatives at schools like Stanford, Northwestern and the University of Illinois. These programs are hybrid majors that combine computing with other disciplines, including anthropology, comparative literature and history \u2014 a nod to the reality that software skills can advance research in nearly every field.But the main on-ramp to computing for non-techies is an introductory computer science class. Today, at many universities, at least half of the student population takes the intro courses. At Stanford, it\u2019s 90 percent.These classes include coding as a window to \u201ccomputational thinking,\u201d which involves abstract reasoning, modeling and breaking down problems into the recipelike steps of an algorithm. That kind of thinking, said Ed Lazowska, professor of computer science at the University of Washington, has become \u201can essential component of a 21st-century liberal arts education.\u201d\u201cProgramming,\u201d he said, \u201cis the hands-on, inquiry-based way we teach computational thinking.\u201dNot a computer whiz? Not a problem. Try these practice exam questions from Computer Science Principles.The programming language for an introductory course, professors say, is not so important, though Python, JavaScript and Java are widely used.David J. Malan, a computer science professor at Harvard, has students work in several different languages in his popular introductory course for majors and nonmajors, CS50. The main goal, he says, is to demystify technology and provide a foundation for students who want to go further. \u201cYou come to realize it\u2019s just one idea after another, layered on top of each other,\u201d Dr. Malan said.No matter what your academic or career path, he has this advice: Take at least one course in computer science. \u201cIt\u2019s just so useful and empowering,\u201d he said.At the nation\u2019s coding boot camps, the pitch has nothing to do with a liberal arts education. This thriving niche of the for-profit education business tightly links courses to the job market.Today, there are 91 coding campuses across the country, producing 18,000 graduates last year, up from fewer than 2,200 in 2013, Course Report says. Programs vary, but the average length is 13 weeks and average cost $11,500.Most boot camp programs are full-time immersives, and the curriculum is tightly focused on the skills most in demand in the marketplace \u2014 these days, web development and data analysis.But this young industry is evolving and adding short introductory sessions and online courses. At General Assembly, which operates 20 boot camp campuses, one of the most popular offerings is \u201cProgramming for Non-Programmers,\u201d said Jake Schwartz, the chief executive. The two-day version of the course costs $525. General Assembly also has a free online course, \u201cDash,\u201d which covers the basics of writing software for the web.When considering a boot camp, first sample the free offerings. \u201cTry it out before you commit your money,\u201d said Liz Eggleston, co-founder of Course Report.Coding camps are not regulated or accredited. Within the industry, initiatives are underway to establish standards for required reporting of graduation and job placement rates. The leading boot camps are disclosing those numbers already.Some universities have started their own coding camps. Their efforts are mainly courses added to continuing education programs, and tap the expertise of outside partners.Trilogy Education Services, which manages skills-based training programs, is working with the continuing education arms of more than 20 universities, including Northwestern, Rutgers, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of California, Berkeley. The six-month courses, with classes held evenings and weekends, cost nearly $10,000. The initial course is on web development, but a new one on data analysis and data visualization is being added.Students graduate with new skills and a portfolio of work, said Dan Sommer, chief executive of Trilogy, and they can qualify for certificates that verify they took and completed the curriculum.Coursera, edX and Udacity, three major providers of MOOCs, or massive open online courses, have evolved into hubs for teaching computing skills. Their most popular courses are nearly all programming and technical. On edX, the lone nonprofit, the course taken by more people than any other is the online version of Harvard\u2019s introduction to computer science, CS50. The course is free, but for $90 students get a certificate of completion.Labor market demand largely explains the dominance of computing offerings. But Richard C. Levin, the former president of Yale and chief executive of Coursera, suggests another factor. Digital subjects, he said, are more naturally suited to being taught online. \u201cYou really can do it yourself with technology courses,\u201d Dr. Levin said. \u201cOr at least you don\u2019t lose as much by not having the classroom experience as you do with the liberal arts.\u201dCoursera\u2019s classes can be taken free, but the track for earning a certificate costs $39 to $79 a month, depending on the course. Udacity has developed more than a dozen certificate-bearing programs it calls nanodegrees, including digital marketing, Android programming, artificial intelligence and self-driving car engineering. The course work is created in partnership with leading companies in those fields, like Facebook, Google, IBM and Mercedes-Benz. A nanodegree course typically costs $200 a month, but if you complete it within 12 months you get half your money back.Sebastian Thrun, the co-founder and chairman of Udacity, who is a former Stanford professor and Google scientist, said his company has found a way to improve the notoriously low completion rates for online courses. Add people.And as he sees it, success in programming requires a certain kind of human empathy. \u201cIt\u2019s a people skill,\u201d said Dr. Thrun, who created and led the self-driving car project at Google, \u201cgetting your brain inside the computer, to think like it does and understand that it\u2019s just a little device that can only do what it\u2019s told.\u201dSteve Lohr is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

He plays a soap opera actor who claims to have done extensive research to prepare for his part as Dr. Dirk Johanson in the ludicrously over-the-top show \u201cDoctors, Nurses and Patients,\u201d but is unable to pronounce even the simplest medical term correctly.\u201cAnal canal\u201d comes out as \u201canal CAY-nal.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the results of your ur-INE test,\u201d Dr. Johanson declares to a patient, played by Phil Hartman. \u201cIt might be the Big C \u2014 canker.\u201dYou can forgive an actor an awful lot when he can produce something so sublimely deadpan, and then, in Baldwin\u2019s particular case, eventually go on to play the great Jack Donaghy on \u201c30 Rock,\u201d his dark eyes glinting with anarchic, Machiavellian intelligence; and then to out-dumb President Donald J. Trump on the current season of \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d So how are we meant to think about this person, whom we know but of course do not know?\u201cI\u2019m not actually writing this book to discuss my work, my opinions or my life,\u201d Baldwin declares right off the bat and soon adds, \u201cI\u2019m writing it because I was paid to write it.\u201dAfter that start, you feel the needle on your Baldwin-appreciation meter trending downward. But to his surprise (and ours) he pulls himself together and delivers a thorough and sophisticated effort to answer an interesting question: How did an indifferently raised, self-flagellating kid from a just-making-ends-meet, desultorily functioning Long Island family, in Massapequa, turn into Alec Baldwin, gifted actor, familiar public figure, impressively thoughtful person, notorious pugilist?The passages about his childhood \u2014 his mother overwhelmed, depressed, lying in bed surrounded by laundry; his father working at a school; six siblings fighting for space and resources in a two-bedroom house, their parents unable to afford even a washing machine \u2014 are beautifully written and unexpectedly moving.\u201cSix pieces of driftwood,\u201d Baldwin writes of himself and his siblings, \u201cjust bobbing through our neighborhood, without a current to carry us in any particular direction, passing time, trying to pass our classes, avoiding trouble, courting trouble, scoring points, telling jokes, drinking, smoking, always mindful of how little we had.\u201dHe never intended to be an actor but fell into the job when, as a student at George Washington University, he spontaneously decided to audition for the New York University theater program while visiting the city. He got a spot despite having no experience, transferred out of George Washington and then had an existential crisis.Why hadn\u2019t he continued with his plans of going to law school? \u201cWhy was I spending hours at the Lee Strasberg Institute weeping or directing scenes wherein we staged our dreams or shouting into a corner at some unseen source of my anxieties?\u201d\u201cNevertheless,\u201d whose title comes from a dirty joke that Baldwin heard from the British actor Michael Gambon, is full of unexpectedly sharp descriptions.Of Mary-Louise Parker, his Off Broadway co-star in \u201cPrelude to a Kiss,\u201d he writes: \u201cWith her big eyes and lanky frame, you weren\u2019t sure if she was a ballet dancer or a murderer.\u201d Harrison Ford, who replaced him as Tom Clancy\u2019s character Jack Ryan after \u201cThe Hunt for Red October,\u201d is \u201ca little man, short, scrawny and wiry, whose soft voice sounds as if it\u2019s coming from behind a door.\u201dHe is tough on himself. Writing about \u201cThe Cooler,\u201d a small film he made in 2003, when his popularity was not at an all-time high, he says, \u201cWhen I read the script and got to the page where my character kicks a pregnant woman in the stomach, I asked my agent, \u2018Don\u2019t I have enough troubles?\u2019\u201dHe says that he had no ghostwriter or collaborator for this book. That is impressive, because he\u2019s a highly literate and fluent writer, but it also means that his authorial discipline can abandon him. He has a bit of trouble with transitions.In the worst example, he\u2019s talking admiringly about the actor Christopher Reeve, who was president of the Creative Coalition, an organization for politically involved actors like Baldwin. One moment Baldwin is standing next to Reeve at the group\u2019s 1995 retreat and all is well.And then: \u201cTwo weeks later he broke his neck and was paralyzed,\u201d Baldwin writes. \u201cSoon after that, I was elected TCC president.\u201dBaldwin expresses love for his second wife, Hilaria, and his four children, and seems to have found a new peace after a lifetime of battling his demons. \u201cI want to end this book contemplating happiness and renewal,\u201d he says.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that was you!\u201d the young cast member Pete Davidson exclaimed. \u201cYou were so handsome!\u201dThey traded personal-appearance insults for a bit, with Davidson marveling at the ravages of time. \u201cAt what point when you get older does your whole head, like, expand?\u201d he asked. \u201cDoes that happen to everyone? Is it going to happen to me?\u201d\u201cYes, Pete,\u201d Baldwin responded, \u201cand along the way if you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll have an entire career.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "You\u2019re Too Busy. You Need a \u2018Shultz Hour.\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byWhen George Shultz was secretary of state in the 1980s, he liked to carve out one hour each week for quiet reflection. He sat down in his office with a pad of paper and pen, closed the door and told his secretary to interrupt him only if one of two people called:\u201cMy wife or the president,\u201d Shultz recalled.These days, however, it is a very tempting way to live. It can be hard to live any other way, in fact. We carry supercomputers in our pockets and place them next to us as we sleep. They\u2019re always there, with a new status update to be read, a new photograph to be taken, a new sports score or Trump outrage to be checked.Even before smartphones, this country\u2019s professional culture had come to venerate freneticism. How often do you hear somebody humble-brag about how busy they are? The saddest version, and I\u2019ve heard it more than once, is the story of people who send work emails on their wedding day or from the hospital room where their child is born \u2014 and are proud of it.My goal with this column is to persuade you to add a Shultz Hour, or something like it, to your week.I\u2019ve just begun to do so. I have committed to carving out an hour each week with no meetings, no phone calls, no email, no Twitter, no Facebook, no mobile alerts and no podcasts. Sometimes, I plan to spend the hour sitting down, as Shultz did, and other times taking a stroll. I keep a pen and paper with me and have set my phone to ring only if my wife calls. (My boss can\u2019t start a war, so I\u2019m willing to ignore him for an hour.)The fact it felt hard to commit to a full hour was a sign of my need to do so. Like many people, I\u2019m overly connected. I have confused the availability of new information with the importance of it. If you spend all your time collecting new information, you won\u2019t leave enough time to make sense of it.The science of the mind is clear about this point. Our brains can be in either \u201ctask-positive\u201d or \u201ctask-negative\u201d mode, but not both at once. Our brain benefits from spending time in each state.Whether you decide a Shultz Hour makes sense for you, I\u2019d encourage you not to fool yourself into thinking that you can easily change your habits in little ways here and there. The ubiquity of smartphones, together with our culture of celebrating busyness, makes ad hoc approaches difficult. You are much more likely to carve out time for strategic thinking by making concrete changes to your habits.Advertisement"}

Within three weeks, 1,000 people joined.Ms. Cox\u2019s group is one of more than a dozen popping out like dogwood blooms in these comfortable suburbs of brick homes, shopping malls and technology companies. They have names like the Johns Creek-Milton Progressives Network, Roswell Resistance Huddle and Liberal Moms of Roswell and Cobb.If a Democrat were to win the seat \u2013 once held by Newt Gingrich, and recently vacated by Tom Price, who joined Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet as secretary of health and human services \u2014 it would not be because of the $4 million that has come into the Ossoff campaign, much of it from national donors. Rather, it would be thanks to volunteer brigades roused by Mr. Trump\u2019s election, who are knocking on doors, making phone calls and writing personalized post cards to turn out voters.Even though the district favors Republicans, special elections are low-participation affairs; a strong ground game by Democrats could upend the usual outcome.Mr. Ossoff, 30, a documentary filmmaker and first-time candidate, is hoping for a knockout punch in the open primary on April 18. All candidates in the race appear on the same ballot. If Mr. Ossoff, the polling leader, can win more than 50 percent, it will eliminate a runoff. If the race goes to a second round, scheduled June 20, a Republican would be favored because of the party\u2019s historic advantage.Ms. Cox recalls insisting to Mr. Ossoff that he use lawn signs, even after campaign consultants had ruled them out, arguing that they have no effect. She got in Mr. Ossoff\u2019s face \u2014 literally, she says \u2014 and told him lawn signs would show shy Democrats like her and her friends that they are not alone.\u201cIf you want volunteer action and people working for you up in these red districts, you need to help us help you,\u201d she recalls telling Mr. Ossoff.Today, there are lots of Ossoff signs.When Mr. Ossoff addressed the Johns Creek-Milton Progressives last week, in a subdivision called Medlock Bridge, he spoke of the young people involved in his campaign.\u201cAnd there are a lot of moms,\u201d a woman piped up from the back, \u201cwho are almost 50 who have never gone to anything like this in their whole life.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Ossoff said.Afterward, supporters stayed behind, describing their surprise that so many liberals had come out of the woodwork. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like being a gay person and realizing there are other gay people in the world,\u201d Tobie Kranitz Walters, a business consultant, said.Many newly hatched activists described a similar pathway, from feeling abashed about sharing their political views before November to feeling emboldened to act out of anger at the Trump administration.Jessica Zeigler, 32, who works in the medical device industry, said she had cried for days when Hillary Clinton lost. Her son, Noah, came home from first grade distraught that someone had told a Muslim classmate \u201cnow you have to leave.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d always been surrounded by conservatives, and I was very uncomfortable sharing my views, so I didn\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Zeigler said. \u201cI didn\u2019t do any activism. I just voted. But I felt on Nov. 9 that wasn\u2019t enough. I was mad at myself.\u201dOn Saturday, Ms. Zeigler and some 25 members of two grass-roots groups gathered in the clubhouse of a community pool to write postcards to Democratic voters. Chloe Carlson, 15, wrote to one district resident, \u201cAs a high schooler my future means a lot to me, and it\u2019s in your hands.\u201dShe sat at a low table beside her mother, Kit Carlson, who trains bank employees. \u201cWhen I found this group, it was crazy to find out I was not the only one,\u2019\u2019 Mrs. Carlson said.The groups are adept at using social media. They have private Facebook groups, Slack channels to coordinate volunteers and email blasts headlined \u201cIf you only do one thing today.\u201dLesley Bauer, who founded PaveItBlue with Ms. Cox, was asked the other day by the Ossoff campaign if she could find two dozen volunteers to drive voters to polls.Professional campaign organizers, who are used to struggling to enlist volunteers, said they were witnessing something remarkable. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d said Amy Friedman, Mr. Ossoff\u2019s field director, a veteran of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in Iowa and Maryland.\u201cNothing we\u2019re doing would be possible without their existence,\u201d Ms. Friedman said of the grass-roots groups. \u201cIt\u2019s something Jon says every day.\u201dOn Saturday, 50 people signed in at an Ossoff field office in Marietta to knock on doors of likely Democratic voters.\u201cWhy are we doing this?\u201d a campaign staff member told the crowd, whose attire included \u201cResist\u201d and \u201cDump Trump\u201d ball caps. \u201cThis is the most effective way to turn out voters. If we can turn out enough, we can end this on April 18.\u201dMs. Cox, walking a suburban street, knocked on the door of Kevin and Erin Jones. Their young daughter squealed when she heard the election date. \u201cApril 18 is my best friend\u2019s birthday and we\u2019re going to Sparkles!\u201d she said.Both parents said they planned to vote for Mr. Ossoff. Ms. Jones, who works in strategy for a communications company, said she had voted for Mrs. Clinton, but had declined to put a sign in her yard.\u201cThere was just this stigma of being a Democratic voter in Georgia,\u201d she said. There was also a reluctance to broadcast her support because of the strong hostility toward Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump\u2019s election ended that.\u201cI\u2019m all for balance, I\u2019m just not for crazy,\u201d Ms. Jones said.Ms. Cox asked if she would like an Ossoff yard sign. Yes, said Ms. Jones.

He has also been far more web savvy than his rivals, running what may be France\u2019s first viral campaign.When French voters go to the polls on Sunday for the first round of elections, they will do so after a campaign that has moved beyond rallies and other traditional events and migrated online for the first time. With some polls showing as many as 30 percent of the voters still undecided, every vote will count \u2014 and so will every \u201clike.\u201dFar-right websites, an ecosystem often referred to as the Fachosph\u00e8re, have long given oxygen to Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front, which was the first French party to create a website. And the left has traditionally had intense ideological debates in the mainstream news media.In this campaign, however, in which the left is split among several candidates, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, a former Trotskyite and longtime Socialist senator before breaking ranks, has more YouTube followers than any rival and a league of active online supporters eager to jump on critics.That\u2019s especially true on the left, where voters are deciding among Mr. M\u00e9lenchon; Mr. Macron, a 39-year-old centrist, former banker and finance minister under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a Socialist; and Beno\u00eet Hamon, a Socialist who comes from the party\u2019s leftist wing and whose flagging campaign represents that party\u2019s implosion.Enter the video game. The idea for Fiscal Kombat came from Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s grass-roots supporters, who created an online community, Le Discord Insoumis, or \u201cDefiant Discord\u201d \u2014 using the Discord gaming software \u2014 to debate ideas and find new ways to push his program. That program includes taking France out of NATO, renegotiating its treaties with the European Union, eliminating nuclear power, raising taxes and capping wages.In the final weeks of the campaign, those supporters have been out in force. When the satirical cartoonist Joann Sfar took to his own Facebook page, which has 33,000 followers, to criticize Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, he was attacked by M\u00e9lenchon supporters.\u201cThat creates a dynamic in the country that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople are really keyed up and comment a lot.\u201dOsons Causer and Usul are no fans of Mr. Hamon, the socialist, but they seem to have particular antipathy toward Mr. Macron, whom they see as the establishment candidate, a dynamic not unlike how supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders viewed his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.\u201cIt\u2019s our moment,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Lambert, one of three founders of Osons Causer, who are 28 to 30 years old and attended Paris\u2019s Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV, as did Mr. Macron. Started in June 2015 (the third founder is Xavier Cheung), the show has nearly 500,000 Facebook followers, up from 400,000 in January. (Le Monde, France\u2019s paper of record, has three million.)Usul agrees. \u201cA lot of young people are trying to discover Socialism,\u201d he said by telephone. Even if Mr. M\u00e9lenchon loses, \u201cwe\u2019ve entered a phase when social movements will be more important, more structured, more radical,\u201d he said, citing Spain\u2019s leftist Podemos party as a model. \u201cWe\u2019ll move from defense to attack.\u201d(In one of the more surreal twists, Usul is the pseudonym of a 31-year-old journalist in Lyon who has never revealed his name.)These YouTubers haven\u2019t exactly replaced the mainstream media in France, but they\u2019ve gone viral in ways that more established media outlets have not.But social media kept the scandal alive \u2014 so much so that Mr. Fillon was the candidate most discussed online, according to Linkfluence.Even though social media has helped bolster Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s campaign, Mr. Vedel, of Sciences Po, warned against drawing too direct a line between social media activity and electoral results.\u201cToday, social media doesn\u2019t always reflect opinion; that\u2019s the problem,\u201d he said. He added that much chatter during the campaign could be \u201cfilter bubbles,\u201d in which people share information that reinforces their own ideas.The Google News Lab in Paris, a division of the search engine company, found that the most searched candidates in recent weeks were Mr. Macron and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon. Among the top questions: \u201cIs Emmanuel Macron left or right?\u201d and \u201cWhy vote for M\u00e9lenchon?\u201dOf the searches for Ms. Le Pen this past week, the top question: \u201cWhy not vote for Le Pen?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Of course I did.When I pushed through that door, I almost bumped into a lone man with a clipboard guarding an empty entryway. He was there to make sure I was approved to go further, and he gestured me up a dusty escalator, which led \u2026 I couldn\u2019t tell where.Up I went, alone.This is not, by the way, usual fashion week practice. Normal fashion week events typically involve brands one-upping each other with the fanciest, most gilded cultural landmarks; most of the events\u2019 venues are full of people, with hordes of paparazzi outside. But anything that suggests fashion business that is not \u201cas usual\u201d is of interest in a time when an endless sea of skirts can start to blur into one.It turned out that \u201cMasters: Louis Vuitton x Jeff Koons\u201d was not business as usual. The new leather goods-and-silk collaboration between the artist and the brand in which Mr. Koons has replicated five famous paintings (including the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d) on Vuitton bags, adding some hip-hop bling, was an unabashed attempt to take the most iconic pieces of art history off their pedestals and attach them to mass(ish) commerce. Even at their most audacious, I can\u2019t think of any other brand that would have dared. You could literally pull your laptop from Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cWheatfields,\u201d or sling a luminescent, fleshy \u201cTitian\u201d over your shoulder,I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Once I got over my initial fit of giggles, I thought: \u201cNo way. No one is going to want a Masterwork on their arm. It\u2019s so kitschy.\u201d Then I started to chuckle again. Then I shook my head and kind of groaned. Then laughter. Then the realization that I actually was not sure how I felt at all about the project, which was interesting, and not dissimilar to the reaction that most of Mr. Koons\u2019s artwork produces, including the giant balloon dogs and bunnies, and the enormous floral puppy.But while art is supposed to make you uncomfortable and challenge assumptions about its very definition, fashion is \u2026 not. Fashion is supposed to make you feel good and generally not demand deep analysis of conflicting emotions in the wearer. Mostly when you see, say, a skirt or a bag, you think: \u201cI like that! Or, I would never wear that!\u201d As a critic, I think: \u201cWho is that for, and what does it say about them?\u201d Almost never: \u201cHow do I parse my own reaction to that?\u201dNone of this was a particular surprise to my Vuitton host at the collection viewing, of course, who was watching me swing back and forth between glee and horror with some amusement. The brand knew the new collection was going to provoke controversy \u2014 they seemed to be courting it in the \u201cno-publicity-is-bad-publicity\u201d sort of way. That was why they didn\u2019t want anyone to know about it until it was about to go on sale, to preserve the shock value.They thought a lot of the discussion, positive or negative, would be about the gall of connecting hallowed paintings with a commercial endeavor. I agree that it will get people talking, but I\u2019m thinking conversation will likely be about why people would want to walk around toting a famous painting as part of their outfit. It\u2019s like pasting a label on your forehead that says \u201cJeff Koons Fan\u201d (for those who know his work) or \u201cI (heart) Grandmasters.\u201dMaybe that\u2019s attractive for some as a talking point, but it\u2019s equally possible to see it turning a lot of other people off. Anyway, I put out a call on Twitter. Here are some reactions: \u201cRubens is the standout piece\u201d; \u201cSuper tacky\u201d; \u201cI think this collab makes sense in the context of his subject matter\u201d; \u201cIt has a very commercial/mass intention that bothers me.\u201d On Facebook I got: \u201cAre there really any creative boundaries between contemporary art, Fashion and design anymore?

Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.The city of Dongguan, a manufacturing center here in the world\u2019s most dynamic industrial region, was hit especially hard by the downpour in May 2014. More than 100 factories and shops were inundated. Water climbed knee-high in 20 minutes, wiping out inventory for dozens of businesses.Next door in Guangzhou, an ancient, mammoth port city of 13 million, helicopters and a fleet of 80 boats had to be sent to rescue trapped residents. Tens of thousands lost their homes, and 53 square miles of nearby farmland were ruined. The cost of repairs topped $100 million.Chen Rongbo, who lived in the city, saw the flood coming. He tried to scramble to safety on the second floor of his house, carrying his 6-year-old granddaughter. He slipped. The flood swept both of them away.A generation ago, this was mostly farmland. Three vital rivers leading to the South China Sea, along with a spider\u2019s web of crisscrossing tributaries, made the low-lying delta a fertile plain, famous for rice. Guangzhou, formerly Canton, had more than a million people, but by the 1980s, China set out to transform the whole region, capitalizing on its proximity to water, the energy of its people, and the money and port infrastructure of neighboring Hong Kong.HUADUZENGCHENGGUANGDONGPROVINCELUOGANGBAIYUNTIANHEGuangzhouHUANGPUHAIZHULIWANDongguanFoshanPANYUNANSHAHUADUGUANGDONGPROVINCEZENGCHENGBAIYUNLUOGANGGuangzhouTIANHEHUANGPUHAIZHULIWANDongguanFoshanPANYUNANSHAHUADUGUANGDONGPROVINCELUOGANGBAIYUNTIANHEGuangzhouHUANGPUHAIZHULIWANFoshanPANYU1990199219941996199820002002200420082010201220142016Rushing to catch up after decades of stagnation, China built a gargantuan collection of cities the size of nations with barely a pause to consider their toll on the environment, much less the future impact of global warming. Today, the region is a goliath of industry with a population exceeding 42 million.While it is difficult to attribute any single storm or heat wave to climate change, researchers say there is abundant evidence that the effects of climate change can already be seen \u2014 in higher water levels, increasing temperatures and ever-more severe storms.And climate change not only poses a menace to those who live and work here, or to the immense concentration of wealth and investment. It is also a threat to a world that has grown dependent on everything produced in the area\u2019s factories.The rising South China Sea and the overstressed Pearl River network lie just a meter or so below much of this new multitrillion-dollar development \u2014 and they are poised to drown decades of progress, scrambling global supply chains and raising prices on a world of goods like smartphones, T-shirts, biopharmaceuticals and even the tiny springs inside your ballpoint pens.China is now the world leader in domestic investment in renewable energy, and over the past decade the central authorities in Beijing have made environmental performance a higher priority for civil servants. But stronger mandates haven\u2019t yet overcome the pace of expansion, a decentralized fiscal system, lax enforcement and a culture that frequently pits growth against green. The country continues to consume as much coal as the rest of the world combined, and to increase its steel capacity.Here in Guangdong Province, all the new cars, the concrete and the belching factories spike temperatures, endangering sick and elderly people, creating urban heat islands and incubating pandemics like dengue fever, an outbreak of which slammed Guangzhou in 2014, afflicting 47,000 people.In the meantime, the costs of inaction rise like the tides and temperatures.One afternoon, I met Cai Yanfeng at a Starbucks in Shenzhen. The Starbucks occupies a ground-floor corner in a factory complex where her parents used to work, now converted into high-end rental lofts and art galleries. Fashionable young Chinese sipped Frappuccinos and stared at smartphones.Shenzhen was still a sleepy fishing village of some 35,000 during the late 1970s when the Chinese authorities declared it a Special Economic Zone, bringing in huge investments and waves of migrants from the countryside who have helped make what today is a metropolis of 11 million. Ms. Cai arrived during the early 1980s as a toddler with her parents. Now trained as an urban designer, she has seen the city\u2019s evolution and, at 36, is a relative old-timer.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.She was recalling her childhood, when she would cross the street up the block from where the Starbucks is now to play in the mangrove swamps hugging the bay. Ms. Cai gestured out the window, as if pointing at something, although the world she was conjuring up had long ago vanished. Today, the street she used to cross is the size of an American Interstate. Where the mangroves started, not far from the Starbucks, a hospital campus flanks a shopping mall. The mangroves were ripped out and bulldozed, replaced by landfill, and smothered by acres of concrete, asphalt, office towers, high-rise apartments and industrial development.\u201cIt started with amusement parks along the beach,\u201d Ms. Cai remembered. \u201cThen the city built another big road near the sea, with the area filled in between with residential blocks. Things sped up after that.\u201dThe destruction of the wetlands where Ms. Cai once played is now one of the region\u2019s biggest climate challenges. Mangroves provide a natural buffer from the sea, shielding the coastline, reducing the impact of waves and rising water, filtering out salt that can infiltrate freshwater reserves, absorbing exceptional quantities of carbon and lowering ambient temperatures. But about 70 percent of the mangrove forests in Shenzhen are gone. And their disappearance is accelerating: 2,100 acres paved over between 1979 and 1985; 6,700 more acres during the next decade; thousands and thousands more since.Recently, Chinese officials announced plans to add yet another 21 square miles of landfill along Shenzhen\u2019s coast. The problem isn\u2019t just the destruction of mangroves. Landfill is notoriously vulnerable to rising waters. When Hurricane Sandy socked Lower Manhattan in 2012, it swamped streets built on landfill, peaking where the island\u2019s long-obscured natural shore had once been. In the end, nature always finds its level. Along the Huishen Highway in Shenzhen, rising seawater recently eroded a stretch of landfill three football fields long, leaving a shambles of asphalt and concrete. When a typhoon pounded the delta in 2008, a third of the sea wall in Zhuhai crumbled, letting water reach the city.By contrast, Zhuhai\u2019s nature preserve, where the mangroves had not been cut down, absorbed the brunt of the water and survived.In Shenzhen, I came across Xiyong Beach, which local fishermen say has been shrinking, gradually swallowed up by rising waters that experts here link to climate change. Chen Tegu, a professor in Guangzhou with the State Oceanic Administration, has been taking measurements since the mid-1980s, watching coastline disappear. Mr. Chen ticked off statistics about temperatures, storms and drought, predicting that the South China Sea could rise almost as much as a foot and a half by the end of this century.That increase, exacerbated by the sinking of the land, will mean more salt water infiltrating the delta, which, combined with drought, threatens drinking water. A drought several years ago caused water shortages for millions of delta residents, and five major saltwater incursions from the South China Sea have hit the region in the past 20 years alone. These incursions corrupt not only the water that people drink but also the water used by factories, corroding equipment and raising production costs, with ripple effects all along the distribution network. Local agricultural yields have been hurt as well. China has been building water treatment plants, but the pace hasn\u2019t kept up with the threat.I asked Ms. Cai whether she thought people in Shenzhen worried much about climate change. \u201cSome NGOs talk about it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut people here still focus on the economic side of things, on jobs and G.D.P. They care about whether we are a first-tier city yet. Are we beating Guangzhou?\u201dLiang Bo, who works for the Shenzhen Mangrove Wetlands and Conservation Foundation, agrees. I walked with her through a waterfront park that\u2019s more or less where Ms. Cai once played in the mangroves. Along the shore, garbage washed up on the rocks from the murky, gray water in the bay.\u201cIt\u2019s worse at low tide,\u201d Ms. Liang said. \u201cYou really see how filthy it has become.\u201d Because of all the landfill and new development, she said, water no longer flows in and out of the bay as it once did. So garbage gets trapped, stagnation gets worse, fish are killed off. That scenario is repeated throughout the delta, where small rivers and tributaries have been filled in and paved over to make way for new highways, office parks and housing developments, adding to the strains on an already inadequate system of drains and sewers.\u201cThe sea, the wetlands and mangroves used to be part of people\u2019s lives here,\u201d Ms. Liang pointed out. \u201cBut most of the people who live here now weren\u2019t around when the mangroves were still here. They see this park, which makes us more vulnerable to rising seas and typhoons, as they do all the tall buildings and highways. They equate it with progress.\u201d\u201cAir pollution is a direct challenge to people, it\u2019s right in their face,\u201d said Ma Jun, founder and director of the citizen-led Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s about the food they put on their table for their children. So they\u2019ve made noise, and things have changed in terms of air pollution policy by the Chinese authorities. On the other hand, climate change is happening at a different speed. Sea level rise is not something you easily notice.\u201dThis is the challenge everywhere. Storms, like hot days, happen all the time \u2014 and they have always happened. So people don\u2019t automatically chalk them up to climate change. Climate change is like the tortoise. Development is the hare. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t unique to China,\u201d Mr. Ma said. \u201cThere is no obvious, short-term solution to climate change problems, no clear strategy everybody agrees is what needs to happen to offset climate change. And there\u2019s no certainty about how to pay for what needs to be done. So there\u2019s reluctance to address the issue. What\u2019s the business model?\u201dThat\u2019s a trillion-dollar question, according to the World Bank, which projected the potential cost of damage to coastal cities worldwide from rising seas to be somewhere near that figure. It estimates that China is already losing 1.4 percent of its annual G.D.P. to climate change. Last spring, residents in Guangzhou woke again to flooded streets after a furious downpour swept across the delta and drowned entire neighborhoods of the city. Local news media, once more, said that there had been nothing like it in years. And as usual, Chinese social media sites buzzed with posts of people trapped in flooded cars. One man, named Pang, became an overnight celebrity for catching a fish with his umbrella, then going home and making soup with the head and tail. \u201cIt was fresh and tender,\u201d he told The Guangzhou Daily.Rains brutalized many other cities throughout southern China last year: More than 160 people were killed by drowning and landslides, dozens went missing, 73,000 homes collapsed and more than a million acres of farmland were destroyed. The death tolls from floods across China have actually been trending downward, thanks to improved emergency relief efforts. But the damage is increasingly felt in urban areas, where overdevelopment continues to outpace the country\u2019s appetite for climate change adaptation and natural disaster preparedness.That\u2019s partly because canals and waterways that once helped to drain cities like Guangzhou naturally have been filled in and paved over with concrete and asphalt. Especially in older, underserved areas, the infrastructure replacing the canals is shoddy. While Guangdong now claims more billionaires than any other province in the country, it is also home to millions of low-wage workers and migrants from the countryside who have settled in cheaper, poorly maintained neighborhoods, the crumbling legacy of humongous Socialist-era housing developments.Zhou Jianyun, an architect and professor who moved to Guangzhou as a student in the early 1980s, took me one day to see some of the older parts of the city most prone to flooding. We toured the area around what used to be the ancient city gates. Streets once lined with handsome covered pedestrian arcades from the 1930s have been widened into boulevards to make more room for cars. Farther west, older neighborhoods spill toward the Pearl River. In many ways, these neighborhoods, like Guangzhou\u2019s ancient villages \u2014 crowded, labyrinthine vestiges of old Canton now dwarfed by giant new shopping malls and housing complexes \u2014 are the liveliest parts of the city. But they are also more and more frequently underwater because they are near the river, inadequately protected and ill served by the outdated sewage system.To the east, an immense, modern district called Tianhe has risen from next to nothing in 30-odd years, its offices and apartment blocks now overshadowed by the super-tall skyscrapers of Guangzhou\u2019s Zhujiang New Town, with its opera house by Zaha Hadid and its signature Canton Tower. The picture-postcard image of New Town can bring to mind American downtowns from the late 20th century \u2014 cities like Atlanta or Phoenix, only glossier and on a vast scale. Advertised as more environmentally conscious than older parts of the city, with better flood protections, New Town is still a sprawling development conceived for cars and glass towers, with a carbon-heavy diet dependent on highways and air-conditioning.\u201cThe cities we now have are partly based on what we saw in American movies \u2014 on the dream of big malls, airports, highways and tall buildings,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cI belong to the generation that witnessed the biggest change. We had been almost like North Korea, closed off. Suddenly we could see American movies.\u201d\u201cThis became our idea of progress,\u201d he added. \u201cOnly we wanted to do everything bigger, because we thought that is what it meant to be modern. The actual needs of the real city are ignored.\u201d\u201cIn many ways, we are still living a dream,\u201d he said.Clearly, the region\u2019s future depends on whether, and how fast, Chinese officials redefine that concept of progress.\u201cChina\u2019s feelings about modernization keep changing,\u201d said Zhou Ming, an urban planner in Shenzhen who expressed some optimism for the future. We met one afternoon in the glittery hotel lobby at the top of KK100, a 1,400-foot skyscraper with a panoramic view that takes in Hong Kong.\u201cBefore the opening to the outside world, people didn\u2019t have food to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they focused on jobs and basic needs. Now wages are going up for workers, people are concerned about air pollution and they are starting to value traditional culture again, meaning neighborhoods that are human-scale and not just a bunch of skyscrapers. That\u2019s on top of pressure from international businesses whose employees care about environmental and climate issues and can decide whether they want to do business here.\u201dNot incidentally, some factories have been leaving Guangdong. Rising wages and threats of stiffer pollution standards have prompted less scrupulous manufacturers to move their businesses to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia, where regulations are weaker. In turn, those countries are repeating mistakes, related to climate change preparedness, that China is paying for now.But this exodus, seeking short-term profits, has also created an opportunity for China. Planners and environmentalists here talk about a chance to rebrand Guangdong Province as a global leader in green, cutting-edge industrial technology and urbanism \u2014 to go beyond token green skyscrapers and really get ahead of climate change. To make China the leading green global superpower.Prosperity will ultimately belong to cities and nations around the world that find ways to capitalize on strategies of resilience against the inevitable impact of climate change. Those cities will retool themselves for new technologies and global businesses whose employees, reflecting a growing worldwide generational shift, want to walk, ride bikes and take mass transit.China has demonstrated that it can be nimble and ingenious. Since 1997, Guangzhou has opened an entire new metro system with scores of stations, covering hundreds of miles; Shenzhen has done the same in only a dozen years. New York has barely managed to construct four subway stations in half a century.But little of this infrastructure in China was conceived in anticipation of extreme conditions and climate change. Rising waters repeatedly reduced train traffic in the delta to a crawl last year, halting ferry service on the Pearl River and turning several of the new subway stations into swimming holes.\u201cWhat climate change says is that if you want to maintain the city as a good place to live and work for everyone, business as usual won\u2019t do,\u201d said Robert J. Nicholls, a professor of coastal engineering at the University of Southampton in England. He helped write the World Bank report that warned of the fiscal impact of climate change on the Pearl River Delta. \u201cDisasters will become more likely. And the last thing the Chinese want is a Katrina event,\u201d he added, referring to the hurricane that devastated New Orleans in 2005.Flooding is not an insurmountable hurdle, he noted. The Chinese can build smarter cities \u2014 healthier, safer, more equitable and humane ones, with restored waterways and waterfronts, flood-proof buildings, wide-reaching air-pollution controls, earlier warning systems, levees that double as parks, retention ponds that provide recreation, neighborhoods less dependent on cars.\u201cThe challenge for the Chinese, as it is for so many others,\u201d he said, \u201cis taking the long view.\u201dWhich shouldn\u2019t really be so hard, considering the recent past. The government estimated regional losses from last summer\u2019s floods alone at $10 billion. For all of 2016, rainfall in China was 16 percent above average.That was the highest level in recorded history.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing and Guangdong Province.Map by Jeremy White.

Their battle is infused with a healthy dose of youthful idealism, but their anticorruption campaign has caught on, as have like-minded movements across the region.The pair have become local media darlings, using Facebook to organize an anticorruption march in mid-April that drew as many as 10,000 people.Immediately after the high schoolers dropped off their single-page manifesto at the government\u2019s complaints office on the day of the march, they made their way through the baroque city center of Bratislava to a square where a few hundred people had already started gathering.\u201cThe state should respect our parents and not steal from them and lie,\u201d Mr. Straka explained without breaking step, as glowering clouds loomed over nearby Bratislava Castle and a steady sprinkle of icy droplets fell from the slate sky.\u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t keep people away,\u201d Mr. Straka said.Ms. Farska was equally earnest, for good reason, she said.\u201cWe are at the point in our lives when we are deciding what we want to do,\u201d she explained. \u201cStay here in our own country with our families, or go abroad where we could have a good life without so much corruption.\u201dThe quandary faces hundreds of thousands across the region, especially young people, who are turning disillusionment into determined action in countries like Poland, Macedonia, Serbia and others.Corruption is not the only target of the demonstrations. The protests are also driven by anger over fresh initiatives aimed at entrenching governing parties, serving the interests of oligarchs, weakening the rule of law, hobbling nongovernmental organizations and co-opting independent news media.\u201cFighting corruption is really hard,\u201d said Igor Matovic, a member of Slovakia\u2019s Parliament whose small party was formed seven years ago to combat corruption. \u201cThey have all the power. They have all the money. But I will tell you one thing they fear, and that is students in the streets.\u201dThe satirical title of the song, first performed by a band named Frendi, is taken from the verdict that ends many corruption investigations. \u201cThe deed did not happen, so it\u2019s hard to prosecute the highest people,\u201d the song begins.Though Ms. Farska and Mr. Straka both come from Dubnica nad Vahom, a small town about 90 miles north of the capital with a population of 24,500, they attend different high schools: Ms. Farska goes to a school in their hometown, and Mr. Straka is in a special two-year program in Bratislava for gifted students.\u201cThen, by chance, we met up again about a year ago,\u201d Ms. Farska said. \u201cIt turned out we had a lot in common.\u201dTheir idea of trying to organize a young people\u2019s protest movement against corruption came about slowly.\u201cWhen we came up with this idea, we thought we\u2019d get maybe 200 people, including our friends and family,\u201d Mr. Straka said. \u201cYou know, people who just want to show support so the whole thing didn\u2019t become a big fail.\u201dBut the idea took off. \u201cIn politics, there is no place for people who want to change things, only for those who want to steal,\u201d Ms. Farska said.The current government of Slovakia, led by Prime Minister Robert Fico, assumed power in 2012 largely on the heels of a huge government scandal.But the parade of scandals has not stopped. Even before the Gorilla scandal, during Mr. Fico\u2019s first stint as prime minister in 2008, a lucrative contract to construct a toll system for the country\u2019s highways slipped into controversy when it went to the highest bidder, a company whose true ownership was unclear, after the government declared three other bidders ineligible.In 2012, shortly after Mr. Fico returned to power, a government-backed hospital was found to have paid over a half-million dollars more than a hospital in the neighboring Czech Republic did for a CT scan machine. And just last year, a close associate of the prime minister was named in a tax fraud scandal.There are nightly protests outside the fashionable building on Castle Hill where the prime minister lives in an apartment for what opponents say is far below market price. His landlord is Ladislav Basternak, the same associate who benefited in the tax fraud case.Nonetheless, Mr. Fico has tried to co-opt the corruption issue. With right-wing extremist parties gaining support, the prime minister has tried to portray his government as a champion in the fight against graft \u2014 going so far as to invite leaders of anticorruption organizations like Transparency International to meet with him for the first time.\u201cI want to assure all the citizens that the government of Slovakia views corruption as a serious, long-term problem and is taking concrete steps to limit and destroy it,\u201d Mr. Fico said in a statement.Ms. Farska and Mr. Straka are not persuaded. Neither, it seemed, were the thousands who ultimately showed up for their march on this recent day, despite the spitting rain.People spilled out of trams, filling the square and its promenade. A couple of men in gorilla suits and long white beards \u2014 to indicate how long the Gorilla scandal has gone on \u2014 whooped and hopped and waved to the dumbstruck tourists.\u201cStop corruption!\u201d they chanted. \u201cWe are not oblivious!\u201dThe rain intensified as the marchers made their way through the city\u2019s narrow streets to SNP Square \u2014 named for the Slovak National Uprising against the Nazis and the site of the main anti-Communist protests during the 1989 Velvet Revolution \u2014 where a stage was wrapped in waterproof plastic.Mr. Straka and Ms. Farska took the stage to raucous cheers.\u201cIf this country is worth anything, these people must resign,\u201d Mr. Straka said, waving a copy of the group\u2019s demands. \u201cThe law is the same for everyone; otherwise, it makes no sense.\u201dMr. Fico and most of his top ministers praised the democratic spirit of the students without addressing their demands. \u201cIt\u2019s good when young people take an active interest in what is happening in their country,\u201d the prime minister said in a statement after the rally.Mr. Straka said they were still trying to figure out what to do if the government rejected their demands.\u201cPeople say we are na\u00efve, and I guess we are na\u00efve,\u201d Ms. Farska said. \u201cBut we are learning, and we are not alone.\u201dMiroslava Germanova contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

When stuck to its long root of bone, the neck is picky business to eat, but it is full of flavor when it is pared away and the outer bits are singed over charcoal and the fat starts to spill over the rest.Now the tenderloin. Many tenderloins come to an ignominious end as \u201ctenders,\u201d encased in bread crumbs in the ketchup-smeared fingers of a toddler. But grilled lightly, so they firm up without scorching, they run with delicate pink juices.Livers, of course, are seared very fast so they don\u2019t get leathery. The rich, red insides are as soft as yogurt. They take well to a few grains of ground sansho pepper, enough to spark a slow buzz on the tongue. So do the hearts, done medium-rare, like steak.On the bird\u2019s back, above the tail feathers, are the oysters. At Torishin they go under their French name, sot-l\u2019y-laisse \u2014 \u201ca fool leaves it.\u201d They are grilled with their skin, which puckers and hisses and goes from creamy blue to gold.For all I know the first yakitori chefs in Japan had nothing but efficiency in mind when they speared each anatomical bit on its own skewer. Fast-cooking livers can be pulled from the grill to make space, while other pieces take their time.In the hands of the attentive chefs at Torishin, this technique produces something beyond convenience. Cooked separately, each part has a different pleasure to offer. Some you chew, and some you crackle. Some have cerebral appeal, others call to instinct.The house style is sensitive to timing, averse to charring and careful with seasoning. The chicken is salted, brushed with a sauce called tare, which is less sweet at Torishin than at some other yakitori specialists, and grilled about an inch above long-burning sticks of binchotan, a Japanese charcoal. The cooks wave bamboo fans at the fire when it needs a boost.Sitting on the tables and counters are vaguely humanoid gourds filled with sansho and the spice blend shichimi, as well as pitchers of soy sauce.\u201cWhich skewers are good with soy?\u201d I asked Atsushi Kono, the chef, one night when he was tending the coals.His head bobbed noncommittally before he said, \u201cIt\u2019s there for people who think they want it.\u201d Right, then. No soy.With minimalist cooking, the distance between dull and delicious can sometimes be measured in grains of salt. This became clear during my only meal at Torishin\u2019s original location, on First Avenue in the 60s.There were many skewers. None of them seemed to have been seasoned. Even the pickled cucumbers and daikon that showed up at the start of the meal seemed to be under orders not to draw any attention to themselves. I knew that some people revered the restaurant, so I just figured that it fell into one of my blind spots.When Torishin moved to its current address in Hell\u2019s Kitchen in 2015, I did not exactly rush over on my hoverboard. In fact, I didn\u2019t make it there until last fall, a delay I regretted as soon as I had unskewered my first lump of chicken. Whatever had been missing from the chicken before was there, and it\u2019s been there each time I\u2019ve gone back. (I still think the pickles need more pep, though.)To the left as you enter is a small bar. The bartenders spend the quiet hours whittling big ice cubes into spheres, with knives. These rough globes are plopped into tumblers of shochu, and if you want to learn about this distilled spirit, Torishin is a fine place to start. The sake list is compact but varied. The few wines come from big, obvious names.At the end of a winding corridor is a split-level dining room. The mezzanine might be the spot for privacy. The lower space is more active, with seating at tables or around a U-shaped counter that hugs the open kitchen and a grill, the depth of a single skewer.If you know your favorite bird bits, ordering \u00e0 la carte is simple enough. The menu is helpfully illustrated, from neck to tail. All but one of the skewers is under $10, and the package of seven chicken skewers plus three vegetables is a good deal at $65.But Torishin always puts me in the mood for surprises, so I like to ask for an omakase menu. The grill cooks serve up a mix of vegetables (the mushrooms are a particular treat, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to grill zucchini better than Torishin does); white meat (the piece wrapped in a shiso leaf and dabbed with salty plum paste is a nearly perfect bite); dark meat (chicken legs can be subdivided in more ways than you might think); and curiosities called \u201cspecial skewers.\u201d This is where you will find the oysters, the kidneys, the nugget of meat from the base of the wing, the wrinkly and fatty neck skin, the smooth and supple belly skin.Most of the surprises have been positive, like \u201cknee gristle.\u201d What about \u201cmain artery\u201d? The nicest thing I can honestly say about this blood vessel, which ties the heart to some other vital organ, is that it is, in fact, edible.If hunger still calls after you have stripped all the bamboo sticks and left them standing in the ceramic cup in front of you, there is an excellent remedy in the form of oyako-don. A homey dish of chicken and egg over white rice, oyako-don can be filling or it can be almost ethereal, as it is at Torishin.To one side of the passage from bar to dining room is a narrow nook behind curtains. Inside is an eight-seat bar, called the Select Counter, where Mr. Kono presides over extended menus that borrow from the kaiseki tradition. One recent meal began with a tiny simmered octopus with peppery sansho leaves. Sashimi followed. Chicken breast was steamed in cherry leaves and served with cucumber wheels and fresh shoots of spring ginger; the flavor was lovely and transient, one of those Japanese miracles of putting the mood of a season on the plate.The $150 menu came with a complete fusillade of skewers as well as a choice of grilled luxury items: either Kumamoto beef (not as meltingly rich as it could have been) or king crab leg (smeared with some funky stuff from inside the crab\u2019s head, and completely delicious).If Mr. Kono had kept cooking all night, I would have been happy, but to experience Torishin you don\u2019t need to spend $150 and a couple of hours. Just a few skewers are enough to expand your sense of what\u2019s possible in the department of chicken.A review last Wednesday about Torishin, a Japanese restaurant in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, misstated the name of a spice blend provided on tables and counters. It is shichimi, not shichi.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Zeal for China Dims, Global Companies Complain More Boldly", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 When Amazon announced its entry into the Chinese cloud computing market last year, Chinese state media celebrated it as \u201ca strong signal\u201d that \u201cthere is tremendous room for foreign firms to expand in the Chinese market as long as they comply with local regulations.\u201dToday, cloud computing is the latest area of contention between China and increasingly frustrated global companies.In late March, a group of more than 50 American lawmakers sent a letter to the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, taking direct aim at China\u2019s restrictions on cloud computing. They wrote that current and draft regulations would force the transfer of valuable intellectual property to Chinese companies and effectively bar foreign cloud service providers \u201cfrom operating or competing fairly in China.\u201d\u201cAs we see it,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, \u201cthese restrictions are fundamentally protectionist and anticompetitive.\u201d Many of the lawmakers hail from states where two major cloud computing players, Amazon and Microsoft, have operations.Big global companies, which have long worked to keep from rocking the boat in China, are showing a bit more tolerance for making waves. The business groups that represent them have become more critical of China\u2019s industrial policies and ambitions. Businesses are increasingly complaining to friendly lawmakers, and those lawmakers have become more vocal on their behalf.Profiles in courage are still hard to find, as businesses fear Chinese retaliation if they complain directly or too loudly. For example, among the companies that would benefit most from any shift in China\u2019s cloud computing regulations, Microsoft, through a spokesman, declined to comment, and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.The shift is also a gradual one, taking place in the years since the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, as the promise of a more open China faded. Still, people in business circles in China say the sense of disappointment in China\u2019s business prospects is growing.\u201cThe enthusiasm is gone,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. \u201cForeign businesses here used to be very excited about China and quite enthusiastic. Now, it\u2019s kind of a grind and a battle.\u201dChina remains a lucrative market for foreign-branded cars, iPhones, high-value engineering equipment and other costly items. Still, the growing frustration has muddled the corporate response to President Trump\u2019s tough anti-China rhetoric.\u201cThere are companies, which in prior years have been strong supporters in Washington of the U.S.-China relationship, who are much quieter, and even waiting to see if a tougher approach might get more results with China,\u201d said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council.\u201cIf the United States gives concessions in the trade area so that we don\u2019t push as hard on leveling the playing field in all these different areas,\u201d Mr. Zarit said at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday, \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame.\u201dIn public, businesses work hard to strike a sunny note. Last November, Jay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for global corporate affairs and former White House spokesman, made no mention of his company\u2019s challenges there when speaking at China\u2019s World Internet Conference, according to a Chinese-language transcript of his remarks in state media.That reticence has bred frustration among some United States officials. In 2015, President Barack Obama told the Business Roundtable, a business group, regarding its complaints about China, \u201cDon\u2019t tell us on the side, \u2018We\u2019ve got this problem, you need to look into it, but then \u2014 but leave our names out of it.\u2019\u201dStill, executives say complaining can have an impact. Earlier that same year, Mr. Obama publicly criticized proposed Chinese rules that would require technology companies to turn over encryption keys to Chinese authorities. His administration had also expressed concern about Chinese draft regulations that would require China\u2019s financial sector buy only from \u201csecure and controllable\u201d suppliers, which trade groups said effectively meant Chinese companies. In both cases China relented, temporarily scrapping the banking laws and tempering the language in the antiterrorism law.Some intermediaries between business and China are pushing the government to do even more.\u201cCountries need to be persuaded. Words don\u2019t do it,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former United States ambassador to China, adding that the United States needs to use \u201cproperly targeted\u201d leverage.\u201cI don\u2019t think the United States has done much of that,\u201d Mr. Baucus said. \u201cWe need to have a more strategic economic approach to China.\u201dHe said Mr. Obama had raised the issue of American companies\u2019 unequal access to the Chinese market repeatedly with Beijing, but these appeals were \u201cinsufficient.\u201dOf all the sectors that China has set its sights on, tech has come under the most pressure. Services like Facebook and Twitter have long been blocked. Last November, China passed a cybersecurity law that would impose security checks on companies in industries like finance and communications and mandatory in-country data storage. In 2015, the American chip maker Qualcomm said it would pay $975 million for violating China\u2019s antimonopoly law. In 2016, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. In the same year, China said it would demand answers to new questions about Microsoft\u2019s business practices in the country.In cloud computing, China mandates that foreign companies work with a local partner, and the foreign companies are subject to equity restrictions that prevent them from owning a controlling stake in the cloud company. New draft regulations would make it even more difficult for them to get licenses for operation, block them from using their brands and logos to market their services and require them to \u201cterminate the transmission of\u201d and report any information posted or transmitted by users that \u201cviolates relevant Chinese laws and regulations.\u201dIn China, the cloud computing market is estimated to be worth $20 billion by 2020, up from $1.5 billion in 2013, according to the consulting group Bain. Both Amazon and Microsoft operate in China through partnerships with local companies. In contrast, Aliyun, the cloud services unit of the Chinese web giant Alibaba, has its own data centers in the United States.For decades, Western companies have stood with China even during rocky moments in the Sino-American relationship. When Congress threatened to revoke China\u2019s most-favored-nation trading status in the 1990s because of concerns over human rights, the American Chamber of Commerce in China, or AmCham, headed to Washington to defend Beijing.More recently, the complaints from Western companies have gotten louder, as China\u2019s economic growth slows and unease grows about Beijing\u2019s failure to deliver on its promise to open markets for foreign companies as well as its Made in China 2025 plan to push for greater self-sufficiency in several industries. AmCham\u2019s 2016 survey of its members showed that 81 percent of its companies felt less welcome in China than before, up from 77 percent in 2015. The survey also showed that 31 percent of its members said the investment environment was deteriorating \u2014 the most pessimistic response AmCham has received since it started asking the question in 2011.\u201cChina\u2019s heavy emphasis on building global champions through industrial policies is spiking new levels of concern about China\u2019s commitment to a mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d said Jeremie Waterman, senior director for the Greater China region for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Mr. Zarit, of AmCham, said a \u201cmixed bag\u201d of companies were unhappy about the investment climate in China, adding that \u201cthey are afraid if anything is done, it will upset the apple cart.\u201dMr. Zarit, who led a delegation of eight former AmCham chairmen to meet with the Trump administration officials in Washington in February, said there was a new realization in Washington \u201cthat this asymmetrical commercial relationship needs to be addressed in some way.\u201dMr. McGregor, who was on the trip, said they met Peter Navarro, a strident China critic in charge of trade and industrial policy, and Matthew Pottinger, Mr. Trump\u2019s top Asia policy maker. There, the delegation pushed the concept of reciprocity, meaning that if American companies are bound by restrictions in China, their Chinese counterparts should be subject to the same limits in the United States.Mr. McGregor said the idea got \u201cquite a bit of traction.\u201d He added, \u201cOur attitude is China should be treated as an equal, and an equal needs reciprocity.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "3 Very Short Books on 3 Very Big Ideas", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byThe ShortlistThe months after Donald Trump was elected president have been boom times for scholars of authoritarianism. Masha Gessen wrote a widely circulated essay on the New York Review of Books website entitled \u201cAutocracy: Rules for Survival.\u201d In that vein, Snyder offers practical advice to #TheResistance in \u201cOn Tyranny,\u201d a brief book that started life as a Facebook post.Unlike public intellectuals who casually toss around the word \u201cfascist\u201d to describe a disappointing restaurant salad, Snyder knows this subject cold. He is a Yale University historian who has written at length on fascism, Communism and the Holocaust. That gives \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d a particular urgency. It is littered with vignettes of how Germans in the 1930s aided and abetted Hitler\u2019s rise to power. It is impossible to read aphorisms like \u201cpost-truth is pre-fascism\u201d and not feel a small chill about the current state of the Republic. Snyder warns, \u201cAmericans today are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism or Communism in the 20th century.\u201d He offers political advice ranging from straightforward (\u201cDefend institutions\u201d) to insightful (\u201cBe calm when the unthinkable arrives\u201d). For such a small book, Snyder invests \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d with considerable heft.At times, though, \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d veers toward overwrought. Trump\u2019s brand of populist nationalism may be illiberal, but it is also not very popular. Since his inauguration, a critical free press, independent judiciary, patriotic Civil Service and robust social movements have placed significant constraints on Trump\u2019s actions. When Snyder intimates that 2016 might be the last free election in the United States for a while, one wonders if the book will become self-defeating because of its hyperbole.Of course, just as I was pondering whether \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d exaggerates, Trump tweeted that the press is the enemy of the American people. That sounds awfully pre-fascist to me. So approach this short book the same way you would a medical pamphlet warning about an infectious disease. Read it carefully and be on the lookout for symptoms.Claims of American exceptionalism can be exaggerated. But the First Amendment really does make America unique, even within the industrialized democracies. No other country has such stringent protections against government restrictions of free speech and a free press.Abrams, a constitutional litigator, celebrates that fact in \u201cThe Soul of the First Amendment.\u201d The best part of this short primer is his history of free speech jurisprudence in the United States. Abrams reminds us that federal protections of free speech rights are of recent provenance. A century ago, obscenity laws and community standards provided ample reason to justify government censorship. States, localities and courts restricted the freedom of the press without much constraint for the country\u2019s first 150 years. The First Amendment was not applied to state censorship laws until 1925.Abrams traces the legal history of the First Amendment all the way through to Citizens United, a case in which he represented the plaintiffs. Liberals who despise that ruling would be well served to read this book. Whatever the policy merits of letting corporations spend unlimited amounts on political advertising, Abrams ably defends its legal reasoning.He is on shakier ground, however, when he compares the First Amendment with laws regulating speech in other established democracies. Abrams acknowledges, for example, that Germany\u2019s Nazi past makes it \u201cunderstandable\u201d to restrict hateful speech in that country. He then blithely notes that \u201cthe United States has been fortunate not to have suffered such horrific events.\u201d I suspect that some Native Americans and African-Americans would take issue with Abrams on this point.Abrams recognizes but offers no answers to the policy ramifications of Citizens United. He also seems willing to live with the social costs of actors like WikiLeaks publishing documents with no redaction: \u201cWhat to print? The First Amendment provides no answer to this question. It never does.\u201dEconomic populism has produced a bear market for attitudes about Wall Street. Public trust in banks dropped precipitously after 2008 and has not recovered. During his campaign, Donald Trump complained that \u201cWall Street has caused tremendous problems for us.\u201d As president, however, Trump has appointed several well-connected financiers. How should Americans feel about that?The moment is ripe for a short book that explains the merits and demerits of America\u2019s financial sector. Alas, Cohan\u2019s \u201cWhy Wall Street Matters\u201d is not that book. To be fair, he tries hard. Cohan repeatedly states that Wall Street is a marvelous contraption for allocating capital to the productive parts of the economy. The problem is that he offers no evidence for this claim beyond assertion. The closest he comes is when he stresses the success of Apple\u2019s initial public offering. On the questions of share buybacks or Libor manipulation or the financial sector being responsible for an increasing fraction of the American economy, he is silent.Cohan is correct on some important matters regarding regulation, as when he argues that the revocation of Glass-Steagall was not responsible for the 2008 financial crisis. Unfortunately, elsewhere he offers mere bromides. On Dodd-Frank he quotes a Wall Street executive: \u201cKeep the regulations that work and make sense and eliminate the rest.\u201d Good to know.Part of the confusion lies in what Cohan means by \u201cWall Street.\u201d He has an introduction entitled \u201cWhat Is Wall Street?\u201d that manages never to answer his own question. In the introduction he says Wall Street is not some \u201cstrange form of alchemy\u201d; but in the next chapter, he writes that \u201cit\u2019s a remarkable bit of alchemy.\u201d This kind of confusion persists throughout the book.The biggest problem with \u201cWhy Wall Street Matters\u201d is its black-and-white framing. Cohan asks at the beginning whether Wall Street should be thought of as a force for good or evil. The obvious answer is \u201cneither.\u201d Wall Street should be thought of as an amoral collection of profit-seekers. Alas, Cohan remains a prisoner of that dichotomy for the length of this small book.Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. His latest book is \u201cThe Ideas Industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York Today: The City and the Great War", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byNew York TodayGood morning on this stormy Thursday.At the time, New York was a city divided.\u201cNew Yorkers provided the strongest voices both for the rush to war, and the opposition,\u201d said Thai Jones, a history professor and curator for American history at the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia University.\u201cHe was also a crack shot and a backwoodsman,\u201d said Mr. Jones. Back then, the opinion of the mayor of New York mattered even more. The post was often considered the second-most powerful position in the country, after the president.\u201cBut there was a counterbalancing to the mayor and the strong voices for the war,\u201d Mr. Jones said, \u201cNew York City\u2019s was also a hotbed of radical politics.\u201dAlexander Berkman and Emma Goldman, two of the best-known anarchists in the country, operated out of New York, and socialists and the working class led protests.This led to one of the lasting legacies of the war effort in New York: the rise of the surveillance state.The Police Department, which until then had cut its teeth tracking the Mafia, began running surveillance on anarchists, Germans, and eventually Bolsheviks, Mr. Jones said. The tactics would later be adopted and expanded by the federal government.Here\u2019s what else is happening:A group of academics and graduate students led by Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University, recently analyzed 40 years of subway ridership data.Here are a few things we learned:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Loses Appeal to Block Bulk Search Warrants", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byNew York State\u2019s highest court dealt a blow to Facebook and other social media companies seeking to expand privacy protections, ruling on Tuesday that Facebook had no right to ask an appellate court to quash search warrants ordering the company to hand over information from hundreds of accounts in a disability fraud case.The state Court of Appeals, in a 5-to-1 decision, with one judge recusing himself, upheld lower court rulings that New York law does not allow a social media company to appeal a judge\u2019s decision to issue search warrants in a criminal case, even if the company believes those warrants violate the constitutional rights of its users.The Facebook case is part of a broader battle between the government and technology companies over the limits on law enforcement requests for data under the federal Stored Communications Act. Much of that fight is playing out in New York.The ruling was a setback for civil libertarians and social media companies hoping the court might create new legal guidelines for search warrants aimed at seizing all the information in electronic accounts, treating them more like civil subpoenas, which can be challenged as overly broad before they are executed.But Judge Leslie E. Stein, writing for the majority, said state courts had held for decades that search warrants issued by judges cannot be appealed to a higher court. Instead, they may be challenged by a defendant only during a pretrial hearing, as illegal searches.\u201cIndeed, to hold otherwise would be to impermissibly and judicially create a right to appeal in a criminal matter that has not been authorized by our Legislature,\u201d Judge Stein wrote in her 25-page decision.She acknowledged that Facebook had presented the court with \u201cnovel and important substantive issues regarding the constitutional rights of privacy and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure\u201d but said the court was \u201cconstrained by law\u201d to dismiss the company\u2019s appeal. Because search warrants cannot be appealed, she said, the court did not need to rule on Facebook\u2019s central contention \u2014 that the warrants were so sweeping they amounted to an unconstitutional search.One judge dissented: Judge Rowan D. Wilson, who argued that the federal law authorizing the warrants \u2014 the Stored Communications Act of 1986 \u2014 did not distinguish between warrants and subpoenas. In his reading, that statute gives service providers a right to appeal all overly broad court orders, including search warrants. \u201cState rules of procedures applicable to garden-variety warrants cannot be used as a device to contravene or frustrate federal law,\u201d he wrote.Judge Wilson noted that the framers of the State Constitution in 1938 had specifically warned against the invasion of privacy in electronic communications. \u201cThe New York Constitution commands us to guard vigilantly against that evil,\u201d he said. He characterized the warrants as \u201cauthorizing the seizure of private information en masse,\u201d including deleted content and content shared by users not under investigation.The case \u2014 known formally as In Re 381 Search Warrants Directed to Facebook Inc. \u2014 had been closely watched as a test as Facebook sought to expand its ability to fight what it sees as fishing expeditions by prosecutors. Several tech giants, including Google, LinkedIn, Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter, filed amicus briefs, as did the New York Civil Liberties Union.The search warrants were signed in 2013 by Justice Melissa C. Jackson on the strength of a 96-page affidavit that has never been made public. In an unusual procedure, Facebook moved to quash the warrants, saying they were too broad and objecting to the judge\u2019s order prohibiting the company from telling its clients about them.Judge Jackson denied the motion, saying Facebook, as a service provider, could not argue the searches were unconstitutional on behalf of its clients, any more than a landlord could stop the police with a warrant from searching a storage facility. She also said there was enough evidence of fraud to justify the mass warrants.The warrants ordered Facebook to turn over all of the information in the accounts of 381 people, including private photos and conversations. That information was used by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to obtain indictments for disability fraud against more than 130 police officers and other former public employees. None of the people indicted challenged the search warrants.Mr. Vance personally argued the case before the court, underscoring its importance to his office, which has used private information in Facebook accounts not only as evidence of the enormous disability fraud scheme but also to help make conspiracy cases against hundreds of members of street gangs in housing projects.One of the concurring judges, Jenny Rivera, wrote a separate opinion, saying she agreed with the majority but on the narrower grounds that Facebook had not made the right arguments under federal law for quashing the warrants: that they would cause an undue burden and harm its business. Judge Rivera said she agreed with Judge Wilson that the federal law permitted Facebook to appeal a judge\u2019s decision on search warrants to a higher court.Jay Nancarrow, a spokesman for Facebook, said the company had yet to decide whether to take its case to the federal courts.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the court\u2019s ruling,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are encouraged to see the thorough dissent that supports Facebook\u2019s position arguing for people\u2019s online privacy.\u201dDonna Leiberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said she was heartened the court ruled only on procedural grounds, leaving the constitutional battle for another day.\u201cThis ruling does not reject our important claim that the state and federal Constitution do not permit district attorneys to rummage around in people\u2019s Facebook accounts like they did here,\u201d Ms. Leiberman said.Vindu Goel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018American Gods\u2019: Why a Story About Ancient Deities Is Relevant Now", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported by\u201cThis is the only country in the world that wonders what it is,\u201d he mutters.He doesn\u2019t know the half of it \u2014 the scene was written and shot months before a polarizing presidential contest and new administration made fretting over the soul of America a national pastime. But it\u2019s just one of the ways that this audacious series, debuting Sunday, April 30, possesses surprising relevancy for a 16-year-old story about deities that have been worshiped for millenniums.\u201cAmerican Gods,\u201d at its core, is a road story about an ex-con named Shadow (Ricky Whittle), who takes up with Mr. McShane\u2019s enigmatic Mr. Wednesday. Their mission involves a rivalry between fading \u201cold gods\u201d \u2014 ancient mythological figures like Loki, Kali and Anansi, who were brought to life in America via the beliefs of immigrants \u2014 and new gods who have arisen to replace them, borne of more modern obsessions like technology and celebrity. Phantasmagorical and terrifically violent high jinks ensue, among other arresting visuals. (A reanimated corpse totes her amputated arm like a satchel. A love goddess consumes partners with her vagina.)But beneath the extraordinary imagery is a story about the power and evolution of faith, and of immigrants who helped to build and define American culture, only to see said culture turn against them. This overarching theme, as well as smaller vignettes about American newcomers, have taken on the sheen of advocacy, the show\u2019s overseers say, since Donald J. Trump\u2019s election and proposed immigration bans.The show, which finished shooting in October, was never planned as a political statement. But \u201cwhat has changed, bizarrely and drastically and unfortunately, is that now immigration is seen by too many as something to be vilified,\u201d said Michael Green, who created the series with Bryan Fuller.The new gods\u2019 hold on the American mindshare has also become exponentially more consuming since the book was written, years before Facebook, TMZ or iPhones. All of which suggests that while various \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d adaptations have been proposed since the novel came out, to no avail, there\u2019s never been a better time for one to come to fruition.\u201cSpeculative fiction usually ages very badly,\u201d Mr. Gaiman said. But in this case \u201cthe stuff that I wanted to talk about 17 years ago feels more apt, and more important, to talk about now.\u201dConceptual underpinnings mean little without a compelling story, of course, but the showrunners\u2019 backgrounds prepared them to adapt a magical realist genre classic like \u201cAmerican Gods.\u201dMr. Fuller\u2019s flair for hypnotic world-building and operatic, hallucinatory violence found full bloom in \u201cHannibal,\u201d another reimagining of a beloved literary property (Thomas Harris\u2019s Hannibal Lecter novels). Mr. Green is another veteran refresher of pop myths, as the screenwriter for \u201cLogan,\u201d based on the X-Men character, and \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d due out later this year.The show they created, as Mr. Whittle put it, \u201cis bananas,\u201d a neo-noir head trip mashing up mythology, science fiction and stylized gore \u2014 think slow-motion splashes of blood set to brooding cellos \u2014 as it reveals the specifics of Mr. Wednesday\u2019s quest. Like the novel, it skips around through time and space and blurs the border between reality and a more fantastical realm, lurking just below mundane American landscapes.The casting gods have been generous. Veteran performers on hand include Cloris Leachman, Orlando Jones, Crispin Glover and Kristin Chenoweth. Corbin Bernsen is Vulcan, a god of fire who has found common cause with gun enthusiasts. Gillian Anderson plays the goddess Media, first appearing as Lucille Ball and, in another scene, speaking in David Bowie lyrics.And of course for the cagey rogue Mr. Wednesday, the producers have, in Mr. McShane, television\u2019s pre-eminent portrayer of cagey rogues. (See also Al Swearengen from \u201cDeadwood,\u201d as well as the title character from \u201cLovejoy,\u201d the series that made him a star in England.)\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking to do a TV show,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t a normal TV show.\u201dThey \u201ccan be unlocked and enjoyed by almost everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly \u2018Thrones\u2019 has been an example of that, and we hope a show like \u2018American Gods\u2019 can follow in those footsteps.\u201dMr. Gaiman, who grew up in England but moved to the United States in 1992, was driven to write \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d by an urge to understand and describe his new home. This celebrated author of both comics (\u201cThe Sandman\u201d) and novels (\u201cNeverwhere\u201d) reached a new level of success with \u201cAmerican Gods,\u201d a best-seller that won major prizes for fantasy and science fiction and horror. (He still plans to write a sequel.)The expansive story was \u201cintentionally not film-shaped,\u201d Mr. Gaiman said, but directors still made inquiries over the years. HBO planned to adapt it into a series at one point \u2014 Mr. Gaiman worked on several drafts of a pilot \u2014 but nothing came of it.After Stefanie Berk, an executive who had helped develop the project for HBO, moved to the production conglomerate FremantleMedia North America, she revisited the idea with Mr. Gaiman. (FremantleMedia is producing the series.) In 2014, they met with Mr. Fuller, then overseeing \u201cHannibal,\u201d who knew Mr. Green from their time working together on NBC\u2019s \u201cHeroes.\u201dThe writers approached the story as devotees first, asking themselves \u201cwhat do you want to see in a TV show, as a fan of this material?\u201d Mr. Fuller said. They also had the ideal consultant in Mr. Gaiman, a heavily involved executive producer who weighed in on casting, read scripts and offered guidance about the story\u2019s direction.\u201cThere was only one time Neil said, \u2018If you do this, I will throw myself in front of a bus,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fuller said, referring to a plot point the showrunners were considering. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018O.K., we won\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201dSo far, Starz has only officially committed to the first eight-episode season, which gets through roughly a third of the book. But the creators estimate that they have enough material for perhaps five, based on related stories Mr. Gaiman has written and ideas he has, as well as their own significant expansions of the source material.\u201cWe\u2019re just doing what always should be done,\u201d Mr. Fuller said.But though the pro-immigrant stance of \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d was not planned in response to the new administration, Mr. Gaiman is \u201cperfectly happy\u201d for any viewers who might take issue with such a position to skip the series. \u201cI can guarantee you wouldn\u2019t enjoy it, so boycotting it is probably a very sensible way to go,\u201d he said.The showrunners also expanded the roles of memorable but fleetingly seen characters, like Mad Sweeney (Pablo Schreiber), a hulking, luckless leprechaun.Female characters, especially, were broadened to make the story less of \u201ca sausage party,\u201d said Emily Browning, the Australian actress who plays Laura Moon, Shadow\u2019s dead but very active wife. Laura and the ancient love goddess Bilquis, played by the Nigerian actress Yetide Badaki, are much more prominent in the show than they were in the book.Ms. Badaki was charged with executing one of the book\u2019s most famous and provocative set pieces, in which Bilquis, also known as the Queen of Sheba, ends a one-night stand by ingesting her lover. Outr\u00e9 mechanics notwithstanding, Ms. Badaki related to the underlying premise of a goddess of love struggling in a more emotionally withdrawn era. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever dated online, you definitely get that there is this loss of connection and intimacy,\u201d she said.While there\u2019s no shortage of indelible imagery, the most powerful examples connect to the show\u2019s deeper themes about faith, identity and modern American values.The creators are \u201cparticularly excited to see how viewers respond to the Salim story,\u201d Mr. Fuller said, a subplot about a gay Muslim man that includes an explicit, transmogrifying sex scene with a genie.In the second episode, Mr. Jones\u2019s African god, Anansi, drives a ship full of slaves to rebellion with a stirring monologue about the indignities black men will endure in America. At the end of the scene, the 40 actors playing slaves gave Mr. Jones a spontaneous ovation.\u201cThat was our first realization that some of the buttons we were pushing may have been hotter than we anticipated,\u201d Mr. Fuller said.Mr. Green said: \u201cYou never know what people are going to be challenged by,\u201d adding, \u201cso we look forward to them telling us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s \u2018Hire American\u2019 Order May Affect Tech Worker Visas", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byThe order makes no immediate changes to work visa programs but tells the Departments of Labor, Justice, Homeland Security and State to study existing laws and procedures and recommend changes.In the case of one program, H-1B temporary visas, the order directs the agencies to suggest changes to help ensure that the visas are awarded to the most skilled, best-paid immigrant workers. \u201cRight now, H-1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery, and that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the signing in Kenosha, Wis.The order also calls for a crackdown on fraud and abuse in the current system of work visas \u2014 which the agencies had already signaled they would do.What is the H-1B program, and why is the president focused on it?The H-1B program grants 65,000 work visas a year to foreigners, with 20,000 more visas granted to foreigners with advanced degrees and an unlimited number of extra visas available for universities, teaching hospitals and other nonprofit organizations. The program is aimed at highly skilled workers, and most of the visas are awarded to technology companies, although other specialty industries such as fashion also use the visas. (Melania Trump, the first lady, worked as a model on an H-1B visa.)Under federal law, employers that use a large number of H-1B workers are supposed to document that they tried to hire Americans for the jobs. All H-1B employers are also required to pay prevailing wages to the immigrant workers who receive the visas.Labor Department data shows that about 40 percent of the visas go to entry-level workers and another 40 percent go to people with limited experience and skills. The Trump administration says that more of the jobs performed by those people could and should be filled by Americans.How are the visas allocated?Visa applications must be sponsored by employers. Every April 1, the government begins accepting applications for the next fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. This year, the government received 199,000 H-1B applications in the first five days and then stopped accepting them.Because there are more applicants than visas, the visas are awarded by lottery. Each visa is good for three years and can be renewed for three more years. Immigrants who are applying for a permanent residency visa, known as a green card, can typically stay longer while waiting for approval.In 2015, President Obama expanded the program to allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to also work in the United States, but in a recent court filing, the Trump administration said it was reviewing that policy.It is not clear exactly how many foreigners are in the United States on H-1B visas, but analysts estimate 650,000 to 900,000. In recent years, about 70 percent of the visas have been issued to citizens of India.Who employs these H-1B visa holders?The biggest employers are India-based outsourcing companies like Wipro Technologies, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Tata Consultancy Services. These firms contract with banks, health care companies and other businesses to handle various computing tasks and bring in thousands of immigrants to do the work. Outsourcing companies based in the United States, particularly IBM and Cognizant, also use large numbers of H-1B workers.The leading American technology companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple, employ thousands of H-1B workers. Two companies, Facebook and the chip maker Qualcomm, are heavily dependent on H-1B visas, with at least 15 percent of their American workforces holding the visas, according to federal filings. Thousands of Silicon Valley start-ups also hire some H-1B workers.How do these foreign workers contribute to the American economy?American technology companies argue that there is a shortage of qualified Americans for scientific and programming jobs, forcing them to turn overseas for workers to meet their hiring needs.In addition, immigrants or their children have played key roles in founding many technology companies, including giants like Apple, Google and Intel and up-and-comers like WhatsApp and Airbnb.The Indian outsourcers, which generally pay lower wages and operate in a different part of the technology ecosystem, say they are helping American companies cut spending on certain basic services so they can keep employing higher-paid workers in other parts of their businesses. R. Chandrashekhar, the president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies, a group that represents the Indian technology industry, says that more than three-quarters of the Fortune 500, America\u2019s largest companies by sales, use the Indian outsourcers for some operations.\u201cThese services play a critical role in ensuring that corporate America remains a job-creation engine,\u201d Mr. Chandrashekhar said.Still, Indian outsourcing companies are preparing for a world of fewer visas, shifting the work to people in India and other countries.Are American workers hurt by immigrant work visa programs?Some studies suggest that universities grant technology degrees to more than enough American students to fill all the open jobs in the United States, so critics of the visas say the program is unnecessary. Silicon Valley companies often do not cast a wide net for American job candidates. Instead, they compete to hire the same graduates of the top colleges for many jobs and rely heavily on immigrants to fill out their workforces.Under the H-1B program, all companies have to attest that they are paying foreign workers prevailing wages and that their existing workers will not be adversely affected, said Russ Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, the American branch of IEEE, the largest professional association for computer scientists and electrical engineers. \u201cBut all you have to do is check a box.\u201dForeign workers can also be abused by the visa programs. The H-1B visa is tied to a specific employer, which means the visa holder cannot easily change jobs. Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, who has long pushed for changes, said some H-1B holders earned less than their stated salaries because they were forced to repay their employer for various expenses, such as travel.What changes are under consideration for visa programs?The government will also publicly release more data about other visa programs, such as the L-1, which allows workers officially employed overseas by a company to work in the United States. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many L-1s are here, who employs them, where they are located and what they are paid,\u201d said Ronil Hira, an associate professor of political science at Howard University who has extensively studied immigrant visa programs.Many in Congress support changing the H-1B lottery system to give preference to the highest-paying jobs. \u201cWe should allocate visas based on who wants to pay the highest salary to avoid undercutting the wages of American workers,\u201d said Ms. Lofgren, who has sponsored one of several bills on the topic.Such a change would favor established American technology companies, which tend to pay high wages, and hurt the outsourcing companies, which hire immigrants to do more basic work at lower wages. But there is a risk of collateral damage to start-ups, which pay less in cash but award stock to new hires, and to hospitals, which recruit immigrants for nursing and other nontech jobs.Changes to work visas could also be wrapped into a broader immigration bill. Mr. Trump recently told members of Congress that he was open to discussing that approach.An article on April 19 about President Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d order referred incorrectly to the application process for employers seeking to hire H-1B workers. The employers must attest that they are paying the foreign workers prevailing wages and that the working conditions of existing workers will not be adversely affected. They do not have to attest that they tried to find an American first. This correction was delayed because the error was pointed out to editors only recently.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nasdaq Hits 6,000 as Markets Rise on Tax Overhaul Optimism", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byPropelled by the skyrocketing returns of large technology stocks, the Nasdaq composite index pushed past the 6,000 level for the first time in its history.The sharp move was driven by a confluence of positive news developments, including a market-friendly outcome in the first round of France\u2019s presidential election over the weekend and reports that President Trump will put forward a plan to slash corporate taxes to 15 percent.But it has been the technology-laden index of 100 Nasdaq stocks that has delivered the far superior performance, rising 14 percent this year \u2014 more than twice the gains of the Dow and S.&P. 500.For the day, the Nasdaq closed at 6,025.49, up 0.7 percent for the day.Driving this performance has been the persistent run-up in stocks such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon, which together now comprise about a third of the index, as measured by QQQ, the $43 billion exchange traded fund that tracks Nasdaq stocks.Apple, Amazon and Facebook are up over 20 percent for the year, with Google having increased by 12 percent.The Dow closed at 20,996.12, up 232.23 points, or 1.12 percent, while the broader S.&P. 500 ended at 2,388.61, up 14.46 points, or 0.61 percent.Analysts have pointed out, though, that compared with past manias \u2014 in particular the dot-com bubble \u2014 the recent surge in technology stocks stands on firmer ground.\u201cIn 2000, the price-to-earnings ratio for Nasdaq was 170 \u2014 today it is trading at 26 times,\u201d said Charlie Bilello, the director of research at Pension Partners, an investment advisory firm, referring to a common gauge for measuring stock valuations. \u201cThat is not cheap, but it\u2019s not crazy. We are definitely not at the level where the average guy quits his job to trade stocks.\u201dThat may be true, but there is no doubt that the explosion in size of these stocks has taken many market participants by surprise, even if it is accepted that their corporate fundamentals are superior.Indeed, the booming returns of these index-heavy stocks has been a cause of intense frustration for portfolio managers and hedge funds who charge their investors steep fees to uncover hidden gems in the stock market.That is because unless they have a large part of their portfolio in fast growing (and richly valued) stocks like Amazon, Facebook and Apple, they are going to lag their benchmarks and lose money to cheaper exchange traded funds that track these indexes and provide maximum exposure to these stocks.\u201cThe mega cap growth stocks in Nasdaq have had a strong start to 2017, and many active managers have been underweight,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, an exchange traded fund specialist at CFRA Research. \u201cPeople underestimate the fact that large companies continue to get larger.

{"Headline": "A Rare Path: From Venture Capitalist to Hair-Coloring Kits", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byPrototype\u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Is this just another e-commerce thing in some crazy market that nobody cares about?\u2019\u201d Ms. Errett said.Home hair color didn\u2019t sound sexy, and women\u2019s products tend to be a hard sell among the male-dominated venture capital ranks. Also, Ms. Errett was embarking upon a rarefied career path. It is not unusual for entrepreneurs to trade in the hustle and grind of the start-up world for the stability of venture capital jobs \u2014 but most don\u2019t do the reverse.\u201cVery, very few people go from being a V.C. back to being an entrepreneur,\u201d said Jeff Crowe, a managing partner of Norwest Venture Partners.As a former entrepreneur, Ms. Errett knew what she was getting into. Earlier in her career, she had founded the online market research firm Spectrem Group, had run a $200 million business for E-Trade, and had served as chief executive of the lesbian-focused travel company Olivia.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I had visions of, \u2018Oh, this is going to be magical because it\u2019s not hard,\u2019\u201d she said of her idea to start Madison Reed. \u201cRunning a company or starting a company, it\u2019s really hard.\u201dThoughts of a return to entrepreneurship began to percolate several years into Ms. Errett\u2019s tenure as a venture capitalist, so she began looking for business ideas. Around the same time, she grew concerned about the harsh hair-coloring chemicals her wife, Clare, was handling during twice-monthly touch-ups.At dinner parties in their home, she began asking her guests the awkward question, \u201cHey, do you dye your hair?\u201d And, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s in your hair color?\u201dThe answer to the second question was invariably no. And even though the emotional stakes can be high with hair-color expenditures \u2014 a botched dye job is more likely to provoke tears than, say, an unsightly pair of shoes \u2014 many of her respondents weren\u2019t quite sure what brand they were using.\u201cIf you ask a woman what hair color she uses, she\u2019ll be like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, I go to my stylist,\u2019\u201d Ms. Errett said. \u201cOr, if she buys it off the shelf, and you ask which box she buys, she\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m not sure. I think it\u2019s L\u2019Or\u00e9al, or maybe it\u2019s Clairol.\u2019\u201dThe United States hair-coloring market is dominated by L\u2019Or\u00e9al (25 percent) and Clairol (17 percent), according to the market research firm Statista.Ms. Errett continued her informal research by observing 53 friends and acquaintances apply their own hair dye. She said she witnessed \u201call the mistakes and all the emotion\u201d involved in the process, and she concluded that the industry was stagnant in terms of the products, distribution channels and the technology used.As a venture capitalist, Ms. Errett used three criteria to assess potential investments in early-stage companies: She looked for a strong team, a sizable market and a compelling, unique quality to the business. \u201cWhy would somebody buy your stuff versus somebody else\u2019s?\u201d as she put it.Ms. Errett used this lens to evaluate her own business idea, Madison Reed.About 56 million Americans dye their hair at home, and many opt for touch-ups or full dye jobs every two to six weeks. Like razors, home hair color is what Ms. Errett calls a repetitive usage product.\u201cIt\u2019s embedded in the business model for a person to come back,\u201d she said.This combination was the clincher for Ms. Errett \u2014 and for the investors she went on to attract. So far, Madison Reed, which is based in San Francisco, has raised $45.1 million in funding, predominantly from venture capitalists.Even though entrepreneurs are often drawn to venture capital, the skills for the two fields are not interchangeable. Entrepreneurs tend to have tunnel vision, concentrating on their business without keeping abreast of broader industry trends, said Mr. Crowe, himself a former entrepreneur. \u201cYou\u2019re just so focused on executing what you and your team are doing.\u201dVenture capitalists, on the other hand, must immerse themselves in industry trends and engage in strategic thinking about competitors and new business models.That Ms. Errett had experience as a venture capitalist and as an entrepreneur helped convince Mr. Crowe to invest in Madison Reed. \u201cI thought it would make her even more effective,\u201d he said.Madison Reed is still a relatively small start-up competing against large, deep-pocketed companies. L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Clairol both have decades of name recognition, ample budgets to hire models and actresses to help promote their brands, and vast manufacturing capabilities. Several years ago, L\u2019Or\u00e9al spent $100 million to build the world\u2019s largest hair-color factory, in Mexico.One way Madison Reed competes is by offering personalized hair color and primarily selling it directly to consumers, rather than through stores or salons. Ninety percent of people who use Madison Reed products buy them from the company, while 10 percent go through Sephora, QVC and Ulta Beauty stores.It also puts a strong emphasis on technology. Ms. Errett hired a crew of \u201crock star technologists,\u201d as she describes them, to help improve the experience of dying hair at home, including devising an algorithm whereby customers answer 12 questions about their hair to find the right color. And because she hoped to appeal to women who wanted a product with more natural ingredients, such as argan oil and ginseng root extract, and fewer harsh chemicals, Ms. Errett contracted out the manufacturing to a facility in Italy, where restrictions on chemicals in hair dye are more stringent than in the United States. She hired an in-house master colorist to develop the shades of color, each of which was tested on real hair before going into production. Being able to use a contract manufacturer also meant Madison Reed required less start-up capital.Last fall, the technologists also built a tool through which customers submit selfies of their hair for color-matching. The customer sends a photo by text message or through Facebook Messenger; the algorithm analyzes the hair and selects the best Madison Reed color. A call center staffed by licensed colorists helps fine-tune the color-matching process and fields questions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Chairman Pushes Sweeping Changes to Net Neutrality Rules", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday outlined a sweeping plan to loosen the government\u2019s oversight of high-speed internet providers, a rebuke of a landmark policy approved two years ago to ensure that all online content is treated the same by the companies that deliver broadband service to Americans.The chairman, Ajit Pai, said high-speed internet service should no longer be treated like a public utility with strict rules, as it is now. The move would, in effect, largely leave the industry to police itself.The plan is Mr. Pai\u2019s most forceful action in his race to roll back rules that govern telecommunications, cable and broadcasting companies, which he says are harmful to business. But he is certain to face a contentious battle with the consumers and tech companies that rallied around the existing rules, which are meant to prevent broadband providers like AT&T and Comcast from giving special treatment to any streaming videos, news sites and other content.His plan, though still vague on the details, is a sharp change from the approach taken by the last F.C.C. administration, which approved rules governing a concept known as net neutrality in 2015. The rules were intended to ensure an open internet, meaning that no content could be blocked by broadband providers and that the internet would not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for internet and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else.In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Pai said he would undo that classification.Mr. Pai said he was generally supportive of the idea behind net neutrality but said the rules went too far and were not necessary for an open internet. He said he would also seek public comment on how to preserve the basic principles of net neutrality \u2014 the prohibitions of blocking, throttling and paid priority for online traffic.Mr. Pai voted against the current rules as a commissioner. Critics of his ideas for changing the rules warned that making any commitments only voluntary would pave the way for the creation of business practices that harm competition.\u201cIt would put consumers at the mercy of phone and cable companies,\u201d said Craig Aaron, president of the consumer advocacy group Free Press. \u201cIn a fantasy world, all would be fine with a pinkie swear not to interrupt pathways and portals to the internet despite a history of doing that.\u201dThe new policy faces several hurdles before going into effect, including months of comments and revisions. But Republicans have a 2 to 1 majority on the commission, including Mr. Pai, so most proposals he puts up for a vote will generally be expected to pass.Consumer groups and tech companies have warned of a legal challenge, however. The current net neutrality rules were affirmed by a federal appeals court, which could put an extra burden on Mr. Pai to justify his changes.The F.C.C.\u2019s policing of broadband companies has drawn greater interest with recent proposals for big mergers, such as AT&T\u2019s $85 billion bid for Time Warner, that create huge media conglomerates that distribute and own video content. Already, AT&T is giving mobile subscribers free streaming access to television content by DirecTV, which it owns. Consumer groups have complained that such practices, known as sponsored data, put rivals at a disadvantage and could help determine what news and information is most likely to reach consumers.Telecom and cable companies applauded the announcement on Wednesday. Since Mr. Pai\u2019s appointment in January by President Trump, their lobbyists have flooded the agency and the offices of Congress, pushing for an unwinding of rules that they say hamper their businesses. The No. 1 target has been the rules on broadband providers, which they complain have crimped their willingness to invest in their networks.Excerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.\u201cWe applaud F.C.C. Chairman Pai\u2019s initiative to remove this stifling regulatory cloud over the internet,\u201d Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cIt was illogical for the F.C.C. in 2015 to abandon that light-touch approach and instead regulate the internet under an 80-year-old law designed to set rates for the rotary-dial-telephone era.\u201dMr. Pai has been an active figure in the Trump administration\u2019s quest to dismantle regulations. He froze a broadband subsidy program for low-income households, eased limits on television station mergers and eased caps on how much a company like AT&T or Comcast can charge another business to get online.Consumer groups have opposed some of his changes, and they challenged the assertions of telecom companies that broadband regulations harm their businesses. They said publicly traded broadband companies have increased investments in their networks 5 percent since the current rules went into effect.About 800 tech start-ups and investors, organized by the Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator and the San Francisco policy advocacy group Engine, protested the unwinding of net neutrality in a letter sent to Mr. Pai on Wednesday.\u201cWithout net neutrality, the incumbents who provide access to the internet would be able to pick winners or losers in the market,\u201d they wrote in the letter.So far, Google and Netflix, the most vocal proponents of net neutrality in previous years, have not spoken individually about Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal. Speaking through their trade group, the Internet Association, they said the broadband and net neutrality rules should stay intact.\u201cRolling back these rules or reducing the legal sustainability of the order will result in a worse internet for consumers and less innovation online,\u201d Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, said in a statement.Mr. Pai vowed a strong commitment to the plan: \u201cMake no mistake about it: This is a fight that we intend to wage and it is a fight that we are going to win.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect location for the policy advocacy group Engine. It is based in San Francisco, not New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Changes to Tech Worker Visas Are Cosmetic. For Now.", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byThe announcements came as the government began accepting applications on Monday for H-1B visas that will be issued for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.How do the announcements change the government\u2019s policies toward foreign workers?The changes are more cosmetic than substantive. Visas for entry-level computer jobs have already been getting more scrutiny from immigration officials, and the Justice Department is reminding companies to follow the law.Still, critics of the H-1B program say the Justice Department\u2019s warning to companies not to discriminate against Americans might lead to enforcement action.\u201cIf the Department of Justice concludes that these companies are discriminating against Americans, the entire outsourcing model becomes deeply suspect,\u201d said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, a group that represents American tech workers.Why is the H-1B program important? H-1B visas are commonly used by companies to bring foreign workers to the United States to fill technical positions like software developers. Some tech companies say they need foreign workers because they cannot find enough Americans with the skills for these jobs.How do the new policies affect Microsoft, Facebook and other big American technology companies? The large tech companies are unlikely to be affected much in the near term, immigration lawyers and technology executives said. Technology companies usually apply for H-1B visas when they need to fill a job with higher-skilled workers holding bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees.William Moss, a spokesman for Intel, said the chip maker does not expect any impact from the change. \u201cIntel\u2019s foreign national population in the U.S. is largely comprised of individuals possessing unique and difficult to find skills which can only be acquired through advanced-degree, university-level education,\u201d Mr. Moss said.What about the Indian outsourcing firms? Indian outsourcing firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and Infosys get a large number of H-1B visas, as do outsource companies that are based in America, such as I.B.M. and Cognizant.Although they do hire some entry-level programmers, they have been shifting their hiring to higher-skilled and better paid workers.Benjamin Trounson, a spokesman for Tata Consultancy Services, said the company has cut back on its use of H-1B visas in the past few years, receiving only 1,500 in 2016.Why is this happening now?On Monday, the federal government began accepting applications for next year\u2019s visas. Demand for the H-1B visas so far exceeds the supply that the government is likely to cut off applications within a week, and visas will be awarded by lottery. Congress allows for 65,000 H-1Bs each year, with an additional 20,000 for workers possessing a master\u2019s degree or higher.The Trump administration may be using the moment to discourage what its views as abuse of the work visa.\u201cThe timing is not coincidental,\u201d said Ted Ruthizer, an immigration lawyer with Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to show a mastery of the situation, that they know what companies are up to with H-1Bs and they\u2019re not going to let them get away with any shenanigans.\u201dAre more changes coming that could affect the technology sector?

Tens of thousands of demonstrators filled the streets to protest a decision by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government to name a new bridge for her father.\u201cRecognize the will of the local ethnic people,\u201d protesters chanted last month as they marched along the waterfront of this historic city in southern Myanmar.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate once celebrated as a champion of democracy, was insulting the Mon people, the dominant ethnic group in the area, protest leaders said, by naming the bridge for a Burmese leader infamous here for steamrollering over their rights.\u201cThis is not a democratic process,\u201d said Min Zarni Oo, general secretary of the Mon Youth Forum. \u201cThis is a big issue for the local people. The government doesn\u2019t value ethnic diversity.\u201dEven so, her first year has been a disappointment to many.She made it a top priority to end the long-running ethnic insurgencies that have torn the country apart, but her anemic peace effort has proved fruitless so far, and fighting between government forces and ethnic groups has increased.Her government\u2019s growing suppression of speech on the internet seems perverse for a onetime democracy icon who spent 15 years under house arrest.Among the public, patience is wearing thin. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have support like before,\u201d said Zar Zar Oo, 31, a vendor selling bottled water at the Yangon train station. \u201cWe loved her so much before, but it seems like she doesn\u2019t do enough for us. For now, we are in trouble.\u201dIn a televised speech to the nation commemorating her first year in office, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi struck a defensive note, acknowledging her government\u2019s lack of progress and saying people could choose another leader if they were unhappy with her.\u201cIf you think I am not good enough for our country and our people, if someone or some organization can do better than us, we are ready to step down,\u201d she said.Some voters apparently listened. In parliamentary by-elections last weekend, her National League for Democracy won only nine of 19 seats.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 71, cites building roads as one of her biggest accomplishments. The party spokesman Win Htein said her government had doubled spending on health care and education, though he provided no details.And the economy has continued to grow as the country emerges from isolation under military rule.But Richard Horsey, a political analyst and former United Nations official, said that the growth had slowed and that foreign investment had dipped significantly. Washington\u2019s lifting of economic sanctions last year has yet to translate into stronger trade, investment or job creation, he said.\u201cAung San Suu Kyi\u2019s administration has not offered any compelling economic vision,\u201d he said.In Yangon, people are waiting for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to deliver results, said Myat Suu Mon, 28, a department store clerk. The cost of taking the run-down bus to work has doubled, she said, while her pay has remained the same.\u201cSupport is less than before because people\u2019s expectations were too high,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in reality we don\u2019t see things changing here.\u201dZaw Htay, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman, acknowledged that progress had been slow but said the government faced complex problems, such as ethnic conflicts and clashes with the Rohingya, that had been years in the making. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe are not magicians.\u201dIndeed, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi faces daunting challenges. In rebuilding the country, she must overcome decades of mismanagement and profiteering by previous military governments that enriched the generals and their cronies and brought the economy to its knees.Though her party has a strong majority in Parliament, it is hamstrung by a power-sharing arrangement dictated by the military-drafted Constitution, which gives the military control of key ministries and enough seats in Parliament to block any constitutional amendment.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is barred by the Constitution from serving as president because her children are foreigners, a prohibition she circumvented by creating the office of state counselor for herself and declaring that the president would report to her. She also named herself foreign minister.Supporters say her ability to get along with the military is a significant accomplishment. But critics suggest she suffers from Stockholm syndrome, becoming too cozy with her former captors.\u201cShe\u2019s Mary Poppins without a sense of humor,\u201d said David Scott Mathieson, an independent analyst. \u201cShe has a schoolmarmish way where instructions are given and obedience is observed. She takes that approach with government, and it is highly misplaced. Politics is compromise.\u201dShe rarely takes questions from the news media or speaks out on major issues. Her office declined a request for an interview for this article.Under the telecommunications act, defaming someone online is punishable by three years in prison. Anyone can bring a case, and suspects can be held without bail while they await trial.The previous government, which adopted the law in 2013, used it only seven times. In the year since Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi took office, 47 cases have been brought, according to Maung Saungkha, who was once imprisoned under the law and now tracks its use.In one case, two media executives were jailed after posting comments on Facebook questioning why a government official was wearing an expensive watch. Five cases have been brought by supporters of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi against people they claim defamed her, Mr. Maung said.\u201cWithout freedom of expression, there won\u2019t be democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the government wants national reconciliation, this kind of law has to be discarded.\u201dMr. Win, the party spokesman, said Parliament would amend the law in its next session. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will solve this problem.\u201dThe biggest stain on Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s record may be her government\u2019s brutal treatment of the Rohingya, and her tepid response to it.In recent months, government soldiers have been accused of widespread killing and rape of Rohingya in Rakhine State. A United Nations report concluded in February that the army and police had slaughtered hundreds of men, women and children; gang-raped women and girls; and forced as many as 90,000 people from their homes.Although Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has no direct control over the military, she has played down the reports of atrocities and stood by the military.She did appoint a commission led by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, to examine conditions in Rakhine, but reviewing the military\u2019s conduct was not part of its mandate.\u201cEntire villages were razed,\u201d said Matthew Smith, director of the group Fortify Rights. \u201cChildren were thrown into fires. Suu Kyi\u2019s denials and failure to provide a shred of moral leadership to deal with the situation is a really damning revelation of her character.\u201dThe blowback over the bridge-naming in Mon State, seen here as more evidence that the government is out of touch with the concerns of ethnic minorities, should have been easier to avoid.Mr. Zaw, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman, said senior party leaders had been warned that naming the bridge for her father, Gen. Aung San, would turn the population against them. They went ahead anyway, and last weekend it cost them the parliamentary seat in Chaungzon, the township across the bridge from Mawlamyine. \u201cIt was a mistake to name this bridge,\u201d Mr. Zaw said. \u201cIt is a good lesson for N.L.D. leaders.\u201dSaw Nang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Students say getting B\u2019s can be deeply dispiriting, dashing college dreams and profoundly disappointing parents.The rocks, it turns out, were the work of a small group of students worried about rising anxiety and depression among their peers. They had transformed a storage area into a relaxation center with comfy chairs, an orange/peach lava lamp and a coffee table brimming with donated art supplies and lots and lots of rocks \u2014 to be painted and given to favorite teachers and friends. They called it the Rock Room.\u201cAt first it was just us,\u201d said Gili Grunfeld, a senior who helped with the effort. \u201cThen everyone was coming in.\u201dSo many rocks were piling up, they had to be stored in a display case near one of the cafeterias. The maxims seemed to call out to students as they headed to their classes in conceptual physics, computer programming, astronomy and Advanced Placement Music Theory.And they became a visual reminder of a larger, communitywide initiative: to tackle the joy-killing, suicide-inducing performance anxiety so prevalent in turbocharged suburbs like Lexington. In recent years, the problem has spiked to tragic proportions in Colorado Springs, Palo Alto, Calif., and nearby Newton, Mass., where stress has been blamed for the loss of multiple young lives. In January, a senior at Lexington High School, who had just transferred from a local private school, took her own life.Residents in this tight-knit hamlet, with its high level of civic engagement, are hoping to stem the tide. Mary Czajkowski, the district superintendent, was hired in 2015 with the mandate of \u201ctackling the issue head on.\u201d\u201cWe want to be a model,\u201d said Jessie Steigerwald, a longtime school board member.But it has not been easy.Claire Sheth, a mother of four who had invited Ms. Abeles to town, describes Lexington students as \u201ctired to the core.\u201d Students say depression is so prevalent that it affects friendships, turning teenagers into crisis counselors. \u201cA lot of kids are trying to manage adult anxiety,\u201d said the principal, Laura Lasa.The town\u2019s growing Asian community has not been timid acknowledging the problem. Through college forums and chat rooms, a group of parents and leaders of the local Chinese-American and Indian-American associations have been working to lower the competitive bar and realign parental thinking. Others are pushing back. They don\u2019t want the workload reduced \u2014 they moved here for the high-rigor schools. At association meetings, where the tension is most pronounced, discussions about academic competition in the district have brought some to tears.Indeed, reversing the culture is complicated in a town that prides itself on sending dozens of students to the Ivy Leagues: 10 went to Harvard last year and seven to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Young people are lauded at school board meetings and online for having published academic papers or performed at Lincoln Center. Last year, the varsity team placed second in the 2016 History Bowl nationals and fourth in the National Science Bowl. The robotics team has qualified for the FIRST Championship, an international technology and engineering competition, for five of the last six years.After school recently at the public library, which was packed with students poring over textbooks, calculus work sheets, lab reports and term papers, a sophomore looked up from her world history textbook and said, \u201cYou see all these people? They want the same thing \u2014 that\u2019s really overwhelming.\u201d What they want: Entry into a top colleges when acceptance rates are at an all-time low.\u2022Lexington looks and feels like a lot of other affluent suburbs: serene, stately, with a whiff of muted money. Minivans and aging Volvos are packed with violins and well-worn soccer gear. There are meticulously restored Colonials and Tudor revivals. Walk along the red brick sidewalks of Massachusetts Avenue, which cuts through the center of town, and Lexington\u2019s Brahmin past is evident: a statue on the Battle Green of a musket-toting Captain John Parker, who led the fight against the British in 1775.In evidence as well are signs of the burgeoning biotech industry, and the changing face of America\u2019s elite.Since 2000, the Asian population has ballooned from 11 percent to an estimated 22 percent of Lexington\u2019s 32,000 or so residents, surpassing Newton (at about 13 percent) and Cambridge (15 percent). Today, more than a third of Lexington\u2019s students are Asian or Asian-American. The demographic mirrors the migration of Asian families to suburbs across the country.In the Crafty Yankee or the Asian bakery across the street, you are likely to bump into electrical engineers from Seoul, physicists from Beijing and biochemists from Boston. They teach at Harvard (10 miles away) and run labs at M.I.T. (11 miles). They hold top positions in the pharmaceutical companies that dot the Boston-area tech corridor. More than half of the adults in Lexington have graduate degrees. And many want their children to achieve the same.In many ways, students in Lexington are the byproduct of the self-segregation that Enrico Moretti writes about in his book \u201cThe New Geography of Jobs,\u201d which addresses the way well-educated, tech-minded adults cluster in brain hubs. For their children, that means ending up in schools in which everyone is super bright and hypercompetitive. It\u2019s hard to feel special.\u201cYou need to bring along everybody,\u201d said Ms. Abeles, whose campaign has taken her to towns with similar communitywide efforts, including Elkins Park, Penn., San Ramon and Burbank, Calif., and New Rochelle, N.Y.\u201cFamily problems are often community problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need community solutions.\u201dNo one is more aware of this than Ms. Lasa, who grew up here, earned degrees from nearby Springfield College and Lesley University, and then returned to the district \u2014 watching all the while as the population morphed from relatively laid back to Type A. She often wakes to emotional emails from parents delivered to her inbox after midnight. Most, she says, are about their children\u2019s academic standing, and the tone is often disappointment.Last fall, as 557 bright-eyed freshmen gathered in cushioned folding chairs in the auditorium for orientation, she gave a speech that over the last few years has come to focus more and more on stress reduction. She begged the students to make mistakes. \u201cDo not believe that you must acquire straight A\u2019s to be a successful student,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you and/or your parents are caught up in society\u2019s picture of success, let us help you change the focus.\u201dStudents are now required to meet with counselors when choosing courses to talk about their academic loads. The practice is largely seen as a way of keeping students from overscheduling to beef up their college transcripts.\u201cWe are trying to change a culture that is deeply rooted here,\u201d Ms. Lasa told me in a sunny Boston accent as she barreled through the school. She was showing off the 45-minute free period she instituted this year, allowing \u2014 or in some cases, forcing \u2014 students to take time to unwind. Some were playing basketball in the gym. Others were talking with teachers. A few hung out in classrooms, chatting with friends. An awful lot, though, were getting a head start on homework.Ms. Lasa says she is trying to \u201cbalance all the messages\u201d they are getting about success and happiness. The one she wants to most impart is: \u201cSlow down.\u201d\u2022One morning in February, students in \u201cPositive Psychology: The Pursuit of Happiness,\u201d a popular elective, were following up on a discussion about the psychologist Barbara Fredrickson\u2019s \u201cbroaden and build\u201d theory, which posits that negative emotions like anxiety and fear prompt survival-oriented behaviors, while positive emotions expand awareness, spurring new ideas, creativity and eventually building skills.\u201cToday, we are going to look at pretty simple ways to make it more likely that you experience positive emotions on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Matthew Gardner told his \u201cHappiness\u201d students as they pulled out notebooks and pencil cases. The class discussed the benefits of exercise and eating foods that release feel-good hormones. The students also learned that smiling and being smiled at releases dopamine, which has an uplifting impact.Mr. Gardner offered an alternative to smiling: \u201cOur brains are not so perfect that, sometimes, if you hold a pen or pencil like this\u201d \u2014 he held a pencil between his teeth \u2014 \u201cyou activate some of the same face muscles. You might get a little bit of a dopamine effect, too.\u201dSeveral students held pencils between their teeth to test the theory.\u201cIt\u2019s not just that your heart rate goes down and you become very calm,\u201d Mr. Gardner explained. \u201cIt\u2019s that the shape of your heart rate is smooth and more controlled. Frustration is more jagged.\u201dTheir homework assignment: Do laughter yoga or \u201csmile at five people you wouldn\u2019t normally smile at.\u201dThe effects of smiling are also taught in the A.P. Psychology class that Gili Grunfeld is taking, and it has informed her thoughts on stress. On a winter afternoon, she and several classmates were uncoiling in the Rock Room, making friendship bracelets and sketching in fat coloring books. A Post-it that read \u201cUnplug\u201d was taped to the wall clock. The students were bemoaning how so many of their peers develop \u201ctunnel vision,\u201d in Gili\u2019s words, about schoolwork and extracurricular activities, sacrificing sleep and time with friends.\u201cThey isolate for academics,\u201d she said glumly.Soon the students had changed topics, and were discussing the ice that had caked the school parking lot that morning and how to balance on it. The subtext, once again, was well-being: How much can friends support each other if both feel overwhelmed?\u201cAre we more likely to fall or are we more steady if we hold onto each other?\u201d asked Jocelyn Geller, a junior.\u201cI feel like if you have a friend with you, you feel safer,\u201d said Millie Landis, a sophomore, pulling Jocelyn up and wobbling on the floor with her to demonstrate. \u201cBut you could pull each other down.\u201d\u2022The district has increased the number of counselors and social workers, including those working in the district\u2019s elementary schools, and expanded the training they receive in identifying and supporting at-risk students.5 PhotosAdding to the pressure, she says, are cultural differences in how parents, raised abroad, and their offspring, raised in the United States, are expected to process setbacks and strife: American educators routinely encourage students to share their feelings; not so in Asia.\u201cI really see a lot of this being bicultural conflict,\u201d Ms. Tang said. \u201cWhen you have one side of the family holding one set of values and the other embracing a new set of values, that inherently creates a lot of misunderstanding and a lot of tension.\u201dMs. Tang says that the disconnect is compounded by a lack of knowledge about the various routes to success available in the United States. Last year, she was brought in by the vice president of the local Chinese-American Association, Hua Wang, to help plan the college forum, a three-hour event on Father\u2019s Day. Dr. Wang, an engineering professor at Boston University, wanted to shift the focus away from a guide on applying to top colleges.Despite resistance from the organizers, he and Ms. Tang prevailed. At the forum, she presented a slide show celebrating the academic trajectories of respected Chinese-Americans: the fashion designer Vera Wang went to Sarah Lawrence College; Andrew Cherng, the founder of the fast-food chain Panda Express, went to Baker University in Kansas; the best-selling author Amy Tan, San Jos\u00e9 State University. Parents were surprised. But, Ms. Tang said, \u201cI think a lot of parents felt like: \u2018What do I do with that information?\u2019\u201dThis year, organizers will delve deeper into the differences between the Chinese and American systems, and are planning to add another new element: a panel discussion on combating stress. Dr. Wang said they want to showcase families who have adopted a more \u201cholistic view\u201d of education. Selected parents of graduating seniors will be asked to talk about how they encouraged their children to get enough sleep, comforted them when they came home with B\u2019s and discouraged them from skipping ahead in math to be eligible for higher level classes earlier.This would not be the only time that Dr. Wang has engaged in this kind of dialogue. Using the Mandarin words \u201cdanding,\u201d which means to keep calm and steady, and \u201cruizhi,\u201d which means wise and farsighted, he has initiated conversations on WeChat, an online chat room popular among Chinese parents. Recently, he told them: \u201cCalmness and wisdom from the parents are the Asian child\u2019s greatest blessings.\u201dBut the message was not well received by everyone. Among the posted responses: \u201cIf your child gets a C, how do you get to a point of calm? You think we should be satisfied because at least he didn\u2019t get a D?\u201d And: \u201cBut my heart still whispers: Am I not just letting my child lose at the starting line?\u201dOne parent, Melanie Lin, found herself, too, in a heated conversation on WeChat after early-admissions decisions arrived last school year. She urged the other parents to stop bragging on the site about acceptance letters to top-tier schools: \u201cIf it\u2019s only those students who are attending the big-name schools that are being congratulated, then the idea being passed on is that only those students are successful, and attending a big-name school is the only way to become the pride of your parents.\u201dDr. Lin, who works at a pharmaceutical company, emigrated in the 1990s from Beijing to get a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Arizona State University. She says her rebuttal annoyed even close friends, whose online responses accused her of trying to deny parents and their children their moments in the spotlight.Recounting the conversation with me brought Dr. Lin to tears. \u201cThere is just so much pressure,\u201d she said. For her, the struggles are not theoretical. On the home front, she too can be just as obsessed as her peers, she says.Her daughter, Emily, would agree. During junior year, she dreaded car rides and family dinners \u2014 any time, really, that she was alone with her parents \u2014 because conversations routinely veered back to college. Now a senior, Emily has eight A.P. and 13 honors classes under her belt. She is also a violinist, choral singer, competitive swimmer and class vice president.For a chunk of her high school career, Emily was one of those who \u201cisolated for academics,\u201d working into the early morning hours on homework and waking up, sometimes before dawn, after only five or so hours of sleep. She skipped birthday parties and lunch to squeeze in more studying. \u201cI was never doing anything for pure fun,\u201d she said. \u201cI put my head down and I was always running somewhere with some purpose.\u201dBut as a member of a youth board for a teen counseling center in town, she realized that her study habits were unhealthy. To get support for herself and others, she helped launch the town\u2019s Sources of Strength chapter. She has assisted in planning student outreach events and spoke up at a town meeting about \u201cthe dog-eat-dog\u201d competition that still persists at the high school.Homework remains heavy, students say, particularly in high-level classes. Class rankings may be gone but students have a pretty good sense of where they stand. And while there has been talk of a later start time to the day so students can get more sleep, the idea is on hold.In December, when early decisions came in, Emily found out she was deferred to the regular admissions pool by Yale, her top choice. Parents on WeChat were more sensitive this time around, but accepted seniors still bragged on Facebook.Since then, Emily has been admitted to nine universities; rejected by three, including Yale; and waitlisted by Harvard and the University of Chicago. She is deciding between Columbia and Duke.Through it all, she has wondered if it\u2019s worth it.\u201cI lost out on a lot of high school,\u201d she had told me as she waited for college decisions. What she hopes is that students who come after her find some balance before their time at Lexington is up.Kyle Spencer writes frequently for The Times on education.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Does a Superhero Look Like?", "Date": "2017-04-16", "News": "Supported byTrying to find someone who looked like me in the world of superheroes is not something I thought about growing up in the \u201970s. My parents are from Ecuador, but I was born in the United States and always thought of myself as American (no preceding modifier and hyphen needed), and what could be more American than the fight for truth and justice?My entry into the world of comics was \u201cSuper Friends\u201d (1973-86), which united DC Comics heroes in animated form. They had colorful costumes, but their skin tones were almost uniformly white. The first hero who stood out to me as \u201cother\u201d was Green Lantern, though his darker hue was more like a deep tan.Four diverse heroes were added to Super Friends in 1978. The intent was well meaning then, even if it seems especially ham-handed now: Apache Chief (Native American), Samurai (Japanese), El Dorado (Mexican) and Black Vulcan (one guess). The show rarely depicted their civilian lives, so viewers never learned much about them.Later that year I met Yolanda Montez, who would become Wildcat II. She was of Mexican descent and added some diversity to her team, Infinity Inc. Yolanda came with an odd tick: Her thoughts and speech were often expressed in Spanish and English. This helped readers who were not bilingual, but made me wonder: Why is she always repeating herself \u2014 and in two languages?My go-to source for superheroes are comics, but we live in an era when many of these champions are on television and film. Robbie Reyes, the latest version of Marvel\u2019s Ghost Rider, is Latino and debuted in 2014. The character joined the fourth season of \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d last year. Wild Dog, a hockey-mask-wearing vigilante named Jack Wheeler who was introduced by DC in 1987, is on \u201cArrow,\u201d where he\u2019s become Rene Ramirez. Then there is the utter delight that Wolverine\u2019s daughter in this year\u2019s \u201cLogan\u201d is of Mexican descent. Even Archie Comics is part of the fiesta \u2014 Veronica Lodge is half Latina in \u201cRiverdale.\u201dFor the next generation of superheroes fans, representation will be easier to find. Nothing wack about that.\u2014 George Gene GustinesThe U.S. Code has an entire section concerning the treatment of the flag. Section 8J (4 U.S.C. \u00a7 8(j)): \u201cThe flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing.\u201dMy interest in the Mexico-U.S. border stemmed from the thought that there are an infinite number of ways to cross illegally, but only 48 legal checkpoints. I set off to visit all of them.In August 2015, the Mexican-American painter Mauricio Cortes and I set off on a research trip along the entirety of the border, east to west, documenting the conditions there. I returned to the studio with a spool of fencing wire a mile long. From this spool I began to make coils, cut them into rings, and weave the rings into a textile in the form of the United States flag.The resulting piece is about 6 feet by 3.5 feet, and weighs just under 50 pounds. It is displayed on the floor and made to be interacted with, draped over and bunched. The phenomena of chain mail, with its liquid-metal qualities, relies on synergy between touch, sight and sound. The tones of red, white and blue are achieved by incorporating three distinct styles of chain-mail weaves, which can be loosely categorized as European, Japanese and Persian.These ancient groupings delineate spheres of competing influence that continue to define international politics.

{"Headline": "Vetting Delays Snarl Path to Citizenship for Thousands in Military", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byMIAMI \u2014 Thousands of immigrants who joined the United States military with promises of a fast track to citizenship are stuck in limbo as new screening measures have taken far longer than expected, leaving some military members around the nation unable to become citizens or even go to basic training.In the Army alone, about 4,300 people are awaiting the completion of their background checks, said Hank Minitrez, a spokesman for the Army. Until they are cleared, they cannot enter basic training or deploy overseas, leaving them stuck on bases if they are on active duty.Immigrants must be in the United States legally in order to enlist. But the new vetting measures, begun in the waning months of the Obama administration, have taken so long that by November, the legal status of up to 1,500 people who enlisted in active duty or the Reserve had expired while they waited for clearance, the Army said.They cannot legally drive or find work, a problem for reservists, who do not draw a full-time military paycheck. Although the Army is granting some extensions, they could eventually be subject to deportation, the Army said.Some enlistees who were at the doorstep of citizenship have had the door slammed shut at the last minute.One Army reservist in South Florida who had been scheduled for her citizenship oath on Thursday was turned away. A trauma surgeon in Springfield, Ill., who signed up for the Army Reserve was scheduled to become a citizen on May 5, then learned that his case was delayed.Anbazhagan Chinnappillai, who came to the United States from India in 2013 on a student visa, lost the visa when the university where he was studying discovered he had enlisted. His original ship-out date has been postponed indefinitely.\u201cI thought joining the military was going to help me have a better life, like an American dream,\u201d he said.So-called Dreamers, immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children and have been granted a reprieve from deportation, are eligible, as are immigrants with valid visas at the time they sign up. Legal permanent residents, or green-card holders, have been able to enlist and win speedy citizenship for years under a separate program.United States Citizenship and Immigration Services referred calls to the Pentagon. The Department of Defense acknowledged that the new screening methods had caused \u201csome delays.\u201dThe scrutiny is extensive. According to a lawsuit filed by seven Mavni members who said the Defense Department was improperly stalling them, the investigation covers at least 10 years of finances, education and professional activities, on top of credit and criminal background checks. The individual must complete an exhaustive questionnaire and is interviewed by an investigator, often for several hours. Close relatives, references, employers, neighbors and colleagues are also interviewed.The process involves various agencies, including the Defense and Justice Departments, and the sheer volume of applications has resulted in delays, said Mr. Minitrez, the Army spokesman.\u201cThese background checks are quite extensive and time consuming,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cbut are absolutely necessary.\u201dNaomi Verdugo, a retired senior recruiting official in the Army who helped create Mavni, said one soldier she knew had an M.B.A. and spoke Ukrainian and Russian, but was sitting around his base with little to do because the military had not completed his background check.\u201cHe is sitting there, painting rocks,\u201d she said.Margaret D. Stock, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve who also was involved in creating Mavni, said she believed the government was violating a segment of the law that says Army reservists are eligible for citizenship as soon as they begin serving.Sagar Dubey, 31, a computer consultant in Minneapolis who runs a Facebook page for Mavni recruits, said hundreds of reservists had posted desperate messages about running out of money or being unable to leave the country to attend a parent\u2019s funeral because they were no longer in the United States legally and might not be allowed to re-enter. Mr. Dubey, who is from India, joined the Reserve a year ago but still has not been allowed to attend basic training.The Army reservist who was turned away from a citizenship ceremony on Thursday had learned just hours earlier that her case was stalled.\u201cTo come this far and not be able to do it?\u201d said the woman, a 29-year-old Brazilian who did not want her name published because she feared it would hurt her citizenship application. \u201cWe have contracts we signed.

{"Headline": "Cuomo Has the Opportunity to Fix Penn Station, but Will He?", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookAlmost every administration has a telltale moment. For Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, it may well have come in 2010, before Bridgegate, when he stopped a plan to build new passenger rail tunnels under the Hudson River, connecting to Pennsylvania Station, claiming they cost New Jersey residents too dearly. In that one decision, he seemed to prove what critics would later say: He put shortsighted politics before constituents, and himself above public welfare.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo may now have reached a similar juncture, and it also involves Penn Station. His legacy may rest on how he handles the crisis there.The urgency to fix the station has reached a peak. But this also creates a great occasion to get something done \u2014 something grander than Mr. Cuomo\u2019s current plan, a project born of political expediency.About 650,000 daily passengers, a number equivalent to the entire population of Boston (and steadily rising), use the station entombed below Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. They ride Amtrak, the Long Island Rail Road, the subways and New Jersey Transit.According to an Empire State Development study, however, only about 20 percent of Penn Station\u2019s daily commuters will end up using the Farley building. Most will still suffer the existing chaos. And Farley does almost nothing to prepare for the still-needed new Hudson tunnels. In effect, the governor wants to slap a two-car garage onto a dilapidated split-level and declare the property good as new.There is a history of politics trumping responsible decision-making when it comes to regional infrastructure. After 9/11, George E. Pataki, New York\u2019s former Republican governor, steered plans for rebuilding the World Trade Center in the wrong direction to suit his own White House dreams. Given the choice to do the right thing for Lower Manhattan or do something quickly, he repeatedly chose short-term gain over long-term vision.Now it seems to be Mr. Cuomo\u2019s turn. His Farley renovation is a step in the right direction. But he has brushed off more sweeping proposals that might tackle once and for all the whole panoply of problems that plague Penn Station.It is widely known, for example, that Vornado Realty Trust, a major developer that jointly won the bid to redevelop Farley with Related Companies, has spent years working with architects, planners and city officials on ways to improve public spaces, circulation and safety in and around Penn Station, where the firm owns a great deal of property. Vornado played a role in having the city create a pedestrian plaza on 33rd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues \u2014 a highly popular move and boon to the area.Vornado also came up with a design for a new entrance to Penn Station along 33rd Street. Those who have seen the plan describe dramatically increased space for passengers to access and exit the hub where congestion is the worst. At the same time, the proposal is said to bring natural light pouring down to the underground dungeon, widening a major, crowded corridor for commuters, and helping orient travelers now lost in a low, miserable, windowless warren.But the governor has declined even to make public Vornado\u2019s proposal or one reportedly submitted to him by JDS Development Group, another real estate company. His fix for the existing trouble beneath the Garden widens that same underground corridor \u2014 but without making it any easier for people to get in or out of the station, a root cause of overcrowding and stampedes. Instead of natural light, he envisions LED screens on the ceiling, displaying puffy clouds and blue skies.As Vishaan Chakrabarti, a New York architect, recently put it: \u201cI think people would rather see an actual blue sky than one on TV.\u201dVornado, according to people who have reviewed its plan, proposed splitting costs between the company and the public. State officials working under Mr. Cuomo have argued that developers making money by leasing retail space at Penn Station should be able to pay for improvements themselves, a concept that smacks of President Trump\u2019s fantasy of the private sector alone solving the nation\u2019s infrastructure crisis.Decades ago, New York lost one of its grand entryways. What if a new one were hiding in plain sight?Mr. Cuomo, as Mr. Christie did by rejecting the tunnels, can insist he is saving the public money and simply being pragmatic in declining Vornado\u2019s more ambitious plan. Companies should contribute their fair share. But the public is mostly paying for the revamp of Farley, which will cost $1.6 billion and still not solve the station\u2019s biggest headaches.But Mr. Cuomo seems to have dropped the ball with the Dolans, too.Gateway is the nation\u2019s most pressing infrastructure project. Millions of lives and a big chunk of the country\u2019s economy depend on it. A chastened Mr. Christie is suddenly singing the tunnels\u2019 praises, whispering their urgency, or so he says, in President Trump\u2019s ear. Steven Roth, the founder and chairman of Vornado, is an old friend and adviser to Mr. Trump on infrastructure. He understands as well as anyone both the need for Gateway and an improved Penn Station.This situation presents Mr. Cuomo with a unique opportunity. Mr. Roth, James L. Dolan and he can tackle the whole of Penn Station. They really don\u2019t need anybody else in the room.They can all benefit by so doing, none more obviously than the New York governor, who could become a true political legend by \u2014 and this is what matters most \u2014 delivering the public what he promised, which Farley alone won\u2019t achieve: a 21st-century station finally worthy of this great city.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Learning to Talk Like a Woman (or Man)", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byIn her 30s, Sophie Marat, now 42, used to record herself reading poetry aloud, then play it back to hear if she sounded like a woman. Ms. Marat, who is transgender, had spent years trying to remake her voice in private by speaking in a higher pitch but ultimately felt that her efforts were hopeless.\u201cI was feeling like changing my voice to match my gender identity was almost impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was terrible.\u201dMs. Marat\u2019s transition from male to female has been a gradual evolution. She had come out to friends and family back home in Mexico, then began to wear skirts to work as a software engineer in Manhattan. Still, her confidence would falter with everyday tasks like ordering takeout. \u201cIt was really painful to speak on the phone,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they would reply, \u2018O.K., sir.\u2019\u201dThat was before she started her weekly sessions with a voice therapist at New York University\u2019s speech-language-hearing clinic, one of a growing number of programs that cater to transgender clients seeking to retrain their voices.Just as some transgender women and men choose to take hormones or have surgery, or choose neither, some seek to feminize or masculinize their voices. Many say they want a voice that matches their appearance or that the change allows them to escape unwanted attention. There\u2019s also a growing recognition among health professionals who have transgender patients that altering one\u2019s voice can improve quality of life and reduce distress.Transgender men who take testosterone permanently thicken their vocal folds, which tends to deepen the pitch of their voice. But transgender women who take hormones \u2014 a mix of estrogen and androgen-reducing drugs, for example \u2014 typically hear no change in their voices. As a result, transgender women are more likely to work with voice therapists, though transgender men can benefit as well, as some struggle with pitch instability and voice fatigue.A lot of what transgender women learn in voice therapy is how to safely use their vocal anatomy to create a higher pitch and oral resonance without straining, so their new voices are ultimately sustainable. \u201cWe\u2019re asking them to do an Olympic athletic feat,\u201d said Heather Krug, who has worked with transgender clients for four years at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. \u201cIf they are going to get pitch into a feminine range, they need to have nicely conditioned vocal cords so they don\u2019t get injuries.\u201dFeminizing a voice, however, involves far more than just achieving a consistently higher pitch. Perhaps the most critical, experts say, is a quality called \u201cforward resonance,\u201d in which a speaker feels vibrations closer to the front of the vocal tract, toward the nose and lips.Research has shown that \u201ca higher pitch and more forward oral resonance corresponds to a voice consistently perceived as female,\u201d said Adrienne B. Hancock, an associate professor of speech, language and hearing sciences at George Washington University.While do-it-yourself YouTube videos from transgender women are available, sessions with a voice specialist can improve forward resonance and soften an elevated pitch, so someone doesn\u2019t sound like Minnie Mouse, Dr. Hancock said.Another voice quality to consider is intonation. While men tend to speak in a monotone fashion, women generally have more highs and lows, something Ms. Marat mastered during about a year of group and one-on-one lessons and practice at N.Y.U.Her fundamental pitch is consistently elevated in the feminine range at about 185 hertz, up from 147 hertz. Still, if Ms. Marat speaks for too long, she gets out of breath, and she feels she speaks too softly.On Tuesdays, Ms. Marat works with Sam Jaffe, a graduate student at N.Y.U., to get her vocal cords into better shape so she can raise her pitch and volume to where she wants it without becoming breathless. \u201cVoice modification therapy is kind of analogous to going to the gym for your voice,\u201d Mr. Jaffe explained.But while therapists help clients gain technical skill, it\u2019s up to each patient to \u201cown\u201d his or her new voice and figure out what sounds right for them, said Leah Helou, the director of the transgender voice program at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\u201cIt\u2019s not my job to make someone into an image of a lady as I see fit,\u201d Dr. Helou said. \u201cThe danger when they come to me is they think, \u2018She\u2019s going to tell me what I need to do to pass.\u2019\u201dSpeech and language therapists have been working with transgender clients as far back as the \u201970s, but it wasn\u2019t until 2006 that the first textbook was published. In the past decade, the number of speech pathologists and voice clinicians learning to work with transgender clients has grown exponentially.This April, Ms. Hirsch, Dr. Helou and Christie Block, a speech language pathologist in Manhattan, joined forces to expand a two-day training program for voice therapists interested in transgender work. The weekend workshop, which started in 2007 with 25 voice therapists, has grown to roughly 85 clinicians this year, Ms. Hirsch said, with roughly half participating via webinar.A Facebook group for speech language therapists and other professionals to discuss transgender care now has about 100 clinicians in the referral database from the United States and about 50 more from abroad, according to Dr. Helou, one of the moderators. Roughly 60 began working with transgender clients only in the last five years.Speech language pathologists are also seeing a growing number of transgender people in their 20s and 30s, and even adolescents.In 2012, when Cynthia Simonetti, a speech language pathologist, became an instructor at the University of New Mexico, most patients were older, many on the verge of retirement from their jobs. \u201cThey were at a point in their lives where they just felt they needed to be true to themselves,\u201d she said. But now, she\u2019s as apt to see new college graduates.Since 2015, Northwestern University and the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago have held a coed voice training session exclusively for transgender adolescents and young adults.Posters advertising the group on campus proclaim, \u201cBe heard for who you are!\u201d The age cutoff is 24, and so far, the youngest participant was 12, said Nathan Waller, a group supervisor and a clinical instructor in Northwestern\u2019s department of communication sciences and disorders. For most, \u201cthey are the only trans kid in their school,\u201d he said, so \u201cwe make it casual and provide information and practice.\u201dVoice modification can take six to 12 months or longer, with home practice required to achieve the stamina needed for sustaining a new voice throughout a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate conversation or a work presentation.Darlene Monda, the clinic supervisor who started the N.Y.U. group three years ago, said some participants haven\u2019t told their friends they\u2019re transgender yet or started the process of physical transition. But \u201cthey want to start working on their voice, so when the time comes, they are ready to transition and have this piece underway,\u201d she said.Others are already out, she said, and they \u201cdon\u2019t want to present visually female, open their mouths, and have people staring at them, like \u2018You\u2019re not really a woman.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Technology Is Built on a \u2018Stack.\u2019 Is That the Best Way to Understand Everything Else, Too?", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsNearly three decades later, now that computing has become truly ubiquitous, its metaphors are deployed without a moment\u2019s thought. We don\u2019t just talk intuitively about the ways in which people are \u201cprogrammed\u201d \u2014 we talk about our emotional \u201cbandwidth\u201d and look for clever ways to \u201chack\u201d our daily routines. These metaphors have developed right alongside the technology from which they\u2019re derived, starting with hardware and then moving to software, apps and networks. Now we\u2019ve arrived at a tempting concept that promises to contain all of this: the stack. These days, corporate managers talk about their solution stacks and idealize \u201cfull stack\u201d companies; athletes share their recovery stacks and muscle-building stacks; devotees of so-called smart drugs obsessively modify their brain-enhancement stacks to address a seemingly infinite range of flaws and desires.\u201cStack,\u201d in technological terms, can mean a few different things, but the most relevant usage grew from the start-up world: A stack is a collection of different pieces of software that are being used together to accomplish a task. A smartphone\u2019s software stack, for instance, could be described as a layered structure: There\u2019s the low-level code that controls the device\u2019s hardware, and then, higher up, its basic operating system, and then, even higher, the software you use to message a friend or play a game. An individual application\u2019s stack might include the programming languages used to build it, the services used to connect it to other apps or the service that hosts it online; a \u201cfull stack\u201d developer would be someone proficient at working with each layer of that system, from bottom to top.The stack isn\u2019t just a handy concept for visualizing how technology works. For many companies, the organizing logic of the software stack becomes inseparable from the logic of the business itself. The system that powers Snapchat, for instance, sits on top of App Engine, a service owned by Google; to the extent that Snapchat even exists as a service, it is as a stack of different elements. \u201cWhat you end up with is entire companies being built on a set of software tools and services,\u201d says Yonas Beshawred, whose own company, StackShare, lets tech professionals publish their companies\u2019 stacks and see what others are using, comparing technology the way hobbyists might compare gear. \u201cYou can think of them as Lego blocks.\u201d A healthy stack, or a clever one, is tantamount (the thinking goes) to a well-structured company.Other attempts to elaborate on the stack have been more rigorous and comprehensive, less personal and more global. In a 2016 book, \u201cThe Stack: On Software and Sovereignty,\u201d the professor and design theorist Benjamin Bratton sets out to, in his words, propose a \u201cspecific model for the design of political geography tuned to this era of planetary-scale computation,\u201d by drawing on the \u201cmultilayered structure of software, hardware and network \u2018stacks\u2019 that arrange different technologies vertically within a modular, interdependent order.\u201d In other words, Bratton sees the world around us as one big emerging technological stack. In his telling, the six-layer stack we inhabit is complex, fluid and vertigo-inducing: Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface and User. It is also, he suggests, extremely powerful, with the potential to undermine and replace our current conceptions of, among other things, the sovereign state \u2014 ushering us into a world blown apart and reassembled by software. This might sound extreme, but such is the intoxicating logic of the stack.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

The meat tugs back under the teeth a moment before giving in, a sign of character. The juices saturate the rice below, or better yet mujadara, green lentils and bulgur wheat wedded in a pan with olive oil and onions just flowering into sweetness. It tastes buttery and creamy without the presence of either.I like a dish that lets you taste how it was made. Baba ghanouj has a history written in smoke, eggplants blackened so long over an open flame that smoke and flesh become indistinguishable.More smoke seeps into moussaka \u2014 the Arab version, not the Greek one \u2014 as eggplants are roasted and then simmered for hours with chickpeas, tomatoes and mint. It\u2019s just a meze, but it\u2019s meaty and hearty, with a sweet-sour streak of pomegranate juice cutting through it, like sunlight through smoke.For makdous, baby eggplants are poached, salted and left to sweat out their bitterness, then stuffed to bulging with red bell pepper, garlic and walnuts, and submerged in olive oil for at least two weeks. They emerge faded and wrinkly but still composed, the outside springy, the inside a puzzle of crunch.Sandwiches, all under $10, have heft and, rolled into long, tight bundles, rest like truncheons in the hand. The pita, from a bakery in New Jersey, is not the thick, spongy variety but is as flat and thin as roti, in the Lebanese style. (Note that should a scrap of bread fall, Lebanese tradition demands that you pick it up and kiss it, as a gesture of respect.)Each sandwich is braced by pickled turnips, made in house and hot pink; they sting. When asked, you want the hot sauce, called harr, a scarlet muster of cayenne pepper.Falafel are gulps of bronzed air, with a garden\u2019s worth of parsley and cilantro packed inside. A spinach pie is thick with leaves, darkened but still tasting fresh, anointed with little more than pomegranate and sumac.Wafa Chami, the chef, was born in northern Lebanon in the ancient Phoenician port of Tripoli, to an inheritance of recipes five generations deep. Her family moved south to Beirut; she was 16 when the civil war began, and left the country soon after, making her way to Forest Hills, Queens. There she wound up in a semi-arranged marriage to a son of a family friend. (The union yielded four children, but did not last.)But she missed her grandchildren. And so she is back, now cooking in Brooklyn because she promised her successor in the Forest Hills space that she would not open a restaurant nearby. The new Wafa\u2019s is a return to the takeout format, with orders placed at the counter and just a few tables. Ms. Chami likes it this way.Former regulars who come to visit her here may be disappointed that she is not yet serving her famous okra or fattoush. (\u201cIn summer,\u201d she said.) But she is still making baklava and kenafeh, honoring the tradition of Tripoli, known for its scholarship regarding sweets.I do not know if I have tasted a better baklava: rich with syrup but not sticky, and no sweeter than it is earthy from the crush of walnuts.But kenafeh is Ms. Chami\u2019s glory. The phyllo is shredded into gossamer strands and gilded with butter; the cheese, akin to mozzarella, is made more voluptuous with ashta, Lebanese clotted cream. And the scent: orange blossom and rose water, in the ashta, in the syrup and in the air, like a benediction.Advertisement"}

Someone even donated the largest amount possible, $500.By the end of the 90-minute live stream, Mr. Rebelo had received 250 Super Chat messages and netted $4,000 from them.YouTube began a test of Super Chat on Jan. 12 and followed with a wide rollout of the feature on Feb. 7. Now any YouTube streamer with more than 1,000 subscribers who is registered with YouTube\u2019s Partner Program \u2014 which allows users to earn money from videos through advertising \u2014 can enable Super Chat during a live stream.\u201cFor creators, Super Chat does double duty: keeping their conversations and connections with (super) fans meaningful and lively while also giving them a new way to make money,\u201d said Barbara Macdonald, a product manager at YouTube who worked on Super Chat.Twitch has a feature similar to Super Chat called Cheering, begun in June 2016, which lets viewers \u201ctip\u201d streamers during a live stream. Viewers \u201ccheer\u201d by using \u201cBits,\u201d virtual goods that come in the form of animated gem-shaped emoticons. Viewers can buy Bits directly from the chat window; there are different colors and sizes starting at $1.40 for 100 Bits. Streamers receive one cent for every Bit used in their chat.\u201cTwitch viewers are very savvy and in tune with their favorite casters, so they are aware that their support is what enables their favorite streamers to broadcast full time,\u201d said Matt McCloskey, the vice president for commerce at Twitch.Super Chat and Cheering are more than about money \u2014 they also offer another way for streamers and their audiences to bond and converse. T. L. Taylor, a professor of comparative media studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said real-time interaction with audiences in live streaming \u2014 particularly in the genre of video game live streaming \u2014 was increasingly becoming a crucial part of the experience.\u201cGame live-streaming taps into the longstanding pleasure of spectating other people\u2019s play,\u201d Dr. Taylor said. \u201cLive streamers are adept at connecting with the folks watching them, drawing them out and into the play experience.\u201dOn Twitch, while all channels are free, subscribing to a channel gives viewers perks like subscriber-only chat, subscriber-only emoticons and discounts on merchandise. Subscriptions on Twitch are generally around $4.99 a month.But features like Super Chat and Cheering feel more personal.\u201cSome people just like to let me know that my videos make their day, what video is their favorite, suggestions for future live streams and over all just to increase the odds of their comments being seen and for me to say their name,\u201d Mr. Rebelo said.There may be a downside to the new features, said Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst. He said it was hard to predict how audiences would react once they were asked to pay for interactions with live streamers.\u201cSuper Chat is probably destined to fail,\u201d Mr. Pachter said. \u201cI think that the business model is flawed, and I think the ability to \u2018buy\u2019 a spot in the queue is going to turn off a lot of fans.\u201dA YouTube spokeswoman said there had already been \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Super Chat purchases since the product launched. \u201cWhile anyone could make predictions, we\u2019ve been really encouraged by the early adoption and engagement on Super Chat,\u201d the spokeswoman said.Yet some internet commentators are not impressed. In February, We the Unicorns, a news site about YouTube personalities, called Super Chat \u201cthe weirdest YouTube feature yet,\u201d arguing, \u201cWe\u2019re all for fans of YouTubers supporting their faves financially however they want, especially if they get something in return; but should the payoff really be a few extra seconds of attention in a chat room?\u201dDigby Lewis, the former director for brand strategy at BuzzFeed, also publicly expressed concern in an opinion piece for The Drum, a magazine focused on the marketing industry. He said paid comments fomented self-promotion by creators and could raise ethical questions about whether comments are for the creator or the community of viewers.\u201cA positive contribution deserves to rise to the top because of its value to the community, not because someone has a financial advantage,\u201d he said in the op-ed essay.For now, live streamers seem to have embraced Super Chat and Cheering. Mr. Rebelo said no one seemed put off by Super Chat during his Grand Theft Auto V live stream \u2014 though a few people did wonder whether he was getting the money from the stream, or if YouTube was.And while the top streamers can earn in the millions of dollars from advertising and other sources, for everyone else, ads may simply not be enough to survive on.Clintus McGintus, 35, a YouTube video blogger from Phoenix, used Super Chat in January for his channel, Clintus.tv. During a 30-minute live stream of him walking around his local Target store, he made almost $900 through Super Chat.\u201cThis is my business and how I pay the bills,\u201d Mr. McGintus said. \u201cSuper Chat is the next level. Tipping on stream and getting a shout-out or having your comment read by the content creator is a great feeling.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As New Zealand Courts Tech Talent, Isolation Becomes a Draw", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported by6 PhotosWELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 In the South Pacific, software no longer needs a hard sell.New Zealand has long wanted to be a tech hub, but distance was an issue. Now, at a moment of political upheaval around the globe, that isolation has become a selling point.For all sorts of reasons, New Zealand suddenly makes sense. The cost of living is less than in San Francisco. Commuting is less wearying. And American politics, \u201cBrexit\u201d and the Islamic State are on the other side of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things where the stars are aligned,\u201d said David Jones, general manager at the Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency.New arrivals describe New Zealand as more idealistic and less frustrating than other places.\u201cIn the U.S., I feel extremely disconnected,\u201d said Alanna Irving, 33, who came here from San Francisco to start two companies. \u201cThings happen all the time that I don\u2019t agree with or understand or think are really good for most people, and I just don\u2019t see any way that I can change that.\u201dThis is the second time New Zealand has tried to use Silicon Valley to jump-start its fledgling tech economy. The current effort is in some ways an outgrowth of the first, featuring the same players.The first time, there were big promises that were never fulfilled. It was a typical Silicon Valley story, in other words, which makes it a bit of a cautionary tale even as everyone assumes that this time will be different.The story began more than a decade ago when a billionaire entrepreneur came here to visit and, like so many others, fell in love with the majestic mountains and sweeping vistas. New Zealand is where Peter Jackson filmed \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d a beloved text for many techies. It is the real Middle-earth, a fantasy come to life.Fantasies are rarely free. People applying for citizenship here are required to have spent 70 percent of the previous five years living in the country, and to commit to living in it afterward. Even humanitarian exceptions are rare.Peter Thiel, the contrarian investor who made his fortune with PayPal and Facebook, made an irresistible financial proposal to New Zealand in early 2011. He would bring the local economy \u2014 whose biggest exports were concentrated milk and the meat from sheep and goats \u2014 into the high-tech era. Mr. Thiel would serve as the country\u2019s roving tech ambassador, opening doors around the world that are closed to mere government officials.Even before applying, he set up Valar Ventures, an investment fund named after the gods in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d Valar put about $3 million into Xero, an online accounting software firm, and was part of a $4 million infusion of cash into Pacific Fibre, which proposed a trans-Pacific undersea cable.And that, Mr. Thiel signaled, would be just the beginning.\u201cI intend to devote a significant amount of my time and resources to the people and businesses of New Zealand,\u201d he wrote in his citizenship application. He donated about $750,000 to earthquake relief after the city of Christchurch was struck in February 2011.\u201cWe were so blown away that Peter Thiel was interested,\u201d said Rod Drury, the chief executive of Xero. \u201cHim getting a passport wasn\u2019t a big deal at the time. No one really thought about it.\u201dWhen the secret was revealed, it created a small uproar.\u201cSomeone being able to invest and get citizenship goes against that important New Zealand value of equality,\u201d Mr. Drury explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why it has played so much in the media here.\u201dMr. Drury is the biggest name in New Zealand\u2019s tech scene, a local version of Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg. He recommended Mr. Thiel for citizenship, and Xero was held up as a model of what, with the investor\u2019s help, all the new start-ups could become.The New Zealand government was so enthusiastic about Mr. Thiel\u2019s investing prowess that it became a partner with him in early 2012, putting about $7 million into a Valar fund. The fund did well, primarily because of its big position in Xero.Valar is now based in New York, where it has been investing in European and Brazilian companies. Mr. Thiel declined to comment.\u201cIt\u2019s sad for New Zealand that Thiel and Valar didn\u2019t follow on with more investments,\u201d Lance Wiggs, a local investor, said. \u201cWe are starved for cash.\u201dXero, which has 1,400 employees and customers in 180 countries, took a different path. Its goal is to turn accountants into \u201cgrowth consultants,\u201d becoming a platform that soars above national borders.\u201cGay marriage, cultural tolerance, refugees, active strategies to address diversity \u2014 more than ever our leadership here is important,\u201d Mr. Drury wrote in an email to his staff immediately after the election. He proposed setting a moral example by bringing \u201csome refugee groups into our Wellington office.\u201dA postelection arrival at Xero from the United States is Nick Piesco, 40, who was writing code for a start-up in Austin, Tex. \u201cI\u2019d say the timing is coincidental but fortuitous,\u201d the programmer said of his move 7,437 miles west. Already he and his wife, Reneau Skinner, 39, are talking about becoming citizens.\u201cOne of the things that attracted me to Xero was the culture \u2014 how they make people feel welcome,\u201d Mr. Piesco said.That means those barred from the United States under the new administration\u2019s policies, or who think they might be, are ripe for recruitment, Mr. Drury said.\u201cEspecially in the U.S. technology industry, where something like 50 percent of the billion-dollar companies have been built by immigrants, it\u2019s nuts that you make it difficult for engineers to come in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy for us not to exploit that.\u201dThe LookSee Wellington initiative to bring in 100 software engineers was initially focused on Americans. Then word began to spread. By the time the contest was finally cut off on March 30, India had overtaken the United States in applications.\u201cWe\u2019re in a global talent war,\u201d said Chris Whelan, chief executive of the Economic Development Agency in Wellington.Mr. Drury is already looking to make LookSee an annual affair. After all, it takes the expensive problem of recruitment off Xero\u2019s hands and lets the government do it.\u201cIt\u2019s boom time for the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Drury said. The more immigrants, the better. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a lot. We\u2019ll take hundreds.\u201dAn article last Friday about New Zealand\u2019s efforts to court technology workers misstated the surname of a local investor. He is Lance Wiggs, not Biggs. Because of an editing error, the article also attributed incorrectly a quotation about immigration and tech labor. It was Rod Drury, the chief executive of the accounting software firm Xero \u2014 not Nick Piesco, a Xero employee \u2014 who said, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy for us not to exploit that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Strike on Syria Brings Fleeting Hope to Those Caught in Brutal Conflict", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported byISTANBUL \u2014 Six years of war in Syria have ravaged the life of Ebrahim Abbas, 27.Mr. Abbas, a computer technician, was detained for protesting against the Syrian government, besieged in his hometown and shot in the stomach, and watched his brother die in a shelling attack. He escaped, but his father, a diabetic, died later from a lack of medicine, and his mother was killed by a sniper.\u201cWatching a world power taking revenge for civilians against the Syrian regime gave me a surge of hope and made me a bit optimistic,\u201d Mr. Abbas said.But the attack will not bring back all that he has lost nor help him return home soon. In a measure of how entrenched the war is, there were new airstrikes on Saturday on the town targeted in the chemical-weapons attack, with at least one person killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.The strike on the air base was the most direct, deliberate military intervention by the United States against Mr. Assad\u2019s forces since the war began. Mr. Trump said he had launched the strike because he was moved by images of women and children choking on poison gas.But while the strike on Thursday appeared intended to limit the chances of retaliation, Mr. Trump has offered no proposals to end the war or to assuage the vast human suffering it has generated, sending fleeing Syrians across the globe.Yasmine Mashaan, a pharmacy technician from the town of Muhassan in eastern Syria who lost several brothers to the conflict, said the strike was unlikely to change much for her and her family. And she doubts Mr. Trump\u2019s motivations.\u201cIt would be great if he continued this in the direction of saving more civilians or establishing a safe zone, but after his racist speeches and anti-refugee policy, I think the strike is more for popularity,\u201d said Ms. Mashaan, who is now in Germany after fleeing there with her family. \u201cBut judging by how fast he intervened in Syria and how powerful it was, then we might be going somewhere with it.\u201dThe number affected by the conflict boggles the mind. What began as an uprising in 2011 escalated into a civil war as protesters took up arms to respond to the government\u2019s repression and seek its ouster.Over time, countries like the United States, Turkey and Saudi Arabia backed the rebels, while Russia and Iran helped Mr. Assad. As chaos spread, extremist groups gained ground. Al Qaeda infiltrated the rebel movement, while the jihadists of the Islamic State seized territory that extended into Iraq.Now more than 400,000 people have been killed, a figure roughly equal to the population of Tulsa, Okla., or Oakland, Calif. Many more have been maimed.Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, which does aid work in Syria, said he could not comment for or against the strike by the United States, but he said that \u201cthey do not solve any of my urgent priorities.\u201dFor the humanitarian situation to improve, aid workers would need more border crossings for getting aid into the country, assurances that air and ground forces would not attack hospitals and better access to besieged and suffering communities, including nearly 400,000 people within an hour\u2019s drive of Damascus, the capital.\u201cIt is heartbreakingly frustrating to be a humanitarian worker and to have the resources and the supplies but not to be able to reach these people,\u201d Mr. Egeland said.Within the conflict\u2019s statistics are countless stories of torture, detention, forced conscription, families torn apart and normal lives downgraded rapidly or simply cut short.Even some Syrians who welcomed the strike questioned why, after all of the war\u2019s brutality, it was the chemical attack this past week that had brought a show of force against Mr. Assad.President Barack Obama did not respond militarily to a chemical attack in 2013, despite having called the use of such weapons a \u201cred line.\u201d Since then, the doctor has watched the world move on while the siege of his area has tightened, he said through Skype. He said he had learned to live with less electricity, less fuel, less clean water and less food.\u201cWe are living like ancient people, how they depended on themselves, how they used wood to make fires,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a hard life.\u201dHe expected more from the United States and its allies after the 2013 attack, what he called \u201ca position that was appropriate for the free world.\u201d But the result was an agreement, brokered by Russia, for Mr. Assad to give up his chemical weapons.\u201cThe solution to the crime was a deal to take away the weapon but leave the criminal,\u201d the doctor said.The strike by the United States made him mildly optimistic that Mr. Trump would intervene more forcefully than Mr. Obama had.\u201cTrump is a closed box that has started to open,\u201d he said. \u201cSoon we will see what\u2019s inside.\u201dWhile conflict monitors said that Mr. Assad\u2019s forces and their allies had caused the bulk of the war\u2019s deaths with their advanced weapons, communities loyal to Mr. Assad have also paid a heavy price.Tens of thousands of Syrian soldiers have been killed, and religious minorities, secularists and others who view Mr. Assad as a symbol of a unified Syria have continued to fight out of fear that they would be eradicated if Islamist rebels take over the country.Others have had to face both the government and the jihadists.Ms. Mashaan, the pharmacy technician, said her family\u2019s troubles began when she intervened to stop a security officer from beating her brother for protesting. The officer beat her instead, breaking her arm.As the uprising spread, Ms. Mashaan, 36, and her five brothers joined in. Soon, her brothers and husband were arrested and tortured, in some cases coming home with their fingernails removed, she said.Then they began to die.As violence spread, Ms. Mashaan\u2019s family fled to a refugee camp in the countryside, but it was soon taken over by a new force in the area: Islamic State jihadists. They killed her younger brother and took advantage of her medical training by forcing her to work in a clinic, she said.The family later fled to a refugee camp across the border in Turkey, where they lived until Ms. Mashaan\u2019s husband and her last remaining brother joined the migration to Europe and paid smugglers to take them to Greece in rubber dinghies. They made their way to Germany, where she and her five children joined them last year.Living in Germany is hard, she said in a Facebook chat from her new home. Not speaking the language made it difficult to register the children, and many Germans refused to rent lodgings to her family because they were refugees, she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How YouTube\u2019s Shifting Algorithms Hurt Independent Media", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byCritic's Notebook\u201cThis is an existential threat to the show,\u201d Mr. Pakman said. \u201cWe need that money.\u201dThe architecture of the internet has tremendous influence over what is made, and what is seen; algorithms influence what content spreads further on Facebook and turns up on top of Google searches. YouTube\u2019s process for mechanically pulling ads from videos is particularly concerning, because it takes aim at whole topics of conversation that could be perceived as potentially offensive to advertisers, and because it so often misfires. It risks suppressing political commentary and jokes. It puts the wild, independent internet in danger of becoming more boring than TV.\u201cIt\u2019s getting so bad that you can\u2019t even speak your mind or be honest without fear of losing money and being not \u2018brand-friendly,\u2019\u201d said Ethan Klein, the creator of h3h3. \u201cYouTube is on the fast track to becoming Disney vloggers: beautiful young people that wouldn\u2019t say anything controversial and are always happy.\u201dThis is not all the algorithm\u2019s fault. People create these systems, and they are sensitive to bad press and skittish advertisers. The YouTube ad crisis \u2014 and the company\u2019s response \u2014 also speaks to a persistent public misunderstanding of the worth of digital creators. The mainstream media barely engages with YouTube videos as an artistic product in the way it does traditional television and film. Coverage is focused on how much money YouTube stars make, how improbably famous they are among teenagers and, now, on the small number of racist and extremist videos that have slipped through the cracks of the ad system.Jamie Byrne, director of creators and enterprise at YouTube, said that concerned companies had requested tougher controls to keep their ad dollars flowing. \u201cFor creators to flourish on our platform, we need an incredibly strong advertising community engaged on YouTube as well,\u201d he said. He hopes that as the ad systems learn to decipher context, and advertisers relax, creators will see greater returns.All of that means that new media creators hoping to make a living online need to play by YouTube\u2019s rules, and steer clear of anything \u201cpotentially objectionable\u201d \u2014 not to real people, who might actually be offended, but to robots. If YouTube wants to fulfill its promise of an online environment where independent creators can make interesting work, it will find a way to scrub ads from truly vile content without penalizing the merely controversial.Advertisement"}
