{"Headline": "Silver Lake Raises $15 Billion Fund for New Tech Deals", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byNow the firm is poised to significantly raise its buying power.Silver Lake plans to announce on Tuesday that it has closed its fifth buyout fund at $15 billion, one of the biggest ever dedicated to technology deals. That exceeds the $12.5 billion fund-raising target that the firm had previously aimed for and brings the firm\u2019s total assets and committed capital to about $39 billion.It is an approach that has garnered good results so far. Silver Lake\u2019s fourth fund, with $10.5 billion under management, currently boasts returns of nearly 31 percent, according to the data provider PitchBook.\u201cWe recognize and take seriously our responsibility to serve as stewards of capital for our limited partners and their beneficiaries in an international investment environment characterized by growing complexity, disruption and change,\u201d the firm\u2019s four managing partners \u2014 Mike Bingle, Egon Durban, Kenneth Hao and Greg Mondre \u2014 said in a statement.Much of the private equity world has turned its eyes toward technology deals. Roughly 20 percent of all American private equity deals in the first quarter were in the tech sector, according to PitchBook. That is roughly double the average for the past decade.And now some of the best-performing private equity firms focus on technology. Vista Equity Partners, an investment firm focused on reviving older software companies, has averaged returns of more than 20 percent, spurring a number of imitators.Silver Lake\u2019s new fund represents a huge sum, although it is far smaller than the $100 billion Vision fund that SoftBank of Japan has assembled for technology-focused deals. That enormous reserve, which counts the Saudi Arabian government and Apple as investors, has shaken the private equity world.The new fund is also distinguished by a trivia note: It is the first fund not to feature any of Silver Lake\u2019s founders as its general partners. Jim Davidson, a co-founder who was listed as one of the managers of the firm\u2019s fourth fund, will not be listed as a manager for the fifth fund and will assume an emeritus status at the firm.Yet the move is in some ways ceremonial. Investment decisions at Silver Lake have been managed by its four current managing partners for more than five years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s C.E.O. Plays With Fire", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Travis Kalanick\u2019s drive to win in life has led to a pattern of risk-taking that has at times put his ride-hailing company on the brink of implosion.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, visited Apple\u2019s headquarters in early 2015 to meet with Timothy D. Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. It was a session that Mr. Kalanick was dreading.For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple\u2019s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased \u2014 a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple\u2019s privacy guidelines.But Apple was onto the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve been breaking some of our rules,\u201d Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber\u2019s app would be kicked out of Apple\u2019s App Store.For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber\u2019s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers \u2014 essentially destroying the ride-hailing company\u2019s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded.In a quest to build Uber into the world\u2019s dominant ride-hailing entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow.But the previously unreported encounter with Mr. Cook showed how Mr. Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale, sometimes to the very brink of implosion.Crossing that line was not a one-off for Mr. Kalanick. According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships, Mr. Kalanick, 40, is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost \u2014 a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009.\u201cTravis\u2019s biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals,\u201d said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Mr. Kalanick. \u201cTravis\u2019s biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That\u2019s the best way to describe him.\u201dThat quality also extended to his personal life, where Mr. Kalanick mixes with celebrities like Jay Z and businessmen including President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn. But it has alienated some Uber executives, employees and advisers. Mr. Kalanick, with salt-and-pepper hair, a fast-paced walk and an iPhone practically embedded in his hand, is described by friends as more at ease with data and numbers (some consider him a math savant) than with people.Through an Uber spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined an interview request. Apple declined to comment on the meeting with Mr. Cook. Many of the people interviewed for this article, who revealed previously unreported details of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s life, asked to remain anonymous because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with Uber or feared damaging their relationship with the chief executive.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s pattern for pushing limits is deeply ingrained. It began during his childhood in suburban Los Angeles, where he went from being bullied to being the aggressor, continued through his years taking risks at two technology start-ups there, and crystallized in his role at Uber.Mr. Kalanick grew up in the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles. His parents, Bonnie and Donald Kalanick, made sure he and his brother, Cory, were never left wanting. He was naturally athletic and competitive, and excelled at running track and playing football.At Patrick Henry Middle School, he was a wiry student who got good grades \u2014 putting him in the sights of some older kids who picked on him. Mr. Kalanick later vowed never to be bullied again and turned the tables on his tormentors.He also showed signs of entrepreneurialism. One summer, he sold knives door-to-door for the cutlery company Cutco. At 18, he started New Way Academy, his own SAT prep business, with a partner.The start-up life soon called to him. After attending the University of California, Los Angeles, to major in computer engineering, Mr. Kalanick dropped out in 1998 to form a start-up with several classmates. The company, Scour, became a peer-to-peer file exchange similar to Napster, which let people digitally share music and media files through legally dubious means.Scour, which was eventually sued for $250 billion for alleged copyright infringement, filed for bankruptcy in October 2000, a move that protected it from the suit. The failure did not stop Mr. Kalanick from helping to found another Los Angeles start-up, Red Swoosh, four months later. Red Swoosh made a technology to efficiently transfer large files of digital data; one of its investors was Mr. Cuban.Sean Stanton, Red Swoosh\u2019s former vice president for sales, said of Mr. Kalanick: \u201cScour was about efficiency. Swoosh was about efficiency. It\u2019s just the way his brain is wired. It\u2019s like the way Uber works right now: What\u2019s the fastest, cheapest and most efficient way to get from point A to point B? That consumes him, and all parts of his life.\u201dWith Red Swoosh, Mr. Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness. When the company struggled, Mr. Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks \u2014 which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the Internal Revenue Service \u2014 and reinvested the money into the start-up, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal.With Mr. Kalanick desperate to keep Red Swoosh afloat, he moved back into his parents\u2019 house. He staved off bankruptcy for a second time by raising another round of funding. The wayward tax dollars eventually went to the I.R.S.Mr. Kalanick also decamped to Thailand with his software team in April 2006 to save money by living cheaply abroad, while also using the trip as a team-building exercise.In 2007, Mr. Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai, a cloud services company, for roughly $19 million. The deal turned the executive, who had headed north to San Francisco, into a millionaire.By then, some advisers had soured on him. \u201cThe Travis Kalanick I came to know 17 years ago was relentless in pursuit of his goals at the expense of those who supported him along the way, deluded by his own embellished personal narrative, and a serial prevaricator,\u201d said Peter Yorke, a former Red Swoosh adviser and a longtime tech executive.Others stuck by him. Michael Robertson, chief executive of MP3.com, an early digital music sharing service, said that he told Mr. Kalanick, \u201cSometimes in business you have to battle the establishment, and it can get brutal and ugly.\u201dIn San Francisco, Mr. Kalanick and Angie You, his longtime girlfriend, bought a townhouse nestled in the upper hills of the city\u2019s Castro section. Though the couple have since split, the two remain close and still speak on a regular basis.The idea for Uber came in 2009 from Garrett Camp, a friend of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s, who became fixated on hailing a private luxury car with a smartphone app after being unable to catch cabs in San Francisco.A few months later, Mr. Kalanick changed his mind and took over as UberCab\u2019s chief. He quickly positioned the start-up as an alternative to the taxi industry. At the time, taxi companies had iron grips in many towns. City-by-city regulations required procedures like base stations for cabs, safety measures and other stipulations.Mr. Kalanick ignored those rules.\u201cWe\u2019re in a political campaign,\u201d he once said at a technology conference, and the candidate is Uber. The opponent is named Taxi, he said, adding a rude descriptive. \u201cNobody likes him, he\u2019s not a nice character, but he\u2019s so woven into the political machinery and fabric that a lot of people owe him favors.\u201dMr. Kalanick carried that same level of intensity into Uber\u2019s headquarters, pacing briskly while working by doing laps around the office. His pacing is so legendary, his father once said, that he wore a hole in the carpeting.Mr. Kalanick focused on expanding UberCab quickly. The company typically sent a small strike team into a new city \u2014 say, Seattle \u2014 to aggressively recruit new drivers through Craigslist and other online listings. Then the team marketed UberCab\u2019s app to increase ridership.That drew attention from regulators. In October 2010, the company shortened its name to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from San Francisco officials for marketing itself as a taxi company without the proper licenses and permits.To influence local legislators to accept Uber, Mr. Kalanick took extra steps. In 2014, Uber hired Ben Metcalfe, an engineer who described his job on LinkedIn as building \u201ccustom tools to support citizen engagement across legislative matters\u201d to drive \u201csocial good and social change.\u201dIn practice, Mr. Metcalfe and his team created an email-based system to aid Uber users and drivers to directly contact local legislators to lobby for allowing Uber in their cities. The system was similar to Change.org, a website that pushes social change through online petitions. City and state officials were soon deluged with emails supporting Uber.In some places, Uber employees were also told to create computer programs known as scripts that would automatically vote for the ride-hailing service in city-administered surveys.Mr. de Blasio capitulated, and the cap did not take place.As Uber gained momentum, Mr. Kalanick moved into the spotlight.It did not come naturally. One friend recalled a night out with a group of married couples at the Gold Club, a San Francisco strip club, a few years ago. Mr. Kalanick, who was single, pulled out a laptop to work on a spreadsheet, crunching Uber\u2019s numbers while friends watched the dancers onstage.Another friend called Mr. Kalanick a \u201ctech world rock star,\u201d which means something different in Silicon Valley than in the music world.\u201cTo work with and around one requires a different kind of mentality and skill,\u201d said Andy Abramson, an early adviser to Mr. Kalanick. Mr. Abramson likened the chief executive to other idiosyncratic founders like Jeff Bezos of Amazon.Mr. Kalanick was eventually coaxed more into the limelight by others. Shervin Pishevar, an Uber investor, sometimes took Mr. Kalanick to clubs in Los Angeles on the weekend, providing a car and a change of \u201cclub clothes.\u201d Mr. Pishevar, who did not respond to a request for comment, was the Uber chief\u2019s entryway into Los Angeles\u2019s world of celebrity.Hollywood stars were eager to buy into Uber, which they had started using to get around. Actors like Edward Norton, Olivia Munn and Sophia Bush took small stakes in the company. Mr. Kalanick and a top lieutenant, Emil Michael, sometimes hung out with Leonardo DiCaprio, who is also an investor, and Jay Z, whose wife, Beyonc\u00e9, performed for Uber employees at a poolside party in Las Vegas in 2015.Jay Z once wired money to Mr. Michael in an attempt to invest even more in Uber. Mr. Michael and Mr. Kalanick, giddy at rebuffing a celebrity, wired some of the money back, saying they already had too many interested investors. Representatives for Jay Z did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Kalanick also dreamed of luring celebrities into advisory roles at Uber. One aim was persuading Oprah Winfrey to join the board \u2014 something Uber executives believed could happen after Mr. Kalanick met Ms. Winfrey at a party on the Spanish island of Ibiza \u2014 but the idea never jelled. A spokeswoman for Ms. Winfrey declined to comment.Mr. Kalanick began mixing with elite business executives. He developed a close relationship with Mr. Cohn, then a top-ranking executive at Goldman Sachs. At one point, the two men spoke on a near daily basis. Mr. Cohn and a White House spokeswoman did not return requests for comment.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s main mantra was \u201cgrowth above all else.\u201dThat meant Uber\u2019s top performers were often promoted and protected. When one general manager, a title for a city-level chief, threw a coffee mug at a subordinate in a fit of rage, the incident was reported to human resources \u2014 but there was no follow-up. At the time, Uber\u2019s business in the general manager\u2019s city was strong.Other complaints also fell on deaf ears.After a backlash over Uber\u2019s use of \u201csurge pricing\u201d (raising ride prices when demand is high) amid an East Coast snowstorm in 2013, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s response to upset riders was a torrent of economics and math.Friends and employees told Mr. Kalanick that he should at least pretend to care about how it looked to take such a hostile stance with Uber\u2019s users. Several described him as \u201cemotionally unintelligent.\u201dWith Mr. Kalanick setting the tone at Uber, employees acted to ensure the ride-hailing service would win no matter what.They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers\u2019 emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft\u2019s business. (Lyft, too, operates a competitive intelligence team.)Uber also tried to win over Lyft\u2019s drivers. Uber\u2019s \u201cdriver satisfaction rating,\u201d an internal metric, has dropped since February 2016, and roughly a quarter of its drivers turn over on average every three months. According to an internal slide deck on driver income levels viewed by The New York Times, Uber considered Lyft and McDonald\u2019s its main competition for attracting new drivers.To frustrate Lyft drivers, Uber dispatched some employees to order and cancel Lyft rides en masse. Others hailed Lyfts and spent the rides persuading drivers to switch to Uber full time.That year, Uber came close to buying Lyft. At a meeting at Mr. Kalanick\u2019s house, and over cartons of Chinese food, he and Mr. Michael hosted Lyft\u2019s president, John Zimmer, who asked for 15 percent of Uber in exchange for selling Lyft. Over the next hour, Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Michael repeatedly laughed at Mr. Zimmer\u2019s audacious request. No deal was reached. Lyft declined to comment.The rivalry remains in force. In 2016, Uber held a summit meeting in Mexico City for some top managers, where it distributed a playbook on how to cut into Lyft\u2019s business and had sessions on how to damage its competitor.To develop its own business, Uber sidestepped the authorities. Some employees started using a tool called Greyball to deceive officials trying to shut down Uber\u2019s service. The tool, developed to aid driver safety and to trick fraudsters, essentially showed a fake version of Uber\u2019s app to some people to disguise the locations of cars and drivers. It soon became a way for Uber drivers to evade capture by law enforcement in places where the service was deemed illegal.The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber\u2019s app, began in 2014.At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased and resold. Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides from those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers could earn more money this way.The start-up has undertaken an extraordinary experiment in behavioral science to subtly entice an independent work force to maximize company revenue.To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called \u201cfingerprinting.\u201d Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents.There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple\u2019s rules. Mr. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner\u2019s identity remained on the device.So Mr. Kalanick told his engineers to \u201cgeofence\u201d Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber\u2019s software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code for people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber\u2019s fingerprinting.The ruse did not last. Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Uber\u2019s methods, prompting Mr. Cook to call Mr. Kalanick to his office.Mr. Kalanick was shaken by Mr. Cook\u2019s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting.But only momentarily. After all, Mr. Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Facebook Keeps Beating Every Rival: It\u2019s the Network, of Course", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThe tech world just witnessed a robbery. The heist was so brazen you kind of had to admire it, even if it was pulled off with all the grace of a gas station stickup.His speech had a lot of corny jokes, but that was just Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s way of hiding the shiv. In reality it was a performance that made plain Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ruthlessness as a businessman. It also shows that he understands Facebook\u2019s most important assets. Mr. Zuckerberg realized early on that the most important thing in his business was not necessarily creating the best new features. It doesn\u2019t matter who invents digital mustaches. What matters is owning the biggest and most engaged network. And because he has the network, he always wins.For years now, the world has been doubting Mr. Zuckerberg. Facebook, they said, would never beat Myspace. Then Facebook was going to get a run for its money from every other social network \u2014 Twitter, Pinterest and more. Hey, could it survive Google\u2019s onslaught? Could it survive its own initial public offering? How would Facebook adjust to mobile? What about live video? And then there was Snapchat. By turning the smartphone camera into a communications platform, Snapchat created a novel and compelling social experience. Teenagers couldn\u2019t get enough of it. And teenagers are the future. If Facebook lost teenagers, game over.Hahaha. In the big picture none of these things really made a dent in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s expanding kingdom.Five years ago, after more or less cementing Facebook\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest social network, he began to buy up and build future networks. He bought Instagram, which now has 600 million users. Then he bought WhatsApp, which has more than a billion users. Then he turned Facebook\u2019s baked-in chat feature into its own chat app, Messenger, and now that, too, has a billion users.He offered Evan Spiegel, Snapchat\u2019s co-founder, $3 billion to buy that app. Mr. Spiegel refused \u2014 but perhaps he should have taken a closer look at the networks Mr. Zuckerberg was assembling.Do you know what happens when you control four of the biggest social networks in the world? You get to stop worrying about competitors beating you on features.Mr. Zuckerberg didn\u2019t win all of this stuff; sometimes the features turned out to be less important than initially thought, but that didn\u2019t matter. At the very least he would neutralize his enemy\u2019s growth, cutting it off before it became an existential threat to Facebook.And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve just seen with Snapchat. There is a debate in the tech press about whether Facebook\u2019s shrewd copying has killed Snap, Snapchat\u2019s parent company, or simply wounded it. After all, last week Instagram said that 200 million people a day were using its Stories feature, which is more users than all of Snapchat (160 million at last count).What\u2019s important is that Facebook has forced this coexistence. Facebook\u2019s billions of users will now be introduced to Snapchat\u2019s best features on Facebook\u2019s own platform, eliminating, for a lot of them, any reason to switch. There is essentially no chance now that Snapchat will eclipse Facebook anytime soon, if ever. In other words, Mr. Zuckerberg has done it again; he has neutralized yet another rival.But there is another aspect to the power of large networks: They make other people\u2019s features better.\u201cEven if we were slow to add cameras to all our apps, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re going to be the ones who push this technology forward,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Let\u2019s end with a note on the ethics of all this. Some of you may find it upsetting that a big company can just lift an innovation from a small company and run with it. If it\u2019s not illegal, isn\u2019t it at least something we should discourage?To which I say: Meh. There are lots of different kinds of innovation in the tech industry. Coming up with something first is not the only kind.There is a rich history in this industry of taking someone else\u2019s idea and adding your own spin on it to improve tech for everyone. Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs and the team behind the original Mac were inspired by a bunch of ideas floating around tech research circles, including at Xerox PARC. Then Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, saw the Mac\u2019s success and \u2014 by creating a new business model for the PC industry \u2014 he ushered in an even bigger deal: graphical computers that could get cheap enough for most people to own.Or look at the smartphone. Apple created the iPhone, but if the tech industry had stopped there, smartphones wouldn\u2019t have swept the world very quickly. Instead, Google more or less copied Apple\u2019s software ideas in early versions of Android, and Samsung essentially copied Apple\u2019s hardware. Economics kicked in, smartphones got really cheap, and they flooded the globe. And everyone did better: In time, Samsung hit on its own big idea \u2014 huge phones \u2014 that Apple copied, and Apple then made a bundle.So let\u2019s not get too hung up on copying. All\u2019s fair in love and rainbow vomit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Tries to Turn Its A.I. Ideas Into Dollars", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byTORONTO \u2014 Long before Google started working on cars that drive themselves and Amazon was creating home appliances that talk, a handful of researchers in Canada \u2014 backed by the Canadian government and universities \u2014 were laying the groundwork for today\u2019s boom in artificial intelligence.But the center of the commercial gold rush has been a long way away, in Silicon Valley. In recent years, many of Canada\u2019s young A.I. scientists, lured by lucrative paydays from Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies, have departed. Canada is producing a growing number of A.I start-ups, but they often head to California, where venture capital, business skills and optimism are abundant.Now bringing A.I. home is a priority for the Canadian government, companies, universities and technologists. The goal, they say, is to build a business environment around the country\u2019s expertise and to keep the experts its universities create in the country.There are encouraging signs, including new government funding, big company investments, programs to nurture start-ups, and the changing habits of homegrown entrepreneurs and American venture capitalists.Mr. Hinton, who was hired by Google in 2013 but remains a professor at the University of Toronto, will serve as its chief scientific adviser. The new institute will be in the Mars Discovery District, a cluster of buildings in downtown Toronto, run by a public-private partnership, that is home to many tech start-ups including A.I. companies..Major technology companies, like Google, Microsoft and IBM, are adding to their A.I. research teams in Canada. So are companies in other industries.Last year, General Motors said it was going to locate one of its research and engineering hubs for self-driving cars in the Toronto suburb of Markham. And Thomson Reuters announced it would open a center for \u201ccognitive computing\u201d in Toronto for research into new ways professionals will use information and technologies to assist decision making.Building businesses that use A.I. is an economic imperative for Canada. The Canadian tech industry has stalled in recent years. Nortel, Canada\u2019s big telecommunications equipment maker, declared bankruptcy in 2009, and was wound down over the next several years. And BlackBerry, once a leader, has faded in the smartphone market.The experience of two start-ups applying A.I. technology to drug discovery illustrate the challenges \u2014 and the opportunities \u2014 facing Canadian start-ups.When Mr. Heifets sought funding, he recalled, one potential Canadian investor said people had tried the same thing 20 years ago. \u201cWhat could possibly be new?\u201d Mr. Heifets said the investor had asked, and turned him down.Later, Mr. Heifets went to the Bay Area and met with Timothy Draper, founder of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Mr. Draper observed that he had invested in a couple of companies trying a similar approach 20 years ago. That didn\u2019t deter him from trying again.\u201cThat\u2019s a cultural issue, a different appetite for risk and willingness to accept failure,\u201d Mr. Heifets said.Atomwise moved to San Francisco to be close to its investors and the region\u2019s enormous talent pool.Brendan Frey, the chief executive, studied under Mr. Hinton at the University of Toronto, and he has spent years on research that combines deep-learning A.I. and cell biology. When he hires software engineers, he asks them to make multiyear commitments.\u201cThere are a lot of distractions in the Bay Area,\u201d said Mr. Frey, who is also a professor at the University of Toronto and a co-founder of the new Vector institute. \u201cThe hype is a little too hot down there. Besides, we have some of the best talent in the world here.\u201dIn 2015, the program tilted toward A.I. start-ups, with 25 companies admitted. Last year, 50 A.I. start-ups were admitted, and this year will likely have 75, Mr. Agrawal said.The program lasts nine months, with fall and spring terms, much like a school year. The participants gather every eight weeks in Toronto for two days to make presentations, listen to advice and set goals for the next eight weeks.At every gathering, at least one and sometimes several companies are voted out. The voters are a growing group of tech entrepreneurs and investors whom Mr. Agrawal has recruited.One of the X factors in Canada\u2019s drive to develop an A.I. industry is the Trump administration. Canadian A.I. scientists say they have received a stream of inquiries from researchers in the United States, concerned about the new administration\u2019s stance on immigration and other policies.Should there be a northward migration it wouldn\u2019t the first time. Mr. Hinton settled in Canada in 1987 in part because of America\u2019s clandestine support for the Contra guerrillas who sought to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.Mr. Hinton, who is from Britain, was at Carnegie Mellon University at the time, and he realized that continuing his research in America would have meant accepting funding from the Reagan administration. \u201cI preferred Canada,\u201d Mr. Hinton recalled.Mr. Sutton left the United States to become a professor at the University of Alberta in 2003, after American troops landed in Baghdad. \u201cGeorge Bush was invading Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good time to leave.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Market Surge Has Even Fans Looking for Feet of Clay", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byIn the past four weeks, exuberant investors have driven up the share price of Tesla, putting the upstart in the league of car companies that have been in the business for a century.But there are others who think Tesla, for all its potential, has become an overpriced investment \u2014 and something of a risky play in the near or medium term, given the challenges of turning battery-powered cars into mass-market products.Among the skeptics are some of Tesla\u2019s biggest fans.Take Dennis Pascual, a tech industry consultant in Long Beach, Calif., and owner of two Teslas \u2014 a Model S sedan and a two-seat Roadster, the first car Tesla put on the road. He is such a fan, in fact, that he has put down deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts once Tesla starts making the car later this year.He also owns some Tesla stock, but is not about to buy more.\u201cIt\u2019s a little pricey for me to jump back in,\u201d he said, speaking by phone from his Model S. \u201cRight now, I think we\u2019re in a hold.\u201dMoreover, he worries about Tesla\u2019s ability to carry out the bold expansion plans it has for this year and next. Tesla\u2019s high-profile chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the company expects to begin production this summer on its first mass-market offering, the Model 3, ramping up to 5,000 cars a month by the end of the year and driving output to several hundred thousand cars over the course of 2018.\u201cThey really need to deliver, and that has me concerned,\u201d Mr. Pascual said, who has worked at start-up companies and has years of experience in the technology business. \u201cI\u2019m bullish long term, but yes, I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m always worried about companies executing.\u201dTesla\u2019s market surge has been extraordinary. Since March 13, its shares are up 25 percent, in a period when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has declined slightly.Along the way, the market value of Tesla, which sold fewer than 80,000 cars last year and does not yet generate steady profits, has grown to $50 billion \u2014 roughly equal to that of General Motors, which sold more than 9.8 million vehicles worldwide and earned $9.4 billion. (On Tuesday, Tesla closed at $308.71, a decline of 1.2 percent, pushing it slightly below G.M. in market capitalization a day after surpassing it.)That Tesla and G.M. are comparably valued is \u201ctotally inexplicable,\u201d Michael J. Jackson, the chief executive of the dealership chain AutoNation, said on Tuesday at an auto-industry conference in New York. He added that Tesla \u201cis either one of the great Ponzi schemes of all time\u201d or will somehow work out for investors.The run-up was fueled in part by some encouraging signs that Tesla\u2019s Model 3 is proceeding on schedule. Early this year the company began production of batteries at its gigantic new plant in Nevada, known as the Gigafactory. Then it announced that Model 3 production would start in July, despite concerns among some analysts that the debut would be delayed until late this year.A smooth Model 3 rollout could propel Tesla to new heights. It has customer deposits of $1,000 for close to 400,000 orders of the new model, which is priced at $35,000, making it affordable to far more buyers than Tesla\u2019s existing models, which go for $90,000 with options.\u201cThe market seems to be thrilled,\u201d said David Whiston, an equity analyst at Morningstar. \u201cThe thinking seems to be that this could be the next Amazon or Apple, and people want to get in early.\u201dAdding to this enthusiasm seems to be a belief in Mr. Musk\u2019s vision of the future. He is trying to revolutionize the auto industry with Tesla, which has jumped ahead of traditional automakers in both battery-powered cars and self-driving technology. At the same time, he is promising to bring affordable renewable energy to homes with SolarCity, which merged with Tesla last year, and commercialize the heavens with SpaceX, a separate company he founded.Tesla, in Mr. Musk\u2019s view, is more than a carmaker. It is leading the shift to renewable energy \u2014 on the road and at home.While Mr. Musk\u2019s vision has captured the imagination of both car buyers and investors, the company\u2019s financial situation is less compelling. Tesla has reported losses in each of the past five years, and must invest heavily to achieve his goals. It had $3.4 billion in cash at the end of 2016, but some $7 billion in debt after the SolarCity acquisition. It has debt payments coming due in 2018, 2019 and 2021. Problems or delays in Model 3 production could make it harder to meet its obligations.\u201cRight now, nobody seems to care about balance-sheet risk,\u201d Mr. Whiston said. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t seem to be concerned about cash-flow risk. People are looking at the potential, and the old-fashioned analysis of fundamentals aren\u2019t seen as important.\u201dAnother question overshadowed by Tesla\u2019s stock surge is whether the company can make the big leap to making, shipping, selling and servicing a half a million cars a year \u2014 a fivefold increase in production of cars that are made out of thousands of parts and components.\u201cAll you need is a problem with one part to delay the Model 3,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book.Producing a half a million cars a year in one plant will not be easy even without such problems. Other car plants in the United States typically make only 200,000 to 300,000 vehicles a year.Pete Cordaro, the owner of a vending-machine company in Connellsville, Pa., drives a 2015 Model S and loves the car. Mr. Cordaro is such a fan, in fact, that he has put down deposits to buy two Model 3s once they are available.But the stock? He is not sold on it. He said he knew well from his own business how important a sound financial footing was.\u201cI think there\u2019s too much enthusiasm in the market like with any growth company,\u201d Mr. Cordaro said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bubble.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slack, an Upstart in Messaging, Now Faces Giant Tech Rivals", "Date": "2017-04-16", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Slack is the classic Silicon Valley accidental success. Born three years ago, with roots in a failed video game, the messaging software is now used by five million people.The company behind it, Slack Technologies, found success by combining something that Silicon Valley fetishizes \u2014 rich data on how people use a product \u2014 with something it often overlooks: How do people actually feel while using it?This combination produced an unlikely hit that, when it became available in 2014, grew mostly by word of mouth, which is unusual for corporate software. Last year, the privately held company was valued at nearly $4 billion.Now Slack faces a significant new challenge. It has become big enough to draw a competitive response from giants like Microsoft, but not big enough to have the roster of large corporate clients it needs to compete with the giants.As a result, Slack, which built up momentum as a lovable underdog, must fend off some of technology\u2019s largest and fiercest competitors if it wants to be more than a niche tool for small businesses and teams.Microsoft, for instance, already offers ways for employees to collaborate. And while its offerings have not been viral hits, they have offered boring but important features that big companies demand, like strong data security and regulatory compliance controls.There is no illusion within Slack that success is certain. But Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive, said small tech companies with new ideas had long defeated larger rivals that tried to copy them. Think of Apple\u2019s beating IBM in personal computing, Google\u2019s beating Microsoft in search and Facebook\u2019s crushing Google in social networks.One advantage Slack does have is focus, Mr. Butterfield maintains. Microsoft, for example, has numerous Slack-like products including Yammer, SharePoint, Skype for Business and now Teams. The executives who run those businesses within Microsoft must \u201ccompete for budget and mind share and attention,\u201d he said, providing an opening for Slack to gain users while Microsoft managers wage internal wars.Microsoft said users would embrace Teams because it had strong encryption and global support and worked seamlessly with software they already used, like Excel. \u201cWe think customers value coherence,\u201d said Bryan Goode, the general manager of Office 365 at Microsoft.Slack is the product of Mr. Butterfield\u2019s second failed attempt to make a video game. His first, called Game Neverending, had a photo-sharing feature that became more popular than the game. It became Flickr, which was sold to Yahoo for $25 million in 2005.In 2011, he introduced another game, Glitch, in which people cooperated to build a shared world. (Misbehaving players got a timeout.) At its height, the game was costing the company $500,000 a month and bringing in $30,000, so Mr. Butterfield shuttered it in late 2012. A few employees stayed on to build out the messaging platform that Glitch engineers had used to talk among themselves. That project became Slack.Slack was officially introduced in February 2014 and today has five million daily users, up from four million in October. Most users are on a free version, but about 1.5 million pay Slack $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search. The 800-person company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable.Initially popular with small teams of software engineers who wanted to work remotely without cumbersome videoconferences or email, Slack was not designed for big companies. Users chat in \u201cchannels,\u201d typically organized around a few well-defined tasks.\u201cThe overhead of working among different offices becomes less of an issue\u201d with Slack, said Nick Coronges, chief technology officer at R/GA, a 2,000-person design and marketing agency with offices in several cities.But Slack has focused on making a product that people love, a strategy that is more common among consumer companies like Apple, Snap and Spotify.Slack modeled itself after consumer messaging apps that let users communicate with GIFs, stickers and emojis. One Slack emoji is a cartoon raccoon with its palms pressed in respectful greeting. Called \u201craccooning,\u201d it signifies, \u201cPlease take this conversation someplace else. You are getting off topic.\u201dIn Slack\u2019s office in Vancouver, British Columbia, designers think about things like color choice, layout and Slack\u2019s sign-in greeting, and how they might affect a customer\u2019s peace of mind. Back at San Francisco headquarters, data jockeys pore over the kinds of signals that tech companies normally study, like time spent with the product and whether moving a button elicits a change in behavior.Unlike some Silicon Valley companies, Slack believes humans are as important as robots. All executives, including Mr. Butterfield, have fielded the 6,000 customer support calls and 2,800 Twitter messages that come in each week. The average turnaround time for a help request is under an hour.\u201cI get worried if I see customer satisfaction scores dip below 97 percent,\u201d said Ali Rayl, Slack\u2019s head of customer experience.If Slack can dovetail seamlessly with how people behave, feel like second nature to use and strongly appeal to employees, taking it away could become \u201clike taking off your astronaut helmet in space,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said.When it began, Slack had fewer features than its rivals had, but that wasn\u2019t seen as a problem at first. Tens of thousands of small teams were creating accounts, some even paying for them, without much prompting. Smaller customers still account for more than 50 percent of Slack\u2019s revenue.But Slack knew it would always be a niche product without basic features like \u201cthreading,\u201d a standard email and chat room feature that groups together replies to a message, and an easier sign-in process. Originally each team required its own sign-in, even if an employee worked on many teams in the same organization.As competition heated up, Slack started to elicit feedback from companies like Capital One. The bank\u2019s teams wanted to log in at one place and get access to all of their Slack rooms. They wanted each channel to allow more people, and they wanted to customize features, like file sharing, to comply with regulations.Slack made those changes, and employees \u201clatched on,\u201d said Jennifer Manry, vice president for work force technology at Capital One, \u201can indication that it was filling a critical need.\u201dAt the end of January, Mr. Butterfield unveiled Enterprise Grid. Aimed at companies and governments, it can manage the conversations of up to 500,000 employees at once. IBM, Jet.com, NASA and Home Depot have all used the product.But Slack has not taken over. Capital One still uses collaboration tools from Microsoft and Atlassian. Facebook and smaller companies like Asana share customers with Slack, too. Microsoft Teams is available in 181 markets around the world in 19 languages. Slack is available only in English, wherever the app is available for download.The battle between Slack and its competitors is essentially a fight over who will make the next piece of workplace software that no one can live without. Many businesses, large and small, depend on Excel from Microsoft, Photoshop from Adobe and Gmail from Google.Slack wants to be in that pantheon \u2014 as the place where people collaborate and hang out online, the world\u2019s virtual conference room and water cooler.Slack\u2019s name \u2014 an acronym for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge \u2014 underscores its big ambition. But to become a Microsoft-size success it needs workers to choose Slack over its competitors.\u201cCompanies want their employees to collaborate more, because better collaboration reduces the need to jump ship,\u201d said Sean Ryan, the head of partnerships at Facebook\u2019s Workplace. \u201cThe No. 1 reason people leave their jobs is they feel isolated.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build empathy at scale,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said. Slack\u2019s office walls are covered with customer feedback, and soothing French pop music is piped into the restrooms. Company engineers say being a good designer is like being a good host, and they use shorthand like \u201cset out the towels\u201d as they create new user features.\u201cI\u2019ve been building software for 15 years, and I\u2019ve become more attuned to how the average person will interact with and experience software in the last 18 months here than in the prior 13 years,\u201d said April Underwood, who joined Slack as vice president of product in 2015.Whether this approach translates into profits for Slack depends largely on how fast the company can expand into more countries and whether employees at big companies push their information technology departments to pay for it. That would necessitate an unusual level of devotion to a piece of workplace software, which is why Slack says it is so devoted to its users\u2019 well-being.\u201cThere are people who will die, get divorced, have children with cancer,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said. \u201cYou really have to put yourself in their frames of mind. If we preoccupy these people for a minute longer than we have to, we\u2019ll lose them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article contained several errors. Users pay Slack $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search, not $8 to $12.50. The company has 800 employees, not 750. And Slack is available in English wherever it can be downloaded, not only in the United States and Britain.An article last Monday about Slack Technologies and the competition it faces from larger companies misstated the number of employees at R/GA, whose chief technology officer commented on the use of Slack\u2019s software. It is 2,000, not 1,000.Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deal by Chinese Tech Company LeEco for Vizio Dies", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 An ambitious Chinese technology giant with a French-sounding name burst into the United States last year with dreams of disruption.LeEco\u2019s vision was certainly grand. As a holding company with a stake in the publicly traded Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corporation, LeEco was once just one of a number of Chinese online video streaming companies. But its founder, Jia Yueting, invested in a dizzying array of new business lines \u2014 movie production, smart TVs and phones, sports broadcasting and goods, electric cars and car sharing, cloud computing and online finance.The conglomerate embarked on a string of debt-financed acquisitions, including stakes in the Chinese electronics companies Coolpad Group and TCL Multimedia. LeEco also acquired the car sharing start-up Yidao Yongche.Mr. Jia adopted a high profile. He publicly pledged to take on Apple and Tesla and began wearing black hoodies and black long-sleeve shirts like the tech icons of Silicon Valley, adopting just the initials YT in contacts with his employees. Regarding Apple, last year he said the iPhone maker\u2019s pace of innovation had become \u201cextremely slow.\u201dThe year before that, Mr. Jia posted an image to one of his social media accounts comparing Apple to Hitler, though he later apologized.LeEco \u2014 a name that links its Chinese name Le with the word ecology, representing Mr. Jia\u2019s dream for a range of interconnected gadgets and services \u2014 also began looking abroad.Those dreams sent the shares of Leshi Internet soaring in 2015, and made Mr. Jia one of China\u2019s richest men on paper, according to the Hurun Report, which tracks the country\u2019s wealthy.But the pace of deals began to take a toll. A rising group of Chinese companies, including the longtime telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies, ramped up competition in smartphones, while LeEco faced well-funded rivals in areas like video streaming.\u201cThey think China\u2019s companies are copycats, plagiarists, incapable of big innovation,\u201d he told the audience in Beijing, according to a publicly filed transcript of the event, acknowledging that further debt financing would be harder to come by. \u201cOn the contrary, this is a country with heroic companies.\u201dIn the first nine months of 2016, the conglomerate\u2019s mobile affiliate alone posted an $820 million loss on $1.6 billion of revenue, according to investor materials seen by The New York Times.Other businesses face challenges: Electric cars are years away from mass production, and the smartphone market remains intensely competitive.LeEco\u2019s own suppliers have grown antsy. On Monday in Beijing, a dozen people who said they worked for unpaid suppliers held a sit-in in the lobby of LeEco\u2019s office tower. They were escorted into the company\u2019s offices before they could be interviewed.In January, workers from Tianjin Hong Furui Electronics, a company LeEco contracted for after-sales cellphone repairs, sat on a patch of grass in front of LeEco\u2019s office tower to protest.\u201cThey delayed our payments four or five months,\u201d said Jacky Yu, an employee in Hong Furui\u2019s sales department, adding that the bill totaled roughly $850,000 to $1 million.By March, the company had been paid and declined to comment further.The LeEco spokeswoman said the company had already solved some payment problems and was working on others.\u201cLeEco\u2019s earlier financial problems have already been systematically resolved,\u201d she said in the emailed statement. \u201cPrevious supplier problems are being resolved through multifaceted and innovative methods.\u201dYufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vanguard Is Growing Faster Than Everybody Else Combined", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byMALVERN, Pa. \u2014 The Vanguard trading floor is the epicenter of one of the great financial revolutions of modern times, yet it is a surprisingly relaxed place.A few men and women gaze at Bloomberg terminals. There is a muted television or two and a view of verdant suburban Philadelphia. No one is barking orders to buy or sell stock. For a $4.2 trillion mutual fund giant that is still growing rapidly, it occupies a small fraction of the space of a typical Wall Street trading hub.You can barely hear the quiet hum of money being invested \u2014 money in scarcely imaginable quantities, pouring into low-cost index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (E.T.F.s) that track financial markets.In the last three calendar years, investors sank $823 billion into Vanguard funds, the company says. The scale of that inflow becomes clear when it is compared with the rest of the mutual fund industry \u2014 more than 4,000 firms in total. All of them combined took in just a net $97 billion during that period, Morningstar data shows. Vanguard, in other words, scooped up about 8.5 times as much money as all of its competitors.\u201cFlows of this magnitude into one company are unprecedented,\u201d said Alina Lamy, an expert on fund flows at Morningstar. \u201cSince the crisis, investors have been saying, \u2018I may not be able to control the market, but I can control how much I pay in mutual fund expenses.\u2019 And when they look for quality funds with low fees, the first answer is Vanguard.\u201dThe triumph of index fund investing means Vanguard\u2019s traders funnel as much as $2 billion a day into stocks like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, as well as thousands of smaller companies that the firm\u2019s fleet of funds track. That is 20 times the amount that Vanguard was investing on a daily basis in 2009. It is manageable, in large part, because no stock-picking is involved: The money simply flows into index funds and E.T.F.s, and through February of this year, nine out of every 10 dollars invested in a United States mutual fund or E.T.F. was absorbed by Vanguard.By any measure, these are staggering figures. Vanguard\u2019s assets under management have skyrocketed to $4.2 trillion from $1 trillion seven years ago, according to the company. About $3 trillion of this is invested in passive index-based strategies, with the rest in funds that rely on an active approach to picking stocks and bonds.More broadly, this deluge of money abandoning higher-price actively managed funds for Vanguard\u2019s plain vanilla cut-rate vehicles has come as an existential shock to a mutual industry that has long been resistant to change.The effect within Vanguard has been no less profound. For decades, the firm has made the case that cheaper index funds will, over time, outperform more-expensive mutual funds that rely on brainy portfolio managers to pick stocks.Unlike its peers, Vanguard is owned by its funds \u2014 and ultimately its investors \u2014 so as money rushes in, expenses are persistently reduced, resulting in perpetual savings for the legions of Vanguard clients. They number well over 20 million and include New York Times employees: Vanguard runs the company\u2019s 401(k) retirement plans.The model has been a powerful one: Since 1976, fees on Vanguard funds have fallen to about 0.12 percent from about 0.70 percent. By comparison, Lipper calculates that the average fee for all mutual funds is currently 1 percent, although it has been coming down rapidly.\u201cMr. Bogle used to say, \u2018This is not our money,\u2019 and I agree,\u201d said F. William McNabb III, Vanguard\u2019s chief executive, referring to the extraordinary inflows. \u201cFor many years, there has been a real move to our way of investing. And it\u2019s more than active versus passive \u2014 it\u2019s high cost versus low cost.\u201dThis no-frills approach has come under some strain as cash flowing into Vanguard funds reaches new highs year after year, some people who follow Vanguard closely say. There have been reports of operational snarls, including website outages, longer-than-usual wait times on the phone and misdirected fund transfers.There is no doubt about Vanguard\u2019s commitment to pinching pennies. In touring the 287-acre campus of pathways, low-slung buildings and a commanding statue of Mr. Bogle, the sensibility is decidedly puritan.There are few flashy cars to be found in the parking lots. The walls are largely devoid of eye-catching art \u2014 with the exception of some musty paintings of the HMS Vanguard, a Napoleonic-era British warship that inspired the company\u2019s name.In sum, the look is slightly drab, certainly by Wall Street standards: rows of uniform cubicles, colorless carpets and an executive boardroom that seems more appropriate for a community college than one of the largest financial institutions in the land.Vanguard executives say they are disciplined in terms of plowing money back into people and technology, but not overly so. \u201cOur true investment spending has doubled in the past five years,\u201d Mr. McNabb said.This tension between breakneck growth and spending restraint is most acutely felt in the firm\u2019s retail division \u2014 or the front lines, as they are referred to here \u2014 where 6,000 customer service representatives attend to the wishes, demands and whims of the close to eight million clients who purchase their mutual funds directly from Vanguard. In 2015 and 2016, this division added 350,000 new accounts each year, numbers never before seen at the firm.\u201cThe spotlight is on us, given the growth, and there have been operational challenges,\u201d said Karin A. Risi, who oversees Vanguard\u2019s retail investor group and is in the midst of an aggressive hiring push. \u201cBut it is not fair to say we are not investing. Bringing in 2,000 crew on a base of 6,000 is not insignificant.\u201dAs with many executives at Vanguard, Ms. Risi gets a glint in her eye when she talks of the virtues of investing in low-cost index funds. Like the majority of her peers, she has spent the bulk of her career at the firm and, as a certified culture carrier, it is clear that she is taking the current growing pains to heart.\u201cMy parents were Vanguard investors, and I was investing in Vanguard funds in high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I feel the burden of this responsibility. We are serving a mission here.\u201dBeyond their devotion to indexing, Vanguard employees talk as if they are working on a frigate, a nod to the nautical images and themes embraced by Mr. Bogle at the company\u2019s founding.Employees are called crew, one eats at the galley (not the cafeteria) and works out in the \u201cship shape\u201d room, and new workers come onboard as opposed to being hired.\u201cYou absorb the culture and you join the cause,\u201d said Joseph Brennan, who, as head of global equity indexing, has had a front-row seat as the firm has expanded. His division embodies Vanguard\u2019s credo of do more with less: The 45 people he oversees globally look after $2 trillion in assets.\u201cOur assets per head are incredible,\u201d he said. At $44 billion per person, that certainly qualifies as an understatement.Already, six out of the 10 largest mutual funds by asset size belong to Vanguard, with the largest, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, now weighing in at $465 billion, according to Morningstar. Only two \u2014 American Funds\u2019 Growth Fund of America and its EuroPacific Growth Fund, both belonging to the Capital Group \u2014 are actively managed, promising higher returns for a steeper fee.An article in the Mutual Fund Quarterly last Sunday about the growth in inflows to the index fund giant Vanguard misspelled the given name of the executive who oversees its retail investor group. She is Karin A. Risi, not Karen. (The error was repeated in a picture caption.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Faces Inquiry in China Over App Store Content", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese authorities plan to question Apple about video streaming services available over its app store within the country, in their latest move to intensify pressure on the American technology giant over the content it provides in the vast and crucial market.The inquiry appears to focus on third-party apps available on the company\u2019s app store in China. The report said the authorities had told three Chinese websites to tighten their oversight of online information, livestreaming services and online performance. Some broadcasters, it said, offered live content forbidden by Chinese law, including pornography.The authorities had already met with Apple representatives about livestreaming apps available on its app store in China, Xinhua said, without disclosing details.An Apple spokesman in China declined to comment.The report comes as Chinese authorities put pressure on Apple over the apps and other content it offers its users in China, which in the fiscal quarter that ended Dec. 31 accounted for about one-fifth of its revenue.The moves are part of a broader Chinese effort to regulate internet content. With services like Google, Facebook and Twitter long blocked in China, Apple is a rare foreign-owned company that provides a significant amount of apps and other content through platforms it controls.More recently, Chinese authorities have also ordered app stores in China to register with the government. Because Google\u2019s app store is among that company\u2019s services that are blocked in the country, a considerable number of locally owned third-party app stores have popped up to serve phones running Google\u2019s Android mobile-operating system. That has complicated China\u2019s efforts to control the country\u2019s fast-growing mobile internet business.The Xinhua report on Wednesday said that Apple had been approached by the Beijing offices of three Chinese agencies. They included the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top online regulator, as well as public security officials and a cultural law enforcement group.The report said three Chinese websites \u2014 toutiao.com, huoshanzhibo.com and huajiao.com \u2014 had violated regulations concerning internet information services. Some potential violations, it said, would be referred to the police.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Sees Augmented Reality Ecosystem in Facebook", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported bySAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has long rued the day that Apple and Google beat him to building smartphones, which now underpin many people\u2019s digital lives. Ever since, he has searched for the next frontier of modern computing and how to be a part of it from the start.Now, Mr. Zuckerberg is betting he has found it: the real world.On Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg introduced what he positioned as the first mainstream augmented reality platform, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras.But in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s telling, there are few boundaries for how this technology will evolve. He said he envisioned a world in which people could eventually point smartphone cameras at a bowl of cereal and have an app create tiny sharks swimming in the milk. Friends can leave virtual notes for one another on the walls outside their favorite restaurants, noting which menu item is the most delicious.\u201cThink about how many of the things around us don\u2019t actually need to be physical,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in an interview last week. \u201cInstead of a $500 TV sitting in front of us, what\u2019s to keep us from one day having it be a $1 app?\u201dFacebook does not expect to build all of these software experiences itself. At its annual developer conference on Tuesday, it called for computer programmers to help by building augmented-reality-based apps to work with what Facebook calls its Camera Effects Platform. Facebook announced new tools to aid developers and will begin the initiative with a small number of partners in a closed test.Still, Mr. Zuckerberg said he intended to create the next major app ecosystem that would work with Facebook\u2019s in-app camera. If successful, Facebook could be in a position similar to that of Apple, which relies on the hundreds of millions of apps in its store to keep users buying the company\u2019s smartphones and tablets every year. Facebook, in turn, wants developers to build experiences that entice people to visit its website and apps on a daily \u2014 if not hourly \u2014 basis.\u201cJust like Apple built the iPod and iTunes ecosystem before the iPhone, you want to make sure there\u2019s a set of content there, even if there\u2019s not everything,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Facebook has been building toward this goal for some time. Mr. Zuckerberg has spent the last 18 months reorganizing his company and its suite of consumer apps \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 around a new interface, focused almost entirely on the camera. Slowly, the company has played down the role of text inside its apps, instead encouraging people to take and send photos and videos to one another by using the in-app camera features.In time, Facebook hopes that companies like Electronic Arts, Nike and Warner Brothers \u2014 which are part of the initial set of partners \u2014 will be the ones to bring immersive augmented reality experiences to Facebook\u2019s platform.One early partner app is Giphy Thoughts, made by Giphy, a start-up that acts as a search engine for animated GIFs, which play as something like short-form videos. With Giphy Thoughts, for instance, people can place cartoon thought bubbles above the heads of others they view through their Facebook camera lens.\u201cIt goes back to creative expression,\u201d said David Rosenberg, director of business development at Giphy. \u201cFacebook Camera is just going to be this massive audience of people ready to make deeply personal content they can share with their friends.\u201dWhether Facebook can make it worth the time of more developers to create such apps remains a question.\u201cSoftware developers might ask, why would I create something for Facebook\u2019s platform that I am presumably giving away for free?\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst for Jackdaw Research, an industry analysis firm. \u201cAnd then when competitors introduce A.R. offerings, will I have to create it for Facebook and then a different lens for Snapchat? Or do I wait for Apple and Google to release their A.R. platforms?\u201dThen came Facebook\u2019s most aggressive move, the acquisition of Oculus in 2014. Facebook is investing hundreds of millions of dollars more in V.R. content and apps in the hopes that it will mature into a full-fledged ecosystem similar to Apple\u2019s App Store, but sales of the Oculus Rift goggles have been slow.\u201cThey are shaking things up there but haven\u2019t quite found their stride,\u201d said Stephanie Llamas, head of virtual reality and augmented reality strategy at SuperData Research, a game industry research firm.Mr. Zuckerberg has said the efforts with Oculus will take longer than he and his team initially believed, and probably billions of dollars more in investment. But in the interview last week, he said some of the technology acquired in the Oculus purchase had helped produce the seeds of the new augmented reality platform.Another dark horse is Magic Leap, the secretive augmented reality start-up that has an enormous investment from Google and Alibaba and is working on hardware to offer a similar experience. The company has yet to unveil an official product.For the near term, however, Mr. Zuckerberg sees the smartphone camera as the first step forward.\u201cWe want to get to this world in the future where you eventually have glasses or contact lenses where you can mix digital or physical objects in the digital world,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The C.E.O. of H.I.V.", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "FeatureMichael Weinstein\u2019s AIDS Healthcare Foundation treats an enormous number of patients \u2014 and makes an enormous amount of money. Is that why so many activists distrust him?Supported byThe question was met with an awkward silence. Most AIDS organizations do accept grants from pharmaceutical companies \u2014 in some cases large ones. It is widely seen as a symbiotic relationship. AIDS nonprofits depend on funding from drug companies; drug companies depend on the organizations to educate patients about their wares. That arrangement rankled Sanders, who views the pharmaceutical industry as a public menace. In the primary, one of his signature issues was support for California\u2019s Proposition 61, a referendum that sought to control drug prices by barring public insurers from paying any more than the prices charged to the Veterans Health Administration, which traditionally gets a big discount. A few of the AIDS activists gathered in San Bernardino \u2014 along with a number of experts and patient groups \u2014 had strong reservations about the unintended consequences of that initiative. Some worried it would drain R.&D. budgets; others feared it would prod drug companies to jack up prices on veterans. Sanders did not share their reservations about Prop. 61. \u201cDrug companies are ripping off the American people in a big way,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are bad-news people, and they need to be taken on.\u201dThe next day, the Sanders campaign circulated a news release about the meeting, which, to Staley\u2019s shock, focused entirely on Sanders\u2019s support for Prop. 61, and, in Staley\u2019s view, gave the misleading impression that everyone present joined Sanders in endorsing the referendum. After Staley took to Facebook to dispute the account \u2014 \u201cFeeling used and abused by the Sanders campaign right now,\u201d he wrote to 12,000 followers \u2014 the Sanders campaign\u2019s policy director, Warren Gunnels, attacked Staley personally on Twitter. Using scare quotes to insinuate that Staley, who once chained himself to a balcony of the New York Stock Exchange to protest high drug prices, didn\u2019t really deserve to be called an \u201cactivist,\u201d Gunnels claimed that Staley had \u201cmade a fortune from big drug companies.\u201d As evidence, Gunnels linked to a post on a website called Stop Pharma Greed that was teeming with opposition research on some of the biggest names in AIDS activism. The post accused Staley of \u201cshilling for big Pharma\u201d and taking funding from companies like DuPont Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead Sciences. \u201cIn short,\u201d the post concluded, \u201cStaley\u2019s livelihood since the year 2000 ... appears to have been wholly dependent on, or funded directly by, the drug industry.\u201d Staley called the accusation a \u201cTrumpian lie,\u201d noting that he has lived entirely on savings for the last five years. (The tweet was later deleted.)The activists hadn\u2019t known what to make of Sanders\u2019s frostiness, but as soon as they saw Gunnels\u2019s tweet, the fog lifted. Staley believed that someone had goaded the Sanders campaign into going nuclear on him, and he had no doubt about who that someone was. Stop Pharma Greed was funded by Staley\u2019s longtime nemesis, Michael Weinstein, the 64-year-old founder and director of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the world\u2019s largest and most controversial AIDS organization. (The Sanders campaign denied Staley\u2019s claim.) Weinstein was also the financier behind Prop. 61, which would go on to become the most expensive referendum of 2016, thanks to the pharmaceutical industry, which spent $120 million on the campaign, and eventually defeated it with 53 percent of the vote. More money was spent against Prop. 61 than was spent on behalf of any candidate for governor or Senate in 2016.Directors of health care nonprofits are traditionally cautious and courtly, fearful of choking the funding streams that issue from nit-picking grant committees and image-conscious donors. Weinstein, an ex-Trotskyite, is no courtier. He runs his organization as a \u201csocial enterprise,\u201d meaning that it generates most of its revenue not from grants and fund-raising but from adjacent businesses. A.H.F.\u2019s main business is a network of pharmacies and clinics that provide primary care to more than 41,000 patients in the United States, most of whom have their insurance claims paid by government insurance programs like Medicaid. The excess income from these patients helps the AIDS Healthcare Foundation provide free care to more than 700,000 H.I.V. patients internationally \u2014 the greatest reach of any AIDS organization. This prodigiously successful model has both insulated A.H.F. from typical funding woes and helped it to expand at an astonishing clip. Over the last six years, A.H.F.\u2019s budget has grown from $300 million to more than $1.4 billion, about the size of Planned Parenthood. If their projections hold, it will reach $2 billion by 2020, giving A.H.F. \u2014 a private entity effectively under the control of one man \u2014 a budget nearly half the size of the World Health Organization\u2019s.Paradoxically, that projected growth depends in part on whether drug costs remain high. While cutting drug prices is an ideological objective for Weinstein, his pharmacies stand to lose revenue should he succeed in that mission. \u201cMost of the time when people benefit from something, they don\u2019t lobby against it,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cBut we\u2019re Robin Hood. If someone was writing an epitaph for this organization some day, it will be: \u2018Bit the hand that fed it.\u2019\u2009\u201dA.H.F.\u2019s rapid ascent has made Weinstein an object of scorn among his peers, who deplore not only his tactics but also his unorthodox positions on public-health issues. Unlike nearly all other AIDS activists and public-health researchers, Weinstein opposes PrEP, the H.I.V.-prevention pill, which he believes will cause a \u201cpublic-health catastrophe\u201d by triggering a dangerous increase in risky sex. He has also campaigned to make condoms mandatory in adult films, even going so far as to introduce a statewide referendum in California, Proposition 60. Weinstein\u2019s positions have been assailed by peers as counterproductive fearmongering. \u201cIt reminds me very much of the Tea Party people with regard to Obamacare,\u201d Ernest Hopkins, director of legislative affairs for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, told me in 2013, referring to Weinstein\u2019s opposition to PrEP. \u201cIf you\u2019re prepared to say whatever you want and lie and demagogue and misrepresent the facts, then you can get a lot of airtime, and you can also persuade a lot of people.\u201dTo his many critics in AIDS activism, Weinstein is the Koch brothers of public health: a mastermind driven by ideology, accountable to no one, with bottomless funds and an agenda marked by financial opportunism and puritanical extremes. It doesn\u2019t help that A.H.F. has been the subject of near-constant litigation and complaints for questionable business practices, including union-busting, giving kickbacks to patients, overbilling government insurers and bullying funders into denying grants to institutional rivals. (A.H.F. has denied these accusations.)To his faithful, however, Weinstein is not only a provider of superior health care but also an evangelist of moral urgency at a time when prevention efforts are floundering and drug prices are surging. Weinstein seems to view himself in loftier terms, as a holy warrior sent to save the innocent, not only from the scourge of H.I.V. but also from those he views as the virus\u2019s human collaborators: a satanic trifecta of greedy executives, vainglorious activists and incompetent bureaucrats.The first time I visited, in February of last year, Weinstein invited me to sit down without shaking my hand. A lean man with a long forehead, bird-of-prey features and a nerdy, pocket-protector vibe, Weinstein had a formal demeanor but was wearing jeans and a hoodie \u2014 a common outfit for a tech leader but unusual for a health care magnate. Weinstein took me on an abbreviated tour, proudly showing off photos he had taken with celebrities and political figures \u2014 Magic Johnson, Alicia Keys, former Senator Tom Harkin. Above his desk hung an Expressionist portrait of his best friend, with whom he founded A.H.F., Chris Brownlie. By all accounts, Brownlie was the softhearted yin to Weinstein\u2019s gladiatorial yang, as charming and consensus-seeking as Weinstein was splenetic and introverted. Brownlie died from AIDS-related complications in 1989.Weinstein has a long history of militancy. Born in Brooklyn\u2019s Bensonhurst neighborhood to a family of left-wing Jews, at age 13 he volunteered for an antiwar congressional candidate and worked as an equipment mule for his filmmaker sister, toting around a 40-pound battery while she shot footage of protesters burning draft cards in Central Park. The next year, he joined a group of activists occupying a new high-rise development to protest what was not yet known as gentrification. Though he realized he was gay early on, he repressed his sexuality for many years, eventually moving in with an older girlfriend. At age 18, he had his first gay encounter with an upstairs neighbor, also officially straight, who knocked on his door one night when both of their girlfriends were out of town.In 1972, when Weinstein was 19, he traveled to California and joined Los Angeles\u2019s gay activism scene. An outsider among both mainstream gays (for being a Marxist) and Marxists (for being gay), Weinstein decided to start his own group, which he called the Lavender and Red Union. The group eventually merged with a gay-friendly Trotskyite organization in New York called the Spartacist League, which offered Weinstein a leadership position, requiring him to move back to the East Coast. He wasn\u2019t at his new post for long, though, before he fell out with his comrades over an unusual matter: the Roman Polanski sexual-abuse case, in which the director was accused of drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. \u201cThey felt that it was not rape, that the girl knew what she was doing,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s boyfriend at the time, Albert Ruiz, told me. Weinstein believed it was rape and felt strongly enough about the matter, among other disputes, that he resigned.Disillusioned with activism, Weinstein briefly ran a candy business in Los Angeles before returning to politics to face an unlikely antagonist. In 1986, the right-wing conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche introduced a ballot referendum in California that would have enabled employers to fire people with AIDS and empowered the government to quarantine them. Early polling suggested that LaRouche\u2019s initiative had broad support. Along with Brownlie and other friends, Weinstein started his own group to fight LaRouche\u2019s proposition. In a move that anticipated his later shock-marketing campaigns, Weinstein distributed leaflets with the headline \u201cSTOP AIDS CONCENTRATION CAMPS\u201d and organized a torch-lit march on LaRouche\u2019s Silver Lake office. Mainstream gay activists abhorred Weinstein\u2019s strong-arm tactics, fearing he might alienate suburban voters. But after the measure lost in a landslide, with 71 percent opposed, L.A. Weekly named Weinstein \u201cBest Young Activist.\u201d Weinstein determined that there was far greater support for his militant approach than he had realized.As the AIDS crisis intensified, Weinstein watched more and more of his friends grow ill and die. Los Angeles County hospital had barely developed procedures for handling dying AIDS patients, and many were left to expire alone on gurneys in crowded hallways. Doctors and nurses would often refuse to care for AIDS sufferers, and when the untreated patients died, undertakers often turned them away, too. In some parts of the country, the deceased ended up in garbage bags delivered directly to crematories. Weinstein wanted to ensure that AIDS patients could die in a respectful, peaceful atmosphere. In 1989, he and Brownlie founded the precursor of A.H.F. \u2014 the AIDS Hospice Foundation. In 1990, as more AIDS medications became available, Weinstein changed the group\u2019s name to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and shifted its focus to medical care for the living. In the late \u201990s, little by little, A.H.F. expanded from Southern California into Florida and New York. Then, in 2000, A.H.F. made a change that would prove crucial to its business model: It opened its first pharmacy.Pharmacy services are, in Weinstein\u2019s words, A.H.F.\u2019s \u201cjet fuel.\u201d That\u2019s because 70 percent of spending on H.I.V. care consists of drug costs. While H.I.V. patients in the United States skew poor, the costly insurance claims they generate by filling prescriptions make them gold mines, not only for pharmaceutical companies but also for certain pharmacies, like Weinstein\u2019s, that take advantage of a federal program called 340B. Passed in 1991, 340B allows pharmacies attached to medical practices serving underprivileged populations to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at, on average, a 35 percent discount but still be reimbursed by insurers for 100 percent of the wholesale price. In effect, 340B allows pharmacies to keep around 35 percent of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s tab, a roundabout way of subsidizing health care for the poor. As the price of AIDS medications has spiraled upward in recent years, A.H.F.\u2019s coffers have swelled. The cost of the latest first-line H.I.V. treatment \u2014 a combination pill from Gilead called Genvoya \u2014 is about $34,000 per patient per year. When a patient uses an A.H.F. pharmacy, about $22,000 of that bill goes to Gilead, and $12,000 goes to A.H.F. The foundation\u2019s pharmacies serve 50,000 patients in the United States, generating approximately $1 billion each year in revenue \u2014 about $200 million of it surplus. That money subsidizes A.H.F.\u2019s expansion and advocacy as well as the group\u2019s political activities.The pool of potential patients for an organization like A.H.F. is oceanic. In 2014, 37,600 Americans were newly infected with H.I.V. That number has declined only slightly over the last decade, as America\u2019s epidemic has settled into a baleful equilibrium of slow growth and rising costs. The lack of progress is especially disheartening considering that H.I.V. medications, when properly administered, render patients almost totally noninfectious. These medications aren\u2019t new \u2014 they\u2019ve existed for two decades. If every infected American took them, our epidemic would be over. Instead, of the roughly 1.2 million Americans with H.I.V., only 40 percent are on medication, a rate lower than South Africa\u2019s. Weinstein believes that America\u2019s AIDS nonprofits, which he refers to derisively as \u201cAIDS Inc.\u201d \u2014 a label meant to evoke sclerotic incumbents who collect renewable grants and stand only for their own perpetuation \u2014 have been useless in the face of the epidemic. To win, he thinks, \u201cAIDS Inc.\u201d has to be sidelined so that A.H.F. can lead the way.To recruit new patients, sales reps are expected to hold several events each month, most of them in high-risk zones. Events vary by location. On Los Angeles\u2019s Skid Row, for example, reps hand out McDonald\u2019s gift cards to anyone willing to take a rapid H.I.V. test. In South Central, the reps sometimes set up a game called Cash Box, in which contestants who agree to a rapid test enter a plexiglass booth where they try to grab cash as it is blown around at high speeds. In gay neighborhoods, reps may invite passers-by to play Dildo Toss \u2014 a carny-inspired game in which players hurl phalluses of varying colors and sizes into a hole carved out of a plank of wood. \u201cWe give them three chances,\u201d explained Edwin Millan, director of sales for the Western United States, \u201cand if it goes in the hole, they get to spin a wheel and they get a prize.\u201d (In 2015, two former employees filed a whistle-blower suit arguing that A.H.F.\u2019s patient incentives amounted to illegal kickbacks; the lawsuit has not yet reached a resolution, and A.H.F. denies the claims.) In addition to seeking out patients directly, sales reps also cultivate referral sources by hosting lunches for area doctors.The retreat\u2019s kickoff dinner was held in the French Quarter, at Deanie\u2019s Seafood. Tucked away in a back room, the gregarious sales reps kibitzed noisily, slurping crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e as Weinstein, seated at the head of a long table, examined his battalion. Like other divisions at A.H.F., this group was anchored by black women in floral prints and gay men of all races in checkered shirts; many were new hires Weinstein was meeting for the first time. \u201cSometimes I have to pinch myself,\u201d Weinstein whispered to me, marveling at how swiftly his organization had expanded.As the sales reps emptied their plates and hailed waiters for second and third rounds of wine, Weinstein tapped his glass with a fork and called the group to attention. \u201cI\u2019d like to officially welcome you to the Big Easy!\u201d he squawked in his blunt Brooklynese. \u201cDo whatever you want as long as you wake up in the morning.\u201d The reps laughed. \u201cYou know, this is a really powerful force on behalf of the organization \u2014 a powerful force on behalf of the growth. Going out there, pounding the pavement, going after new accounts and clients \u2014 you have to be immune to rejection to be successful, and that\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m pretty bad at it myself!\u201d He wasn\u2019t kidding. Weinstein belies the clich\u00e9 that the best fighters develop a thick skin: He has sustained himself through decades of conflict by salting unhealed wounds, nursing unceasing resentment and preserving grudges in amber.The morning after the dinner, the sales reps reconvened in a dreary conference room with red tablecloths and damask carpeting. Programming for the first day called for an icebreaker in which employees were asked to scribble unusual facts about themselves on pieces of paper tossed into a hat. One man, a bodybuilder from South Beach with silver hair and pumpkin-colored skin, wrote that he used to train with Madonna; a copper-haired woman from San Francisco disclosed that she swam through garbage during an initiation ritual for Semester at Sea. Weinstein\u2019s own fact, the one he always uses for such exercises, was that he dropped out of high school.The icebreaker was followed by an exercise intended to explore how to navigate conversations with A.H.F.\u2019s critics. Weinstein gave volunteers the option of representing the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, leaders of which have been vocally critical of A.H.F., or a \u201cPrEP crazy,\u201d someone incensed by Weinstein\u2019s opposition to the H.I.V.-prevention pill. Another volunteer would play A.H.F.\u201cI\u2019ll be S.F.A.F.!\u201d volunteered the copper-haired woman. Her counterpart was a man whose upper lip was adorned with a sumptuous mustache.\u201cI\u2019m here to talk to you about the services that we provide,\u201d he began.\u201cI know all about A.H.F., actually,\u201d replied the copper-haired woman, her eyes narrowing. \u201cYour reputation precedes you.\u201d\u201cO.K., awesome. Did you know that we started the first AIDS hospice in Los Angeles about 28 years ago?\u201d he asked. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve grown rapidly, primarily overseas.\u201dThe reps laughed; they\u2019d all heard some version of this tirade a thousand times. Weinstein took the floor and concluded the session by telling a little story about a nun he once met. She ran a hospital, which required her to make tough budgetary decisions in the name of helping people. Whenever people criticized her for being harsh, she had a canned response: \u201cNo margin, no mission!\u201d This, according to Weinstein, is what A.H.F.\u2019s critics couldn\u2019t bring themselves to understand. \u201cWe should never be in a position of apologizing for our success,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that we take a business model from the private sector and utilize it on behalf of a nonprofit is a great thing.\u201dAnd then there are the billboards. In major American cities \u2014 and increasingly, around the world \u2014 Weinstein\u2019s most visible impact is his trolling approach to sexual-health messaging. In 2013, he put up signs in several cities with the image of a magma-spewing volcano captioned, \u201cSYPHILIS EXPLOSION.\u201d The following year, in South Central, he posted billboards with two black men spooning in bed alongside the leading question \u201cTrust Him?\u201d Some ads have been humorous and topical \u2014 a sendup of the Netflix logo replaced with the mantra \u201cGet Tested and Chill,\u201d a Bernie Sanders parody with the modified slogan \u201cFeel the Burn?\u201d Others have hectored the public with reproachful questions: \u201cFriends With Benefits?\u201d \u201cSexually Reckless?\u201d \u201cWorried?\u201d One A.H.F. billboard managed to cause a national scandal in Uganda. Unusually for a nonprofit, A.H.F. employs a 15-person in-house creative agency to create its messaging. The expense is justified because the billboards are a marketing channel: They seek to stir dread in the libertine masses, not only to stem what Weinstein sees as a rising tide of promiscuity but also to drive traffic to his clinics.In the press, Weinstein has attracted the most attention for his hostility to PrEP, a once-a-day antiretroviral that reduces the likelihood of contracting H.I.V. by 99 percent. In 2015, the C.D.C. began recommending PrEP for anyone at \u201chigh risk\u201d for H.I.V. infection, including any gay man not in a monogamous relationship who has had sex in the last six months without a condom (1.2 million people, according to the C.D.C.\u2019s estimates). Many hailed it as an era-defining advance. Weinstein, virtually alone among major AIDS figures, has assailed PrEP, calling it a \u201cparty drug\u201d that could lead to a collapse in condom use. In a citizen petition to the Food and Drug Administration following PrEP\u2019s approval in 2012, A.H.F.\u2019s lawyer denounced the treatment as \u201cunsafe and ineffective.\u201d Weinstein called on Margaret Hamburg, the agency\u2019s commissioner, to resign over the issue, suggesting she was part of a pharma-led plot to put millions of Americans on a new medication.Weinstein\u2019s critique of PrEP is a fringe view. According to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, support for PrEP among researchers and regulators is all but universal. \u201cIt\u2019s having an extraordinarily positive impact,\u201d he says. Robert Grant, a professor of medicine at U.C.S.F. and a leading PrEP researcher, credits the treatment with \u201ca plummeting decline\u201d in H.I.V. transmission rates among white gay men in San Francisco.Nevertheless, Weinstein is quoted regularly in articles about the treatment, and his noisy skepticism has reverberated across the internet. Some argue that Weinstein\u2019s grandstanding during public hearings delayed PrEP\u2019s approval by the C.D.C., and that his sowing of doubt about the medication is continuing to suppress its use, especially in black and Latino communities. \u201cWhat I find in my practice,\u201d Grant says, \u201cis that A.H.F.\u2019s propaganda does not impress or influence privileged groups of gay men. They can see right through it. But when I talk to some people of color who are clients in my clinics, I find they\u2019ve heard the A.H.F. message, and it gives them pause, it makes them concerned, it appeals to their sense that this isn\u2019t for them.\u201d Despite the C.D.C.\u2019s efforts, very few people, even now, are on PrEP; according to recent estimates, only about 100,000 people take it.Weinstein\u2019s concerns about PrEP are in line with his other heterodox positions, which often cut against the sexual-liberationist doctrine embraced by other activists. Many issues that have been controversial in the gay community, he claims, like laws that make it illegal to intentionally infect a sexual partner with H.I.V., are no-brainers for ordinary voters. \u201cSome people are so extreme,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a group here in California that wants to reduce intentionally infecting somebody from a felony to a misdemeanor. There\u2019s articles being written basically saying we should be proud to bareback\u201d \u2014 slang for condomless sex. \u201cIn the hothouse environment of the gay community, that point of view is very popular, but it isn\u2019t in the community at large, and it isn\u2019t in the medical community either.\u201dWhat motivates Weinstein to adopt such lonely views? Weinstein\u2019s fiercest critics have often searched for a financial motive, some even going so far as to suggest that he aims to profit from the spread of H.I.V. Those who know him personally dismiss this explanation. Phill Wilson, president of the Black AIDS Institute, first met Weinstein in 1980 when Wilson was dating Chris Brownlie. In fact, the first iteration of A.H.F. was founded in Wilson\u2019s living room. \u201cThis is the mistake that people make when they think about Michael,\u201d Wilson told me. \u201cWhether what he does is good or bad, he does what he believes is in the best interests of people living with H.I.V. or at risk of infection.\u201d Weinstein was \u201cprimarily driven by mission,\u201d Wilson said. Even Peter Staley concedes that point. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the money for him,\u201d he told me, unsurprised to learn that in Weinstein\u2019s most recent annual report, he disclosed a comparatively humble salary of $400,000, low for directors of similarly sized nonprofits. \u201cThe core of the business at A.H.F. is not something that has been scandalous,\u201d Staley says. \u201cIt is an empire worth building. A.H.F.\u2019s problem is that once it created the largest AIDS empire on the planet, it started using that power for nefarious purposes: Michael Weinstein\u2019s twisted political views.\u201dEven so, when I visited Weinstein at his office in February, he showed no sign of disappointment. Discussing recent losses, he wasn\u2019t merely philosophical; he was downright giddy. \u201cI had never been involved with a campaign,\u201d he said, referring to the drug-pricing initiative, \u201cwhere people were so enthusiastic about something that didn\u2019t win.\u201d (He would later use the same line with reporters when his anti-density ordinance went down in flames.) As we chatted, he sipped from a radioactive-looking bottle of apple-melon Isopure; he said he liked his chances for this November, when he would try again with a new drug-pricing initiative, this time in Ohio. The problem in California, he said, was that the drug companies had flooded the airwaves \u2014 \u201ctotal aerial bombardment, 3,500 gross rating points a week\u201d \u2014 but he doubted that kind of \u201crazzmatazz\u201d would work in flyover country. \u201cMidwesterners are kind of square-shouldered, common-sense people. I\u2019d think there\u2019d be a backlash if they dumped $80 million into Ohio.\u201dIf that referendum were to pass, Weinstein figured, then Big Pharma\u2019s citadel \u2014 the American market \u2014 would start to crack. Ohio would be copied by other states, and the V.A.\u2019s price for drugs would become the universal price, as even private insurers would demand to pay the new public rate. Billions would be shaved off pharma\u2019s bottom line, meaning the industry would no longer have the muscle to bully Congress into propping up its international patent regime. Drug prices would plummet across the world, AIDS medications would flow freely and the industry\u2019s lobbying operation would shrink so much that it could be drowned in a bathtub. This sequence of events seemed far-fetched, but Weinstein was nevertheless optimistic about the coming year, win or lose. His equanimity in the face of failure reminded me of something he once said to me about Prop. 60, the condoms-in-porn bill. It lost at the ballot box by an eight-point margin, but Weinstein found a reason to declare victory. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more than 10,000 stories on condoms in porn,\u201d he boasted. \u201cForget about porn: That\u2019s a lot of free advertising for condoms.\u201dWeinstein often consoles himself in moments of defeat by reaffirming his commitment to the long game. This is part of what makes him so frustrating to his critics: It is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to distinguish his cynical ploys from his ideological commitments. In his person, the will to power and the will to change the world seem to fuse. It wasn\u2019t simply that he cared more about fighting than about winning. Eventually, he believes, people will come around to his view. And if they don\u2019t, that\u2019s fine, too: A.H.F. will continue to thrive, even in a fallen world.Christopher Glazek is a freelance writer based in New York and the founder of the Yale AIDS Memorial Project.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Balance Court Ruling in China Is Rare Win Against Piracy", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 New Balance has won a rare legal victory in China in an intellectual property dispute: A court has ordered five shoe manufacturers and sellers to pay the state $250,000 for using the American shoemaker\u2019s signature slanting \u201cN\u201d logo.In previous years, the company has battled legions of counterfeit manufacturers, taken on a rogue supplier who exported its shoes at a deep discount and, most recently, struggled in court to win the use of its Chinese name.In a preliminary decision, the Suzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court on Monday fined the five companies for breaching an injunction issued in September prohibiting them from selling shoes with the logo, according to a report in China Intellectual Property Magazine. The $250,000 in fines will go to the state. The court will issue its final judgment at the end of May, at which time New Balance could get damages.Amy Dow, New Balance\u2019s senior global corporate communications manager, confirmed the penalty, saying the brand used by all five was called New Boom.Ms. Dow said New Balance sued under China\u2019s Anti-Unfair Competition Law because the country\u2019s trademark laws \u201ccurrently provide slight loopholes for these brands to exist.\u201d\u201cThese actions are significantly more costly than traditional counterfeit enforcement measures, but New Balance believes strongly in the protection of our intellectual property,\u201d she said.The case offers a high-profile example of how doing business in China can feel like a Wild West shootout.For years, foreign brands have been battling low-quality manufacturers that churn out cheap copies of everything from iPhones to Louis Vuitton bags. But piracy in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, has a new twist: Manufacturers copy everything about a product but with a slight modification of the brand name.For New Balance, that meant consumers ran into New Boom, New Barlun, and New Bunren \u2014 brands that are protected under China\u2019s trademark law.\u201cParasite brands are fast becoming the scariest form of \u2018counterfeit\u2019 within China,\u201d Ms. Dow said in an emailed response.Ms. Dow said another Chinese court had awarded New Balance $550,000 this month in a judgment against companies making New Bunren brand shoes. Separately, New Balance has an outstanding case against manufacturers using the brand New Barlun.In China, trademarks are generally awarded to those who first file paperwork with the government. That has given rise to a crush of people registering the names of well-known brands, a practice known as \u201ctrademark squatting.\u201d Unlike in the United States, people who file for the trademarks do not have to give a reason for their application.Trademark lawyers said companies rarely obtain preliminary injunctions in China, making this case an unusual one.Douglas Clark, an intellectual property lawyer who has practiced in Greater China for the last 25 years, said he could not recall a Chinese court imposing such a substantial fine for breaching a preliminary injunction.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely significant because until now, defendants have very commonly in China just ignored court orders,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cThis is sending a message that if you don\u2019t obey them, you will get into trouble.\u201dGuizeng Wayne Liu, a senior partner at Yuanhe Partners, said Monday\u2019s decision underlined China\u2019s willingness to protect intellectual property rights.\u201cThis is a good sign for New Balance in future trial cases,\u201d Mr. Liu added.Trademark lawyers say Beijing has started taking intellectual property rights seriously because Chinese companies now have valuable intellectual property to protect.Charles Feng, head of the intellectual property division at the law firm East & Concord Partners, said the injunction was particularly important because Chinese courts typically don\u2019t award much in the way of damages in trademark infringement cases. An injunction helps them minimize the losses from trademark infringement, Mr. Feng said.He cited statistics from the Chinese courts that show that in the past 10 years, only 5 to 10 percent of companies that applied for preliminary injunctions obtained them.The decision comes 10 months after a Chinese court upheld an earlier ruling that New Balance\u2019s Chinese trademark had infringed the rights of a businessman who had registered it first. The court ordered the company to pay the businessman $730,000, reducing the fine from $14 million.Edward Lehman, from Lehman, Lee and Xu, one of China\u2019s top law firms, said the punishment in this week\u2019s case implied that the courts had monitored the enforcement of the injunction. That was a good sign, he said, but much is left to be done.\u201cFrom an intellectual property portfolio management perspective, this is a Band-Aid on cancer,\u201d Mr. Lehman said.Zhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}

This year, there will be a screening for the films at the festival, and they will appear on a special section of The Atlantic\u2019s website.\u201cA huge part of the reason readers come to The Atlantic is to understand, more broadly, what people are thinking about and why specific issues matter,\u201d said Hayley Romer, the publisher. \u201cBrands have the same opportunity to provide greater perspective for consumers for dramatic changes that are happening now and shaping their world.\u201dMs. Romer said companies were motivated to pursue such marketing because \u201cthe pinnacle of what you can be as a brand is a thought leader in the area in which you exist.\u201dThe jury that will select the winner this month includes figures like Jenna Lyons, the creative director of J.

He likened these efforts to the high end of a spectrum, where the low end is the automated buying of millions of online ads tailored to a person\u2019s interests and optimized for clicks and sales.\u201cThe brand will make the thing, not the thing that interrupts the thing, with shows and films in addition to the programmatic stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have that classic high and low but nothing in between.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the affiliation of Jae Goodman.

The permit authorizes six people to take control of the vehicles if necessary.In October, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, told investors, \u201cWe are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it\u2019s clear that there are a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionize the car experience.\u201dThere are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.In those comments, the company said: \u201cApple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\u201dThe self-driving car segment is among the most bitterly contested areas in emerging technology, with Apple joining 29 other companies that have received test permits in California.Google, an early developer of the technology, considers self-driving cars to be a potential new market, while Uber hopes to eliminate the need for human drivers to shuttle its customers.

Even so, Tesla now trades at some 28 times estimated earnings in 2020. By then Mr. Musk expects to be producing one million cars a year, up from around 100,000 in 2017.That will require a huge ramp-up in production, which is no easy feat. Also, that valuation multiple suggests Tesla will either keep growing quickly or else generate pretax margins around the 30 percent that Silicon Valley stalwarts Apple and Google achieve rather than the 10 percent that counts as decent in the auto industry \u2014 or maybe both.It\u2019s hard to see that happening, at least without major setbacks along the way.Long-term guesstimates from Morgan Stanley\u2019s auto analysts show a standard-looking car company \u2014 and they have been among Tesla\u2019s most bullish followers. They don\u2019t see output reaching one million cars until around 2027. By 2030, they reckon the company\u2019s pretax margin could be about 14 percent, with some $11 billion of profit.Another way to assess these numbers is to discount the projected 2030 earnings back to this year at a rule-of-thumb 10 percent annual rate. Tesla\u2019s current valuation is about 18 times that discounted profit figure.It\u2019s a somewhat arbitrary analysis, but it may hint at what some investors are hoping for. Take Apple in 2004. Back then, the future iPhone maker was trading at just 65 percent of expected earnings this year, discounted back. In other words, Steve Jobs unleashed growth that blew projections away.If Mr. Musk is riding another wave of consumer change \u2014 a shift toward electric cars \u2014 it could be less drastic than the smartphone revolution and still pay off for Tesla\u2019s investors.That\u2019s possible. By 2030, a quarter of the miles driven in the United States could be in self-driving electric cars, according to the Boston Consulting Group. Mr. Musk faces plenty of competition, though.

{"Headline": "Is It Time to Break Up Google?", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byOpinionIn just 10 years, the world\u2019s five largest companies by market capitalization have all changed, save for one: Microsoft. Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Citigroup and Shell Oil are out and Apple, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon and Facebook have taken their place.They\u2019re all tech companies, and each dominates its corner of the industry: Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising, Facebook (and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic and Amazon has a 74 percent share in the e-book market. In classic economic terms, all three are monopolies.We have been transported back to the early 20th century, when arguments about \u201cthe curse of bigness\u201d were advanced by President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s counselor, Louis Brandeis, before Wilson appointed him to the Supreme Court. Brandeis wanted to eliminate monopolies, because (in the words of his biographer Melvin Urofsky) \u201cin a democratic society the existence of large centers of private power is dangerous to the continuing vitality of a free people.\u201d We need look no further than the conduct of the largest banks in the 2008 financial crisis or the role that Facebook and Google play in the \u201cfake news\u201d business to know that Brandeis was right.While Brandeis generally opposed regulation \u2014 which, he worried, inevitably led to the corruption of the regulator \u2014 and instead advocated breaking up \u201cbigness,\u201d he made an exception for \u201cnatural\u201d monopolies, like telephone, water and power companies and railroads, where it made sense to have one or a few companies in control of an industry.Could it be that these companies \u2014 and Google in particular \u2014 have become natural monopolies by supplying an entire market\u2019s demand for a service, at a price lower than what would be offered by two competing firms? And if so, is it time to regulate them like public utilities?Consider a historical analogy: the early days of telecommunications.In 1895 a photograph of the business district of a large city might have shown 20 phone wires attached to most buildings. Each wire was owned by a different phone company, and none of them worked with the others. Without network effects, the networks themselves were almost useless.The solution was for a single company, American Telephone and Telegraph, to consolidate the industry by buying up all the small operators and creating a single network \u2014 a natural monopoly. The government permitted it, but then regulated this monopoly through the Federal Communications Commission.In a 1956 consent decree in which the Justice Department allowed AT&T to maintain its phone monopoly, the government extracted a huge concession: All past patents were licensed (to any American company) royalty-free, and all future patents were to be licensed for a small fee. These licenses led to the creation of Texas Instruments, Motorola, Fairchild Semiconductor and many other start-ups.True, the internet never had the same problems of interoperability. And Google\u2019s route to dominance is different from the Bell System\u2019s. Nevertheless it still has all of the characteristics of a public utility.We are going to have to decide fairly soon whether Google, Facebook and Amazon are the kinds of natural monopolies that need to be regulated, or whether we allow the status quo to continue, pretending that unfettered monoliths don\u2019t inflict damage on our privacy and democracy.It is impossible to deny that Facebook, Google and Amazon have stymied innovation on a broad scale. To begin with, the platforms of Google and Facebook are the point of access to all media for the majority of Americans. While profits at Google, Facebook and Amazon have soared, revenues in media businesses like newspaper publishing or the music business have, since 2001, fallen by 70 percent.There are a few obvious regulations to start with. Monopoly is made by acquisition \u2014 Google buying AdMob and DoubleClick, Facebook buying Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon buying, to name just a few, Audible, Twitch, Zappos and Alexa. At a minimum, these companies should not be allowed to acquire other major firms, like Spotify or Snapchat.The second alternative is to regulate a company like Google as a public utility, requiring it to license out patents, for a nominal fee, for its search algorithms, advertising exchanges and other key innovations.The third alternative is to remove the \u201csafe harbor\u201d clause in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which allows companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube to free ride on the content produced by others. The reason there are 40,000 Islamic State videos on YouTube, many with ads that yield revenue for those who posted them, is that YouTube does not have to take responsibility for the content on its network. Facebook, Google and Twitter claim that policing their networks would be too onerous. But that\u2019s preposterous: They already police their networks for pornography, and quite well.Removing the safe harbor provision would also force social networks to pay for the content posted on their sites. A simple example: One million downloads of a song on iTunes would yield the performer and his record label about $900,000. One million streams of that same song on YouTube would earn them about $900.I\u2019m under no delusion that, with libertarian tech moguls like Peter Thiel in President Trump\u2019s inner circle, antitrust regulation of the internet monopolies will be a priority. Ultimately we may have to wait four years, at which time the monopolies will be so dominant that the only remedy will be to break them up. Force Google to sell DoubleClick. Force Facebook to sell WhatsApp and Instagram.Woodrow Wilson was right when he said in 1913, \u201cIf monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of the government.\u201d We ignore his words at our peril.Jonathan Taplin is the director emeritus of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Google, Facebook and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "That Fingerprint Sensor on Your Phone Is Not as Safe as You Think", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byWhile such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole.The researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones.\u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it\u2019s almost certainly pretty darn bad,\u201d said Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Canada, who studies biometric security systems. \u201cIf all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into 1 in 10 phones, that\u2019s not bad odds.\u201dFull human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google\u2019s Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger \u2014 say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand.Since a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches.\u201cIt\u2019s as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one,\u201d said Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at N.Y.U.\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, which was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. The other authors are Aditi Roy, a postdoctoral fellow at N.Y.U.\u2019s Tandon School, and Arun Ross, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State.Dr. Memon said their findings indicated that if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 to 50 percent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password, known as a personal identification number.Apple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone\u2019s fingerprint system was 1 in 50,000 with one fingerprint enrolled. Ryan James, a company spokesman, said Apple had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system, and also incorporated other security features to prevent false matches.Google declined to comment.The actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret, and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google\u2019s standard design in ways that reduce the level of security.Stephanie Schuckers, a professor at Clarkson University and director of the Center for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrint findings. She said the researchers used a midrange, commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings.\u201cTo really know what the impact would be on a cellphone, you\u2019d have to try it on the cellphone,\u201d she said. She noted that cellphone makers and others who use fingerprint security systems are studying anti-spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. A new fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm, for example, uses ultrasound.Phone makers have acknowledged that fingerprint sensors are not foolproof, but said that the ease of touching a finger to unlock a phone meant that more users actually turned on security features instead of leaving their phones unlocked \u2014 a common habit in the early days of smartphones.Dr. Ross acknowledged the limitations of the work. \u201cMost of the current smartphone vendors do not give us access to the fingerprint image,\u201d he said.For a thief or spy to turn master fingerprints into smartphone keys would require a lot of additional work. \u201cIn order to launch this attack, you still have to make fake fingers,\u201d Dr. Ross said.Still, the team\u2019s fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Chris Boehnen, the manager of the federal government\u2019s Odin program, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity.\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low,\u201d Dr. Boehnen said.Phone makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, \u201cbut the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it.\u201dAdding a larger fingerprint sensor would also decrease the risk, Dr. Boehnen said. And some newer biometric security options, such as the iris scanner in Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy S8, are harder to trick. (Face recognition, another security option available on some phones, is considered less secure than fingerprints.)Phone users can also protect themselves by turning off fingerprint authentication for their most sensitive apps, such as mobile payments, Dr. Boehnen said.Dr. Memon said that despite his research, he was still using fingerprint security on his iPhone.\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s still a very convenient way of unlocking a phone. But I\u2019d rather see Apple make me enter the PIN if it\u2019s idle for one hour.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Facebook Fix Its Own Worst Bug?", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "FeatureMark Zuckerberg now acknowledges the dangerous side of the social revolution he helped start. But is the most powerful tool for connection in human history capable of adapting to the world it created?Supported byZuckerberg used to be a nervous speaker, but he has become much less so. He speaks quickly but often unloads full paragraphs of thought, and sometimes his arguments are so polished that they sound rehearsed, which happened often that morning. \u201c2016 was an interesting year for us,\u201d he said as the three of us, plus a P.R. executive, sat around a couple of couches in the glass-walled conference room where he conducts many of his meetings. (There are many perks to working at Facebook, but no one, not even Zuckerberg, has a private office.) It was an understatement and a nod to the obvious: Facebook, once a mere app on your phone, had become a global political and cultural force, and the full implications of that transformation had begun to come into view last year. \u201cIf you look at the history of Facebook, when we started off, there really wasn\u2019t news as part of it,\u201d Zuckerberg went on. But as Facebook grew and became a bigger part of how people learn about the world, the company had been slow to adjust to its new place in people\u2019s lives. The events of 2016, he said, \u201cset off a number of conversations that we\u2019re still in the middle of.\u201dAfter the election, Zuckerberg offered a few pat defenses of Facebook\u2019s role. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite proud of the impact that we were able to have on civic discourse over all,\u201d he said when we spoke in January. Misinformation on Facebook was not as big a problem as some believed it was, but Facebook nevertheless would do more to battle it, he pledged. Echo chambers were a concern, but if the source was people\u2019s own confirmation bias, was it really Facebook\u2019s problem to solve?It was hard to tell how seriously Zuckerberg took the criticisms of his service and its increasingly paradoxical role in the world. He had spent much of his life building a magnificent machine to bring people together. By the most literal measures, he\u2019d succeeded spectacularly, but what had that connection wrought? Across the globe, Facebook now seems to benefit actors who want to undermine the global vision at its foundation. Supporters of Trump and the European right-wing nationalists who aim to turn their nations inward and dissolve alliances, trolls sowing cross-border paranoia, even ISIS with its skillful social-media recruiting and propagandizing \u2014 all of them have sought in their own ways to split the Zuckerbergian world apart. And they are using his own machine to do it.Underneath it all was a nagging feeling of complicity. Trump had benefited from a media environment that is now shaped by Facebook \u2014 and, more to the point, shaped by a single Facebook feature, the same one to which the company owes its remarkable ascent to social-media hegemony: the computationally determined list of updates you see every time you open the app. The list has a formal name, News Feed. But most users are apt to think of it as Facebook itself.If it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that News Feed has become the most influential source of information in the history of civilization, it is only slightly so. Facebook created News Feed in 2006 to solve a problem: In the social-media age, people suddenly had too many friends to keep up with. At the time, Facebook was just a collection of profiles, lacking any kind of central organization. To figure out what any of your connections were up to, you had to visit each of their profiles to see if anything had changed. News Feed fixed that. Every time you open Facebook, it hunts through the network, collecting every post from every connection \u2014 information that, for most Facebook users, would be too overwhelming to process themselves. Then it weighs the merits of each post before presenting you with a feed sorted in order of importance: a hyperpersonalized front page designed just for you.Scholars and critics have been warning of the solipsistic irresistibility of algorithmic news at least since 2001, when the constitutional-law professor Cass R. Sunstein warned, in his book \u201cRepublic.com,\u201d of the urgent risks posed to democracy \u201cby any situation in which thousands or perhaps millions or even tens of millions of people are mainly listening to louder echoes of their own voices.\u201d (In 2008, I piled on with my own book, \u201cTrue Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society.\u201d) In 2011, the digital activist and entrepreneur Eli Pariser, looking at similar issues, gave this phenomenon a memorable name in the title of his own book: \u201cThe Filter Bubble.\u201dEmployees got the same message. \u201cWhen Facebook cares about something, they spin up teams to address it, and Zuck will come out and talk about it all the time,\u201d one former executive told me. \u201cI have never heard of anything close to that on the filter bubble. I never sensed that this was a problem he wanted us to tackle. It was always positioned as an interesting intellectual question but not something that we\u2019re going to go focus on.\u201dFacebook, under criticism, reinstated the picture, but the photo incident stuck with Zuckerberg. He would bring it up unbidden to staff members and to reporters. It highlighted, for him, the difficulty of building a policy framework for what Facebook was trying to do. Zuckerberg wanted to become a global news distributor that is run by machines, rather than by humans who would try to look at every last bit of content and exercise considered judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s something I think we\u2019re still figuring out,\u201d he told me in January. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to do here than what we\u2019ve done. And I think we\u2019re starting to realize this now as well.\u201dIt struck me as an unsatisfying answer, and it later became apparent that Zuckerberg seemed to feel the same way. On a Sunday morning about a month after the first meeting, I got a call from a Facebook spokesman. Zuckerberg wanted to chat again. Could Mike and I come back on Monday afternoon?What\u2019s striking about that 2012 letter, read through the prism of 2017, is its certainty that a more \u201copen and connected\u201d world is by definition a better one. \u201cWhen I started Facebook, the idea of connecting the world was not controversial,\u201d Zuckerberg said now. \u201cThe default assumption was that the world was incrementally just moving in that direction. So I thought we can connect some people and do our part in helping move in that direction.\u201d But now, he said, whether it was wise to connect the world was \u201cactually a real question.\u201dZuckerberg\u2019s new manifesto never quite accepts blame for any of the global ills that have been laid at Facebook\u2019s feet. Yet by the standards of a company release, it is remarkable for the way it concedes that the company\u2019s chief goal \u2014 wiring the globe \u2014 is controversial. \u201cThere are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone,\u201d Zuckerberg writes, \u201cand whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course.\u201d He also confesses misgivings about Facebook\u2019s role in the news. \u201cGiving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality.\u201dAt the time of our second interview, the manifesto was still only a draft, and I was surprised by how unsure Zuckerberg seemed about it in person. He had almost as many questions for us \u2014 about whether we understood what he was trying to say, how we thought it would land in the media \u2014 as we had for him. When I suggested that it might be perceived as an attack on Trump, he looked dismayed. He noted several times that he had been noodling over these ideas since long before November. A few weeks earlier, there was media speculation, fueled by a postelection tour of America by Zuckerberg and his wife, that he was laying the groundwork to run against Trump in 2020, and in this meeting he took pains to shoot down the rumors. When I asked if he had chatted with Obama about the former president\u2019s critique of Facebook, Zuckerberg paused for several seconds, nearly to the point of awkwardness, before answering that he had.Facebook\u2019s spokespeople later called to stress that Obama was only one of many people to whom he had spoken. In other words: Don\u2019t read this as a partisan anti-Trump manifesto. But if the company pursues the admittedly airy aims outlined in \u201cBuilding Global Community,\u201d the changes will echo across media and politics, and some are bound to be considered partisan. The risks are especially clear for changes aimed at adding layers of journalistic ethics across News Feed, which could transform the public\u2019s perception of Facebook, not to mention shake the foundations of its business.For the typical user, Cox explained when I met him on a morning in October at MPK20, News Feed is computing the relative merits of about 2,000 potential posts in your network every time you open the app. In sorting these posts, Facebook does not optimize for any single metric: not clicks or reading time or likes. Instead, he said, \u201cwhat you really want to get to is whether somebody, at the end of the day, would say, \u2018Hey, my experience today was meaningful.\u2019\u2009\u201d Personalizing News Feed, in other words, is a very big \u201cmath problem,\u201d incorporating countless metrics in extraordinarily complicated ways. Zuckerberg calls it \u201ca modern A.I. problem.\u201dLast summer, I sat in on two meetings in another glass-walled MPK20 conference room, in which News Feed\u2019s engineers, designers, user-research experts and managers debated several small alterations to how News Feed displays certain kinds of posts. The conversations were far from exciting \u2014 people in jeans on couches looking at PowerPoints, talking quietly about numbers \u2014 and yet I found them mesmerizing, a demonstration of the profound cultural differences between how news companies like The Times work and how Facebook does. The first surprise was how slowly things move, contrary to the freewheeling culture of \u201cthe hacker way.\u201d In one meeting, the team spent several minutes discussing the merits of bold text in a certain News Feed design. One blessing of making social software is that you can gauge any potential change to your product by seeing how your users react to it. That is also the curse: At Facebook, virtually every change to the app, no matter how small or obviously beneficial, is thoroughly tested on different segments of the audience before it\u2019s rolled out to everyone.The people who work on News Feed aren\u2019t making decisions that turn on fuzzy human ideas like ethics, judgment, intuition or seniority. They are concerned only with quantifiable outcomes about people\u2019s actions on the site. That data, at Facebook, is the only real truth. And it is a particular kind of truth: The News Feed team\u2019s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want \u2014 what they find \u201cmeaningful,\u201d to use Cox and Zuckerberg\u2019s preferred term \u2014 and to give them more of that.This ideal runs so deep that the people who make News Feed often have to put aside their own notions of what\u2019s best. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve all learned over the years is that our intuition can be wrong a fair amount of the time,\u201d John Hegeman, the vice president of product management and a News Feed team member, told me. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t expect will happen. And we learn a lot from that process: Why didn\u2019t that happen, and what might that mean?\u201d But it is precisely this ideal that conflicts with attempts to wrangle the feed in the way press critics have called for. The whole purpose of editorial guidelines and ethics is often to suppress individual instincts in favor of some larger social goal. Facebook finds it very hard to suppress anything that its users\u2019 actions say they want. In some cases, it has been easier for the company to seek out evidence that, in fact, users don\u2019t want these things at all.If a human editor ran News Feed, she would look at the clickbait scourge and make simple, intuitive fixes: Turn down the Upworthy knob. But Facebook approaches the feed as an engineering project rather than an editorial one. When it makes alterations in the code that powers News Feed, it\u2019s often only because it has found some clear signal in its data that users are demanding the change. In this sense, clickbait was a riddle. In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them? Was there something Facebook\u2019s algorithm was missing, some signal that would show that despite the clicks, clickbait was really sickening users?To answer these questions, Cox and his team hired survey panels of more than a thousand paid \u201cprofessional raters\u201d around the world who answer questions about how well News Feed is working. Starting in 2013, Facebook began adding first dozens and then hundreds and then thousands of data points that were meant to teach the artificial-intelligence system that runs News Feed how people were reacting to their feeds. Facebook noticed that people would sometimes click open a clickbaity story but spend very little time on it. In other cases, lots of people would click on a story but few would share or Like it. Headlines on stories that people seemed to reject often contained a set of signature phrases (\u201cyou\u2019ll never believe,\u201d \u201cthis one trick,\u201d etc.) or they came from a set of repeat-offender publishers.This approach \u2014 looking for signs of user dissatisfaction \u2014 could curb stories that constitute the most egregious examples of misinformation. Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s vice president in charge of News Feed, says that Facebook has begun testing an algorithm change that would look at whether people share an article after reading it. If few of the people who click on a story decide to share it, that might suggest people feel misled by it and it would get lower billing in the feed.But the solution to the broader misinformation dilemma \u2014 the pervasive climate of rumor, propaganda and conspiracy theories that Facebook has inadvertently incubated \u2014 may require something that Facebook has never done: ignoring the likes and dislikes of its users. Facebook believes the pope-endorses-Trump type of made-up news stories are only a tiny minority of pieces that appear in News Feed; they account for a fraction of 1 percent of the posts, according to Mosseri. The question the company faces now is whether the misinformation problem resembles clickbait at all, and whether its solutions will align as neatly with Facebook\u2019s worldview. Facebook\u2019s entire project, when it comes to news, rests on the assumption that people\u2019s individual preferences ultimately coincide with the public good, and that if it doesn\u2019t appear that way at first, you\u2019re not delving deeply enough into the data. By contrast, decades of social-science research shows that most of us simply prefer stuff that feels true to our worldview even if it isn\u2019t true at all and that the mining of all those preference signals is likely to lead us deeper into bubbles rather than out of them.\u201cAt some point, if they really want to address this, they have to say, \u2018This is good information\u2019 and \u2018This is bad information,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Emily Bell, the director for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School. \u201cThey have to say, \u2018These are the kinds of information sources that we want to privilege, and these others are not going to be banned from the platform, but they are not going to thrive.\u2019 In other words, they have to create a hierarchy, and they\u2019re going to have to decide how they\u2019re going to transfer wealth into the publishing market.\u201dDuring our first meeting in January, I posed this question to Zuckerberg: \u201cWhen you see various problems in the media, do you say to yourself, \u2018I run Facebook, I can solve that?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cUm,\u201d he started, and then paused, weighing his words as carefully as American presidents once did. \u201cNot usually.\u201d He argued that some of Facebook\u2019s critics\u2019 proposed fixes for news on the service, such as hiring editors, were impractical due to Facebook\u2019s scale and global diversity. Personalization, he said, remained a central tenet. \u201cIt really gets back to, like, what do people want at a deep level,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this oversimplified narrative that a company can get very successful by just scratching a very superficial itch, and I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s right over the long term.\u201dYet by our second meeting, Zuckerberg\u2019s position seemed to have evolved. Facebook had by then announced plans for the Facebook Journalism Project, in which the company would collaborate with news companies on new products. Facebook also created a project to promote \u201cnews literacy\u201d among its users, and it hired the former CNN news anchor Campbell Brown to manage the partnership between it and news companies. Zuckerberg\u2019s tone toward critics of Facebook\u2019s approach to news had also grown far more conciliatory. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to get to the core of the actual problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI also really think that the core social thing that needs to happen is that a common understanding needs to exist. And misinformation I view as one of the things that can possibly erode common understanding. But sensationalism and polarization and other things, I actually think, are probably even stronger and more prolific effects. And we have to work on all these things. I think we need to listen to all the feedback on this.\u201dStill, in both our conversation and his new manifesto, Zuckerberg remained preoccupied with the kind of problems that could be solved by the kind of hyperconnectivity he believed in, not the ones caused by it. \u201cThere\u2019s a social infrastructure that needs to get built for modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving more people oriented not just toward short-term things but toward building the long-term social infrastructure that needs to get built across all these things in order to enable people to come together is going to be a really important thing over the next decades.\u201d By way of example, he pointed to Safety Check, Facebook\u2019s system for letting people tell their friends that they\u2019ve survived some kind of dangerous event, like a natural disaster or terrorist attack.\u201cWe\u2019re getting to a point where the biggest opportunities I think in the world ... problems like preventing pandemics from spreading or ending terrorism, all these things, they require a level of coordination and connection that I don\u2019t think can only be solved by the current systems that we have,\u201d Zuckerberg told me. What\u2019s needed, he argues, is some global superstructure to advance humanity.This is not an especially controversial idea; Zuckerberg is arguing for a kind of digital-era version of the global institution-building that the Western world engaged in after World War II. But because he is a chief executive and not an elected president, there is something frightening about his project. He is positioning Facebook \u2014 and, considering that he commands absolute voting control of the company, he is positioning himself \u2014 as a critical enabler of the next generation of human society. A minor problem with his mission is that it drips with megalomania, albeit of a particularly sincere sort. With his wife, Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg has pledged to give away nearly all of his wealth to a variety of charitable causes, including a long-term medical-research project to cure all disease. His desire to take on global social problems through digital connectivity, and specifically through Facebook, feels like part of the same impulse.Yet Zuckerberg is often blas\u00e9 about the messiness of the transition between the world we\u2019re in and the one he wants to create through software. Building new \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d usually involves tearing older infrastructure down. If you manage the demolition poorly, you might undermine what comes next. In the case of the shattering media landscape, Zuckerberg seems finally to have at least noticed this problem and may yet come up with fixes for it. But in the meantime, Facebook rushes headlong into murky new areas, uncovering new dystopian possibilities at every turn.Just as quickly, though, Zuckerberg then pivoted to Facebook\u2019s next marvel, a system for digitally augmenting your pictures and videos. The technical term for this is \u201caugmented reality.\u201d The name bursts with dystopian possibilities \u2014 fake news on video rather than just text \u2014 but Zuckerberg never mentioned them. The statesman had left the stage; before us stood an engineer.Farhad Manjoo is a technology columnist for The New York Times. He is working on a book about what he calls the Frightful Five: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 the five technology giants that are swallowing up the rest of the economy.Advertisement"}

And what we discovered was that it was great for some and not others,\u201d Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for marketing, said at the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for that, what happened with the Mac Pro, and we\u2019re going to come out with something great to replace it.\u201dKevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management who loaded up on Apple shares near last year\u2019s lows, is one of those confident investors. \u201cApple is turning into the big Caddy that\u2019s going to cruise down the freeway, and there\u2019s a certain class of investors that are really comfortable with that. And we\u2019re that kind of investor,\u201d he said.Heavy buying of Apple shares by Mr. Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway, and by Apple itself has also helped support the stock price, accounting for one month\u2019s trading volume in the shares, according to Mr. Cybart\u2019s calculations. Berkshire is now Apple\u2019s fifth-largest shareholder, owning 2.61 percent of the company as of Feb. 27.In recent years, as United States phone carriers have stopped subsidizing the purchase of new phones, consumers have been holding on to their old smartphones longer than the typical two-year upgrade cycle. The last time that Apple made big changes to its phone lineup was in 2014, when it first introduced models with larger screens.Expectations are high that the new iPhones coming out this year will have enough improvements to prompt a big wave of new purchases. \u201cPeople are excited about a feature-rich launch,\u201d said Timothy Arcuri, a technology analyst at Cowen & Company.But as Apple pushes the innovation envelope, there are risks. The company has been having difficulty with the new type of fingerprint reader needed for its most advanced iPhone, which is expected to have a screen that runs edge to edge, with no physical home button, Mr. Arcuri said.He said Apple had just a few more weeks to work out the kinks if it hoped to meet its traditional September release date. Otherwise, it will have to delay the new phones or put the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone \u2014 a clunky solution adopted by Samsung for its Galaxy S8 phone that has been panned by reviewers.\u201cThey\u2019re wringing their hands,\u201d Mr. Arcuri said of Apple.Potential breakthroughs are also in the works.The company is developing augmented reality technology, including eyeglasses, that will overlay real objects with digital ones. Some expect a rudimentary form of augmented reality to show up in the next iPhone.Technological leaps like those would win back skeptics like Mr. Landis. \u201cHistory says that Apple does great but they never shake up the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI need them to surprise me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "American Brandy Is Surging, Even in Whiskey Country", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Three years ago, Joe Heron, a pharmaceutical executive turned beverage-industry entrepreneur, moved here from Minneapolis to open a distillery. But unlike the dozens of other would-be whiskey barons setting up shop in Kentucky these days, Mr. Heron and his wife, Lesley, weren\u2019t interested in making bourbon. They wanted to make brandy.Brandy has become a quiet giant of the liquor industry. More than 13 million cases were sold domestically in 2016, outpacing gin, Scotch and Irish whiskey, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. And most of that \u2014 eight million cases \u2014 was American brandy.\u201cPeople ask, \u2018Is it hot?\u2019 I say, \u2018It\u2019s about to get white hot,\u2019\u201d Mr. Heron said on a recent tour of his distillery, a converted warehouse in this city\u2019s Butchertown district, just east of downtown.Though overshadowed by the bourbon boom, domestic brandy has a growing appeal. Adventurous young consumers, weaned on craft whiskey and beer, are eager to try something new. Bartenders love it because many classic cocktail recipes call for brandy, and new American expressions like Copper & Kings emphasize flavor and power over the more subtle notes found in Old World brandies like Cognac.Broadly speaking, brandy is simply fermented, distilled fruit juice, and any fruit will do. Until Prohibition, apple, peach and pear brandies were some of the most popular drinks in America, though hundreds of distilleries made grape brandy (essentially, distilled wine) as well. Since then, American brandy has been dominated, and defined, by a few brands \u2014 Christian Brothers, E&J, Korbel \u2014 and their thick, super-sweet style.Perhaps the most famous brandy isn\u2019t American at all: Cognac, which must be distilled and aged in the Cognac region of France. (Armagnac, another kind of French brandy, is made in Gascony.) Cognac producers follow strict rules, including a limited choice of varietals \u2014 primarily ugni blanc, a mild grape also known as trebbiano.American brandy faces none of those constraints. That freedom is drawing craft distillers who feel crowded out of the whiskey market and, at the same time, see an opportunity to remake American brandy as something other than a syrupy-sweet concoction.If there is a single definition of American brandy, it is a style built around robust flavors, in contrast to the muted elegance of Cognac.\u201cIn Cognac, the soil is dominant, and they use a neutral grape, so all the character comes from the soil,\u201d said Hubert Germain-Robin, widely considered the godfather of modern American brandy. He grew up in an old Cognac-producing family in France, but as a young man, he took his skills to California. There, in 1982, he helped found the Germain-Robin distillery, where he turned out a series of cult-favorite brandies (coveted by, among others, Ronald Reagan).\u201cEspecially on the West Coast,\u201d Mr. Germain-Robin said, \u201cthe fruit is very dominant.\u201dThere are two clear camps among American brandy distillers: the innovators and the traditionalists.\u201cWe don\u2019t play by the old rules,\u201d Mr. Heron said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for the finesse of a brandy with the muscle of a whiskey.\u201dMr. Tate, 42, of Tate & Company in Texas, takes a similar approach. A self-taught coppersmith, he makes his own stills, with added features to personalize his brandy. (In fact, he earns extra money building stills for other companies.) And he embraces locally grown grapes; for the moment, his favorite is zinfandel, a choice unheard-of, let alone legal, in France.\u201cI don\u2019t want to use the term irreverence, but distilling is inherently an artistic endeavor,\u201d Mr. Tate said, adding, \u201cWe just step out and try something new,\u201d and hope that it won\u2019t disappoint.A much different story is being told in California by a geophysicist-turned-distiller named Daniel Farber. An erudite former New Yorker and former professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Mr. Farber, 54, took up distilling as a hobby in the 1980s, though he didn\u2019t start selling brandy, under the Osocalis label, until 2002. Even today, he makes just two expressions, Rare and XO (along with an apple brandy), and he recently planted his own vineyards.If Copper & Kings is punk rock, Osocalis is classical. Mr. Farber uses French-built Charentais stills, the same as Cognac makers, and he ages his brandy exclusively in French oak. For him, a good American brandy is a matter of interpretation and translation: taking Old World techniques and figuring out how they work in New World soils and climates, with New World grapes.\u201cI really love Cognac, Armagnac and Calvados,\u201d he said, referring to a French style of apple brandy. \u201cSo for me it\u2019s really about understanding the quality factors of traditional brandy and trying to obtain these qualities with the fruit, climate and soils we have in California.\u201dIf there is any hesitation about American brandy, particularly among old-timers, it\u2019s that they have seen this excitement before.But there is reason to believe this time is different. In the \u201980s, the liquor market hadn\u2019t been primed by a decade of rapid growth in brown spirits and craft distilling. Palates hadn\u2019t been trained for the nuances of a complex domestic spirit. And brandy, though always a solid sell in regional markets, was just a blip in the spirits business, compared with where it is today.It is also increasingly popular with bartenders. Many popular classic cocktail recipes, like the Sidecar, call for brandy, but Cognac is expensive, and many American brands are too sweet. The new generation of craft brandies solves both problems.The truly exciting thing about American brandy, though, is the range of variables \u2014 grape variety, yeast, soil, barrel, climate \u2014 that can combine to produce a vast range of styles.\u201cIt\u2019s still in the infancy of American brandy,\u201d Mr. Germain-Robin said. \u201cIt has so much potential. If people are distilling in the Finger Lakes or Virginia, we\u2019re going to have many varieties. It\u2019s unbelievable what we\u2019re going to be able to do over time.\u201dAmerican brandies are nowhere near as well known as their French cousins. Here are some bottles that offer a good introduction.A blend of varietals with a heavy dose of pinot noir, s\u00e9millon and colombard, aged for about six years. Citrus and spice notes dominate.A monster spirit drawn from a wide variety of grapes, bottled at cask strength and redolent of dark fruits and caramel.Made from a blend of Virginia-grown grapes and aged for at least two years in French oak barrels, it is the most whiskeylike of the bunch, with notes of vanilla, spices and stewed cherries.Made from upstate New York grapes and aged in used American oak barrels, with hints of vanilla, stone fruits and raisins.One of the oldest, and priciest, American brandies, No. 89 \u2014 named for 1989, the year it was distilled \u2014 is made from pinot noir and sauvignon blanc. It offers notes of banana, toasted coconut and cloves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Denies It Is Using Stolen Waymo Technology", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber denied claims from Waymo, the self-driving car company spun out of Google\u2019s parent company last year, that it is using driverless car technology stolen by a former Google employee.The component is called lidar, for light detection and ranging sensors, and it helps a self-driving car navigate. Uber said its lidar system is significantly different from Waymo\u2019s. For example, Uber said it uses four lenses while Waymo has a single-lens design.Uber also said a temporary injunction was not justified because there was no urgency to Waymo\u2019s claim, noting that Waymo did not ask for the injunction until last month despite knowing about the file downloads in October.\u201cWaymo\u2019s injunction motion is a misfire,\u201d Angela Padilla, Uber\u2019s associate general counsel, said in a statement. \u201cIf Waymo genuinely thought that Uber was using its secrets, it would not have waited more than five months to seek an injunction. Waymo doesn\u2019t meet the high bar for an injunction, which would stifle our independent innovation \u2014 probably Waymo\u2019s goal in the first place.\u201dA temporary injunction could be damaging to Uber, because it is rushing to catch up to Waymo and others in the rapidly shifting world of self-driving cars.Technology companies like Google and Apple are devoting extensive resources to putting self-driving cars on the road, while traditional automakers like Ford and General Motors are snapping up talent in the hopes of preventing technology companies from moving onto their turf.Uber said it couldn\u2019t explain his actions, because Mr. Levandowski, who is not a named defendant in the suit, was pleading the Fifth.\u201cUber never possessed \u2014 and never used \u2014 any information Mr. Levandowski allegedly took from Waymo,\u201d Uber said in its filing.Judge William Alsup in United States District Court in San Francisco said in a hearing earlier this week that since neither Uber nor Mr. Levandowski were denying that the documents were stolen, the fact that the documents had not been found in Uber\u2019s possession was not enough to stave off an injunction.\u201cUber\u2019s assertion that they\u2019ve never touched the 14,000 stolen files is disingenuous at best, given their refusal to look in the most obvious place: the computers and devices owned by the head of their self-driving program,\u201d Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman, said in a statement. He said Waymo had \u201cclear evidence\u201d that Uber was using or planned to use Waymo technology, \u201cas seen in both circuit board blueprints and filings in the State of Nevada.\u201dUber said it should not have to stop work on self-driving cars because its lidar is still in development and is based on a 2015 design from one of its employees, while the one on Uber\u2019s current self-driving car is an off-the-shelf version from a supplier.Separately, Waymo is pursuing arbitration with Mr. Levandowski and Otto\u2019s other founder, Lior Ron, also a former Google employee, accusing them of building a competitor to Google\u2019s self-driving car project while still working there.In arbitration documents, Waymo said the Otto founders tried to poach Google employees \u2014 a violation of their employment agreement. In one eye-popping detail, Waymo said Mr. Levandowski had acted disloyally even though it had paid him $120 million in bonus incentives for his work on the autonomous vehicle project.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Starting Up a Business, With Little Ones Close By", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipStart-up culture is defined by long days and nights. Shoestring budgets, thin staffing and lots of trial and error are hardly ideal conditions for any entrepreneurs, let alone working parents.Funded in a variety of ways that include bootstrapping entrepreneurs and corporate behemoths like Google, these spaces all perform vital functions. Some host meetings with a bank or investors, others help entrepreneurs learn all facets of starting a business, while some simply provide a common space to meet and talk with peers.One such space in Durham, N.C., called Nido was exactly what Ali Rudel said she needed to fulfill her dream of starting her own bakery while juggling the responsibilities of caring for her 3-year-old and 6-month-old daughters. They attended a Montessori preschool on site while she worked next door on developing her idea over 14 months.\u201cIt was especially wonderful because I was able to breast-feed, take breaks to see my kids, and I felt I was able to be very involved with what was going on in their classrooms,\u201d she said.At Nido, whose name is Italian for nest, Ms. Rudel also attended workshops on starting a business and sought feedback from the other members.\u201cNido enabled me to set up a foundation for my business,\u201d she said. She set out to raise $20,000 through Kickstarter and ultimately raised over $24,000.There are 3,900 co-working spaces in the country and approximately 11,100 worldwide, according to a 2016 report by Emergent Research, a research and consulting firm. Although there are no formal numbers on how many of those offer child care, Emergent estimates only 15 do nationwide.\u201cCo-working spaces with child care are a great idea,\u201d said Steve King, a partner at Emergent Research. \u201cThe challenge is in the implementation.\u201dThe main difficulties, Mr. King said, are the stringent regulations for running a child care site. Furthermore, running two very different businesses \u2014 an office-space firm and a day care operation \u2014 can be tricky, he said. \u201cStill with the growth of the broader co-working industry, we expect to see more,\u201d he added.Nido has beaten the odds. It began in fall 2014 in the living room of Tiffany Frye, one of its co-founders. When she was returning to work after the birth of her daughter, she wanted to build community with other like-minded parents. Seven families gathered, allowing some parents to work while others watched the young children.Today, 28 families have memberships, which start at $405 a month for two half-days a week of co-working space and school and run to $905 a month for five half-days a week.With a waiting list growing for their infant room, the founders are looking to find a new facility to allow them to expand to four classrooms from two. Ms. Frye has also hosted webinars for women across the country who hope to replicate the setup.A twist on the concept has been to add child care to existing hacker spaces \u2014 community-operated places where people who like to tinker with crafts, technology or food can meet and work on projects.\u201cI was working on an unfunded start-up project but I also had a newborn son, which is a very real obligation,\u201d said William Fertman, who lives in Berkeley, Calif.\u201cMy wife had a steady job and steady paycheck, so it was obvious I would be the one taking care of our son,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t simply disappear into an incubator for two weeks or longer and remain married.\u201dWhen his son, Leo, was a few months old, Mr. Fertman started looking for a workspace where he could also take his son.Mr. Fertman said he felt unwelcome at the hacker spaces he tried first. \u201cMany of the local hacker spaces were full of 20-something males and none of them had kids yet.\u201dHis wife, Minda Berbeco, introduced him to mothers who shared ideas on balancing parenthood with careers.\u201cI generally felt like a wet blanket showing up,\u201d Mr. Fertman said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly welcome when the conversation turned to chapped nipples and residual spotting.\u201d\u201cIt was a godsend. This was a place I could go with my baby,\u201d Mr. Fertman said. \u201cWhen he was a bit older, I brokered several deals with my cheese distributors with Leo playing next door.\u201d HackerMoms uses Berkeley students as babysitters, who charge parents $3 to $5 an hour per child.Mr. Fertman\u2019s company, which he started with a business partner, Stephanie Skinner, now has 100 active users on its test site. The site will have its formal start in September.Child care costs can be prohibitive to many start-up founders whose businesses are yet unfunded. Some entrepreneurs are applying to a Google-sponsored start-up program for parents called Campus for Moms.She wanted to expand abroad but had no idea how to tackle other markets. \u201cWe were more like a manufacturing company with one product,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had no proper business plan.\u201dMs. Sielicka-Kalczynska was accepted into the Campus for Moms in Warsaw in 2016. She received a co-working space and went in for workshops once a week for 10 weeks.Nearby were crying rooms, feeding spaces and playrooms for her young children. \u201cThe play area was a great solution because I could bring my children and not miss any of the workshops or meetings,\u201d she said.She also connected with various mentors at Google and was invited to a workshop in Palo Alto, Calif. There she learned Americans preferred stuffed animals that feel fluffier and sleeker than those favored by European shoppers, who are accustomed to simpler cotton.Google does not charge for the program or take any equity in the new companies.Ms. Sielicka-Kalczynska now has a group of Google mentors in several countries. Whisbear just won the top award at one of the biggest baby trade shows in Europe.\u201cHaving a start-up is like having another child,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really need to care about it.

{"Headline": "The Other Side of Anne of Green Gables", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "FeatureA new Netflix series aims to explore the trauma behind the heroine. Is there a risk to rewriting a beloved book?Supported byAnne Shirley is the heroine of Lucy Maud Montgomery\u2019s beloved 1908 novel, \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d the chronicle of a spirited but previously unloved orphan taken into the town of Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, Canada, by the unmarried, middle-aged siblings Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert. Over a period of years and a nearly endless series of scrapes \u2014 falling off roofs, dyeing her hair green, accidentally intoxicating her best friend \u2014 Anne transforms the hearts of everyone around her while making a home for herself. The book has sold over 50 million copies and has been translated into at least 36 languages. Polish resistance fighters took \u201cGreen Gables\u201d with them to the front; the novel became a part of the Japanese school curriculum in the orphan-filled postwar 1950s; a television show based on the series aired in Sri Lanka; and the book occupies a pre-eminent place in Canada, where \u201cGreen Gables\u201d is taught in school and featured on postage stamps \u2014 a cultural export matched only by hockey and the Mounties. While contemporaneous tales of motherless girls, like \u201cRebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,\u201d \u201cPollyanna\u201d and \u201cA Little Princess\u201d have faded from popular memory, Anne has thrived, continuing to connect with audiences as she did with Mark Twain, who once described her as \u201cthe dearest and most lovable child in fiction since the immortal Alice.\u201dAnne is also, to use the blunt jargon of the entertainment business, a strong female character with a pre-existing fan base who recently entered the public domain: an adaptation waiting to happen \u2014 again. The novel and its seven Montgomery-penned sequels have already spawned a silent movie, a talkie and more than half a dozen TV shows, including the particularly adored 1985 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation mini-series starring Megan Follows as Anne and a recently aired PBS version starring Martin Sheen as Matthew. There is also a Japanese anime; a Canadian cartoon; multiple musicals, including Canada\u2019s longest-running one; an authorized prequel novel; and the entire bustling branch of the Canadian tourism industry that is the Anne-obsessed summer season in P.E.I. Starting next month, Netflix, in collaboration with the CBC, will air \u201cAnne With an E,\u201d the latest reimagining of \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d \u2014 this time as an ambitious TV drama.\u201cAnne With an E\u201d is being overseen, written and co-produced by Moira Walley-Beckett, a \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d writer from Canada who also created \u201cFlesh and Bone,\u201d a 2015 Starz series about the physically and mentally brutal field of ballet. Walley-Beckett won an Emmy for writing \u201cOzymandias,\u201d the watch-through-your-fingers episode of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d in which the heroic cop Hank Schrader is slaughtered in the New Mexican desert because of his brother-in-law, the meth lord Walter White. This may seem like a counterintuitive credit for someone updating \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d but it is a signal of the project\u2019s aspirations. Walley-Beckett wants to bring the long-term psychological explorations, story arcs and heady themes of virtuosic TV, as well as its production values, to bear on the lighthearted, primarily episodic novel.What this means in practice is that the cheerful novel has, in Walley-Beckett\u2019s hands, become much darker. Extrapolating from asides in the text, Walley-Beckett has fleshed out minor characters; given major ones back stories; drawn out themes of gender parity, prejudice, isolation and bullying; and emphasized the trauma of Anne\u2019s childhood. On Anne\u2019s first journey to Green Gables in the new TV show, she is still, as in the book, so overcome by the beauty of a drive thick with apple trees in bloom that she renames it \u201cthe White Way of Delight.\u201d But in an invention of the show, she is also overcome by memories of being beaten by her former employer. The resulting seven-episode season, the first of a hoped-for five, all based on the first novel, is an amalgam of that which is expected from Anne Shirley (her buoyancy) and that which makes for prestigious television today (her depths).If you begin to ask why Anne has remained popular for as long as she has, you will get multiple explanations and a bounty of adjectives: She\u2019s curious. She\u2019s hopeful. She\u2019s optimistic. She\u2019s timeless. She\u2019s ahead of her time. She\u2019s imperfect, but perfectly so. She is easy to love. Everything about Anne \u2014 her disposition, her gender, her age, her provenance \u2014 is a rarity for acclaimed television. Tony Soprano, Don Draper, Walter White, Hannah Horvath and the rest of the antihero litany are infamously challenging to love, while Anne\u2019s appeal is as plain as the freckles on her face. When I mentioned to Walley-Beckett that Anne is a straightforwardly winning character, her initial reaction was to defend her as if from an undermining charge. \u201cOh, she has got some antihero stuff, which is fun,\u201d Walley-Beckett said. \u201cShe\u2019s not classically beautiful, and she has a bad temper, and she can be heedless.\u201d But then she agreed that yes, \u201cshe is a highly lovable and yummy pleasure to sit down with at night.\u201dWhen Walley-Beckett says that Anne has some antiheroic traits, she is not denigrating Anne\u2019s charms. She is making a claim for Anne\u2019s importance in the terms of our television moment, when antiheroes are seen as self-evidently fascinating but a resilient teenage girl who has been adored for over a century might be dismissed as kid\u2019s stuff. Walley-Beckett is, needless to say, hoping that \u201cAnne With an E\u201d will be meaningful to children, and especially young women, but she is very explicit about refusing to pander to them. \u201cMy bottom line is: Go deep and make the show worthy of watching,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are other versions of \u2018Anne\u2019 out there for 5-year-olds.\u201dWith her TV series, Walley-Beckett is trying to solve a riddle: If everything about \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d is what prestige TV usually avoids, how do you adapt it in a way that is both sufficiently sophisticated and yet not a betrayal of the source material? Can Anne Shirley, the yummy pleasure who has flourished by cheerfully gliding above her trauma, be transformed into an almost-antiheroine who, in the fashion of contemporary television, has to grapple with her awful past directly? And can she do so while remaining quintessentially Anne?\u201cAnne With an E\u201d was filmed briefly on P.E.I. but spent the majority of its six-month shoot at two locations in Ontario: the gum factory for interiors and a farmstead outside the small city of Pickering for exteriors. At the farmstead, the crew painted and stripped the barn; turned its main floor into a hayloft; sank its electric wires underground; fenced in the paddock; added a porch, a roof and an attic onto the farmhouse; and planted a tall tree \u2014 now dead but stapled with a smattering of autumnal leaves \u2014 just outside, so Anne would have the cherry tree mentioned in the novel to stare at reverently from her bedroom window.Walley-Beckett, who has lived in Los Angeles for the last two decades but was born and raised in and around Vancouver, is meticulous in the way of many accomplished creative people, whose imaginations are matched only by a fanatical patience for detail work. She is so devoted to giving Anne what she called a \u201cdocumentary feel\u201d that she assured me the potatoes in Marilla\u2019s pantry were period accurate. (They were smaller than supermarket behemoths but otherwise unremarkable.) She insisted on making room in the budget for a 10-foot-long burbling creek, built behind a schoolhouse also constructed from scratch, because the novel mentions that Anne and her fellow students put their milk bottles in a brook to \u201ckeep it cool and sweet until the dinner hour,\u201d an evocative detail Walley-Beckett said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t do without.\u201dYet, on this November morning, Walley-Beckett was settled into a director\u2019s chair inside Matthew Cuthbert\u2019s bedroom, full of the period, right-angled wood furniture that hurts your back just to look at it, watching as Amybeth McNulty, the 15-year-old Irish actress who plays Anne, filmed a scene that cannot be found anywhere in the novel. Walley-Beckett did not use a writer\u2019s room for \u201cAnne,\u201d writing all seven scripts herself, and told me with no little pride that she was \u201calmost completely off book.\u201d To flesh out what she hopes will be an at-least-35-hour series, she filmed new histories for Matthew and Marilla that explain how they wound up emotionally remote and unmarried; reimagined one of the novel\u2019s many spinsters as one-half of a long Boston marriage; conjured an entire character, the Cuthberts\u2019 young farmhand, Jerry, from a few of Montgomery\u2019s sentences; sent Marilla to a progressive parenting group in which \u201cfeminism\u201d is complimentarily defined; aged Anne from 11 to 13; and accentuated Anne\u2019s abusive upbringing while taking countless other liberties with the plot.Walley-Beckett has long white-blond hair and a dancer\u2019s comportment that give her the air of a romantic disguised in bluejeans. She looked on as, in the scene, Anne both lets loose her imagination and is brought up painfully by her past. Perched on a tabletop, Anne stares into a pewter plate as if it were a mirror, imagining herself to be a Princess Cordelia, talking to her servant Griselda about a new ball gown. \u201cI do so appreciate your attentions, Griselda,\u201d she says to her imaginary maid, but increasingly to herself. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to give credit where credit is due. How awful it would be to be in service to people who neglect you and treat you unkindly. I imagine it would make you feel quite small and hopeless and occasionally despairing and sometimes lacking in confidence. I wonder if those feelings ever go away.\u201dAll these details appear in the book, but Montgomery treats them with such a light touch that they often come to adult rereaders as a surprise, an unexpectedly painful subtext they may not have noticed as children. Walley-Beckett makes it manifest. In \u201cAnne With an E,\u201d Anne is constantly remembering her abuse, filmed in jerky, tightly framed, intentionally disorienting flashbacks of, for example, Mr. Hammond\u2019s dying of a heart attack while beating her with his belt. Crying babies cause her to recall Mrs. Hammond sneeringly describe her as a \u201cmiserable piece of trash.\u201dWhen she realizes that the Cuthberts do not intend to keep her, instead of exclaiming, \u201cTragical!\u201d as she does in the book, Anne falls to her knees and enters a momentary fugue state. Anne\u2019s imagination and bottomless energy are clearly presented in the TV series as coping mechanisms, a frantic and resourceful means of keeping upsetting memories at bay. \u201cI like imagining better than remembering,\u201d Anne says, always choosing between one and the other.It is Walley-Beckett\u2019s interest in trauma that attracted her to both \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cAnne of Green Gables.\u201d \u201cI am drawn to the psychology of wounded people,\u201d she says, linking Walter White to Anne Shirley like a vulture to a moth: It\u2019s true, they both fly. (To get a further sense of Walley-Beckett\u2019s typical interests: She worked on \u201cAnne With an E\u201d while on location for \u201cThe Grizzlies,\u201d a movie she wrote about teenage suicide in Nunavut territory in the Canadian Arctic.) \u201cI was extremely drawn to what it meant to be an orphan in that time,\u201d Walley-Beckett says, \u201cwhat it meant to not belong, what it meant to be derided and abused and maintain the forthright, determined optimism and point of view that Anne has.\u201d If, in \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d hints of Anne\u2019s suffering occasionally waft by, like feathers that escaped from a down pillow, in \u201cAnne\u201d the feathers hang as heavy as if there had just been a pillow fight.Viewers familiar with the books and previous adaptations may feel when watching \u201cAnne With an E\u201d that the emphasis is on the wrong syllable, while also finding something provoking and substantive in the new pronunciation. Walley-Beckett\u2019s series is recognizably \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d but with a grimmer feel. Anne still, for example, smashes a slate over the head of her future husband, Gilbert Blythe, when he has the temerity to call her \u201cCarrots,\u201d but this is no longer foreplay; it\u2019s the culmination of many weeks of bullying, including by an older boy who calls her a \u201ctalking dog\u201d because she is an orphan. Even the show\u2019s handsome look, which Walley-Beckett developed with the director Niki Caro (\u201cWhale Rider\u201d), is naturalistic and washed-out, evoking sepia despite being in color.Anne\u2019s transformations are easy to see as part of a trend in TV and film, one in which suffering has become indistinguishable from gravitas and even the most cheerful superheroes come complete with psychological baggage. In a world where Superman no longer smiles, Archie Andrews is an ennui-filled singer-songwriter and Belle\u2019s mother in \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d tragically dies of the plague, of course Anne has PTSD. But this new interpretation of Anne also treats a young, female character with the attention and focus often reserved for difficult men and the perversions of their machismo. In emphasizing Anne\u2019s past, Walley-Beckett may be roughing up a sunny tale, but she is also insisting that a plucky 13-year-old girl is as worthy a subject as anyone. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point in doing \u2018Anne\u2019 in a way that\u2019s been done, that\u2019s very charming, teacups and doilies and \u2018Oh, Anne\u2019s in another scrape,\u2019\u2009\u201d Walley-Beckett told me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the most realistic way to show the way a girl like this, from a strange place, with enormous prejudices against her, would move through the world?\u201dAnne longs to be beautiful. Not only does she wish for her hair to turn a more dignified auburn, she also tells her best friend, Diana Barry, \u201cI\u2019d rather be pretty than clever.\u201d Praying at Marilla\u2019s behest, she asks God to let her stay at Green Gables and to \u201cplease let me be good-looking when I grow up.\u201d She loves pretty things, because she has had none, and swoons over cherry blossoms, an amethyst brooch and the possibility of one day having a stylish dress with puffed sleeves, which sensible Marilla refuses to make for her.If \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d were written today, it is easy to imagine that over the course of the book, Anne would come to learn that none of these externalities matter: not the color of her hair, not the sleeves of her dress. Instead, in the novel, her hair mellows to the coveted auburn, and Matthew, in a moment of tremendous fatherly kindness, gives her a dress with puffed sleeves. Rather than dispense the message that it\u2019s only what\u2019s on the inside that counts, \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d conveys something more nuanced, that beauty can be a pleasure, that costumes can provide succor, that the right dress can improve your life \u2014 all things that adults know to be true, sometimes, but that we try to simplify for our children.\u201cGreen Gables\u201d is rife with complications like these; it\u2019s an artifact from a different time that, instead of being outdated, speaks to ours in an uncanned, unpredictable voice. Anne has survived for so long because she is more sophisticated than she initially seems.The book, in a manner that is rare for young-adult novels even now, is a celebration of Anne\u2019s intelligence, which is ultimately cherished by her adoptive parents, her community and her future partner, Gilbert \u2014 who is also her closest academic rival and who instead of being threatened by Anne\u2019s brain admires her for it. And yet at the end of \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d Anne quits college and returns to the farm to care for an ailing Marilla, never becoming the writer she wanted to be as a child. This is, perhaps, a disappointing ending (and one that presages a string of follow-up novels in which Anne eventually becomes muted by family life), but it is an honest one: We still live in a world where a woman\u2019s intellect does not preclude her from accruing vast domestic responsibilities.\u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d is also a romance, but a slow-burning one. Anne can\u2019t stand Gilbert until the final pages of the first novel, her attentions turned less to love than her friendship with Diana. In the middle of the third novel in the series, \u201cAnne of the Island,\u201d Anne is still putting Gilbert off, rejecting his proposal of marriage. It is not until the beginning of the fifth book, \u201cAnne\u2019s House of Dreams,\u201d by which point Anne has had other suitors and other proposals, that the two are finally married, going on to have seven children. For all her curiosity, imagination and education, Anne eventually arrives at the traditional ending: a husband, a family and all the attendant duties, the nonconforming woman who conforms. But the novels do not present this as either a great tragedy or a great victory. Instead, these choices look a lot like the fraught and difficult compromises of adulthood, in which you might put aside personal desires to care for your mother or modify your career goals to accommodate children. We would flatter ourselves to think that there is anything particularly old-fashioned about Anne\u2019s trajectory. She is a thoroughly modern girl.\u201cEighties polyester?\u201d Walley-Beckett countered, as if polyester were a bad taste in her mouth.This may sound innocuous enough, but to a certain subset of \u201cGreen Gables\u201d fans, those are fighting words. Walley-Beckett\u2019s series is contending with memories not only of the novel, but also of the 1985 mini-series, which is so beloved among a certain group of \u201cGreen Gables\u201d admirers \u2014 probably women, of impressionable age in the \u201980s, perhaps from Canada, where it was one of the highest-rated programs that had ever aired \u2014 that it has surpassed the books as the canonical text. (\u201cCan \u2018Anne of Green Gables\u2019 overcome 30 years of nostalgia?\u201d an article published in The Guardian recently wondered, as if the 1985 series, not the book, were the original.) The mini-series ensorcelled a generation of \u201cGreen Gables\u201d lovers with its own interpretation of Montgomery\u2019s novel, one that was faithful to the tone of the book but emphasized the romance between Anne and Gilbert. If you think of \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d as a love story and swoon at the name Gilbert Blythe, chances are you watched the mini-series. The director, Kevin Sullivan, accentuated the blooming (and admittedly captivating) romance between Gilbert and Anne to the extent that the scholar Susan Drain argued that the novel\u2019s \u201ccareful character-building had been sacrificed to the television love story\u201d in a 1987 academic article titled \u201cToo Much Lovemaking: \u2018Anne of Green Gables\u2019 on Television.\u201dBut just as evidence of Anne and Gilbert\u2019s love story exists in the text of the first novel, and was drawn out by Sullivan, so does the trauma that Walley-Beckett stresses. The last book Montgomery wrote in the Anne series, \u201cThe Blythes Are Quoted,\u201d is a structurally experimental and grim volume of poetry and short stories, concerning the death of one of Anne\u2019s children, World War I, adultery and murder. It is so wholly a departure from what came before that it was not published in its entirety until 2009, despite purportedly having arrived on Montgomery\u2019s publisher\u2019s doorstep the day she died in 1942.A bleaker interpretation of \u201cGreen Gables\u201d is further supported by the life of L.M. Montgomery herself. Montgomery\u2019s mother died when she was an infant, and her father left her to be raised by her cold grandparents in Cavendish, P.E.I., the future model for Anne\u2019s Avonlea. A high-spirited young woman, at odds with her caregivers, she nonetheless spent years caring for her aging grandmother, eventually marrying a depressive preacher while contending with her own mood disorder. \u201cMontgomery was a woman who wrote about expansive, sunny worlds,\u201d says the professor Mavis Reimer, an Anne scholar who holds the Chair in Young People\u2019s Texts and Cultures at the University of Winnipeg, \u201cbut she lived in a dark little room.\u201d She may have committed suicide. Her official cause of death was coronary thrombosis, but a note was found by her bed that read, in part: \u201cMy position is too awful to endure and nobody realizes it. What an end to a life in which I tried always to do my best in spite of many mistakes.\u201dBut as Margaret Atwood wrote in an essay on the occasion of the \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d centenary, \u201cThe presiding genius of \u2018Anne\u2019 is not the gritty gray Angel of Realism, but the rainbow-\u200bcolored, dove-winged Godlet of the Heart\u2019s Desire.\u201d Montgomery\u2019s life may have been hard, but her writing, purposefully, was not. In another of her novels, \u201cEmily\u2019s Quest,\u201d Emily\u2019s teacher offers his pupil a bit of advice: \u201cDon\u2019t be led away by those howls about realism. Remember \u2014 pine woods are just as real as pigsties and a darn sight pleasanter to be in.\u201d It is not an accident that young readers finish \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d feeling as comforted as the odd child who has found a kindred spirit: They are meant to.You can concede that shaking things up is the creatively fulfilling spirit in which to undertake an adaptation (Say something new!) while also recognizing that adaptations of beloved stories, particularly those worshiped by those sticklers for repetition known as children, will always be subject to reactionary desires (Say something familiar!). We want dear tales to be as we recall them, even as we rely on memories formed when we understood less but could wonder more. It doesn\u2019t matter how accomplished, how polished, how heady and period-perfect \u201cAnne With an E\u201d may be: We want Anne to be as we remember her \u2014 even if we don\u2019t remember her that well.For all the changes that Walley-Beckett has made in adapting \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d she understands this sentiment. \u201cI take nothing away from Anne,\u201d Walley-Beckett insists. \u201cShe is buoyant, she\u2019s optimistic, she\u2019s bright, she\u2019s fiery, she\u2019s sunny, she\u2019s imaginative, she\u2019s curious. I just add in the reality of her history.\u201dAnd so in addition to drawing out the darkness embedded within the text, Walley-Beckett has also included lovely and entirely concocted moments that match the sweetness of the novel, like when Matthew and Marilla ask Anne to sign her name in the Cuthbert family Bible and make herself, officially, one of them. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we hold hands over a running stream and pledge ourselves to each other as Cuthberts forever, or prick our fingers and mingle our blood as a symbol of our lasting devotion?\u201d Anne wonders, by way of asking for a grand ceremony to mark the occasion, before settling instead for a celebratory glass of raspberry cordial and a signature. \u201cWith this pen,\u201d Anne says, her hands shaking, \u201cI take you, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, to be my family forever, to call you mine and to be yours, for always.\u201d Then she writes down her name.Because of a transcription error, an article on April 30 about a new Netflix series based on \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d included an incorrect word in dialogue from the series. The character Anne Shirley says, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we hold hands over a running stream and pledge ourselves to each other as Cuthberts forever, or prick our fingers and mingle our blood as a symbol of our lasting devotion?\u201d The character does not say \u201cbreak our fingers.\u201dWilla Paskin is the television critic at Slate.Advertisement"}
