{"Headline": "No \u2018Death Spiral\u2019: Insurers May Soon Profit From Obamacare Plans, Analysis Finds", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byIn contrast to the dire pronouncements from President Trump and other Republicans, the demise of the individual insurance market seems greatly exaggerated, according to a new financial analysis released Friday.The analysis, by Standard & Poor\u2019s, looked at the performance of many Blue Cross plans in nearly three dozen states since President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law took effect three years ago. It shows the insurers significantly reduced their losses last year, are likely to break even this year and that most could profit \u2014 albeit some in the single-digits \u2014 in 2018. The insurers cover more than five million people in the individual market.After years in which many insurers lost money, then lost even more in 2015, \u201cwe are seeing the first signs in 2016 that this market could be manageable for most health insurers,\u201d the Standard & Poor\u2019s analysts said. The \u201cmarket is not in a \u2018death spiral,\u2019 \u201d they said.It is the latest evidence that the existing law has not crippled the market where individuals can buy health coverage, although several insurers have pulled out of some markets, including two in Iowa just this week. They and other industry specialists have cited the uncertainty surrounding the Congressional debate over the law, and the failed effort two weeks ago by House Republicans to bring a bill to the floor for a vote.\u201cThings are getting better,\u201d Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said of the insurance markets. The foundation has been closely tracking the insurers\u2019 progress.Although it took longer than expected, the insurers appear to be starting to understand how the new individual market works, said Deep Banerjee, an S.&P. credit analyst who helped write the report. The companies have aggressively increased their prices, so they are now largely covering their medical costs, Mr. Banerjee said. They have also significantly narrowed their networks to include fewer doctors and hospitals as a way to lower those costs.In 2016, the number of companies whose medical costs exceeded their premiums fell by half, to nine of the 32 Blue Cross companies included in the S.&P. analysis. The improvement signaled the potential for profit margins to increase. A few plans, notably Florida Blue, are already profitable. The report released on Friday did not include Anthem\u2019s for-profit Blue Cross plans, which span 14 states.Mr. Banerjee warned that the market is still fragile, and he said insurers needed more time to figure out how to make the business work. While the market is very much alive, he said, it is \u201cstill in critical care. It still needs time to improve.\u201dThe S.&P. report represents some good news in a market that has proved more than challenging to the health insurers. Most insurers have struggled to make money, and several companies reported losses that ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars.The insurers\u2019 latest withdrawals are helping to fuel Republicans\u2019 arguments that they have no choice but to repeal the law. Mr. Trump has continued to proclaim that he believes the market will collapse without a new law.It is unclear what he and Congress will do to fundamentally change the insurers\u2019 projections for next year. While Mr. Banerjee predicted insurers would probably raise their prices only moderately next year, he said questions over whether there would be as much government financing could lead to much sharper increases. The companies appear likely to make money in 2018, but \u201cthere are external events that could stop that,\u201d he said.Under the Republican proposal, called the American Health Care Act, several provisions could upend coverage for a variety of customers, Mr. Claxton said. The insurers could be selling to a new group of customers, if lower-income customers lose the subsidies they now receive and cannot afford higher prices.Mr. Claxton warned that there could be markets that would have no insurance companies offering coverage, particularly in rural areas where there were not many to begin with. \u201cHow to fix that was always going to be an issue,\u201d he said.Caroline Pearson, a senior executive at Avalere Health, predicted that more insurers would decide there was no real future for the market, given the political environment. Even if they are close to making money, they may decide it is not worth the headache. Many of the companies are still losing money or are at risk of losing money if they sign up too many people who are sick.\u201cIf you are an insurer and think the exchange is here to stay, your tolerance for annual losses is higher,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s a long-term strategy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fewer Tomatoes in Ketchup? East Europeans Pursue Parity at the Grocery", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byBRATISLAVA, Slovakia \u2014 When Simona Budinska, a 31-year-old public relations specialist, had trouble finding lactose-free products at her local grocery, she and her husband began driving across the border to Austria, where the stores were teeming with choices.But it was not the variety of products on the shelves as much as what was in them that stunned the couple. \u201cThe washing powder was just much more effective, and the ketchup contained more tomatoes than the Slovak one,\u201d Ms. Budinska said.The countries of Eastern and Central Europe have long bridled at being treated like the poor cousins of the European Union family. It does not help that even after more than a dozen years in the bloc, wages remain lower, corruption persists and public services, like schools and hospitals, are far scruffier.But now that sense of resentment \u2014 of being treated as second-class citizens by more prosperous neighbors \u2014 is reaching even into the region\u2019s refrigerators and cupboards. With rising passion, prominent politicians and local news media have taken up the issue of whether Eastern Europeans are being sold inferior products.Last month, the leaders of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic went so far as to ask the European Commission to investigate the complaint, which has been backed up in recent years by several studies, though not exhaustive ones.\u201cPeople who are bothered about this trend tend to be young, middle class and higher income,\u201d said Daniel Prokop, head of social and political research at Median, a private polling and marketing agency in Prague. \u201cPoliticians need some enemies to mobilize support. And they like the food issue, because it can be blamed on foreigners.\u201dFood producers and industry analysts point out that it is common for ingredients to differ from country to country, sometimes to favor local producers, sometimes to appease local tastes and, yes, sometimes to increase profits by substituting cheaper ingredients.But bitter Eastern Europeans insist that their situation is different. They are part of the European Union, a common market, and they believe that means that food quality should remain constant throughout all 28 nations.\u201cWe cannot allow our citizens to be considered second class,\u201d said Gabriela Matecna, Slovakia\u2019s agriculture minister. \u201cSlovak consumers, just like consumers from other countries of the European Union, have the right to get the same quality of food when it comes to the same brand from the same producer.\u201dWith parliamentary elections set for the fall, the food issue has gotten an even bigger push next door in the Czech Republic. Marian Jurecka, minister of agriculture there, has been leading the charge on the issue since 2015.He denies that it has anything to do with politics. But the populist party leading in the polls was created by Andrej Babis, an oligarch currently serving as finance minister, whose holdings include some of the country\u2019s leading food producers.\u201cWe will ask the European Commission to adopt the suitable legislation as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Fico said this year, \u201cto stop the practices that degrade the citizens of Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.\u201dWhile rumors that inferior food is shipped to the East have swirled for years, only in 2011 did the Slovak Association of Consumers conduct a comparison of a basket of products purchased in Austria with the same products bought in Slovakia.In all but one case, the products in the East were inferior, the group concluded.This led Olga Sehnalova, a Czech member of the European Parliament, to take up the cause. She conducted a test with her own basket of products and found half were inferior.\u201cRegrettably, I had to confirm that differences were really found, and not in terms of something being more or less tasty but in the quality of the basic ingredients,\u201d Ms. Sehnalova said.The Czechs found that many brand-name products \u2014 M\u00f6venpick bourbon vanilla ice cream, Carbonell extra virgin olive oil, Heinz ketchup \u2014 were identical whether purchased in Germany or in the Czech Republic.But when differences were found in other products, lesser quality in the East was almost always the result.Rama Classic margarine had lower fat content. Pepsi-Cola, Sprite and Nestea used fructose as a sweetener in the Czech Republic, but actual sugar in Germany. Canned luncheon meat sold under the Tulip brand was all pork in Germany, but it included \u201cmechanically separated poultry meat\u201d in the Czech Republic.Officials at Rama did not respond to requests for comment. But the differences are obvious to Jens Hansen, a spokesman for Danish Crown, which makes Tulip products.\u201cIt is two different products sold under two different names in two different countries,\u201d he said, adding that a quick look at the list of ingredients makes that clear.Ms. Sehnalova, though, said the Czechs conducting the study had taken into account the entire \u201cvisual impact\u201d of the products, including their packaging and label design, before deciding to compare them.\u201cLess meat, more additives and other indicators to justify saying that the quality is lower,\u201d Ms. Sehnalova said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we found.\u201dThus far, the only studies conducted have been between Germany and the Czech Republic, and Slovakia and Austria, and these have involved only a small sampling. But officials from the region now want all Europe Union countries to undergo testing, to determine how widespread the issue is.Food producers and industry experts insist there are often sound reasons for products to differ between countries: local tastes, a preference for local ingredients, divergent buying patterns.The Czech Republic gets fructose syrup, he said, but so do Spain and the United States. Germany gets cane or beet sugar, but so do Austria and many other countries.The Czech Association for Branded Products said its products met all European Union regulations. If contents do change from country to country, the difference is reflected on the ingredients label.\u201cSpecial attention is given to providing consumers with comprehensive information about the products, including detailed specifications of ingredients on the label, enabling them to make a qualified choice,\u201d the association said in a statement.That has done little to allay a sense of resentment among many Eastern consumers.\u201cIt is absolutely proven that the product are inferior here,\u201d said Helena Tomkova, 43, who runs a public relations agency in Bratislava, the Slovakian capital. \u201cFoods are different, but also household products, like laundry detergent. The soaps sold here are not as concentrated.\u201dBusiness is growing, with plans to expand into the Czech Republic.\u201cFood quality is an issue that some care about, some don\u2019t,\u201d said Mr. Prokop, of the marketing and polling agency in Prague. \u201cBut for those who do, it is a potent issue.\u201dHana de Goeij contributed reporting from Prague, and Miroslava Germanova from Bratislava.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Budget Leaves New York-Area Transit Projects Up in the Air", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byWhen the new president is a lifelong New Yorker promising a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, many believed New York would be first in line to benefit from the spending spree.But only two months into President Trump\u2019s administration, elected leaders in New York and New Jersey are alarmed that some of the most high-profile and crucial transit projects in the region are already on the chopping block.That project is considered essential to helping alleviate congestion on the subway system, especially on the nearby Lexington Avenue line, the nation\u2019s most crowded subway. A new Hudson River tunnel is needed to remedy a deteriorating bottleneck and improve rail service throughout the Northeast.\u201cThis is a dagger to the heart of the Gateway project that is so vital to our economy,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a vocal critic of Mr. Trump on many issues, said in an interview.Mr. Schumer, a Democrat and the Senate minority leader, said he would fight the cuts to New Starts, a program that has benefited large cities with ambitious projects.\u201cNew York is No. 1 on the list because we\u2019re the biggest city, and we\u2019re by far and away the biggest mass-transit city,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed cuts have reverberated across the country with transit agencies worried that an array of projects could be halted or delayed, including a subway extension in Los Angeles, a light rail plan in Maryland and a rapid transit bus line in Kansas City, Mo. Over all, the Department of Transportation\u2019s budget would be cut by 13 percent, or $2.4 billion.Mr. Trump\u2019s budget suggested that new transit projects should rely on local financing \u2014 a major shift in how such projects have been financed in recent decades. Still, it is early in the budget process, and Congress will weigh in on the cuts in the coming months.\u201cThese agencies count on a strong federal partner,\u201d said Andrew Brady, senior director for government affairs at the American Public Transportation Association. \u201cThere has been a federal role in public transportation since Ronald Reagan put it there.\"President Reagan signed a law in 1983 that raised the federal gas tax and reserved some of the money for public transit projects. The New Starts grant program was created in 1991 under the Federal Transit Administration, though conservative voices like the Heritage Foundation want to see it eliminated. Under Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, only New Starts projects that have already secured full financing agreements would receive money.Officials are moving forward with a $4.8 billion proposal to extend a train line west through San Jose, Calif., to the city of Santa Clara, said Stacey Hendler Ross, a spokeswoman for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority. The agency is not \u201cpanicking yet,\u201d she said, since it is early in the budget process. Officials plan to request $1.5 billion in federal funding.\u201cIt\u2019s such a strong project for the economic vitality of this region,\u201d she said.The trillion-dollar question is how Mr. Trump\u2019s broader infrastructure proposal could affect public transit and how it would be paid for. The new transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said recently that the initiative would be unveiled this year and that, in addition to transportation, it could focus on energy, water, broadband and veterans hospitals.As the Trump administration develops the plan, it is possible that major transit expansion projects could be part of the initiative, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak about the plan while it was still under discussion. The official said a key component would be partnerships with the private sector to complete infrastructure projects.In New York, Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats, have criticized the transportation cuts and other budget proposals that could hurt the city. The next phase of the Second Avenue subway is expected to cost about $6 billion, and officials planned to rely on $2 billion in New Starts funding. It is unclear if the project could proceed without federal funding.\u201cDefunding all of New Starts has a very big impact on us, and we hope that won\u2019t happen,\u201d said Fernando Ferrer, the acting chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that runs New York\u2019s subway, buses and commuter railroads.The first three stations of the Second Avenue subway finally opened on the Upper East Side this year after nearly a century of planning and debate. The second phase would extend the line to 125th Street \u2014 an expansion officials say is critical during a period of booming subway ridership.The saga surrounding a new train tunnel under the Hudson River has also been tumultuous. Mr. Christie, a Republican who once led Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, has thrown his support behind the Gateway project. But nearly seven years ago, Mr. Christie canceled an earlier plan because of cost concerns.Since then, officials have grown increasingly anxious about the century-old tunnel currently used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains. It was damaged by Hurricane Sandy and needs major repairs.\u201cWhether it ultimately comes from New Starts money or from a new infrastructure program that\u2019s passed sometime this year is really of no moment to me,\u201d Mr. Christie told reporters. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to, you know, go jumping off the cliff quite yet.\u201d\u201cNew York has the most ambitious building plan in the nation, and it\u2019s absurd the federal government claimed these projects were a priority one day and then cut funding for them the next,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.Mr. Schumer had even harsher words for the Trump administration.\u201cHow can you say you believe in dramatically increasing infrastructure and submit a budget this way?\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a total contradiction. It\u2019s schizophrenic.\u201dCommuters have recently received a preview of how traveling between the two states could become a nightmare if the current tunnel is closed for emergency repairs. Last month, an Amtrak train derailed near the tunnel, closing half of Pennsylvania Station\u2019s tracks and leading to widespread train cancellations and delays. Then on Monday, a New Jersey Transit train derailed in the same area, setting off another round of delays.\u201cWithout this project and this tunnel, that becomes the day-to-day existence for commuters, and I don\u2019t think anybody wants that to happen,\u201d said Carlo A. Scissura, the president of the New York Building Congress, a group that represents the city\u2019s construction industry.\u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent designed,\u201d Mr. Porcari said. \u201cThe permits are in hand. It\u2019s literally ready to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chapel That Survived Sept. 11 Attacks May Not Survive Rent Increase", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byIn the stench and smolder that followed the Sept. 11 attacks, emergency workers ripped the pews out of the little Roman Catholic chapel opposite the World Trade Center site in Battery Park City in Manhattan and used the church as a command station. As the weeks passed, the pastor erected a tent outside to celebrate Mass. The interior was used by the workers at ground zero as a place for food, rest and counseling.When residents of Battery Park City began returning home three months later, they were determined to restore the chapel, St. Joseph\u2019s. So the parish held a national fund-raising drive. It commissioned sacred artworks for the space to amplify the theme of rebirth. The chapel was rebuilt as both a prayer space and a Catholic memorial to the horrors and heroism of Sept. 11, 2001.Now the little chapel itself is on the verge of destruction.As a result of the neighborhood\u2019s recovery, which the chapel helped bring about, St. Joseph\u2019s rent more than tripled in 2014, to $264,000 a year. Since then, the parish has been borrowing money from the Archdiocese of New York to cover the cost, but the parish\u2019s new pastor and its Finance Council have decided that the debt is not sustainable.Parishioners say their pastor, the Rev. Jarlath Quinn, has informed them that the chapel will close by June unless a miracle occurs. They are expecting to hear from the landlord this week about possible further rent reductions.The fight to save the chapel is led by a small, mostly female group of Battery Park City parishioners, most of whom lived through the attacks and cherish the chapel as a link to Sept. 11. The group has been trying to raise a public outcry about the closing and promote fund-raising.What is confusing matters, they say, is that their own pastor has been steadily reducing the chapel\u2019s role in the parish rather than embracing their efforts.To save money, St. Joseph\u2019s Chapel is closed on weekday mornings and on Saturdays, when tourists often want to visit. Its longstanding, thriving religious instruction program for children has been moved a half-mile away to the main church in the parish, St. Peter\u2019s, just north of the World Trade Center site.St. Joseph\u2019s is the only house of worship in Battery Park City, a park-filled, state-run enclave of roughly 13,000 residents just west of the World Trade Center site. Once a largely middle-class neighborhood, it is now a place of luxury apartments and high-end shopping malls.\u201cThe world ended, and everyone said, \u2018Never forget,\u2019\u201d said Amy McCarthy Koethe, 52, a parishioner whose memories of the attacks are so vivid that she still cries when she recounts them. \u201cWe are essentially making people forget, because we have basically sanitized Battery Park City of every single reminder of the attacks.\u201dShe added, \u201cWe are fighting to keep this open, but we are also uncertain about the intentions of the archdiocese and our current pastor, which makes it very disheartening.\u201dSome opacity surrounds the church\u2019s situation. The archdiocese says that the decision to close the chapel lies squarely with the parish and that it has not threatened to cut off the loans to cover the rent.\u201cThey are trying to be good stewards of not only the parish\u2019s money, but also the archdiocese\u2019s money,\u201d said Joseph Zwilling, the archdiocese spokesman, referring to the parish\u2019s leaders.St. Joseph\u2019s pastor, Father Quinn, referred all questions about St. Joseph\u2019s Chapel to Mr. Zwilling.The parish, which consists of St. Peter\u2019s, St. Joseph\u2019s and another downtown church, Our Lady of the Rosary, borrowed $540,000 from the New York Archdiocese last year to cover the rent and other deficits, the financial statement states. Parishes are supposed to be self-sustaining and pay an annual tax of 8 percent of collections to the archdiocese.\u201cThe trustees and the members of the Finance Council believe that this significant operating loss is not sustainable and that parish expenses must be brought in line with operating revenue,\u201d the balance sheet states.The parishioners say Father Quinn has told them that means they will vacate St. Joseph\u2019s this spring unless something changes, even though the lease ends in 2019. The apparent decision to stop borrowing money for rent perplexes both the parishioners and a former pastor, the Rev. Kevin V. Madigan, who led the chapel on Sept. 11 and through its rededication.\u201cIt\u2019s not like a debt collector is going to come after you,\u201d Father Madigan said. \u201cThe archdiocese doesn\u2019t come after parishes to pay them back loans.\u201dMr. Zwilling said the loans would need to be repaid only if the parish came into a financial windfall, such as from a sale of property.St. Joseph\u2019s Chapel is an unassuming, low-ceilinged place, tucked into the ground floor of the residential complex behind the tall office towers that line the West Side Highway. It was moved to its current location, about a block and a half from the World Trade Center site, in 1983; the original church next to the twin towers was demolished to make way for an office building that was never built. There are three Masses each Sunday. During the week, workers visit at lunchtime.Because of the small space, it is easy to see everyone who comes to services, creating a sense of community, Father Madigan said. \u201cBasically, it was hard to get lost there,\u201d he said.Kate Megna, 31, who was praying before noon Mass at the church on a recent weekday, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not grand, like St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. You are here for your faith and for God. It\u2019s very pure.\u201dThe parishioners who are fighting for the chapel to stay open point to the intensive effort by the Greek Orthodox Church two blocks away to rebuild St. Nicholas Church, which was destroyed on Sept. 11 and is soon to reopen as a national shrine. Roughly $38 million was raised for the striking project, on the southern end of the World Trade Center site.But the possible closing of St. Joseph\u2019s Chapel has not been the subject of a fund-raising effort by the archdiocese, or even a public statement by Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop.\u201cThe cardinal has confidence in the pastor and people of the parish that they will do what is appropriate for the overall good of the parish,\u201d Mr. Zwilling said.As rent negotiations continued, the LeFrak organization provided a statement: \u201cGateway has generously and unilaterally offered a significant reduction in rent to the church \u2014 well below the rent called for by the church\u2019s lease \u2014 as a community gesture to Battery Park City and awaits resolution from the church.\u201d\u201cWhile the state has no role in the discussions between the church and its landlord, St. Joseph\u2019s is an iconic part of the neighborhood, and we hope the parties can reach an agreement that allows the church to remain in its location,\u201d it said in a statement.Advertisement"}

For Some, It\u2019s Life and Death", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byTom Sheridan opened his lobbying firm in 1991 with the motto \u201cHelping the good do better,\u201d and these days he could use all the help he can get.As a left-leaning lobbyist for the nonprofit sector, his job is getting the voices of groups like the American Cancer Society, Save the Children Action Network and the ONE Campaign (which fights poverty and disease) heard in Washington. Over the years he has gotten support from both political parties for a variety of causes with the help of celebrities like the Irish rock star Bono and the actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Jennifer Garner.When administrations change, there is a normal ebb and flow of political appointees and an inevitable shift in focus for power brokers. Everyone adjusts to a new normal, identifies where opportunities are and finds point-people in the White House and on Capitol Hill who can advance their agendas.But everything changed in January, with the new administration determined to slash budgets and minimizing priorities for anything not related to the military and Homeland Security.Domestic and international development groups face proposed deep cuts in federal funds, and so do social programs that include meals for older adults, work-study programs for college students, programs to help homeless veterans and support for the arts and public broadcasting. Conservatives have come to power before, but Mr. Sheridan says the tone is different this time.Whereas in prior handovers nonprofits faced a fight for keeping or increasing their share of federal support, this time they face extinction. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a political threat, it\u2019s life and death,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said by phone in March. \u201cWe\u2019re not fighting ideology. It\u2019s raw politics and a culture that is extremely new. Many are not equipped to handle it.\u201dFederal funding to support nonprofits has been a Republican bugaboo since the Reagan era, when policy priorities focused on cutting taxes and giving states more of a say in allocating the funds directed to them by Washington. Mr. Reagan shifted to a system of block grants to states for services related to aging, children and mental health. And those grants have been a favorite target for elimination by Republican lawmakers in recent years.Still, there have been opportunities for widespread support for some causes. Mr. Sheridan, a social worker by training, began his lobbying career in the late 1980s, representing AIDS activists pushing for a federal response to the growing health crisis. Their work led to two early achievements: the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Ryan White Care Act, which funded H.I.V. and AIDS research and treatment, both signed into law by George H.W. Bush.The Clinton administration created the national volunteer organization AmeriCorps in 1993 under the Corporation for National and Community Service, the new name for a federal agency established during the George H.W. Bush administration to help advance his \u201c1,000 points of light\u201d vision of national service.AmeriCorps would become a big vehicle steering how the federal government finances community programs such as local disaster services, youth education, financial literacy programs and affordable housing through Habitat for Humanity.In 2001, George W. Bush came to office promising his own brand of \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d an opportunity Mr. Sheridan seized upon. Senator Edward Kennedy introduced him to Bobby Shriver, a Kennedy nephew, and along with Bono, they helped push through the bipartisan emergency AIDS relief program for Africa. The program devoted $1.1 billion last year to medicine and prevention programs through government and development agencies.In 2009, again with bipartisan support, President Barack Obama authorized the expansion of AmeriCorps and created the Social Innovation Fund, designed to match government grants with private sector investments to finance programs on chronic homelessness, unemployment, mental health and early childhood education. In eight years it has invested more than $1 billion (about $300 million of government money) in 469 nonprofit organizations.Financing such programs in a way that appeals to Republicans and Democrats has been a major effort, says Mark Shriver, the president of the Save the Children Action Network, an advocacy arm of the nonprofit group, which focuses on early childhood education and maternal and child health care. He has been talking to both parties, attending political conventions last summer and having conversations with the administration and lawmakers at the state level.\u201cYou need to have solutions that are palatable to both sides,\u201d said Mr. Shriver, who is Bobby Shriver\u2019s brother.Social impact bonds are one of those ideas. Essentially, they are loans from the investors who buy the bonds to social services programs. If the programs are successful, the private investors get paid back. Eight projects financed by them emerged in the last years of the Obama administration with mixed results. But they have the backing of big banks like Goldman Sachs and wealthy investors like Chicago\u2019s Pritzker family foundation, which teamed up on a bond to support a Utah preschool program.Nonprofits are bracing for what\u2019s next. President Trump\u2019s proposed budget eliminates the Corporation for National and Community Service, and with it would go AmeriCorps, a related program called Senior Corps for older volunteers and the Social Innovation Fund.A mini-version of this played out in 2013 when Congress failed to make required budget cuts, triggering an immediate reduction in funds to a wide range of defense and civilian programs. As Mr. Sheridan wrote in The Huffington Post at the time, millions of older adults received fewer meals, tens of thousands of children lost access to early education in Head Start, and research on cancer and AIDS was halted.\u201cRarely in our nation\u2019s modern history have the differences of our political parties put our nation at such risk,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWalking the halls of Congress, veteran lawmakers and their staff are asking themselves, \u2018Has it ever been this bad?\u2019 The standard answer among most is, \u2018No, it really hasn\u2019t.\u2019\u201dWhat does he think of the current climate? \u201cThis is going to be a fight unlike one we\u2019ve ever had before,\u201d he said.They are merely proposals for now. If the health care legislation in Congress is any indicator, Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to push through his whole budget may be limited.\u201cThere is a ramped-up harsh tone that\u2019s generating fear that I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Tim Delaney, the chief executive of the National Council of Nonprofits, who says he and his staff have pulled a lot of all-nighters recently because of the significant increase in activity. \u201cHyperpartisanship is ripping our country apart. We have to bridge the divide and bring people together.\u201dHe is fighting to protect the tax deduction on charitable donations and make it universally available, because reductions in giving would have devastating consequences for food banks, art groups and other community-based charities.At the state level, Republicans have shown a willingness to play ball, Mark Shriver said. Governor Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican whom the Save the Children Action Network spent $1 million trying to defeat in last year\u2019s election, recently proposed a $9 million program for all-day kindergarten in some of the state\u2019s neediest communities. The Save the Children Action Network has been running media spots in the state praising the proposal.Tax policy could be an opportunity for nonprofits, Mr. Sheridan said. Along with immigration, trade and health care reform, Mr. Trump came to office on the promise of a tax overhaul. The Save the Children Action Network has proposed expanding tax credits and deductions for supporting early childhood education, in just one example.\u201cBillionaires would get a lot,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said, \u201cbut we would get something, and even a little is good.\u201dHis work fighting for AIDS research and treatment in the 1980s, up against very vocal opponents such as Senator Jesse Helms, taught him a few lessons. \u201cIt taught me the airplane theory,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. \u201cYou need a right wing and a left wing to run an effective social change movement.\u201dHe needed the \u201ccraziness\u201d of Senator Helms pitted against the antics of Act Up, the vocal AIDS activists, because together the upheaval disrupted the status quo and got people to focus on compromise, Mr. Sheridan said: Once threatened with the extreme from both sides, the people tasked with setting policy in motion \u201cwill always choose the middle.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Up to 100,000 Taxpayers Compromised in Fafsa Tool Breach, I.R.S. Says", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Internal Revenue Service said on Thursday that the personal data of as many as 100,000 taxpayers could have been compromised through a scheme in which hackers posed as students using an online tool to apply for financial aid.The I.R.S. has been struggling to overhaul its defenses against increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats as its budget shrinks and its staff dwindles.The agency became concerned last fall when it realized that it was possible for criminals to take advantage of the student loan tool that allows aid applicants to automatically populate the applications with their and their parents\u2019 tax information. The worry was that thieves might use the stolen data to file fraudulent returns and steal refunds, as they did two years ago.But the breadth of the breach remains unknown, and Mr. Koskinen faced tough questions during the hearing as to why he did not act sooner.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the committee, wondered why Mr. Koskinen had waited several months to shut down the tool after realizing that it might be vulnerable.Mr. Koskinen said he did not want to cut off a tool that millions of financial aid applicants use before the evidence of foul play was clear. After monitoring activity in the system, the I.R.S. noticed an unusual spike of unfinished applications in February that suggested criminals were at work.The commissioner, who in the past has faced calls from many Republican lawmakers to resign, said that the agency had already sent out 35,000 letters to taxpayers and that it was planning to contact 100,000 people to alert them that they might be at risk. The agency believes that fewer than 8,000 fraudulent returns were filed and processed, resulting in refunds issued.The questions about the security of data at the I.R.S. came less than two weeks before tax day and amid new calls from Republicans that Mr. Koskinen resign before his term ends in November. The commissioner has been a boogeyman for Republicans for years, because many in the party think that he has misled them over accusations that the agency overzealously audited certain conservative nonprofit groups.Mr. Koskinen said on Thursday that he had no intention of stepping aside.\u201cWhere I come from,\u201d he said, \u201cif you sign up for a commitment, you complete that commitment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Trump\u2019s 10-Second Convictions", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byEditorial\u2022In some instances, President Trump has adopted, for the moment, more sensible positions than the sweeping, outlandish ones he took during the campaign. Some commentators point to the comforting possibility that his reversals mean that Mr. Trump is growing in office, adapting postures born of ignorance or political calculus as he meets the realities of governing.But then you\u2019d have to overlook the nasty positions he\u2019s stuck to, as he caters to the oligarchs who surround him, builds his personal fortune and stirs the darker passions of his base. Why else would he break his promise to release his taxes or relinquish control of his business? Mr. Trump now surrounds himself with the bankers he once lambasted; he\u2019s lagged behind on promises of infrastructure jobs, manufacturing revival and health care, while opening up bidding on the wall. He\u2019s decried Syria\u2019s gas attack on \u201cbeautiful babies\u201d but continues to bar Syria\u2019s children from America.Democrats or House Freedom Caucus members, NATO members or Middle East dictators, potential allies or adversaries \u2014 all must be deeply unsettled by the one clear pattern emerging here, a pattern that is consistent with Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of others in private life, from his stiffing of his creditors to his swindling of students at Trump University: betrayal.And where does that leave the working-class voters who pinned their hopes on this man? They can live with what Mr. Trump calls successes, and hope that his interests align enough with theirs to achieve some peripheral benefit. Or they can press their legislators, and demand from Mr. Trump himself, that he stop spinning and start delivering.Advertisement"}

Putin.Detailed maps show sharp differences between the bases of support for Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron.Many of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s supporters may have little fondness for Ms. Le Pen, but in interviews they expressed equal disdain for the pro-free market Mr. Macron. \u201cFor me, Le Pen, Macron, it\u2019s the same,\u201d said Olivia Scemama, a musician from the 18th Arrondissement of Paris who said she voted for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon. \u201cWith Macron, it\u2019s the extremism of banks, of finance.\u201dThe election results published Monday suggested another hurdle for Ms. Le Pen to overcome: a sharp urban-rural divide in the vote, with voters in France\u2019s major cities heavily favoring her rivals. The geography and sociology of her support was similar to Donald J. Trump\u2019s support in the 2016 United States presidential race. She won more d\u00e9partements \u2014 between a county and a state in French political geography \u2014 than Mr. Macron, and she won the working-class vote. But she did poorly in what French sociologists call \u201cWinner\u2019s France\u201d \u2014 urban, employed, well-educated and pro-European. She received less than 5 percent of the vote in Paris, less than 8 percent in Bordeaux and less than 9 percent in Lyon.Polls released Monday showed that about 60 percent of voters supported Mr. Macron, compared with less than 40 percent for Ms. Le Pen. A live televised debate between the candidates is set for May 3.In H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, the northern French city where Ms. Le Pen won 46 percent of the vote and whose National Front mayor is one of her top advisers, even supporters were pessimistic about her chances in the runoff. \u201cIt\u2019s a bummer,\u201d said Jean-Louis Devienne, 72. \u201cIf people could come here and see how good the National Front has been for our town, they would understand how good it can be for our country.\u201dOn Monday, Ms. Le Pen continued to emphasize the anti-immigrant and anti-globalization views that propelled her into the second round, and she denounced the efforts of the mainstream parties to keep her out of the presidency.Mr. Macron, who has never held elective office, came in first among 11 candidates, with 24 percent of the vote. Ms. Le Pen was second, with 21.3 percent, according to final results tallied Monday by the Interior Ministry.The mainstream parties were left struggling to pick up the pieces after their poor showing. On the right, many were quick to blame their candidate, Mr. Fillon, who refused to drop out of the race after the embezzlement scandal.The Socialists and the Republicans will now be looking to elections in June, when French voters will elect the members of the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower and more powerful house of Parliament. Those legislative elections could present a bigger challenge for Mr. Macron than winning the second round of the presidential election. He has vowed to field candidates in all 577 districts. But his political movement is barely a year old, and he is up against the established parties, which are weakened but still have extensive networks.Although Mr. Macron is seen as an overwhelming favorite in the second round of the presidential election, he was warned not to take victory for granted and \u2014 after he spent Monday night with supporters at a chic restaurant in the wealthy Sixth Arrondissement of Paris \u2014 not to celebrate too much, too soon.Elian Peltier contributed reporting from H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, France, and Pamela Rougerie from Paris.Advertisement"}

One man has been rising rapidly in polls, threatening the front-runners a week before the first round in France\u2019s presidential election. One man has suddenly turned the French contest, locked for months between two favorites, into a four-man race.The formula, delivered in fiery anticapitalist phrases, and peppered with learned philosophical abstractions, has put him within spitting distance of earning a spot in the election\u2019s decisive second round on May 7.\u201cM\u00e9lenchon: The Insane Program of the French Ch\u00e1vez,\u201d the right-leaning newspaper Figaro blared in a front-page headline last week. The candidate was delighted by this jittery jab.\u201cWhat is the liberty of the employee who is fired for not working on Sunday?\u201d he asked the crowd, delivering repeated thrusts at capitalism. \u201cWhat is the liberty of 120,000 families whose water is cut off because they can\u2019t pay the bill?\u201d His advisers depict him as a kind of French Bernie Sanders. Unlike Mr. Sanders, though, he has no vigorous party establishment to block his way.\u201cMasters of the earth, you have good reason to be uneasy!\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon yelled at the festive, youthful crowd on Sunday, some wearing revolutionary Phrygian caps, as he stabbed the air with his fist and paced back and forth on the stage. \u201cGive it up! Give it up!\u201d the crowd yelled, a message clearly intended for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s opponents.\u201cThere must be decent salaries,\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon shouted into the microphone. \u201cThat\u2019s why the minimum wage will have to go up!\u201dIf this veteran of French politics \u2014 he started as a young Socialist senator in 1986 \u2014 pulls it off, France\u2019s election could end up a contest between two radical outliers. Both Mr. M\u00e9lenchon and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front gleefully promise a top-to-bottom shake-up, rejecting the country\u2019s European Union membership, blasting its budgetary and deficit rules, and injecting France with huge doses of public spending.The prospect of a M\u00e9lenchon-Le Pen runoff, written off several weeks ago, no longer seems impossible. In a poll published in Le Monde on Friday, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon had pulled to within two points of both Ms. Le Pen and her nearest challenger, the centrist Emmanuel Macron, a former economy minister.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s advisers speak admiringly of Mr. Sanders. Their candidate\u2019s score among 18- to 24-year-olds has shot to 44 percent from 12 percent in one month, according to Le Monde. Among 25- to 34-year-olds it has almost doubled, to 27 percent. Analysts say Mr. M\u00e9lenchon has the momentum at a time when others, like the mainstream right candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, stagnate or fall in the polls. \u201cHe\u2019s a total campaign warrior,\u201d the political scientist Pascal Perrineau said.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon has come so far so fast that the other candidates spent part of the last week attacking him for the first time. Even the widely unpopular incumbent, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, called him \u201csimplistic.\u201dBut as Mr. Hollande\u2019s mainstream Socialist Party has collapsed, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, an ex-Trotskyist, has been the big beneficiary, making the Socialists look like pallid imitators of his own robust promises to cut back the workweek, lower the official retirement age to 60, raise taxes on the rich and hire many more civil servants.What remains of the once-powerful French Communist Party backs him; Mr. M\u00e9lenchon is not unhappy. \u201cMr. Fillon reproaches me for being a Communist,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s a reproach I find totally tolerable,\u201d he said, mockingly promising the right-wing Mr. Fillon a \u201chandmade electoral jacket\u201d in a reference to a recent scandal over his opponent\u2019s expensive clothing habits.In a country winded by 10 percent unemployment, a plethora of unstable part-time job contracts for the young, a frozen job market and rising inequality, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s message has powerful resonance. His supporters \u2014 the campaign said 70,000 turned out Sunday \u2014 speak of him with a fervor that surpasses that of all the other candidates, with the exception of Ms. Le Pen.Yet the racially diverse crowd at Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s rally is nothing like the all-white, all-French one that comes to hear Ms. Le Pen.\u201cI work a lot and I\u2019m badly paid,\u201d said Inti Gomez, 40, who said he was a night receptionist in a Toulouse hotel, existing below the poverty line as he supports three on a salary of about $2,100 a month.Although he works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. every night, he had come out to hear Mr. M\u00e9lenchon. \u201cWhat\u2019s really hard is this inequality that I\u2019m forced to submit to,\u201d Mr. Gomez said, bemoaning the fact that his education had gone for naught. \u201cChange is possible,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just taking advantage of this collective joy.\u201dRen\u00e9 Amando, 60, said he had spent a lifetime working in chemical factories but retired early because his health had been damaged. \u201cIt\u2019s his attitude of refusal,\u201d Mr. Amando said, waiting for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon to appear. \u201cThere is such a huge split between the big financiers and the people, who get poorer and poorer,\u201d Mr. Amando added. \u201cHe gives us hope for a new kind of society, a more socialized and humane society.\u201dWhen Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said that the \u201cpresidential monarchy must be abolished,\u201d he was tapping into an old French revolutionary tradition, one that sees revolution itself as an inherent good. The revolutionaries of 1789 France created a kind of civic religion around their revolution; Mr. M\u00e9lenchon tries to do something similar. Even so, the crowd on Sunday appeared a little bewildered by his abstruse references to heretics who had suffered for their beliefs, his advocacy of an obscure Latin-American alliance he is keen on and his admonition to \u201cnot let anybody exercise police power over thought.\u201dIt roared though when he attacked President Trump over the missile attack on Syria. \u201cNo Frenchman can accept a global gendarme who decided all by himself the good and the bad,\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Growth in Pizza, Paint and Credit-Card Companies", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byGrowth stocks \u2014 those whose earnings are expected to grow faster than average \u2014 surged in the first quarter. They carried with them the managers of several of the quarter\u2019s top-performing stock funds.Those managers grabbed onto that growth in expected sorts of companies, like Alphabet and Facebook, and in more surprising and mature ones like MasterCard, Domino\u2019s and Sherwin-Williams.The funds are also unified by a philosophy, Mr. Lynch said.\u201cWhat we do is try to buy good growth companies and own them for many years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look very different from any benchmark. We have differentiated holdings, and we take concentrated positions. And with that, comes some volatility.\u201d Shares of Amazon and Facebook, for example, each accounted for about 9 percent of the Growth fund\u2019s assets at the end of February.Morningstar\u2019s numbers bear out Mr. Lynch\u2019s points. The three funds\u2019 turnover ratios, indicating the percentage of holdings sold annually, are below average, while their risk ratings are above. Put differently, the funds tend to trade less than average, but their returns tend to roller-coaster more than the indexes they\u2019re benchmarked against.A characteristic shared by many of the funds\u2019 holdings is that they can be tough to pigeonhole in a conventional investment sector, like technology or health care, Mr. Lynch said. \u201cIf there\u2019s not an easy category or comparison, then the company is more likely unique,\u201d he said.Take Alphabet, the holding company for Google. Many people call it a tech company, but it makes its money from advertising, which would traditionally point to media. \u201cThey used the internet to create a large audience and then disrupted the advertising world,\u201d he said.The largest and, in the most recent quarter, best performing of the three Morgan Stanley funds was the Growth fund. The fund, whose A shares carry an expense ratio of 0.96 percent, returned 16.25 percent for the quarter, compared with 5.5 percent for the S.&P. 500-stock index.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to identify two to three dozen high-growth companies whose stocks have little to do with one another,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then let that growth germinate. We\u2019re trying to invest in companies for three or four years.\u201dAnother point of emphasis is ensuring the returns of the fund\u2019s investments are not correlated with one another. The managers do that by using both statistical screens and fundamental analyses of how businesses may interact in unexpected ways, Mr. Galvin said. It is also one of the reasons they limit the portfolio\u2019s size. After about 35 stocks, he said, correlations in stock prices start to rise. \u201cEither the companies are competing with each other, or they\u2019re impacted by the same macroeconomic trends,\u201d he said.One of the qualities that drew Mr. Galvin and his colleagues to Domino\u2019s, the pizza delivery chain, was that its size and strong financials have enabled it to invest heavily in technology. And that has differentiated it from independent pizza peddlers, he said.\u201cThe digital divide is finally separating them from the mom-and-pop operators,\u201d he said. \u201cWith digital, you tap the app and have a pizza delivered, along with other menu items. Local operators don\u2019t have the financial wherewithal to invest in that kind of technology.\u201dMr. Galvin and his team divide their holdings into two groups: established companies, like Domino\u2019s, and emerging ones, like biotechnology outfits. The former \u201cprovide ballast to the portfolio,\u201d and the latter, opportunities for outsized returns, he said.\u201cWhen you have about half the portfolio in each of those, it blends out at an 18 to 22 percent level\u201d of average earnings growth, he said.The Columbia fund, whose A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.08 percent, returned 15.6 percent in the first quarter.\u201cI was just trading too much, and I didn\u2019t think I was that good at trading,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m doing good work, I should recognize mistakes, but I should also let the ideas develop.\u201d That means selling when he\u2019s sure an investment has gone bad but also hanging on through down periods if he is confident in a company\u2019s plans and prospects.Like any growth manager, Mr. Weiner hunts for strong, sustainable earnings growth. That has led him to put more than a third of the portfolio in technology stocks, like Facebook and Amazon. But it can also lead him into less obvious plays like the paint company Sherwin-Williams.\u201cThe paint-store business is huge and consistent and grows nicely year in and year out,\u201d he said. Sherwin-Williams caters to professional painters, and they\u2019re loyal in return. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go to Home Depot,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want 30-day terms.\u201d That is, they want to finance purchases for a month, rather than paying upfront.The business has pricing power, too, he said. The actual paint is a small enough portion of the cost of most paint jobs that the final consumer is not that sensitive to changes in price. \u201cPeople hire a painter and get a quote and have no idea what the cost of paint is in the quote,\u201d Mr. Weiner said.The Growth Discovery Fund, with an expense ratio of 0.78 percent, returned 12.15 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s C.E.O. Plays With Fire", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Travis Kalanick\u2019s drive to win in life has led to a pattern of risk-taking that has at times put his ride-hailing company on the brink of implosion.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, visited Apple\u2019s headquarters in early 2015 to meet with Timothy D. Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. It was a session that Mr. Kalanick was dreading.For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple\u2019s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased \u2014 a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple\u2019s privacy guidelines.But Apple was onto the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve been breaking some of our rules,\u201d Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber\u2019s app would be kicked out of Apple\u2019s App Store.For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber\u2019s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers \u2014 essentially destroying the ride-hailing company\u2019s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded.In a quest to build Uber into the world\u2019s dominant ride-hailing entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow.But the previously unreported encounter with Mr. Cook showed how Mr. Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale, sometimes to the very brink of implosion.Crossing that line was not a one-off for Mr. Kalanick. According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships, Mr. Kalanick, 40, is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost \u2014 a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009.\u201cTravis\u2019s biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals,\u201d said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Mr. Kalanick. \u201cTravis\u2019s biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That\u2019s the best way to describe him.\u201dThat quality also extended to his personal life, where Mr. Kalanick mixes with celebrities like Jay Z and businessmen including President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn. But it has alienated some Uber executives, employees and advisers. Mr. Kalanick, with salt-and-pepper hair, a fast-paced walk and an iPhone practically embedded in his hand, is described by friends as more at ease with data and numbers (some consider him a math savant) than with people.Through an Uber spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined an interview request. Apple declined to comment on the meeting with Mr. Cook. Many of the people interviewed for this article, who revealed previously unreported details of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s life, asked to remain anonymous because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with Uber or feared damaging their relationship with the chief executive.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s pattern for pushing limits is deeply ingrained. It began during his childhood in suburban Los Angeles, where he went from being bullied to being the aggressor, continued through his years taking risks at two technology start-ups there, and crystallized in his role at Uber.Mr. Kalanick grew up in the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles. His parents, Bonnie and Donald Kalanick, made sure he and his brother, Cory, were never left wanting. He was naturally athletic and competitive, and excelled at running track and playing football.At Patrick Henry Middle School, he was a wiry student who got good grades \u2014 putting him in the sights of some older kids who picked on him. Mr. Kalanick later vowed never to be bullied again and turned the tables on his tormentors.He also showed signs of entrepreneurialism. One summer, he sold knives door-to-door for the cutlery company Cutco. At 18, he started New Way Academy, his own SAT prep business, with a partner.The start-up life soon called to him. After attending the University of California, Los Angeles, to major in computer engineering, Mr. Kalanick dropped out in 1998 to form a start-up with several classmates. The company, Scour, became a peer-to-peer file exchange similar to Napster, which let people digitally share music and media files through legally dubious means.Scour, which was eventually sued for $250 billion for alleged copyright infringement, filed for bankruptcy in October 2000, a move that protected it from the suit. The failure did not stop Mr. Kalanick from helping to found another Los Angeles start-up, Red Swoosh, four months later. Red Swoosh made a technology to efficiently transfer large files of digital data; one of its investors was Mr. Cuban.Sean Stanton, Red Swoosh\u2019s former vice president for sales, said of Mr. Kalanick: \u201cScour was about efficiency. Swoosh was about efficiency. It\u2019s just the way his brain is wired. It\u2019s like the way Uber works right now: What\u2019s the fastest, cheapest and most efficient way to get from point A to point B? That consumes him, and all parts of his life.\u201dWith Red Swoosh, Mr. Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness. When the company struggled, Mr. Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks \u2014 which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the Internal Revenue Service \u2014 and reinvested the money into the start-up, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal.With Mr. Kalanick desperate to keep Red Swoosh afloat, he moved back into his parents\u2019 house. He staved off bankruptcy for a second time by raising another round of funding. The wayward tax dollars eventually went to the I.R.S.Mr. Kalanick also decamped to Thailand with his software team in April 2006 to save money by living cheaply abroad, while also using the trip as a team-building exercise.In 2007, Mr. Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai, a cloud services company, for roughly $19 million. The deal turned the executive, who had headed north to San Francisco, into a millionaire.By then, some advisers had soured on him. \u201cThe Travis Kalanick I came to know 17 years ago was relentless in pursuit of his goals at the expense of those who supported him along the way, deluded by his own embellished personal narrative, and a serial prevaricator,\u201d said Peter Yorke, a former Red Swoosh adviser and a longtime tech executive.Others stuck by him. Michael Robertson, chief executive of MP3.com, an early digital music sharing service, said that he told Mr. Kalanick, \u201cSometimes in business you have to battle the establishment, and it can get brutal and ugly.\u201dIn San Francisco, Mr. Kalanick and Angie You, his longtime girlfriend, bought a townhouse nestled in the upper hills of the city\u2019s Castro section. Though the couple have since split, the two remain close and still speak on a regular basis.The idea for Uber came in 2009 from Garrett Camp, a friend of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s, who became fixated on hailing a private luxury car with a smartphone app after being unable to catch cabs in San Francisco.A few months later, Mr. Kalanick changed his mind and took over as UberCab\u2019s chief. He quickly positioned the start-up as an alternative to the taxi industry. At the time, taxi companies had iron grips in many towns. City-by-city regulations required procedures like base stations for cabs, safety measures and other stipulations.Mr. Kalanick ignored those rules.\u201cWe\u2019re in a political campaign,\u201d he once said at a technology conference, and the candidate is Uber. The opponent is named Taxi, he said, adding a rude descriptive. \u201cNobody likes him, he\u2019s not a nice character, but he\u2019s so woven into the political machinery and fabric that a lot of people owe him favors.\u201dMr. Kalanick carried that same level of intensity into Uber\u2019s headquarters, pacing briskly while working by doing laps around the office. His pacing is so legendary, his father once said, that he wore a hole in the carpeting.Mr. Kalanick focused on expanding UberCab quickly. The company typically sent a small strike team into a new city \u2014 say, Seattle \u2014 to aggressively recruit new drivers through Craigslist and other online listings. Then the team marketed UberCab\u2019s app to increase ridership.That drew attention from regulators. In October 2010, the company shortened its name to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from San Francisco officials for marketing itself as a taxi company without the proper licenses and permits.To influence local legislators to accept Uber, Mr. Kalanick took extra steps. In 2014, Uber hired Ben Metcalfe, an engineer who described his job on LinkedIn as building \u201ccustom tools to support citizen engagement across legislative matters\u201d to drive \u201csocial good and social change.\u201dIn practice, Mr. Metcalfe and his team created an email-based system to aid Uber users and drivers to directly contact local legislators to lobby for allowing Uber in their cities. The system was similar to Change.org, a website that pushes social change through online petitions. City and state officials were soon deluged with emails supporting Uber.In some places, Uber employees were also told to create computer programs known as scripts that would automatically vote for the ride-hailing service in city-administered surveys.Mr. de Blasio capitulated, and the cap did not take place.As Uber gained momentum, Mr. Kalanick moved into the spotlight.It did not come naturally. One friend recalled a night out with a group of married couples at the Gold Club, a San Francisco strip club, a few years ago. Mr. Kalanick, who was single, pulled out a laptop to work on a spreadsheet, crunching Uber\u2019s numbers while friends watched the dancers onstage.Another friend called Mr. Kalanick a \u201ctech world rock star,\u201d which means something different in Silicon Valley than in the music world.\u201cTo work with and around one requires a different kind of mentality and skill,\u201d said Andy Abramson, an early adviser to Mr. Kalanick. Mr. Abramson likened the chief executive to other idiosyncratic founders like Jeff Bezos of Amazon.Mr. Kalanick was eventually coaxed more into the limelight by others. Shervin Pishevar, an Uber investor, sometimes took Mr. Kalanick to clubs in Los Angeles on the weekend, providing a car and a change of \u201cclub clothes.\u201d Mr. Pishevar, who did not respond to a request for comment, was the Uber chief\u2019s entryway into Los Angeles\u2019s world of celebrity.Hollywood stars were eager to buy into Uber, which they had started using to get around. Actors like Edward Norton, Olivia Munn and Sophia Bush took small stakes in the company. Mr. Kalanick and a top lieutenant, Emil Michael, sometimes hung out with Leonardo DiCaprio, who is also an investor, and Jay Z, whose wife, Beyonc\u00e9, performed for Uber employees at a poolside party in Las Vegas in 2015.Jay Z once wired money to Mr. Michael in an attempt to invest even more in Uber. Mr. Michael and Mr. Kalanick, giddy at rebuffing a celebrity, wired some of the money back, saying they already had too many interested investors. Representatives for Jay Z did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Kalanick also dreamed of luring celebrities into advisory roles at Uber. One aim was persuading Oprah Winfrey to join the board \u2014 something Uber executives believed could happen after Mr. Kalanick met Ms. Winfrey at a party on the Spanish island of Ibiza \u2014 but the idea never jelled. A spokeswoman for Ms. Winfrey declined to comment.Mr. Kalanick began mixing with elite business executives. He developed a close relationship with Mr. Cohn, then a top-ranking executive at Goldman Sachs. At one point, the two men spoke on a near daily basis. Mr. Cohn and a White House spokeswoman did not return requests for comment.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s main mantra was \u201cgrowth above all else.\u201dThat meant Uber\u2019s top performers were often promoted and protected. When one general manager, a title for a city-level chief, threw a coffee mug at a subordinate in a fit of rage, the incident was reported to human resources \u2014 but there was no follow-up. At the time, Uber\u2019s business in the general manager\u2019s city was strong.Other complaints also fell on deaf ears.After a backlash over Uber\u2019s use of \u201csurge pricing\u201d (raising ride prices when demand is high) amid an East Coast snowstorm in 2013, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s response to upset riders was a torrent of economics and math.Friends and employees told Mr. Kalanick that he should at least pretend to care about how it looked to take such a hostile stance with Uber\u2019s users. Several described him as \u201cemotionally unintelligent.\u201dWith Mr. Kalanick setting the tone at Uber, employees acted to ensure the ride-hailing service would win no matter what.They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers\u2019 emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft\u2019s business. (Lyft, too, operates a competitive intelligence team.)Uber also tried to win over Lyft\u2019s drivers. Uber\u2019s \u201cdriver satisfaction rating,\u201d an internal metric, has dropped since February 2016, and roughly a quarter of its drivers turn over on average every three months. According to an internal slide deck on driver income levels viewed by The New York Times, Uber considered Lyft and McDonald\u2019s its main competition for attracting new drivers.To frustrate Lyft drivers, Uber dispatched some employees to order and cancel Lyft rides en masse. Others hailed Lyfts and spent the rides persuading drivers to switch to Uber full time.That year, Uber came close to buying Lyft. At a meeting at Mr. Kalanick\u2019s house, and over cartons of Chinese food, he and Mr. Michael hosted Lyft\u2019s president, John Zimmer, who asked for 15 percent of Uber in exchange for selling Lyft. Over the next hour, Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Michael repeatedly laughed at Mr. Zimmer\u2019s audacious request. No deal was reached. Lyft declined to comment.The rivalry remains in force. In 2016, Uber held a summit meeting in Mexico City for some top managers, where it distributed a playbook on how to cut into Lyft\u2019s business and had sessions on how to damage its competitor.To develop its own business, Uber sidestepped the authorities. Some employees started using a tool called Greyball to deceive officials trying to shut down Uber\u2019s service. The tool, developed to aid driver safety and to trick fraudsters, essentially showed a fake version of Uber\u2019s app to some people to disguise the locations of cars and drivers. It soon became a way for Uber drivers to evade capture by law enforcement in places where the service was deemed illegal.The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber\u2019s app, began in 2014.At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased and resold. Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides from those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers could earn more money this way.The start-up has undertaken an extraordinary experiment in behavioral science to subtly entice an independent work force to maximize company revenue.To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called \u201cfingerprinting.\u201d Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents.There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple\u2019s rules. Mr. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner\u2019s identity remained on the device.So Mr. Kalanick told his engineers to \u201cgeofence\u201d Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber\u2019s software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code for people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber\u2019s fingerprinting.The ruse did not last. Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Uber\u2019s methods, prompting Mr. Cook to call Mr. Kalanick to his office.Mr. Kalanick was shaken by Mr. Cook\u2019s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting.But only momentarily. After all, Mr. Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

And we took six million low-income families entirely off the income tax rolls.BOB PACKWOOD, PORTLAND, ORE.The writer, a former Republican senator from Oregon, was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in 1985-86. To the Editor:Unless Americans want to \u201cstarve the beast\u201d further, they should be chary of so-called \u201ctax reform\u201d and \u201ctax simplification.\u201d They can become a slow-motion Trojan horse.Over the years, many of the reforms and simplifications of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 have been repealed outright or just eroded, without even a pretense of maintaining revenue neutrality. Over the long term, tax reform has become a vehicle for ratcheting down the amount of money available for public purposes. At the same time, our tax system has become increasingly inequitable.Legislation that lacks strong mechanisms to defeat tax termites that undermine the structure and to prevent clandestine revenue losses should either be amended or defeated.\u201cReforms\u201d could actually make things worse.To the Editor:As one who considers himself a liberal and usually votes Democratic, I nevertheless find myself in full agreement with the writers\u2019 proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, and to allow capital investment to be fully deducted in the first year of expenditure.I have been a chief financial officer of two venture-backed companies, and I know that every dollar of profit in small businesses goes right back into the business. Enactment of this proposal would further innovation, growth and jobs.I am also enthusiastic about the infrastructure investment proposal. With these two ideas, President Trump has an opportunity to get Democrats and Republicans on board, and fulfill his campaign promises on growth, tax reform and infrastructure.But I would add one caveat: Keep the tax rate at 35 percent for profits used to pay dividends or buy back stock. In the past 10 years, American corporations have spent trillions of dollars in buybacks and dividends, stunting growth while enriching shareholders and mediocre executives. This came at the expense of workers, long-term company health and the American economy.Adding this provision will provide incentives to executives and their shareholders to invest for growth.MICHAEL TWOMEY, AUSTIN, TEX.To the Editor:In case the writers haven\u2019t noticed, big business in America has been racking up record profits. It is small businesses that need the benefit from tax relief. So unless Republicans are intent on bestowing a grand entitlement on big business at the expense of our grander deficit, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to target all tax relief, including the deduction of the full cost of capital purchases and reduction in the tax rate, exclusively to small businesses? And we should ensure that small businesses are given priority in all contracts for infrastructure improvement.Targeting tax relief to where it is most needed may avert a deficit increase and would be more likely to spur growth from the bottom up rather than hoping and praying for it to trickle down.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Plan: Low Rate for Corporations, and for Companies Like His", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump plans to unveil a tax cut blueprint on Wednesday that would apply a vastly reduced, 15 percent business tax rate not only to corporations but also to companies that now pay taxes through the personal income tax code \u2014 from mom-and-pop businesses to his own real estate empire, according to several people briefed on the proposal.The package would also increase the standard deduction for individuals, providing a modest cut for middle-income people and simplifying the process of filing tax returns, according to people briefed on its details. That proposal is opposed by home builders and real estate agents, who fear it would diminish the importance of the mortgage interest deduction. And it is likely to necessitate eliminating or curbing other popular deductions, a politically risky pursuit.As of late Tuesday, the plan did not include Mr. Trump\u2019s promised $1 trillion infrastructure program, two of the people said, and it jettisoned a House Republican proposal to impose a substantial tax on imports, known as a border adjustment tax, which would have raised billions of dollars to help offset the cost of the cuts.With that decision, Mr. Trump acceded to pressure from retailers and conservative advocacy groups, but the move could deepen the challenge of passing a broad tax overhaul in Congress, where concern about the swelling federal deficit runs high. His plan would put off the difficult part of a tax overhaul: closing loopholes and increasing other taxes to limit the impact of tax cuts on the budget deficit.Republicans are likely to embrace the plan\u2019s centerpiece, substantial tax reductions for businesses large and small, even as they push back against the jettisoning of their border adjustment tax. The 15 percent rate would apply both to corporations, which now pay 35 percent, and to a broad range of firms known as pass-through entities \u2014 including hedge funds, real estate concerns like Mr. Trump\u2019s and large partnerships \u2014 that currently pay taxes at individual rates, which top off at 39.6 percent. That hews closely to the proposal Mr. Trump championed during his campaign.But Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to extend the corporate tax cut to real estate conglomerates like his own will give Democrats a tailor-made line of attack.\u201cYesterday, we learned President Trump wants to slash the corporate tax rate, even though corporations already dodge most of their tax responsibilities while making record profits,\u201d said Frank Clemente, executive director of the liberal Americans for Tax Fairness. \u201cToday, we find out it\u2019s even worse. In trying to slash taxes for \u2018pass through\u2019 business entities, Trump is seeking to dramatically reduce his own tax bill.\u201dThe border adjustment tax may be revisited later but was considered too controversial to include now.Spokeswomen for the White House and the Treasury Department declined to comment on the details of the plan before Wednesday\u2019s announcement, which is expected to contain only broad principles, leaving unanswered crucial questions about the financing of the package and the process for advancing it through Congress.Emerging from a meeting at the Capitol where he briefed Republican congressional leaders on Tuesday evening, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said participants had \u201cvery, very productive discussions\u201d and were united in their desire to accomplish a tax overhaul this year.The broad contours of the plan seemed to please conservatives who had worried in recent weeks that Mr. Trump, who has dropped or modified many of the major proposals of his campaign, was drifting away from the plan he had laid out for voters.\u201cConservatives are going to be very happy with this plan, because it achieves a lot of the objectives that we\u2019ve wanted: lower business taxes, simplification and not a major tax increase that is unacceptable,\u201d said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and helped craft his tax proposal.But Mr. Moore conceded that finding ways to offset the large revenue reductions envisioned in the blueprint would be a challenge.\u201cThat\u2019s the unknown right now, is whether there is some sort of pay-for for any of this,\u201d he said.Government officials crafting the tax plans are aware of the math problem, one of the people involved in the proposal said, but they see the 15 percent corporate tax rate as a compelling starting point for negotiations. Mr. Trump may yet reveal other tactics for replenishing lost tax revenue, someone who has been briefed on the plans said.But the final plans remain very much in flux. At midafternoon on Tuesday, for instance, it was still not clear whether personal income-tax rate cuts or an increase in the standardized deduction for individuals would be part of Wednesday\u2019s announcement.The demise of the border adjustment tax was met with relief by Republicans in the Senate, who had been cool to it from the start.On Tuesday, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said it was safe to conclude that the provision was \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d because of skepticism in the Senate.But Mr. Cornyn described Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to cut the corporate income tax to 15 percent as \u201cpretty aggressive,\u201d with unknown consequences for the deficit.Other Republican senators appeared ready to embrace a tax proposal that adds to the deficit in the name of jump-starting the economy. Republicans appear intent on using parliamentary rules that would block Democrats from filibustering the plan in the Senate, but would also put a time limit on the tax cuts.\u201cI\u2019m open to getting this country moving,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure we have to go that route, but if we do, I can live with it.\u201dSenator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said he was also open to tax cuts with an expiration date if that was the only way to get them passed without Democratic support, pointing to President George W. Bush\u2019s cuts.\u201cYou look at the tax cuts from 2002 and 2003 \u2014 well over 90 percent of them became permanent law,\u201d Mr. Blunt said.Democrats have criticized Republicans for failing to engage with them on a tax overhaul. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he would be open to working with Republicans on a plan that would bring home corporate profits parked overseas and use some of the funds to pay for infrastructure.But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said on Tuesday that he intended to pass tax legislation through budget rules that would block a filibuster. He accused Democrats of being more interested in \u201cwealth transfers\u201d than in spurring economic growth.So far, the Senate has taken a back seat in tax discussions. The abandonment of the border adjustment tax will deal a blow to the comprehensive rewrite of the tax code championed by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.Mr. Brady said Tuesday that he would press ahead with the import tax, not merely because it would make up for lost revenue but because it would protect American jobs.However, he acknowledged that his goal of producing legislation before summer was slipping.\u201cI\u2019m less focused on the month than on the year for tax reform, which would be this year,\u201d Mr. Brady said.An earlier version of this article misstated how much the economy would have to grow to make up for the loss in federal revenue caused by the proposed tax cuts, according to the Tax Foundation. It would have to become 5 percent larger, not five times larger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Barclays C.E.O. Investigated Over Treatment of Whistle-Blower", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byThe British banking giant Barclays is again facing questions about its leadership just as its efforts to turn itself around in the aftermath of the 2012 Libor scandal are starting to take shape.The bank said on Monday that its American chief executive, James E. Staley, was being investigated by the British authorities after he sought to learn the identity of a whistle-blower.Mr. Staley had called on the bank\u2019s internal security team to try to uncover the identity of the whistle-blower in an \u201chonestly held\u201d but \u201cmistaken\u201d belief that he had clearance to do so, Barclays said in a statement. Its security team even received assistance in that effort from a \u201cUnited States law enforcement agency,\u201d the bank said.The bank said it would formally reprimand Mr. Staley and make a \u201cvery significant compensation adjustment\u201d to his bonus after the investigators completed their work.John McFarlane, the bank\u2019s chairman, personally chastised Mr. Staley, saying he was \u201cvery disappointed.\u201dThe chain of events began last summer after Tim Main left the boutique investment bank Evercore Partners to join Barclays, where Mr. Staley, a friend and a former boss at JPMorgan, had recently become chief executive. At JPMorgan, Mr. Main had spearheaded the bank\u2019s dealings with other financial institutions, including with the American International Group during the 2008 financial crisis.For Mr. Staley, Mr. Main, who was known for his team-building skills at JPMorgan, seemed like a great hire.\u201cTim was a star here at Evercore,\u201d Roger C. Altman, the firm\u2019s founder, said on Monday. \u201cHe had everyone\u2019s respect and was exceedingly successful. We tried mightily to keep him when Barclays came calling.\u201dBut leave Mr. Main did, apparently lured by a new and larger platform at Barclays \u2014 a British bank that also has significant operations in New York \u2014 and by the chance to collaborate again with Mr. Staley.But a month after his hiring, an anonymous whistle-blower sent letters to officials at Barclays that cited erratic behavior by Mr. Main when he was at JPMorgan, according to a person briefed on the letters. Two people who had worked with Mr. Main while at JPMorgan confirmed that he had acted erratically for a period of a time.Barclays did not disclose the substance of the whistle-blower\u2019s letter.When he learned of the letter, Mr. Staley apparently took umbrage.\u201cThe allegations related to personal issues from many years ago,\u201d Mr. Staley wrote in an email to employees on Monday, \u201cand the intent of the correspondents in airing all of this was, in my view, to maliciously smear this person.\u201dHoping to uncover the name of the writer and implore that person to \u201cstop the harassment,\u201d as he described it in the letter, Mr. Staley twice asked Barclays\u2019s internal security team to track the writer down. But the inquiry was not successful.Barclays ultimately disregarded the whistle-blower\u2019s objections and kept Mr. Main in his job.Through representatives, both Mr. Main and Mr. Staley declined to comment.\u201cI have apologized to the Barclays board and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part,\u201d Mr. Staley said in a statement. \u201cI will also accept whatever sanction it deems appropriate. I will cooperate fully with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulatory Authority, which are now both examining this matter.\u201dMr. Staley\u2019s defenders say he was showing loyalty to a friend facing an unwarranted attack based on dated information. But critics say his actions crossed the line for any public company and underscored the difficulty of whistle-blowing in general.\u201cWhistle-blowers are typically treated horribly, even in the government, let alone in the private sector,\u201d said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to have problems pointed out.\u201dIt was the first of 11 banks to settle with regulators, and the scandal cost Robert E. Diamond Jr., then the chief executive and also an American, his job. His replacement, Antony Jenkins, was pushed out after three years amid criticism that he had not revived the ailing bank fast enough.Soon after joining Barclays late in 2015, Mr. Staley initiated a major restructuring effort. He sold the bank\u2019s Africa unit and built up its investment banking in the United States and Britain. Despite a strong start at the company, where some returns have improved, he has not fully proved himself yet.And he might not have found himself under investigation if not for a second whistle-blower. In January, an employee at Barclays contacted its outside directors \u2014 in other words, all except for Mr. Staley and Tushar Morzaria, a fellow JPMorgan alumnus who is now Barclays\u2019s finance director. In a letter, the Barclays employee pointed to flaws with the bank\u2019s whistle-blower procedures. A case in point, according to that employee, was Mr. Staley\u2019s attempts to unveil Mr. Main\u2019s anonymous critic.An outside law firm, Simmons & Simmons, was commissioned to investigate the concerns, and the British authorities were notified. Their conclusion: that Mr. Staley erred in seeking out the June whistle-blower, but that his belief that he had clearance to do so was an honest mistake.It remains to be seen whether regulators will agree.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hungary Law That Could Close Soros-Backed University Faces Uncertainty", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byThe European commissioners, at their weekly meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, discussed recent laws introduced by Mr. Orban\u2019s government, including the one involving Central European University. Mr. Timmermans said the group resolved to \u201cconsider next steps on any legal concerns by the end of April.\u201dThe meeting came shortly after several top United States officials \u2014 including the acting State Department spokesman, Mark C. Toner \u2014 urged the Hungarian government to allow the university to operate in its present form.The university, established by Mr. Soros in 1991 after the fall of Communism, has become a flash point in a campaign by Mr. Orban, a right-wing populist, who has long denounced Mr. Soros as part of an elite capitalist class that puts cosmopolitan values over national interests. The university has become a platform for critics of Mr. Orban as he has embraced what he calls \u201cilliberal democracy.\u201dThe new law requires foreign-accredited universities \u2014 like Central European, which is also accredited in the United States \u2014 to have a campus in their home country, which it does not. But the university could circumvent that rule simply by issuing its degrees through its existing Hungarian sister school.University officials said they had not been approached directly by Mr. Palkovics with this information, and they remained skeptical. \u201cThis is not a robust, secure solution,\u201d the university\u2019s pro-rector for Hungarian affairs, Zsolt Enyedi, said by email.Under such an arrangement, he said, Central European would no longer be an international university operating in Budapest but an American university operating through a Hungarian partner.Since the new higher education law was passed last week and signed on Monday by the Hungarian president, thousands of Hungarians have taken to the streets in support of the university and the concept of academic freedom, as well as to express concern over the country\u2019s populist drift.More than 10,000 people gathered on Heroes\u2019 Square in Budapest on Wednesday to support the university and protest another law proposed by the Orban government, this one targeting nongovernmental organizations with foreign financing. (That law, too, seems intended to hobble organizations affiliated with Mr. Soros.)One protester, Miklos Lipkovszky-Barna, 30, suggested that something larger than the future of a university was at stake: \u201cOf course we have to stand for everybody the government kicks, like C.E.U. or NGOs.\u201dAn article on Thursday about a new Hungarian law apparently intended to shut down the Central European University in Budapest misspelled the given name of the acting spokesman for the State Department.

G.M. then asked the Supreme Court to review that ruling.The Supreme Court\u2019s rebuff means that several hundred remaining unsolved wrongful death and personal injury claims against G.M. could be sent to state courts for resolution or even trials.\u201cThere are a lot of cases out there that either are going to have to be settled by G.M. or litigated, now that the Supreme Court is not getting involved,\u201d said Robert C. Hilliard, a lawyer who is handling 243 claims against G.M. Among them are cases involving 27 deaths, Mr. Hilliard said.He estimated that 1,000 or more outstanding cases remain.The ignition switch at the heart of the matter was used mainly in the Chevrolet Cobalt and Saturn Ion small cars that G.M. started producing in 2002 and 2003. The switch had a tendency to turn off by itself, leaving the car without power and disabling its airbags.G.M. engineers knew of the switch\u2019s problems for years before the company issued limited recalls of affected models, and the trouble remained obscured as G.M. went through a federally financed bankruptcy in 2009. In 2014, as links between the switch and an increasing number of fatal crashes became clear, the company was forced to acknowledge that it had failed to respond quickly, and it recalled 2.6 million vehicles.Eventually, G.M. paid $900 million to settle a federal criminal investigation, and set aside $594.5 million for a fund to compensate victims of switch-related crashes. That fund was managed by the compensation expert Kenneth R. Feinberg.In a statement on Monday, G.M. reiterated that allowing prebankruptcy claims to move forward \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the landscape\u201d regarding ignition-switch claims. \u201cThe plaintiffs must still establish their right to assert successor liability claims,\u201d the company said. \u201cFrom there, they still have to prove those claims have merit.\u201dHow much G.M. might be liable for is hard to calculate. In injury and death cases, plaintiffs have to show that a defective switch caused the accident in which a victim was injured or killed. Some cases have been dismissed at trial because crashes were found to be related to other causes, such as impaired driving, or other contributing factors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Many Big Donors to de Blasio Have Yet to Chip In for Second Run", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byThe big donors who helped sweep Mayor Bill de Blasio into office have largely been staying away from his re-election campaign.Of the 892 people who gave Mr. de Blasio the maximum donation during his 2013 campaign for mayor, just 142, or 16 percent, have made a contribution of any size to his re-election campaign, according to an analysis of campaign finance records.The analysis of contributors to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s two campaigns, which was done with the assistance of the Center for Urban Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, revealed both apparent shortcomings and signs of potential promise for the mayor.During the 2013 campaign, Mr. de Blasio received donations from 12,368 people. Of those, just 1,084, or 8 percent, had donated something to the mayor\u2019s re-election campaign through mid-March, the last time the campaign filed a report with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board.But even many of those who might be considered among Mr. de Blasio\u2019s most loyal donors \u2014 people who gave the maximum amount before the Democratic primary in September 2013, when his chances of winning were far from clear \u2014 have yet to jump in with contributions this time. Of the 342 people who gave him the maximum leading up to the primary, 71, or about one in five, have made a contribution this time.\u201cSome people who are loyalists probably gave in spite of the investigations just to show solidarity with the mayor,\u201d said John Mollenkopf, the director of the Center for Urban Research. Others, he said, \u201cmight worry that, if there had been an indictment, that would sink the mayor\u2019s ship and their money would have been spent for naught.\u201dThen the mayor spent most of last week on a West Coast trip, with fund-raisers in Seattle, Sacramento and San Francisco.\u201cMayor de Blasio is incredibly proud of the grass-roots support powering his re-election effort and small donations from the people of New York City will continue to fuel this campaign,\u201d Dan Levitan, a spokesman for the campaign, said in a written statement.Mr. Levitan pointed to the push to bring in thousands of donors giving $175 or less, the threshold to initiate city-financed matching funds from the city\u2019s campaign finance rules. The first $175 contributed by a city resident brings a match of six to one, so that a $175 donation brings the campaign an additional $1,050. So far, the campaign has raised $3.7 million and expects to receive more than $2.4 million in matching funds, according to the Campaign Finance Board.Florence Frucher; her husband, Sandy Frucher; and their three children each contributed $4,950 to Mr. de Blasio in 2013 and have yet to give any money this time.\u201cWe like him, we like what he\u2019s doing and we intend to contribute,\u201d said Ms. Frucher, an adjunct professor at Baruch College who had a long career in city and state government. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t yet.\u201dThe mayor has attracted a new crop of big money donors: So far, 385 donors have given Mr. de Blasio\u2019s re-election campaign the maximum donation of $4,950, including 85 who gave the maximum in 2013.That is ahead of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s pace at this stage in the race during his first run for mayor. He had 294 donors who had given the maximum at the time of the March 2013 filing. However, at that time, Mr. de Blasio was the city\u2019s public advocate, mounting what appeared to be a long-shot campaign for mayor in a crowded field. Now he is the city\u2019s mayor, with much higher expectations of his ability to raise large amounts of money.It is difficult to make comparisons with other mayoral campaigns, partly because Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor, the billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg, who paid for his own campaigns, served three terms without ever taking campaign donations.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of churning in donor pools, much more than people have realized,\u201d said Michael J. Malbin, executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonpartisan research center in Washington, adding that the phenomenon may be greater this year for Mr. de Blasio because he has sought to reach out to more small donors.\u201cIt\u2019s a general rule in politics that people only give after they\u2019re asked, so if he\u2019s shifting his focus maybe he\u2019s asking fewer of the traditional donors,\u201d Mr. Malbin said. \u201cBut some of that may be that his base of support had shifted somewhat.\u201dIn an analysis of contributions to the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush, Mr. Malbin found that 30 percent of donors who gave $200 or more in 2000, and a similar percentage of donors who gave the maximum of $1,000, contributed again in 2004. Those are much higher rates than Mr. de Blasio has seen so far, but there are still many months for donors to make contributions.There are some striking shifts among Mr. de Blasio\u2019s top donors this time, compared with four years ago.Real estate industry executives said that developers and others had held back donations from Mr. de Blasio\u2019s re-election effort in part because the investigations into his fund-raising had made them leery of the scrutiny large donations could bring. One executive, who asked not to be named so as not to jeopardize relationships with City Hall, said that some also feared that a donation could backfire if city officials felt compelled to act less favorably to big donors with projects requiring city action regarding zoning or other factors, in order to avoid any suggestion of pay to play.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos Says He Is Selling $1 Billion a Year in Amazon Stock to Finance Race to Space", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byCOLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 Standing against the backdrop of his New Shepard rocket booster and a full-scale mock capsule for carrying humans into space, Jeff Bezos revealed on Wednesday that he was selling about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company.Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, showed off the reusable rocket booster and the mock-up of the capsule that will take people up for panoramic views back down at earth, during a symposium here.Mr. Bezos, who hopes to build Blue Origin into a commercial and tourist venture, also disclosed that it would cost about $2.5 billion to develop an even bigger rocket, New Glenn, capable of lifting satellites and, eventually, people into orbit.Like his fellow technology titan Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, Mr. Bezos has identified reusable rocket parts as a key to lowering the price of admission to the field, which he said on Wednesday would lead to a \u201cgolden age of space exploration.\u201d\u201cIf we can make access to space low-cost, then entrepreneurs will be unleashed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see creativity, you will see dynamism, you will see the same thing in space that I\u2019ve witnessed on the internet in the last 20 years.\u201dMr. Bezos has repeatedly expressed caution about setting timetables for the start of Blue Origin\u2019s commercial or passenger trips, and he did not diverge from that on Wednesday. He would not say when New Shepard would undergo its next round of test flights, or set a specific date as a goal, merely mentioning next year for possible tourist trips.\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to race to a deadline when you\u2019re talking about a flying vehicle, especially one that you\u2019re going to put people on,\u201d he said. \u201cI still think we can do commercial paying passengers in 2018.\u201dAsked how much passengers would pay, Mr. Bezos said he did not know yet, but he predicted ticket prices would decline as spaceflight became more common. (Hundreds of people have already put down deposits to reserve places on similar commercial trips on Virgin Galactic that could cost $250,000 a ticket, although that company\u2019s spaceplane has yet to take anyone up.)New Shepard is a modest start for Mr. Bezos\u2019s ambitions to tap into the nascent space tourism market. It is a single-stage booster with a capsule on top that is designed to carry six passengers at a time on trips of about 10 to 11 minutes.There will not be a Blue Origin crew on the spacecraft. Passengers wearing sleek jumpsuits will be able to peer out what the company says will be the largest windows in space, taking up about one-third of the surface area of the dome.About 12 feet in diameter, the passenger capsule holds six black seats that resemble recliners, with panels offering details about altitude and other features of a trip.The engine that powers the booster produces up to about 110,000 pounds of thrust.On ascent, passengers will experience forces of about 3 Gs, about three times the normal force of gravity that humans experience on earth. When the booster reaches a certain altitude, the capsule will detach and coast above the Karman line, which is 62 miles above sea level, officially entering into space.There, the passengers will experience about four to five minutes of weightlessness. They can unbuckle their harnesses and do somersaults, if desired, in the padded-dome interior.On descent, they will encounter forces of 5 Gs.The capsule will parachute back to the plains of West Texas, slowing to a coasting speed of about 20 miles per hour, while the booster drops and fires its engine to slow down and make a vertical landing. The capsule slows to 3 m.p.h. before touching down. Both pieces are reusable to make the trips more economical.\u201cReusability is the key to getting millions of people living and working in space,\u201d Mr. Bezos said.New Shepard has a simpler flight path: just up and down, almost like a big roller coaster that slows to a stop at the top of its arc.The abort system worked. To the pleasant surprise of the engineers, the booster survived the force of separation, righted itself and descended to a landing. (It would have still been considered a successful test if the booster had crashed.)A Virgin Galactic test flight in 2014 crashed, killing one pilot and severely injuring the other.Both Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk have much more ambitious goals beyond their current rockets. Mr. Musk wants to send settlers to Mars. Mr. Bezos has said his long-term vision involves having millions of people living and working in space.Kenneth Chang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Isn\u2019t Wrong on China Currency Manipulation, Just Late", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneHas the United States mismanaged the ascent of China?By April 15, the Treasury Department is required to present to Congress a report on the exchange rate policies of the country\u2019s major trading partners, intended to identify manipulators that cheapen their currency to make their exports more attractive and gain market share in the United States, a designation that could eventually lead to retaliation.It would be hard, these days, to find an economist who feels China fits the bill. Under a trade law passed in 2015, a country must meet three criteria: It would have to have a \u201cmaterial\u201d trade surplus with the rest of the world, have a \u201csignificant\u201d surplus with the United States, and intervene persistently in foreign exchange markets to push its currency in one direction.While China\u2019s surplus with the United States is pretty big \u2014 almost $350 billion \u2014 its global surplus is modest, at 2.4 percent of its gross domestic product last year. Most significant, it has been pushing its currency up, not down. Since the middle of 2014 it has sold over $1 trillion from its reserves to prop up the renminbi, under pressure from capital flight by Chinese companies and savers.Even President Trump \u2014 who as a candidate promised to label China a currency manipulator on Day 1 and put a 45 percent tariff on imports of Chinese goods \u2014 seems to be backing away from broad, immediate retaliation.And yet the temptation remains. \u201cWhen you talk about currency manipulation, when you talk about devaluations,\u201d the Chinese \u201care world champions,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Financial Times, ahead of the state visit of the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, to the United States last week.For all Mr. Trump\u2019s random impulsiveness and bluster \u2014 and despite his lack of a coherent strategy to engage with what is likely soon to become the world\u2019s biggest economy \u2014 he is not entirely alone with his views.Many learned economists and policy experts ruefully acknowledge that the president\u2019s intuition is broadly right: While labeling China a currency manipulator now would look ridiculous, the United States should have done it a long time ago.\u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, China should have been named,\u201d said Brad Setser, an expert on international economics and finance who worked in the Obama administration and is now at the Council on Foreign Relations.There were reasonable arguments against putting China on the spot and starting a process that could eventually lead to American retaliation.Yet by not pushing back against China\u2019s currency manipulation, and allowing China to deploy an arsenal of trade tactics of dubious legality to increase exports to the United States, successive administrations \u2014 Republican and Democratic \u2014 arguably contributed to the economic dislocations that pummeled so many American workers over more than a decade. Those dislocations helped propel Mr. Trump to power.From 2000 to 2014 China definitely suppressed the rise of the renminbi to maintain a competitive advantage for its exports, buying dollars hand over fist and adding $4 trillion to its foreign reserves over the period. Until 2005, the Chinese government kept the renminbi pegged to the dollar, following it down as the greenback slid against other major currencies starting in 2003.American multinationals were flocking into China, taking advantage of its entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001, which guaranteed access to the American and other world markets for its exports. By 2007, China\u2019s broad trade surplus hit 10 percent of its gross domestic product \u2014 an unheard-of imbalance for an economy this large. And its surplus with the United States amounted to a full third of the American deficit with the world.Though the requirement that the Treasury identify currency manipulators \u201cgaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade\u201d dates back to the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, China was never called out.There were good reasons. Or at least they seemed so at the time. For one, China hands in the administration of George W. Bush argued that putting China on the spot would make negotiations more difficult, because even Chinese leaders who understood the need to allow their currency to rise could not be seen to bow to American pressure.Labeling China a manipulator could have severely hindered progress in other areas of a complex bilateral economic relationship. And the United States had bigger fish to fry.\u201cThere were other dimensions of China\u2019s economic policies that were seen as more important to U.S. economic and business interests,\u201d Eswar Prasad, who headed the China desk at the International Monetary Fund and is now a professor at Cornell, told me. These included \u201cgreater market access, better intellectual property rights protection, easier access to investment opportunities, etc.\u201dAt the end of the day, economists argued at the time, Chinese exchange rate policies didn\u2019t cost the United States much. After all, in 2007 the United States was operating at full employment. The trade deficit was because of Americans\u2019 dismal savings rate and supercharged consumption, not a cheap renminbi. After all, if Americans wanted to consume more than they created, they had to get it somewhere.And the United States had a stake in China\u2019s rise. A crucial strategic goal of American foreign policy since Mao\u2019s death had been how to peacefully incorporate China into the existing order of free-market economies, bound by international law into the fabric of the postwar multilateral institutions.And the strategy even worked \u2014 a little bit. China did allow its currency to rise a little from 2005 to 2008. And when the financial crisis hit, it took the foot off the export pedal and deployed a giant fiscal stimulus, which bolstered internal demand.In a set of influential papers that have come to inform the thinking about the United States\u2019 relations with China, David Autor, Daron Acemoglu and Brendan Price from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Gordon Hanson from the University of California, San Diego; and David Dorn from the University of Zurich concluded that lots of American workers, in many communities, suffered a blow from which they never recovered.Economic theory posited that a developed country like the United States would adjust to import competition by moving workers into more advanced industries that competed successfully in global markets. In the real world of American workers exposed to the rush of imports after China erupted onto world markets, the adjustment didn\u2019t happen.If mediocre job prospects and low wages didn\u2019t stop American families from consuming, it was because the American financial system was flush with Chinese cash and willing to lend, financing their homes and refinancing them to buy the furniture. But that equilibrium didn\u2019t end well either, did it?What it left was a lot of betrayed anger floating around among many Americans on the wrong end of these dynamics. \u201cBy not following the law, the administration sent a political signal that the U.S. wouldn\u2019t stand up to Chinese cheating,\u201d said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cAs we can see now, that hurt in terms of maintaining political support for open trade.\u201dIf there was a winner from this dynamic, it was Mr. Trump.Will Mr. Trump really go after China? In addition to an expected executive order to retaliate against the dumping of Chinese steel, he has promised more. He could tinker with the definitions of \u201cmaterial\u201d and \u201csignificant\u201d trade surpluses to justify a manipulation charge.And yet a charge of manipulation would add irony upon irony. \u201cIt would be incredibly ironic not to have named China a manipulator when it was manipulating, and name it when it is not,\u201d Mr. Setser told me. And Mr. Trump would be retaliating against the economic dynamic that handed him the presidency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Policyholders in Limbo After Rare Failure of Insurer", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byRetiringSomething unusual happened last month: A good-size American insurer, Penn Treaty of Allentown, Pa., was ordered to liquidate and wind down its affairs. Its demise will orphan tens of thousands of policyholders \u2014 people who bought its long-term-care insurance to shield their families from crushing nursing home costs.Big insurance companies rarely fail in the United States. Most of the time, an ailing insurer will quietly find a buyer, and vanish under its rescuer\u2019s wing. Policyholders may not know what happened, or care, as long as their claims are paid.The dearth of visible insurance failures makes it seem the industry\u2019s squadrons of actuaries and regulators will always get things right, measuring complex risks accurately and charging premiums that will cover all future claims.But the failure of Penn Treaty shows that was not really true. It\u2019s quite possible for a regulated insurer to miscalculate its book of business, operate for years without correcting the mistake, and ultimately take policyholders into the very realm of loss and uncertainty that insurance is specifically designed to avoid.Now, some fear Penn Treaty\u2019s failure is a signal of more trouble to come in the long-term-care sector.\u201cLiquidation is rare, but it does happen in bunches sometimes,\u201d said Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. The organization has been warning about problems with long-term-care insurance since the early 1990s. In essence, companies underestimated the true cost of coverage and are struggling now to make good on all their promises.\u201cThere is definitely talk in the street that it\u2019s still a high-risk situation for quite a few companies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a healthy situation.\u201dMichelle Leonard, a Penn Treaty policyholder in Venus, Fla., said she was shocked to learn of the liquidation.\u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go to a facility to live out my days,\u201d she said, explaining that she had already selected a group home, submitted an application and been accepted (but had not yet sold her house). \u201cThey may not take me now. I may not have enough assets to go in.\u201dEach state has a so-called guarantee fund to rescue policyholders in insurance failures. The funds pay people\u2019s claims, up to a predetermined limit that varies by state. The limit is $300,000 in Florida.\u201cBut how long does that take?\u201d Ms. Leonard wondered. She said that she had not yet heard from the guarantee fund, but added that she had received mailings instructing her to keep on paying her monthly premium in full, even if it rises, or else her coverage would be canceled.\u201cOh, hey! We\u2019re going down the toilet but keep paying your premium,\u201d she said, mocking the letters. \u201cIt\u2019s very upsetting.\u201dOther Penn Treaty customers agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have C.P.A.s and actuaries and insurance professionals \u2014 to run the business properly,\u201d said Charley Sproule, a policyholder in Harrisburg, Pa. \u201cIn my opinion, the actuaries and executives and the board should be held legally liable for this, but they won\u2019t. They\u2019ll get off scot-free.\u201dIn Pennsylvania, the guarantee limit is also $300,000. Mr. Spoule said the cash value of his policy was close to double that \u2014 $573,000. So is the cash value of a separate policy held by his wife, Mary Lou.Mr. Sproule said that his mother lived to be 100 and spent her final years in a nursing home. The care was expensive enough to wipe out all of her assets in just three years, including the value of her house. After that, she had to turn to Medicaid, the government health program for the poor.\u201cThat\u2019s why we bought insurance, so that all of our assets wouldn\u2019t be gobbled up by nursing-home costs,\u201d Mr. Sproule said.In liquidation, the policies will be canceled, and the guarantee fund will take care of $300,000 worth of claims. \u201cWe end up suffering about a 48 percent loss,\u201d Mr. Sproule said. It took the couple 18 years to build up their policies\u2019 value to $573,000 apiece. Mr. Sproule said he was sure it was too late to go out and buy coverage to replace what they had lost.\u201cWe\u2019re probably uninsurable,\u201d he said. \u201cYou buy long-term-care insurance when you\u2019re young and healthy, because that\u2019s how you pay the lower premium.\u201dThey were also encouraged by a federally financed program in which states urged their residents to buy long-term-care insurance. The goal was to keep Medicaid from being overwhelmed by tens of millions of aging baby boomers.The Sproules, Ms. Leonard and all the rest of Penn Treaty\u2019s policyholders have spent the last nine years in a strange legal limbo. State insurance regulators in Pennsylvania first petitioned the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania to order liquidation in 2009, which is standard procedure.But then the standard playbook went out the window. Droves of insurance agents challenged the petition in court. That\u2019s because as long as Penn Treaty stayed out of liquidation, they would keep receiving their sales commissions, which they said they were constitutionally entitled to.Health insurers fought the liquidation, too. State guarantee funds, it turns out, are not funded at all. When an insurance company goes under, all the surviving companies in that line of business are required to chip into the guarantor, with assessments based on their market share.Long-term-care insurance is classified as health insurance, so health insurers would get the assessment \u2014 even the ones that steered clear of long-term-care insurance and never sold a single policy. They were aghast at having to pay for other people\u2019s mistakes.Some of the staunchest opposition came from Penn Treaty\u2019s corporate parent, the Penn Treaty American Corporation of Frisco, Tex. Its chief executive, Eugene J. Woznicki, said that the insurer was viable and could be put back on its feet if only state insurance regulators would grant adequate rate increases. In court filings, he heaped blame on the Pennsylvania Insurance Department in particular.\u201cThe commissioner has deference,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHe can make decisions that he thinks are the right ones and not be challenged.\u201dAs it happens, Penn Treaty\u2019s financial problems date back at least to 2001, when the company noticed its claims were higher than expected. Executives worked with regulators on a \u201ccorrective action plan,\u201d which included fresh capital, reinsurance and a series of rate increases. But insurance rates are approved state by state, and while some granted the prescribed increases, others (including Pennsylvania) did not.\u201cThis case presents a serious indictment of the existing system of rate regulation of long-term-care insurance,\u201d Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt said in a 2012 opinion. By refusing to grant the rate increase, Pennsylvania \u201cshowed that rate regulation is governed by politics, not actuarial evidence or legal principles.\u201dThe 2001 rehabilitation plan may have been a lost cause, but things play out slowly in this corner of the insurance business. While Penn Treaty\u2019s troubles mounted, its offshore insurance deals gave it an appearance of normalcy. The biggest, with a reinsurer in Dublin, removed more than $1 billion in liabilities from Penn Treaty\u2019s balance sheet, making it look robust, despite the faltering corrective-action plan.And then, in the financial turmoil of 2008, Penn Treaty and its Irish reinsurer had a falling-out. Penn Treaty had to take back the $1 billion of liabilities, blowing a hole in its balance sheet. That was the beginning of the end. A year later, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department said the situation was irretrievable and asked the court for a liquidation order.\u201cIt was the best option,\u201d said the spokesman for the Insurance Department, Ron Ruman. \u201cThe company was not viable, and this would provide the maximum protection under law for the consumers.\u201dBut the court wrangling went on for nearly nine years before Judge Leavitt finally ordered the liquidation, in March. During that time, Penn Treaty\u2019s financial condition deteriorated further. And for nine years, policyholders didn\u2019t know if their insurer was dead or alive \u2014 but they kept getting those letters instructing them to keep paying their monthly premiums or they would lose everything.Policyholders who had already moved into nursing homes or other care facilities did have their claims paid throughout the proceedings.But those who didn\u2019t make the move yet, like Ms. Leonard, will in some cases bear losses. They are waiting now to hear how much. A few states cap guarantee-fund relief at $100,000. Others, like California and Connecticut, guarantee $500,000 and more. New Jersey is said to have no limit at all, but some analysts question that promise, especially if another big long-term-care insurer fails.\u201cI\u2019m sure I speak for everybody else: We\u2019re all confused,\u201d said Ms. Leonard, a retired member of the faculty at Nova Southeastern University. She said she had asked for updates on the nine-year court proceedings, but thought it was a class-action lawsuit. She was surprised to learn it was something else.\u201cIf this was not a class-action suit, then why was it not?\u201d she said. \u201cThere needs to be a class-action suit. It seems to me they need to be made an example of and made to honor their policies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "France in the End of Days", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byParis \u2014 For some time France has been a country that does not like itself. Somewhere on the road from its humiliation in World War II to its disappointment with European integration to its discomfort with globalization, France slid into moroseness. High-speed trains purred; France pouted. Grumbling became a way of life, the response to lost grandeur. Now France seems ready to vent this slow-ripening anger in an election that could see the extreme right return to power for the first time since the 1940s and Europe revert to a turbulence not seen since that epoch.If Marine Le Pen of the National Front wins, she says she will take France out of the euro, the shared European currency, and restore the franc. Exit from the European Union could follow. This would constitute an economic and political rupture so violent that even Donald Trump\u2019s victory and Britain\u2019s vote to leave the union would pale beside it. Europe, and not just its markets, would be upended. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has been meddling, would be happy.A Le Pen victory is far from assured, plausible if not probable. Returning to France late last month, to the glow of Paris and the gloom of the provinces, I was struck by how much Le Pen\u2019s party, whose racist ideology was once taboo, has joined the mainstream. The pattern that has prevailed throughout the Fifth Republic \u2014 alternation of center-left and center-right \u2014 seems dead. The French are tired of increasingly indistinguishable Socialist and Republican presidents. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a socialist with a single-digit approval rating, decided not to run for a second term. As elsewhere in the West, traditional parties bereft of compelling ideas are in crisis, buffeted by social-media-driven mobilizations.The first round of voting on April 23 is almost certain to send Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, the 39-year-old upstart leader of a new catchall centrist movement, into the runoff on May 7: the xenophobic nationalist versus the pro-Europe neophyte.Polls show them both with clear, if tightening, leads over the scandal-plagued Republican candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, and an extreme leftist, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, of the Unbowed France movement, whose support has surged in recent days. The left, still singing the Internationale and plotting class struggle, is in disarray. The inclination to blow up the system has found fertile ground. People have had it with experts. \u201c\u00c7a suffit!\u201d \u2014 \u201cEnough!\u201d \u2014 is a much-heard cry; and if disruption leads to deluge, so be it.Such end-of-days gloom is puzzling. Near 10 percent unemployment and near invisible growth cannot explain it. French infrastructure is a rebuke to American decay. French universal health care works. Savoir-vivre, the art of living, is not a French phrase for nothing. From the United States to China, the French hold on the world\u2019s imagination endures. It is a land of unique pleasures.\u201cThere is a certain French masochism,\u201d Pascal Bruckner, an author, told me. \u201cWe are a country that does not unleash its potential. We ruminate on the past. After 1989, we thought Europe would become French. But the models of Germany and Thatcher did much better. And so we lapse into mediocrity.\u201d Jacques Rupnik, a political scientist, put it this way: \u201cFrance suffers from cultural and civilizational insecurity. Many people feel somehow dispossessed.\u201dThis sense of dispossession, of loss, is what the National Front has exploited: loss of identity, jobs, national borders; loss of faith in a corrupt political system. \u201cOn est chez nous!\u201d \u2014 roughly \u201cWe are at home!\u201d \u2014 is the party\u2019s strange battle cry, chanted at every rally. But why such pathological need to reaffirm belonging, and who exactly are \u201cwe\u201d? Millions of immigrants from North and sub-Saharan Africa, many of them Muslims, do not appear to make the cut.\u201cThere is no right or left. This election is about patriotism versus globalization,\u201d Nicolas Bay, the secretary-general of the National Front, told me. \u201cThat is why we would end immigration. If it\u2019s Le Pen against the globalist Macron in the second round, it will be clear what the contest is about: Do we defend the nation, or is the nation finished?\u201dMacron is a former banker and economy minister under Hollande. Small, with glittering blue eyes, his pitch is that he\u2019s a tech-friendly pragmatist with the ability to revitalize France. Nobody quite knows what\u2019s in his gut. To fans he\u2019s a doer; to critics he\u2019s a hedger of bets. But nobody can deny his remarkable surge. En Marche! (Onward!), Macron\u2019s movement, was formed just a year ago. It has become the last best hope of those who would stop Le Pen.In an interview, Macron told me: \u201cLook, do you want to strengthen Europe, to have a strong reformed France, or do you just want to leave this world and return to the 19th century? What Le Pen proposes does not fly even for a second.\u201dI headed east to Metz, in the Lorraine region of France. Outside the station, opened in 1908 when the city was part of Germany, I found French, German and European Union flags fluttering to mark \u201cMetz Wunderbar\u201d (\u201cWonderful Metz\u201d) week, a celebration of French-German friendship. Such is Europe today: a shared house built over borders etched in blood. Lorraine closed its last iron ore mine a couple of decades ago. The region has struggled to replace it with service sector jobs. The National Front has prospered.At a restaurant I ran into Thierry Corona, a sommelier from nearby Koenigsmacker who had come to attend a Le Pen rally. A blue rose, Le Pen\u2019s campaign symbol, was pinned to his lapel. Corona was fired up. Le Pen would boost the wine industry by getting rid of a \u201cpolitically correct\u201d law curtailing advertising. She would end \u201cthe dictatorship of Brussels.\u201d She would rebuild \u201cFrance for the French.\u201dKoenigsmacker, Corona said, had been stripped of life. Small stores had been replaced by huge \u201chypermarkets\u201d on the outskirts of town. Human contact was almost forgotten. \u201cIn the shopping malls the cashiers are lined up like cattle for the slaughter,\u201d he said. Old people without cars were treated like human refuse. \u201cAnd immigrants arrive and they immediately get handouts!\u201dSuch provincial alienation is widespread. The most talked-about political book these days is Christophe Guilluy\u2019s \u201cThe France of the Periphery,\u201d a devastating portrait of what he calls the \u201ctotal cultural fracture\u201d between the networked milieu of Paris and a few other cities, and the declining dystopia outside them. If America has New York and Trump country, France has Paris and Koenigsmacker. The red state-blue state chasm, in various guises, is the core cultural condition of the West.\u201cThe political world is today a field of ruins,\u201d Guilluy writes. He cites a poll conducted in 2014 by the Ipsos research firm that found that 74 percent of French workers felt they were no longer \u201cat home\u201d; 74 percent saw globalization as a threat (while 68 percent of managers saw it as an opportunity).\u201cOn the fundamental subjects of globalization, free trade, immigration and multiculturalism, dialogue has become impossible,\u201d Guilluy concludes. This is the backdrop to workers\u2019 abandonment of the left and their embrace of the National Front, now the leading working-class party in France.Corona took me over to a nearby table where Florian Philippot, one of Le Pen\u2019s top advisers, was lunching. Philippot is an architect of the attempt to rebrand the party by shedding its Fascist, anti-Semitic antecedents (Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine\u2019s father, called the Holocaust \u201ca detail\u201d of history) and replacing it with France-first economic nationalism. Philippot is a slick operator. He did not have time to talk, but I saw him a half-hour later at the rally, warming up the crowd as images of Le Pen on a horse and with a truffle-hunting dog rolled across a giant screen, evoking the connection with \u201cLa France profonde\u201d (deep rural France) that is still de rigueur for any French political career.\u201cON EST CHEZ NOUS!\u201d the crowd roared. Philippot vowed that the \u201cradical Islamists strolling around our towns\u201d would soon be history. He called Macron an agent of high finance, a man \u201crecycling everything that has ruined France.\u201d Somebody in the crowd shouted \u201cRothschild!\u201d and then again \u201cRothschild!\u201d \u2014 a reference to the bank where Macron once worked. The attempt to rid the National Front of its anti-Semitism is clearly a work in progress.Indeed, Le Pen has reopened old wounds by insisting that France was not responsible for the \u201cVel\u2019 d\u2019Hiv\u201d \u2014 a reference to the stadium where 13,000 Jews were rounded up in 1942 before being dispatched to Auschwitz. She tried to portray the wartime Vichy government as distinct from France, an appalling evasion.Le Pen entered to thunderous applause in a black pantsuit. It\u2019s easy to imagine her an everywoman telling it like it is. Her hashtag is #aunomdupeuple (in the name of the people), and, like Trump, she vowed to \u201creturn power to the people.\u201d The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, she declared, would become \u201cthe house of the people,\u201d and referendums would be held on major issues like leaving the European Union.For a couple of hours Le Pen rambled. The influence of Islam was \u201cunbearable.\u201d France faced \u201ca choice of civilization\u201d \u2014 either uncontrolled immigration \u201cor recovering our home.\u201d National borders would not be closed; they would, however, exist. Patriotism meant resistance to \u201csavage globalization.\u201d In short, \u201cThe Republic must again become all-conquering.\u201dTh\u00e9rese and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Defaux were watching. \u201cLook, this is pretty simple,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe need to recover our values and defend them.\u201d Then his voice was drowned out. \u201cON EST CHEZ NOUS! ON EST CHEZ NOUS!\u201dEurope used to signify stability and peace. Now refugees and asylum seekers stream across the union\u2019s porous borders. To find jobs for immigrants, you need an open and flexible labor market. But the comprehensive French welfare state \u2014 financed by mandatory contributions for pensions, health and unemployment benefits that push up wage costs \u2014 tends toward inflexibility. Firing anyone can be tedious and expensive, so there\u2019s reluctance to hire. Youth unemployment stands around 25 percent. Over 31 percent of gross domestic product is spent on health, unemployment and other benefits, compared to 24.6 percent in Germany. France has in effect made a structural choice for unemployment. Everyone knows this. But because attachment to the model is fierce, honest discussion tends to be taboo.The first presidential debate last month was an exercise in evasions. The moderators redefined journalism as deferential passivity. Macron, Fillon and the socialist candidate, Beno\u00eet Hamon, were all dressed in blue suits and blue ties, like a bunch of airline stewards, and their responses scarcely differed more than their attire. Nobody even asked Fillon, a former prime minister, about the fact that he\u2019s been placed under investigation relating to allegations he employed his wife and children in make-believe jobs as aides.Fillon, a social conservative who favors free-market reforms and labor market deregulation, had been looking formidable but slumped after the scandal broke. He had promised to stand aside in the event of a formal judicial inquiry, but reneged, infuriating people. The political classes\u2019 contempt for the electorate was encapsulated in his volte-face. Voters\u2019 disgust has boosted the National Front, even if Le Pen is herself caught up in a financial fraud investigation at the European Parliament and has used parliamentary immunity to avoid a police summons.Her path to victory runs roughly like this. She qualifies for the second round with about 24 percent of the vote. Macron is her opponent, with about the same score. The more right-wing Fillon supporters migrate to Le Pen. Supporters of the far-left candidate, M\u00e9lenchon, refuse to vote for Macron; they\u2019ve had it with so-called \u201cuseful votes\u201d and they believe Macron, for all his talk of being a progressive, will pursue \u201cneoliberal\u201d global capitalism. Some Hamon supporters also refuse to back Macron. The abstention rate soars. Le Pen squeezes past 50 percent and becomes president.It could happen. Only a fool, after Brexit and Trump, would suggest otherwise. Le Pen\u2019s line of attack on Macron is clear: he is the perpetuation of Hollande, the representative of \u201cthe system\u201d and a product of \u201cinternational finance,\u201d with all the attendant innuendo. This attack is pretty disgusting, which is not to say it won\u2019t work. Russia is helping. The Russian propaganda site Sputnik has singled out Macron for attack. It was behind rumors that he\u2019s gay and living with the head of Radio France \u2014 rumors so insistent that Macron, who\u2019s married to his 64-year-old former high-school teacher, had to deny them.One thing is certain: Le Pen needs to distract attention from her economic program, a hodgepodge of nationalist and statist measures combined with exit from the euro, which alone could send French bank accounts into free fall. Fear of such a meltdown may be the biggest obstacle Le Pen still has to overcome.I found Macron in Paris answering questions for a Yahoo News event in French and then English (radical for a French politician). The first question was whether \u201cexplicit Macron\u201d is an oxymoron. He laughed. He said he was pragmatic, supple, interested above all in results. His political family was broad: the pro-European moderate right, socialists, progressives, \u201creasonable ecologists.\u201d He called for \u201cstrong reforms\u201d of the French labor market, decreased corporate taxes and invigorated vocational training.\u201cModernity is disruptive,\u201d he declared, \u201cand I endorse that.\u201dAs economy minister, Macron\u2019s \u201cdisruption\u201d involved allowing stores to open on Sundays and creating what are still called \u201cMacron buses\u201d to offer cheap competition to trains for journeys within France: deregulation, French-style! More reform is needed; it\u2019s proved elusive because nobody wants to give up their \u201cacquis\u201d \u2014 the benefits they already have. Whether Macron could build a parliamentary base for change is also an open question.Still, he\u2019s proved that he can break molds. Perhaps his most attractive feature is his brave attachment to the European Union and commitment to helping refugees. \u201cWe are a continent of refugees,\u201d he said, \u201cand if you say we can\u2019t integrate refugees, that\u2019s not consistent with our values, even if borders cannot be wide open.\u201dI asked him if his pragmatism could really fly in an age of populist demagogy. Sure, he told me. \u201cWe are contrarians,\u201d he went on. \u201cWhen neoliberal economics was triumphing everywhere, we refused to adopt it. And now when demagogues are winning, in France pragmatism is going to win.\u201dMacron continued: \u201cThere is a crisis of such proportions that people are ready for change. I am not shy. I am for an open society. I am for a progressive world. I do not propose to reform France; I propose to transform it at its deepest level.\u201dCould he do it? I want to believe he can, in part because I take seriously something he had said earlier: \u201cI want to help with Muslim integration. If you follow the line of Marine Le Pen, you create a civil war.\u201dIn \u201cSubmission,\u201d his best-selling novel, Michel Houellebecq writes: \u201cThe growing gap \u2014 an abyss \u2014 between the population and those who spoke in its name, politicians and journalists, had necessarily to lead to something chaotic, violent and unpredictable. France, like other western countries, had been heading for a long time toward civil war.\u201dIn the book, frantic maneuvering to keep Le Pen from power leads to the victory of an imagined Islamic party led by a telegenic character Mohammed Ben Abbes. Houellebecq\u2019s France is culturally exhausted \u2014 a land of desperate sex and spiritual emptiness \u2014 and so it succumbs to a movement driven by faith and conviction.I get talking to Moussa Sanogo, who came to France from the Ivory Coast a quarter-century ago, and N\u2019diaye Fousseiny, from Mali. Here\u2019s the deal, Sanogo explains, there are no jobs for his kids. He used to install scaffolding, but these days Polish and Romanian construction workers arrive by truck every Monday, making it impossible for French citizens to compete. \u201cMy son drifts around the projects selling drugs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the only business that works.\u201d Fousseiny, who works a night shift at Disneyland Paris, tells me his 14-year-old daughter got detained the other night while hanging out with dealers. Integration through education, the French Republic\u2019s promise, has broken down.I ask about Islamic radicalism. Sanogo, a Muslim, says the area \u201cis worse than Molenbeek,\u201d the terrorist-breeding district of Brussels. About 30 young men from the area, he says, had left for Syria. \u201cLook,\u201d he tells me, \u201chere we are, there\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s a hole, and the jihadists do this out of vengeance. It\u2019s revenge for an indecent life.\u201d He describes a pattern: first drugs, then the discovery of religion (perhaps in jail), then radicalization in clandestine mosques.Close to five million Muslims live in France. Many succeed, but they are likely to have overcome prejudice first. Nisrine Zaibi, the daughter of Tunisian immigrants and now the socialist vice president of the Burgundy regional council, told me how when she became a French citizen at the age of 18, she was asked if she wanted to change her name to \u201csomething more French.\u201d (She also told me she would never \u201cvote useful\u201d for Macron.) Job interviews inevitably turn to questions about the veil or extremism. La\u00efcit\u00e9 often translates into laws banning Muslim headscarves. It may seem a short step from defining the state by its secularism to insisting everyone become secular. \u201cThe banlieue can be a desperate place,\u201d Zaibi said. \u201cI know people who are ready to vote Le Pen just to break something.\u201dAs I leave Sevran, a lanky kid barges into me. \u201cYou could excuse yourself,\u201d he says, looking for a fight. We square up; he moves off, muttering insults. Violence simmers just beneath the surface.Villers-Cotter\u00eats, a town in Picardy about an hour northeast of Paris, has a special place in French history. It was here in 1539 that Francis I established French rather than Latin as the language of all legal acts and notarized documents. The town is synonymous with the forging of that formidable thing: French culture. Today it is run by a National Front mayor, Franck Briffaut.Briffaut thinks Macron is a clown. \u201cHe\u2019s an unidentified political object, part toad and part duck,\u201d he told me. Another Macron stumble \u2014 the decision to go to Algiers to tell an autocrat that France should apologize for its colonial-era \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d \u2014 caused the mayor to explode. \u201cIt\u2019s scandalous, this penitence! Every country has a history of light and shadow. We cannot blame ourselves. These Algerians wanted us to leave. Well, if French colonialism was so terrible, why do they flock here to colonize us today?\u201dAn ex-parachutist who served in Beirut, the bristling Briffaut sees a war of civilizations against Islamism. Parts of France have become no-go areas, he says. \u201cI joined the National Front because I did not want to see what happened in Lebanon happen in France.\u201d He asks me why Trump even had to say \u201cAmerica First.\u201d It\u2019s obvious a nation must put itself first.After the meeting, I am joined by two leftists who worked in education before retirement, Jean-Claude Meunier and Christiane Dufour. They hate the National Front but will not \u201cvote useful\u201d for Macron. Their issue is growing inequality and what they call the \u201cpauperization\u201d of France as the welfare state and workers\u2019 rights and salaries are gradually eroded. They wanted a \u201csocial Europe\u201d; they got what they see as a Europe of ruthless capitalism.We head for a restaurant called the Kiosk of Bacchus. I order a Coke but am brought a glass of C\u00f4te de Gascogne red wine \u2014 \u201cour form of resistance,\u201d Meunier jokes. Dufour\u2019s daughter, Geraldine Leclerc, has joined us. She is struggling as a nurse. \u201cIt\u2019s just more and more difficult to survive,\u201d she says. \u201cFrance is a land of gradual degradation.\u201d Still, we raise a glass and, of course, the steak tartare is first-rate.An argument ensues. Cyril Jacquiot opened the restaurant last year and is working a 75-hour week. He thinks France\u2019s problem is not the fraying welfare state but the fact that \u201cthere are too many acquired rights and too little will to work.\u201d Jacquiot tells Dufour and Meunier they are deluded. If France is the land of \u201cimmobilisme\u201d \u2014 roughly paralysis \u2014 it is because the French know they are protected. \u201cIf you want less unemployment, you need more flexibility,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople need to know they can be fired. Otherwise all sense of responsibility is lost. You have to decide in life: Do you want to work or not?\u201dI listen to the escalating row. In truth, I am not sure the French will ever decide. They live better than they admit but in a state of growing angst fed by failures they are not quite ready to confront. That is the backdrop to Le Pen\u2019s possible victory. It is a frightening prospect; French streets could become battlegrounds. Insurrection is another of those French habits that do not die easily.Seeking quiet, I wander into a park that was once the grounds of the chateau where Francis I made French the language of the land. The chateau, its roof sagging, its windows boarded up, is collapsing into ruin.An earlier version of this column misstated the given name, in one instance, and the surname, in a photo caption, of a restaurant owner. He is Cyril Jacquiot, not Cyrille Jacquinot. A separate caption misstated where that photo was taken: It was in Sevran, not Sevran Cotterets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Moves to Ban Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses as \u2018Extremist\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byVOROKHOBINO, Russia \u2014 A dedicated pacifist who has never even held a gun, Andrei Sivak discovered that his government considered him a dangerous extremist when he tried to change some money and the teller \u201csuddenly looked up at me with a face full of fear.\u201dHis name had popped up on the exchange bureau\u2019s computer system, along with those of members of Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and other militant groups responsible for shocking acts of violence.The only group the 43-year-old father of three has ever belonged to, however, is Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, a Christian denomination committed to the belief that the Bible must be taken literally, particularly its injunction \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201dYet, in a throwback to the days of the Soviet Union, when Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were hounded as spies and malcontents by the K.G.B., the denomination is at the center of an escalating campaign by the authorities to curtail religious groups that compete with the Russian Orthodox Church and that challenge President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s efforts to rally the country behind traditional and often militaristic patriotic values.Whether it stays there will depend on Russia\u2019s Supreme Court, which is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to hear a request from the Justice Ministry to outlaw the religious organization and stop its more than 170,000 Russian members from spreading \u201cextremist\u201d texts.Extremism, as defined by a law passed in 2002 but amended and expanded several times since, has become a catchall charge that can be deployed against just about anybody, as it has been against some of those involved in recent anti-corruption protests in Moscow and scores of other cities.Several students who took part in demonstrations in the Siberian city of Tomsk are now being investigated by a special anti-extremism unit, while Leonid Volkov, the senior aide to the jailed protest leader Aleksei A. Navalny, said he himself was detained last week under the extremism law.In the case of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, the putative extremism seems to derive mostly from the group\u2019s absolute opposition to violence, a stand that infuriated Soviet and now Russian authorities whose legitimacy rests in large part on the celebration of martial triumphs, most notably over Nazi Germany in World War II but also over rebels in Syria.Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, members of a denomination founded in the United States in the 19th century and active in Russia for more than 100 years, refuse military service, do not vote and view God as the only true leader. They shun the patriotic festivals promoted with gusto by the Kremlin, like the annual celebration of victory in 1945 and recent events to celebrate the annexation of Crimea in March 2014.Mr. Sivak, who says he lost his job as a physical education teacher because of his role as a Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses elder, said he voted for Mr. Putin in 2000, three years before joining the denomination. He added that while he had not voted since, nor had he supported anti-Kremlin activities of the sort that usually attract the attention of Russia\u2019s post-Soviet version of the K.G.B., the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B.\u201cI have absolutely no interest in politics,\u201d he said during a recent Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Friday service in a wooden country house in Vorokhobino, a snow-covered village north of Moscow. Around 100 worshipers crammed into a long, chilly room under fluorescent lights to listen to readings from the Bible, sing and watch a video advising them to dress for worship as they would for a meeting with the president.\u201cFrom the Russian state\u2019s perspective, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are completely separate,\u201d said Geraldine Fagan, the author of \u201cBelieving in Russia \u2014 Religious Policy After Communism.\u201d She added, \u201cThey don\u2019t get involved in politics, but this is itself seen as a suspicious political deviation.\u201d\u201cThe idea of independent and public religious activity that is completely outside the control of \u2014 and also indifferent to \u2014 the state sets all sorts of alarm bells ringing in the Orthodox Church and the security services,\u201d she said.That the worldwide headquarters of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses is in the United States and that its publications are mostly prepared there, Ms. Fagan added, \u201call adds up to a big conspiracy theory\u201d for the increasingly assertive F.S.B.For Mr. Sivak, it has added up to a long legal nightmare. His troubles began, he said, when undercover security officers posed as worshipers and secretly filmed a service where he was helping to officiate in 2010.Accused of \u201cinciting hatred and disparaging the human dignity of citizens,\u201d he was put on trial for extremism along with a second elder, Vyacheslav Stepanov, 40. The prosecutor\u2019s case, heard by a municipal court in Sergiyev Posad, a center of the Russian Orthodox Church, produced no evidence of extremism and focused instead on the insufficient patriotism of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\u201cTheir disregard for the state,\u201d a report prepared for the prosecution said, \u201cerodes any sense of civic affiliation and promotes the destruction of national and state security.\u201dIn a ruling last year, the court found the two men not guilty, and their ordeal seemed over \u2014 until Mr. Sivak tried to change money and was told that he had been placed on a list of \u201cterrorists and extremists.\u201dHe and Mr. Stepanov now face new charges of extremism and are to appear before a regional court this month. \u201cThere is a big wave of repression breaking,\u201d Mr. Stepanov said.In response to written questions, the Justice Ministry in Moscow said a yearlong review of documents at the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u201cadministrative center\u201d near St. Petersburg had uncovered violations of a Russian law banning extremism. As a result, it added, the center should be \u201cliquidated,\u201d along with nearly 400 locally registered branches of the group and other structures.For the denomination\u2019s leaders in Russia, the sharp escalation in a long campaign of harassment, previously driven mostly by local officials, drew horrifying flashbacks to the Soviet era.Vasily Kalin, the chairman of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 Russian arm, recalled that his whole family had been deported to Siberia when he was a child. \u201cIt is sad and reprehensible that my children and grandchildren should be facing a similar fate,\u201d he said. \u201cNever did I expect that we would again face the threat of religious persecution in modern Russia.\u201dIn Russia, as in many countries, the door-to-door proselytizing of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses often causes irritation, and their theological idiosyncrasies disturb many mainstream Christians. The group has also been widely criticized for saying that the Bible prohibits blood transfusions. But it has never promoted violent or even peaceful political resistance.That message, it would seem, is that everyone needs to get with the Putin program \u2014 or risk being branded as an extremist for displaying indifference, never mind hostility, to the Kremlin\u2019s drive to make Russia a great power again.\u201cA big reason they are being targeted is simply that they are an easy target,\u201d Ms. Fagan said. \u201cThey don\u2019t vote, so nobody is going to lose votes by attacking them.\u201dAttacking Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses also sends a signal that even the mildest deviation from the norm, if proclaimed publicly and insistently, can be punished under the anti-extremism law, which was passed after Russia\u2019s second war in Chechnya and the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.Billed as a move by Russia to join a worldwide struggle against terrorism, the law prohibited \u201cincitement of racial, national or religious strife, and social hatred associated with violence or calls for violence.\u201dBut the reference to violence was later deleted, opening the way for the authorities to classify as extremist any group claiming to offer a unique, true path to religious or political salvation.Even the Russian Orthodox Church has sometimes fallen afoul of the law: The slogan \u201cOrthodoxy or Death!\u201d \u2014 a rallying cry embraced by some hard-line believers \u2014 has been banned as an illegal extremist text.To help protect the Orthodox Church and other established religions, Parliament passed a law in 2015 to exempt the Bible and the Quran, as well as Jewish and Buddhist scripture, from charges of extremism based on their claims to offer the only true faith.The main impetus for the current crackdown, however, appears to come from the security services, not the Orthodox Church. Roman Lunkin, director of the Institute of Religion and Law, a Moscow research group, described it as \u201cpart of a broad policy of suppressing all nongovernmental organizations\u201d that has gained particular force because of the highly centralized structure of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses under a worldwide leadership based in the United States.\u201cThey are controlled from outside Russia, and this is very suspicious for our secret services,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like having an organization that they do not and cannot control.\u201dArtyom Grigoryan, a former Jehovah\u2019s Witness who used to work at the group\u2019s Russian headquarters but who now follows the Orthodox Church, said the organization had \u201cmany positive elements,\u201d like its ban on excessive drinking, smoking and other unhealthy habits.All the same, he said it deserved to be treated with suspicion. \u201cLook at it from the view of the state,\u201d he said. \u201cHere is an organization that is run from America, that gets financing from abroad, and whose members don\u2019t serve in the army and don\u2019t vote.\u201dEstranged from his parents, who are still members and view his departure as sinful, he said Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses broke up families and \u201cin the logic of the state, it presents a threat.\u201dHe added, \u201cI am not saying this is real or not, but it needs to be checked by objective experts.\u201dMr. Sivak, now preparing for yet another trial, said that he had always tried to follow the law and that he respected the state, but could not put its interests above the commands of his faith.\u201cThey say I am a terrorist,\u201d he said, \u201cbut all I ever wanted to do was to get people to pay attention to the Bible.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Andrei Sivak\u2019s age. He is 43, not 42. The error was repeated in a picture caption, which also misstated the age of Vyacheslav Stepanov. He is 40, not 39. And because of an editing error, the article also misidentified the person who said he was detained last week under Russia\u2019s extremism law. It was Leonid Volkov, not Aleksei A. Navalny.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As It Embraces Las Vegas, N.F.L. Is Awash in Gambling Contradictions", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported byLas Vegas has evolved enough for us to bless it with our presence, the league seemed to be saying.But the decision to leave Oakland and embrace Las Vegas presents conflicts for a league that has long stood vehemently against gambling. A franchise will live in Sin City \u2014 a notion considered a nonstarter just five years ago \u2014 as a neighbor of the casinos and sports books that for so long were the enemy.Goodell has said that the league\u2019s policies are all about protecting the integrity of the game, but they amount to a hodgepodge of contradictions.The league continues to fight legal efforts that would effectively let states other than Nevada and Delaware introduce sports gambling even as leagues like the N.B.A. and the N.H.L., which have stood with the N.F.L. in court, have softened their stance on the issue. The N.F.L. also continues to penalize players and other league personnel who are paid to appear at casinos even as team owners collect millions of dollars from sponsorships with casinos, state lotteries and fantasy football providers, and play games in England, where sports betting is legal.\u201cHow can you have a franchise there and not allow players to participate in arm wrestling contests?\u201d said Scott Rosner, who teaches sports law and business at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWhen you get into the weeds, the policies may not be as inconsistent as they seem, but the optics are that the league is very inconsistent on this.\u201dThe N.F.L., though, will remedy these contradictions, Rosner said. The Raiders will play in Oakland for at least two more seasons, giving the owners time to revisit their rules and bring them more in line with the reality that gambling has become far more ubiquitous than the days when gamblers had to place bets through a bookie or at a racetrack.The N.F.L. is often criticized for having a double standard on gambling, in part because the public seems to be more accepting of betting on games. A recent poll by researchers at Seton Hall University found that just 21 percent of respondents thought the N.F.L. was tarnishing its reputation by putting a team in Las Vegas. While it\u2019s hard to imagine another American city prompting such a negative reaction, it is also a far smaller percentage than might have been the case even a decade ago.In the immediate future, the league will tread more slowly because a lawsuit brought by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to allow casinos in his and other states to open sports books is still pending. The N.F.L. and other leagues have argued for years that permitting sports gambling beyond Nevada and Delaware would harm them. When that case concludes, the N.F.L. will be able to revisit its stance on gambling, said Daniel Wallach, a sports gambling lawyer at Becker & Poliakoff in Florida.The league is not averse to sports gambling and recognizes that there is a lot of money to be made, he added. The key, he said, is for the league to manage the process by, for instance, lobbying Congress to introduce a national policy on sports wagering instead of facing variations in each state.\u201cThey\u2019re not fighting to stop sports betting, they\u2019re fighting allowing states to come up with their own apparatus in their own ways,\u201d Wallach said.If anything, this is good business, and if there is anything the N.F.L. has shown, it is good at making money. The league certainly recognizes that the growth of DirecTV\u2019s N.F.L. Sunday Ticket, which lets fans watch every game, and Verizon\u2019s N.F.L. RedZone, which shows every scoring play, has been driven by people who gamble on football. Fans who bet on N.F.L. games watched more than twice as many games as nonbetting ones during the 2015 regular season, according to a study by Nielsen Sports financed by the American Gaming Association.The question, then, is how the league continues to prevent the perception, real or otherwise, that games might be influenced by gamblers, while also adapting to a changing world in which casinos and gambling in general are becoming more pervasive.\u201cWe have to make sure that we continue to stay focused on making sure that everyone has full confidence that what you see on the field is not influenced by any outside factors,\u201d Goodell said last month. \u201cWe will not relent on that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Showdown Over Wells Fargo\u2019s Board of Directors Looms", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byPONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. \u2014 The scandal at Wells Fargo over the creation of millions of fake bank accounts cost more than 5,300 people their jobs, many of them tellers and other low-level employees.The bank then clawed back tens of millions of dollars in pay from its retired chief executive and fired the former head of the retail operation.The next group of employees who could lose their jobs are Wells Fargo\u2019s board of directors, who face re-election on Tuesday at the bank\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.Giant pension funds \u2014 like Calpers, which manages the retirement funds of California\u2019s public employees, and its New York City counterpart \u2014 are planning to vote against most of Wells\u2019s 15 board members, saying they failed in their duties to oversee the company.The bank does have one influential ally: Warren Buffett, whose firm, Berkshire Hathaway, owns about 10 percent of the company\u2019s shares. He has signaled that he intends to back the incumbent board, and his support could ultimately carry more weight than that of investors like pension funds, which tend to be more vocal in their criticism.As of late Monday, a few large shareholders were leaning toward voting against some board members. (Two people joined the board in February, after the scandal had been widely exposed.)\u201cIf there is a serious failure in oversight, directors need to be held accountable,\u201d said Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller. He helps oversee the city\u2019s pension funds, which are planning to vote against most of the bank\u2019s 15 directors.Wells Fargo has argued that ousting the board would be extreme and unnecessary because the bank has already taken aggressive steps like clawing back executive pay and reworking sales incentives in its retail banking.In its defense, the board has said bank executives were not entirely forthcoming with directors about the extent of the fraud, according to an internal investigation into the scandal that was commissioned by the board and released this month.Tuesday\u2019s vote puts Wells in uncharted territory. While some companies occasionally face calls to replace a handful of directors at a time, it is unusual for investors to push for most members to be ousted at once.Upending the board\u2019s leadership could create more uncertainty for Wells Fargo, just as the bank is trying to regain respect and credibility among customers, investors and regulators.The bank has declined to say whether it has a contingency plan in place should its board members lose their re-election bid.On Monday, Wells Fargo received a rare respite from months of regulatory pressure: The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said Wells Fargo had submitted an adequate plan to wind down in the event that it faced a financial catastrophe. The regulators had rejected its previous \u201cliving will\u201d plan.Also uncertain is how the bank would react to the shareholders\u2019 votes, should they want to remove some of the directors. Under Wells Fargo\u2019s corporate governance standards, director nominees must receive a simple majority of votes to win election.If directors fall short of that mark, they must tender their resignations \u2014 but ultimately, the board decides whether to accept them.The board can then appoint new members to fill any vacancies that arise.The vote is not only a serious challenge for Wells, one of the nation\u2019s largest banks. It is also a test for a decades-long movement among certain shareholders who have been pushing to hold corporate leaders more accountable.\u201cIf we\u2019re serious about board accountability in this country, it\u2019s hard to understand the case for keeping these directors,\u201d said Robert J. Jackson, a professor at Columbia Law School and the director of the school\u2019s program on corporate law and policy.Yet for all the scandals that have rattled corporate America over the past decade \u2014 such as those in the mortgage market and the media industry \u2014 it is extremely rare for a board to take the fall.Of the more than 37,000 corporate directors who have faced elections at companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index since 2007, only 57 have failed to gain a majority of votes, according to ISS Analytics, the data arm of Institutional Shareholder Services.A second company, Glass Lewis, recommended against the re-election of six directors, including all of those who served on the bank\u2019s risk committee.Sometimes, company directors are targeted by aggressive investors who buy up an underperforming stock and then push for changes at the company. These so-called activist investors \u2014 often hedge funds \u2014 will put forth their own candidates for board seats in order to enact a specific agenda.In recent years, there have been calls to replace a few board members at Target, after customer data was stolen in a digital breach, and at Viacom, over concerns about compensation.But those efforts took aim only at the directors who served on committees overseeing specific issues, like compensation and corporate responsibility.Among Wells Fargo investors, the concerns about the board\u2019s leadership go much deeper.One major shareholder advisory firm, ISS Proxy Analysis, has recommended that investors vote against 12 of the 15, including the chairman, Stephen W. Sanger, a former chairman of General Mills.Disgruntled shareholders say they are frustrated the board did not detect warning signs that stretched back for more than a decade. The bank\u2019s directors allowed Wells Fargo\u2019s decentralized management system to flourish, even though it gave them fairly little insight into important operational areas, and they \u2014 like the bank\u2019s regulators \u2014 overlooked signals that something was badly amiss, including a growing number of whistle-blower complaints and firings of employees.As late as 2015, when the board was given materials that labeled the bank\u2019s sales tactics high risk, directors viewed the problem as a small and manageable one. Because customers rarely lost much money to the fraudulent fees they were charged, the board considered the unethical acts to be minor misdeeds and \u201cvictimless crimes,\u201d according to the board\u2019s investigative report.That infuriates Seth Magaziner, Rhode Island\u2019s treasurer, who oversees funds that own Wells Fargo shares. He is voting against all of the incumbent directors.\u201cBoard members are elected by shareholders to be our watchdogs,\u201d Mr. Magaziner said. To be unaware of such widespread fraud is inexcusable, he said.Mr. Buffett, who holds the largest stake in Wells Fargo, has not elaborated publicly on his decision to back the current board.Calstrs, the large pension fund for California teachers, which has made it known it is voting against nine board members, owns less than 1 percent.The annual meeting on Tuesday is being held at a resort in Ponte Vedra Beach, on Florida\u2019s northeast coast, that is dotted with lakes, waterfalls and pristine golf greens.Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco, likes to hold its annual meetings in cities around the country close to its large facilities.After the financial crisis, protesters swarmed the annual meetings of Wall Street banks en masse, demanding retribution for their role in contributing to widespread foreclosures.In recent years, the protests have subsided somewhat as activist shareholders have focused on other issues, such as the big banks\u2019 role in facilitating climate change.The Wells Fargo meeting promises more fireworks as groups of nuns and environmentalists \u2014 in particular, those who oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline, which Wells has helped finance \u2014 converge on the resort.But the fate of the board will most likely be determined out of the limelight. Many of the largest shareholders are likely to cast their votes remotely and are not expected to attend the meeting.Stacy Cowley reported from Ponte Vedra Beach and Michael Corkery from New York.

{"Headline": "A Hushed Departure at the Met Museum Reveals Entrenched Management Culture", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "Supported byIn 2010, the Metropolitan Museum of Art hired Erin Coburn away from the J. Paul Getty Museum, lauding her as its \u201cfirst chief officer of digital media\u201d \u2014 a role created and promoted by the Met director and chief executive, Thomas P. Campbell, as part of his efforts to move the museum into the 21st century.Two years later, Ms. Coburn quietly left, along with a confidential settlement from the Met. Though no clear explanation was given at the time, recent interviews with former and current staff members reveal that Ms. Coburn had long complained that she was unable to do her job effectively because of a close personal relationship between Mr. Campbell and a female staff member in her department.Despite its vaunted collection, prodigious $332 million budget and a board stocked with some of the country\u2019s most powerful donors, the Met is largely run by a dozen or so executives and trustees, interviews show, with little transparency or accountability.The recent discovery of a looming $40 million deficit that forced the institution to cut staff, trim its exhibition schedule and postpone a heralded $600 million expansion are signs that the system is showing cracks. Now, details about how dysfunction in the digital media department was allowed to continue are revealing additional consequences of the Met\u2019s turning a blind eye to problems.Ms. Coburn filed a formal complaint in 2012. Met executives investigated her claims but concluded they didn\u2019t warrant action. The board\u2019s chairman, Daniel Brodsky, and several museum executives negotiated Ms. Coburn\u2019s departure and settlement while Mr. Campbell stayed on.Yet, for many then at the Met, the results of Mr. Campbell\u2019s relationship with a member of Ms. Coburn\u2019s staff were plain. The employee had a direct line to Mr. Campbell and amassed power well beyond her rank, they say, sidelining certain colleagues as well as commanding resources and hiring outside staff members for her projects, which added costs and created infrastructure complications.Leaders of the Met board and staff knew of the relationship before Ms. Coburn was hired, and at times had urged Mr. Campbell to end it, according to several people inside the museum.Mr. Campbell and the staff member \u201chad an inappropriate relationship,\u201d said Matthew R. Morgan, the general manager of the Met\u2019s website from 2006 to 2012.\u201cIt was the reason I left,\u201d he said. Mr. Campbell\u2019s decisions favored the \u201cvanity\u201d of the staff member with whom he had close ties \u201cover doing digital the right way,\u201d Mr. Morgan added.This article is based on interviews with more than two dozen people during the past month, including Met trustees, senior executives, curators and former and current members of the digital staff. All expressed admiration for the museum and its acclaimed exhibitions, but many indicated concern that Met leaders would not take a hard look at themselves and find ways to change.\u201cThis is not just the singular responsibility of the C.E.O.,\u201d said Reynold Levy, the former president of Lincoln Center and an expert on nonprofits, speaking generally about the Met\u2019s culture and recent struggles. \u201cThe board needs to hold a mirror up to itself and assess its own performance.\u201dAs boards go, the Met\u2019s is high end and old school. An international jewel of the art world, the museum sits atop the hierarchy of major New York cultural institutions and a spot on its board has long been considered the pinnacle of prestige.At 101 members, the board is also unusually large, which means decisions tend to be made in committees, the most important of which are the executive and finance committees. Expectations for most everyone else are relatively simple: deep pockets, attendance at five meetings a year and a willingness to let the Met\u2019s top executives handle the details.\u201cIf you\u2019re not on the executive committee, you don\u2019t know anything,\u201d said a trustee, who insisted on anonymity because board members have been warned against speaking publicly. \u201cYou\u2019re expected to work and give, but not to question what goes on.\u201dAnother trustee said, \u201cFew people have spoken up in a meeting for about 40 years.\u201dThis laissez-faire style appeared to work well enough, including throughout the 31-year tenure of Philippe de Montebello, who retired as director in 2008, just before the financial crisis. But the world has changed for the Met since then. Corporate and government donations to cultural institutions have declined; competition from contemporary art institutions like the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art has increased; and the demands to reach new audiences digitally have become urgent.It was in this environment that the board promoted Mr. Campbell, a former tapestry curator who \u2014 while erudite and elegant \u2014 had never managed an institution, let alone one with 2,200 employees.Many inside and outside the Met describe Mr. Brodsky, a real estate executive who has been chairman since 2011, as a likable but passive leader who avoids conflict and has continued the Met tradition of informing the full board of museum developments at the last minute or, in the case of the Coburn investigation, not until he learned about the impending publication of this article.Inside the Met, several top executives knew about Ms. Coburn\u2019s complaints, former employees say, including Emily K. Rafferty, then president; Sharon H. Cott, the senior vice president, secretary and general counsel; Debra A. McDowell, the vice president for human resources; and Carrie Rebora Barratt, the associate director for collections and administration, all of whom declined to comment.But aside from Mr. Brodsky and Candace K. Beinecke, chairwoman of the board\u2019s legal committee, other trustees were not made aware of the complaint. The Met said that this was to protect the confidentiality of the parties involved.Moreover, without the approval or knowledge of the entire board, the Met brought the full force of its resources to bear on the case, hiring an external management consultant as well as two law firms, which conducted a six-week investigation.Tax records show that Ms. Coburn received $183,000 in addition to her annual salary of $166,000 in her final year at the museum, an unusually high payment given that she had been employed for just two years. The museum would not comment on whether the size of the payment was connected to her claim or why the terms of her departure had been kept confidential.As for the staff, no one was told the real reasons for the departure of Ms. Coburn, an executive described by former colleagues as \u201cvisionary\u201d and \u201cprincipled.\u201d\u201cTo drive someone like Erin Coburn out and see her undermined was very disconcerting to the whole department,\u201d said Paco Link, the digital department\u2019s former general manager of creative development, who had also worked with Ms. Coburn at the Getty.The exact nature of Mr. Campbell\u2019s relationship with the staff member \u2014 whom The New York Times is not naming to protect her privacy \u2014 is not widely known, except that she became friendly with Mr. Campbell when he was chief tapestry curator and that their relationship grew closer after he became director in 2009, current and former employees say.The staff member joined the Met in 2000 and was promoted to manager of online publications in 2009. She was generally considered capable and helped develop the museum\u2019s acclaimed online timeline, as well as website programs that feature curators and artists discussing pieces in the museum.Nevertheless, her relationship with the museum director made her \u201cvery hard\u201d to manage, said Morgan S. Holzer, a former project manager at the Met.Neither the staff member nor Mr. Campbell responded to requests for comment.During the past seven years, newer trustees from the business world have, by many accounts, brought a more bottom-line metabolism to the board \u2014 zeroing in on the Met\u2019s financial troubles; hiring a new president and chief operating officer, Daniel H. Weiss, a former president of Haverford College, in 2015; and enlisting Boston Consulting to do one of the \u201c360 evaluations\u201d commonly used by Fortune 500 companies to assess employees.Mr. Campbell remains director until June. Mr. Weiss, who has taken over Mr. Campbell\u2019s role as chief executive on an interim basis, is considered a leading candidate for the next director, though the Met is planning a formal search. At a recent board meeting the Met agreed to examine the job descriptions of president and director.Mr. Brodsky, in response to detailed questions from The Times, said in a prepared statement: \u201cThe board is deeply committed to ensuring a professional workplace, and one that is free of favoritism of any kind. While we believe, in this case, that the board responded appropriately by ordering an investigation by independent, external experts \u2014 which concluded Ms. Coburn\u2019s complaint was without merit \u2014 there is more we can do.\u201dMs. Coburn was replaced by Sree Sreenivasan, who left in June, and then by Loic Tallon, under whom the female staff member was laid off, along with several others, in October.The current president, Mr. Weiss, said he was committed to establishing a very different management culture at the museum.\u201cI know that this has been a difficult time at the Met,\u201d he said in an email last week. \u201cI look forward to working with my administrative and board colleagues to support a climate of candor, transparency, accountability and mutual respect.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "France\u2019s Far Right, Once Known for Anti-Semitism, Courts Jews", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterPARIS \u2014 For years, France\u2019s far-right National Front was synonymous with anti-Semitism. Its founder, Jean Marie Le Pen, was notorious for anti-Semitic outbursts \u2014 including a comment that the Holocaust was just a detail of history.But since Mr. Le Pen\u2019s daughter Marine took over the party\u2019s leadership in 2011, the National Front has attempted a remarkable about-face: Today, the party positions itself as a champion of French Jews.Although Ms. Le Pen, one of the front-runners in the coming presidential election, still alludes to anti-Semitic stereotypes on the campaign trail, she now promises that her party will be the protector of French Jews.It is a surprising twist that has resonated with some French Jews who feel abandoned by what they see as the government\u2019s tepid response to the anti-Semitic violence that has plagued the country for years.But experts say the National Front\u2019s shift may be intended more as a message to non-Jewish voters looking for moral cover in supporting a party that vilifies their primary sources of fear and anger: Muslims and immigrants.The National Front has long been widely viewed in France as toxic, but by declaring itself a shield for French Jews, it may have found an effective way to allow many voters to justify breaking a taboo. That reflects a concept known as \u201cmoral license.\u201d Framing the party as a champion of one minority enables voters to justify supporting its agenda in suppressing another.The result is not a more racially tolerant National Front, but rather a party that has found nearly unprecedented success in persuading mainstream voters \u2014 many of whom may be quietly sympathetic to its anti-immigrant agenda \u2014 to embrace far-right ideas once considered off-limits.\u201cThey are instrumentalizing us,\u201d said Jonathan Arfi, vice president of the Council of Jewish Institutions in France, which goes by the French acronym CRIF. \u201cWe are a small minority,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have an important symbolic role to play.\u201dMr. Arfi can point to the precise month when the new age of anti-Semitism began in France: September 2000, the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising. That brought about attacks on Jews in France, particularly those who lived in poorer neighborhoods on the outskirts of large cities \u2014 areas that had gradually become dominated by Muslim immigrants from North Africa and their families. Since then, anti-Semitic violence has remained high.But the French government and civil society were slow to respond to the attacks, Jewish leaders felt. For many years, Mr. Arfi said, politicians were in denial about the attacks, preferring to see them as an \u201cimported conflict\u201d rather than as resurgent French anti-Semitism, although he was careful to note that the response had improved in recent years.\u201cIt was uncomfortable for them to see that in France, the country of human rights, you had anti-Semitism coming up again,\u201d said Simone Rodan-Benzaquen, the director of the American Jewish Committee\u2019s advocacy in Europe.That the attacks came from immigrant and Islamist communities, Ms. Rodan-Benzaquen said, deepened that discomfort: \u201cIt requires admitting that a population that suffers racism also harbors it.\u201dThe situation created an opportunity for the National Front. The anti-Semitic attacks tracked with its narrative about the dangers of Muslim immigration: Mainstream parties had allowed the Islamist threat to grow by refusing to admit it was happening, and only the National Front could undertake the harsh measures needed to solve the problem.It was also a way for the National Front to delegitimize charges of racism against Muslims, Mr. Arfi said. \u201cThey are trying to say \u2018these people are committing anti-Semitic attacks, so they cannot be victims of anything.\u2019 \u201dIn 2014, Ms. Le Pen summarized her message to France\u2019s Jews in an interview with the French magazine Valeurs Actuelles. Her party, she argued, \u201cis without a doubt the best shield to protect you against the one true enemy, Islamic fundamentalism.\u201dIn early 2016, the party began to publicize the support it had received from a new group, the Union of French Jewish Patriots. It is not legally affiliated with the National Front, but was founded by Michel Thooris, a National Front city councilor in Carros and a member of the party\u2019s central committee.Mr. Thooris said that he had made his peace with the National Front\u2019s legacy of anti-Semitism. \u201cThere are anti-Semitic personalities in the party,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it happens in every political party.\u201dHe had decided to support the party, Mr. Thooris said, because he believed it would offer protection from anti-Semitic violence. \u201cIt\u2019s the only political party that actually offers to fight against insecurity, the rise of radical Islamism,\u201d he said.Still, no mainstream Jewish organization in France has endorsed the National Front, whose support among Jewish voters remains relatively low. But the group\u2019s message may be about more than recruiting Jewish voters.\u201cBy saying they will protect the Jews against anti-Semitism, people understand that they mean they will be tough with the Muslims,\u201d Mr. Arfi said. \u201cEverything is between the lines.\u201dThis message enabled Ms. Le Pen to retain the loyalty of the party\u2019s base, which remains drawn to anti-Semitism, said C\u00e9cile Alduy, a Stanford University professor who studies the discourse of the French far right and has written a book about Ms. Le Pen\u2019s speeches and language.When Ms. Le Pen attacks \u201cinternational finance\u201d or \u201cglobalized money,\u201d she is referring to common tropes of anti-Semitism, Ms. Alduy said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to say anything against the Jewish community,\u201d she said. \u201cHer rhetoric still nourishes and revitalizes these stereotypes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the best of both worlds in a way for the National Front,\u201d Ms. Alduy said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to play dirty because their audience understands them between the lines.\u201dA more important reason for the National Front\u2019s new stance on Jews may be its desire to attract mainstream voters who would otherwise consider it taboo to support the party.To understand how this works, experts say, it helps to think about an unexpected analogue: the way people behave when they are trying to lose weight.People on diets will say things like \u201cWell, I was good yesterday, so I can cheat a little bit today,\u201d said Daniel A. Effron, a professor at London Business School who studies the psychology of moral behavior.Social psychologists call that a licensing strategy, meaning that once people convince themselves they are \u201cgood,\u201d they can bend the rules in the future without losing that virtuous status.It turns out that people employ the same kind of licensing strategy in political decisions.In 2008, Mr. Effron, with his colleagues Jessica S. Cameron and Benoit Monin, recruited subjects who had voted for Barack Obama and asked them to consider a hypothetical: Imagine, they said, that you are a small-town police chief who needs to hire a new officer for a department plagued by racial tensions. Should you hire the white candidate or the black one?There was a twist. Half of the participants were first asked whom they supported in the presidential election, effectively getting a reminder \u2014 and an opportunity to tell the research team \u2014 that they had voted for Mr. Obama over Senator John McCain.People in that group were more likely to say that the police chief should hire the white officer than people who hadn\u2019t been reminded of their electoral choice.Remembering a vote for a black presidential candidate was the racial equivalent of a dieter remembering a day of salads. It made people feel as if they had \u201cnonprejudiced credentials,\u201d Mr. Effron said, and could therefore indulge their unspoken desire to privilege the hypothetical white candidate.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s emphasis on defending Jews \u2014 while retaining the party\u2019s core message of fear and anger \u2014 may have given potential supporters the same kind of \u201cnonprejudiced credentials\u201d that voting for Mr. Obama gave Mr. Effron\u2019s study subjects.By recasting the National Front as a vote in defense of Jews rather than a vote to suppress Muslim immigrants, Ms. Le Pen is giving mainstream voters a way to embrace racial supremacist politics without feeling racist.In order to convince the general public that times have changed and that the National Front is no longer taboo, Ms. Rodan-Benzaquen joked that the party needs \u201cthe kosher stamp.\u201dIn the last few years, the party has won more support than nearly any other far-right movement in Western Europe. Ms. Le Pen is tied for first in the presidential election polls, though she is projected to lose in a second-round runoff. And she is coming off remarkable success in the 2015 regional elections, in which National Front candidates won nearly a third of the votes nationwide.Nicolas Bay, the party\u2019s general secretary, was up front about why he visited Israel last January. One goal of the trip, he said, was to \u201cerase every ambiguity about the accusations of anti-Semitism against our party\u201d by emphasizing its \u201cspecial attentions for Jewish people.\u201dI asked Mr. Thooris, the National Front central committee member who founded the Union of French Jewish Patriots, about the moral license theory.Did he think that the party\u2019s moral credentialing on Jewish matters \u2014 including the public support of groups like his \u2014 had helped dispel the broader public taboo against voting for the National Front?\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt is undeniable.\u201dPamela Rougerie contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Tumultuous \u201990s Paved the Way for Putin\u2019s Russia", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The hopes for a partnership between Russia and the West have been dashed, and in \u201cWho Lost Russia?\u201d Peter Conradi, the foreign editor of The Sunday Times of London, who spent seven years covering Russia for Reuters, seeks to explain what went wrong.Conradi wisely examines the forest\u2019s contours, avoiding the trees. He writes engagingly and enlivens his smart, balanced analysis with colorful anecdotes, though his book\u2019s title does him a disservice. \u201cWho Lost Russia?\u201d suggests that he, like many Westerners, will treat this gargantuan, complicated country as if it were a misplaced personal item, or solipsistically attribute its post-Soviet path to Western policy. Conradi does discuss the West\u2019s missteps, but he also focuses on the internal developments that shaped Russia\u2019s course. And he is attentive to Russians\u2019 views, even if his footnotes \u2014 which are sparse \u2014 contain only two Russian-language sources, one dating back to 1924.Conradi starts with Gorbachev\u2019s reforms, the fall of the Soviet-backed Communist states in Eastern Europe (in 1989), the Soviet Union\u2019s implosion (1991) and the Yeltsin years (the 1990s). He describes the Russian economy\u2019s crash and the penury millions of Russians endured. He recounts the privatization of state-owned industries and the accompanying corruption and Ponzi schemes of unscrupulous men who hijacked the process, enriched themselves and eventually became oligarchs. He tells of Russians\u2019 dejection as their country\u2019s power and prestige plummeted and of their sense of betrayal when NATO advanced eastward, even as Western leaders celebrated the Cold War\u2019s end and welcomed Russia as a partner. He highlights the gap between the West\u2019s verbal support for Russian reform and its paltry financial aid \u2014 $2.50 per Russian, by his reckoning.And he recalls the 1996 Russian election, which President Clinton praised as a victory for democracy, even though oligarchs bankrolled Boris Yeltsin\u2019s campaign in exchange for shares in state-owned industries at bargain-basement prices. He portrays the tumultuous presidency of the oft-inebriated Yeltsin, who, during a visit to the United States, was encountered by Secret Service agents in front of the White House, drunk and in his underwear, trying to get a cab to a pizza joint.Yet the Clinton administration praised Yeltsin for promoting democratic and market reforms. Clinton had a soft spot for \u201cOl\u2019 Boris,\u201d whom he considered a bulwark against Russia\u2019s Communist Party, which was growing in popularity as Russians\u2019 misery increased.Though Conradi\u2019s coverage of the 1990s doesn\u2019t turn up anything new, it does something valuable. It shows that the authoritarianism, corruption and crony capitalism of Putin\u2019s Russia took root during that decade. More important, given Conradi\u2019s objective, it demonstrates that the disputes currently dividing Russia and the West preceded Vladimir Putin\u2019s presidency.Consider Putin\u2019s broadsides against NATO\u2019s eastward expansion. Conradi reminds us that Yeltsin, not to mention Russia\u2019s military brass, also vociferously opposed NATO\u2019s enlargement. Even Russian liberals, like Boris Nemtsov (later a fierce opponent of Putin who was shot dead on a Moscow bridge in February 2015), predicted a backlash. Clinton airily dismissed such prognoses as \u201csilly.\u201dIn the 1990s, Russia, weak and reliant on Western aid, acquiesced unhappily to NATO\u2019s advance toward its borders. As Yeltsin once said wearily, having again failed to change Clinton\u2019s mind on that policy, \u201cWell, I tried.\u201dLikewise, while Western leaders have condemned Putin\u2019s quest for spheres of influence, Conradi shows that in Yeltsin\u2019s time too Russians believed that they were entitled to preponderance in the countries of the former Soviet Union, particularly Ukraine. For Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Ukraine and Russia were organically connected. Vladimir Lukin, Yeltsin\u2019s ambassador to Washington, advised Strobe Talbott \u2014 Clinton\u2019s top Russia expert and later deputy secretary of state \u2014 to consider Russia and Ukraine as akin to New York and New Jersey. Yeltsin\u2019s first foreign minister, the liberal reformer Andrei Kozyrev, asked why Russia should retreat from territories that took centuries to conquer.Putin\u2019s Russia and the West are now at loggerheads \u2014 even, according to a popular but misguided analogy Conradi uses, enmeshed in a new Cold War. But things didn\u2019t start out that way. Putin\u2019s early meetings with President George W. Bush, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and NATO Secretary General George Robertson were convivial. He presented Russia as part of the West and even startled his interlocutors by proposing that Russia join NATO. He called the White House immediately after the 9/11 attacks, offering assistance, and actually provided it during Washington\u2019s war against Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Though he didn\u2019t like George W. Bush\u2019s renunciation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, his invasion of Iraq and NATO\u2019s incorporation of the three Baltic States \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 he took these matters in stride.When did things go awry and why? Conradi suggests that the democratic revolutions in Georgia in 2003-4 and Ukraine in 2004-5 may have been a turning point. Western governments applauded the protesters, and American and European NGOs had long financed and trained Georgian and Ukrainian pro-democracy groups. For Putin, the democratic movements represented a Western effort to undercut Russia in its own neighborhood; democracy and human rights were ruses, demanded of some countries but not others.In 2007, at the annual Munich Security Conference, Putin lambasted the United States for foisting its values on others, sowing instability and behaving arrogantly. He has stuck to this script. And it has had enormous appeal within Russia. For lots of Russians, Putin personifies a break with the 1990s, when their country, led by a boozy, erratic president, was politically chaotic, economically near collapse and dissed by the West.Only 47 when he was elected president in 2000, Putin exuded vitality \u2014 a stark contrast, as Conradi shows, to Yeltsin\u2019s decrepitude. Taking advantage of soaring oil prices, which quintupled between 2000 and 2008, Putin bulked up Russia\u2019s army, acquiring the muscle to push back: in Georgia in 2008 (Conradi provides an illuminating account of the events that culminated in the Georgian army\u2019s humiliating defeat) and in Ukraine in 2014 (here Conradi doesn\u2019t add anything original).If any one event explains the rupture between Russia and the West, it was, as Conradi vividly shows, the mass rebellion that erupted in Ukraine in late 2013 when President Viktor Yanukovych, popularly elected albeit venal, cut off negotiations with the European Union on an association agreement and tacked instead toward Russia. Western governments immediately embraced the uprising against him. Senator John McCain and Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland visited Kiev and communed with the protesters.On Feb. 21, the E.U. brokered a deal between Yanukovych and opposition leaders that included an early presidential election. But when the protesting masses cried betrayal, Yanukovych was finished. He fled the next day. To Putin, his ouster was another Western conspiracy. Russian officials seized on a telephone conversation in Kiev between Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt, the American ambassador, about the post-Yanukovych government\u2019s composition, an amateurish exchange that was intercepted by Russian intelligence and inevitably reached YouTube. Putin upped the ante in March, annexing Crimea, with its Russian majority, and backing separatists in eastern Ukraine with weapons and troops. The West slapped Russia with economic sanctions and banished it from the G-8. President Obama\u2019s ailing \u201creset\u201d policy lay dead.So who lost Russia? Russia\u2019s leaders, primarily Putin, who neither built democracy nor made Russia a partner of the West? Or the West, which was never serious about respecting Russia\u2019s interests, let alone a partnership? Conradi doesn\u2019t provide a clear-cut answer to his question. Given the complexities he grapples with, who can blame him?Rajan Menon, a City College political science professor, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Conceit of Humanitarian Intervention.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Cuomo\u2019s Free* College Plan", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byEditorialIt\u2019s amazing what Gov. Andrew Cuomo can do when he puts his mind to it. Only last fall he seized on the idea that New York should be the first state in the nation to make tuition at its public universities and colleges free for all residents.\u201cFIRST-IN-NATION TUITION-FREE COLLEGE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS\u201d said a placard placed front and center on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s lectern.Yes, the lectern was driving home Mr. Cuomo\u2019s talking point.Mrs. Clinton was there because she had pushed the idea after borrowing much of it from Bernie Sanders. Mr. Cuomo got the idea from both of them. It\u2019s not as if free tuition for the middle class was a dream that has been burning in the governor\u2019s heart since he was growing up in middle-class Queens. It was, as he said on Wednesday, a bolt of insight from watching the presidential race.And so, a few months later, it came to pass: the Excelsior Scholarship, for students from families making up to $125,000 a year (by 2019) who attend the State University of New York or the City University of New York. This is how things can work in Albany, when a single-minded executive controls an opaque budget process, when wheeling and dealing occur behind closed doors. A big, ugly package of legislation emerges in the spring, with policies and surprises aplenty, and lawmakers approve it, lining up first and asking questions later.So it\u2019s not clear whether this would needlessly harm private colleges and universities by stealing students, as some officials have complained, or place damaging financial strains on the SUNY and CUNY systems, which have been starved of funds for years.No, this is one program for one slice of the middle class.The governor\u2019s aides say this is an experiment that will be tested and may be adjusted. They say it should be applauded for its ambition, not faulted for its shortcomings. And that, New Yorkers, is how Mr. Cuomo has it all ways. Sometimes he has real achievements, like this year\u2019s deal raising the age of criminal responsibility for juvenile defendants. Other times he can take credit for the half-full glasses, and blame Republicans and breakaway Democrats in the State Senate for the perennial failure of other goals, the ones he seems less interested in achieving, like Albany\u2019s Holy Grail: meaningful ethics reform and public campaign-financing.Having established his first-in-the-nation, champion-of-the-middle-class cred, Mr. Cuomo is now free to let others sort out the perplexing details while he moves on. It\u2019s too bad many important priorities aren\u2019t as politically tantalizing to him as \u201cfree\u201d college. E. J. McMahon of the Empire Center for Public Policy told The Times it seemed to him that Mr. Cuomo had \u201chastily reverse-engineered\u201d the process to get the headline he wanted, which sounds about right.Advertisement"}

Work had dried up, and Hollywood had stopped getting in touch many years ago.Whenever the phone rang, they assumed that people were \u201ctrying to find out if we were, in fact, still alive,\u201d Ms. Sears said in a recent interview, laughing.But Mr. Wilson had something special stowed away: He controlled a big chunk of the TV and movie rights to the 1985 Margaret Atwood novel, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which he had made into an otherwise forgettable 1990 feature. If Hulu wanted to bring the story to television, it would have to deal with Daniel Wilson Productions.So through a twist of fate, prescient deal-making and an intensely competitive television landscape \u2014 where studios seem to be willing to turn over any stone to find a hit \u2014 Danny and Fran are back in business.In short order, they had to, among other things, revive a production company that had gone dark and study up on a vastly changed television landscape, in which streaming services were becoming increasingly important. They also had to acquaint themselves with tasks foreign to them \u2014 like creating an online imprint.\u201cWe just looked at each other and said, \u2018Oh, God, we better do this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sears said, about creating a website. \u201cWe\u2019ve been terrible about a Wikipedia page or IMDB. It\u2019s not part of our sensibility.\u201dOn a recent Tuesday in Manhattan, the duo (they are, alas, not a couple) were discussing their unlikely comeback at Mr. Wilson\u2019s Upper East Side apartment. Over the course of an afternoon, Ms. Sears excused herself each time the phone rang. \u201cDaniel Wilson Productions,\u201d she cooed as she answered.A bookshelf in the living room was filled with awards Mr. Wilson had won in the 1970s and \u201980s, including several Emmys. It was difficult to identify what some of the Emmys were for; the plaques were too faded.Though Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears were not in charge of making \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d they found themselves, somewhat surprisingly, in the role of executive producers. They were given a front-row seat to script development, casting and the production process, and offered notes to the writers and executives overseeing the show.They marveled at just how much the business had changed. Television executives nowadays? \u201cMuch less combative,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. And they have been transformed from cigar-chomping titans to, as Ms. Sears put it, \u201cyoung hipster types.\u201dThen there were the dailies, rough cuts from each day of filming. They used to be an exhaustive process that took hours to produce, with filmmakers packing a room to watch poor-quality film reels of scenes shot the day before. Now, Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears could watch high-quality footage from \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d from the comforts of their own homes, at 8 a.m. each day.\u201cI\u2019d get up in the morning, I\u2019d be wandering around, crashing into the wall in my jimjams with a cup of coffee, and I\u2019d watch the dailies and call up Danny and say, \u2018Did you watch that?\u2019\u201d Ms. Sears recalled.Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears met in the 1960s when they were working on a children\u2019s show for ABC. Soon, Daniel Wilson Productions was up and running, and they were making after-school specials with titles like \u201cThe Terrible Secret\u201d and \u201cMe and Dad\u2019s New Wife.\u201dIt was in the late 1980s when, at the suggestion of his wife, Mr. Wilson read \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d the dystopian novel that presents a grim future for women in the United States. Impressed, Mr. Wilson met with Ms. Atwood, secured the film rights to the book and shared them with the independent movie company Cinecom, which helped finance the film.The movie, which starred Robert Duvall and Natasha Richardson and was written by Harold Pinter (Ms. Atwood was not interested in screenwriting), was released in 1990 and was a dud at the box office. (\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as good as perhaps it should have been,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.)Soon, their careers began to wind down. Mr. Wilson learned that his wife had Alzheimer\u2019s, and he put aside work to tend to her. Ms. Sears said she would return to the business only if she actually had passion for a project.\u201cI guess I just didn\u2019t really think that was going to happen,\u201d she said.Then everything changed.\u201cWe realized, \u2018Wait a minute, no, no, no, it\u2019s not all ours,\u201d said Steve Stark, the studio\u2019s president for television development and production. \u201c\u2018We have to call a Danny Wilson. Where\u2019s he at?\u2019 We didn\u2019t know. We couldn\u2019t find him.\u201dIt took some time to track him down, and, initially, Mr. Wilson was unmoved. Cinecom had gone bankrupt, and Mr. Wilson was convinced he owned all the rights to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d In fact, MGM had secured what was once Cinecom\u2019s 50 percent.Even in the sometimes confounding world of Hollywood copyrights, this odyssey was \u201cexceptional,\u201d Mr. Stark said. It took a lengthy negotiation to get Mr. Wilson on board.\u201cWe decided to make him an executive producer, we gave him a nice fee, and we figured it all out,\u201d Mr. Stark said. Mr. Wilson did not disclose financial details, but the deal, if the show reaches a third season (which appears possible, considering the reviews), is expected to be worth $1 million.The show was originally written for Showtime by Ilene Chaiken, a veteran of \u201cThe L Word.\u201d Mr. Wilson did not like her script, which he said was far too \u201cgraphic sexually.\u201d\u201cThey wanted bare-breasted women running around,\u201d he said, sounding exasperated.But Ms. Chaiken was soon tied up with obligations to the new Fox hit \u201cEmpire,\u201d and the story was back on the market. Suddenly, FX and Hulu were neck and neck in pursuit of the series.But Hulu?\u201cFor me, Hulu is where you can watch old episodes of \u2018The Andy Griffith Show,\u2019 if you\u2019re so inclined,\u201d Ms. Sears said.Mr. Wilson was not entirely sure to trust the streaming service until Mr. Stark convinced him it was just fine.\u201cI heard about it from Steve, and I said, \u2018Really?\u2019\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Danny, they\u2019re the new kid on the block; they\u2019re going to back this series to the hilt.\u2019\u201cI said, \u2018Terrific!\u2019\u201dBruce Miller, the new showrunner for \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d wrote scripts that they adored. Elisabeth Moss, a veteran of \u201cMad Men,\u201d seemed ideal to play the main character, Offred. For Hulu, which has failed to match the buzzy original series of rivals like Amazon and Netflix, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d may have finally delivered a drama that can drive up subscriptions.It also didn\u2019t hurt that the Trump administration has made the show\u2019s bleak themes feel more relevant to certain viewers.\u201cIts timing is a hell of a lot better than when the feature was released,\u201d Ms. Sears said. \u201cMargaret\u2019s book was extraordinary, but it was about another time. We didn\u2019t see it coming fast and furious at us the way it is now.\u201dMr. Wilson and Ms. Sears are hopeful that \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is just the beginning of their comeback.And last Friday night, they were able to take their victory lap in earnest.As Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sears circled a room in the Beekman Hotel for the show\u2019s premiere party, a remix of Prince\u2019s \u201cRaspberry Beret\u201d blasted at full volume.

{"Headline": "Ontario Hopes Tax on Non-Canadians Buying Toronto Homes Will Temper Prices", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 In a bid to slow the soaring growth of housing prices in the Toronto area, Ontario officials announced several measures on Thursday, including a 15 percent tax on residential buyers who are not residents or citizens of Canada.While Ontario\u2019s premier, Kathleen Wynne, emphasized the need for the 15 percent tax on outside purchasers, similar to one enacted recently in Vancouver, British Columbia, there are no statistics on the number of Toronto houses that have gone to such buyers. Ontario\u2019s finance minister estimated that they make up 8 percent of the market, but other estimates are well above or well below that figure. Neither Ms. Wynne nor members of her cabinet were able to quantify the effect of what they called \u201cphantom\u201d purchasing.\u201cThis is a complex issue,\u201d Ms. Wynne said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t one single thing we could do that would deal with the issues we\u2019re confronting.\u201dPolitical pressure is escalating on Ms. Wynne and the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to cool off the Toronto market.At the same time, both levels of government have been loath to take steps that effectively punish current homeowners by forcing down the value of their property.On Thursday, the premier said that the high prices were not entirely a bad thing, calling the market boom \u201cthe unwanted consequence of a strong economy.\u201dSome economists have encouraged Ontario to impose a nonresident tax in what is generally known as the Greater Toronto Area.\u201cThe province is aiming at those effectively parking wealth in the G.T.A. real estate market, and we have been fully in favor of such a move for some time,\u201d Robert Kavcic, senior economist with BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, wrote in an analysis.But Mr. Kavcic was also skeptical that the tax and other measures announced by Ms. Wynne would have a substantial effect.He said the tax would mostly prevent a rise in the prices of the most expensive houses on the market.Because not all of Ontario has experienced a major escalation in house prices, the new tax and some other measures announced on Thursday will apply only to a portion of the province within commuting distance of Toronto. The tax also includes several exemptions and will be rebated to people who later can prove that they have stayed in Canada to work or study.Ms. Wynne outlined some modest changes intended to remedy that. Cities and towns in Ontario can now impose extra taxes on houses left empty by investor-owners, and undeveloped land that has water and sewer service and that is approved for housing will face increased property taxes. The province will also allow housing to be built on some of its vacant land in the Toronto area.The province also expanded provincial rent controls to include apartments built after 1991.

The groundbreaking shifts envisioned by the provision would influence the way corporations in the United States raise money and invest.The House measure would cause a sea change in how companies account for debt, perhaps their most important source of financing. It would stop companies from treating the interest they pay on their borrowings as an expense for tax purposes, something they have done for many decades. Right now, the interest paid on debt reduces a firm\u2019s taxable profits, effectively allowing it to pay less in tax.Its supporters say the measure would remove skewed incentives, stoke entrepreneurship and even make the economy less prone to recessions over the long run. To some, like Jason Furman, a senior economic adviser in the second Obama administration, the provision could form a major part of a tax bill that could win over Democrats in Congress. But opponents warn of an overall drop in investment and it becoming harder for businesses, especially small ones, to raise the money they need to expand.When a company or person can use an expense to reduce taxes, it is called a deduction. And allowing corporations to deduct interest may appear to make sense, since interest is a cost of doing business, like paying wages or spending on marketing.But the tax treatment of debt is very different from the treatment of equity, the other main source of financing for companies. For instance, firms typically cannot deduct the dividends they pay out on their stock.Tax experts and economists have long argued that as a result, borrowing gets an unfair advantage. This, they assert, has at times created incentives for companies to take on too much debt, which might be invested poorly and leave them vulnerable when interest rates go up or business hits a rough patch.Some high-profile examples of this happening are the debt-burdened commercial real estate projects that got Mr. Trump into financial trouble during his career as a developer. And on a broad scale, too much debt can make the wider economy more vulnerable to recession.Importantly, though, the House plan does not just yank away the deductibility of interest without giving back something big in return.It also proposes that companies would be able to immediately treat as an expense all of the money they spend on items like plant and equipment. Under current tax rules, such capital expenditures are accounted for bit by bit over time, a practice known as depreciation. But under the House proposal, a company spending $1 million on a new machinery would be able to subtract that cost from revenue immediately rather than spaced over a number of years. And if the company borrowed $1 million to buy the machinery, the interest on that debt would no longer be deductible.To some tax specialists and economists, these changes would create a more neutral operating environment for companies, because the tax advantage would be directly tied to their investment spending, not the debt they might have used to finance the spending.And that is why those experts believe eliminating the interest deduction is one of the least-bad ways to raise the hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes needed to make up some of the shortfall caused by the big tax cuts envisioned elsewhere in the House plan.\u201cThis is a tax increase on debt finance \u2014 there is no question about that,\u201d said Alan Cole, an economist at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, a research organization. \u201cBut there are some grounds to think this is reasonably justified.\u201dEstimating how much the two changes will affect tax revenues is tough, but experts calculate that in the first decade, the tax revenue loss on the capital expenditures would far outweigh the gain from ending the interest deduction. \u201cIf you go to immediate expensing, you have this big upfront cost,\u201d said James R. Nunns, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the center-left Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.Industries that take a relatively long time to write down their assets would get the biggest one-time boost from the immediate expensing of capital expenditures. The beneficiaries would include commercial real estate developers. And that fillip could offset any concerns, perhaps in the White House, about the negative effect on real estate firms of removing the interest deduction.After 10 years, though, the revenue raised from eliminating the interest deduction could outweigh that lost to expensing capital expenditures. That is in part because the House plan would eliminate only the deductibility of interest on new debt. As old debt is replaced, the amount of revenue from the elimination would increase. In the first 10 years, the two changes could drain $1 trillion out of tax revenue but raise another $1.1 trillion in the second 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center.One reason this decline might not occur is if the tax overhaul slashes corporate taxes to a level that prompts companies to invest considerably more than they did before, thus offsetting any negative effects of ending the interest deduction. But the Goldman economists are skeptical that the final overhaul will push the corporate tax rate down to the 20 percent level envisioned in the House plan.And a higher effective cost of borrowing could be worse for some companies than for others. Firms with high borrowings would feel the effects as they came to issue new debt. Large public companies could offset costlier debt financing by raising money in the equity markets, which would become more attractive economically than the debt market. But small businesses that generally do not tap stock markets could get squeezed.Some economists are also skeptical more generally about ending interest deductibility. They say that it is not definitive whether tax policies have had a large role in driving up debt levels at corporations. Company owners may prefer using debt because selling stock reduces their ownership control over the firm. And big debt binges, including the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, may have been caused far more by weak banking regulations and excessively cheap loans than by tax incentives.Conversely, of course, that means that removing the deductibility of interest may have less of an impact on how companies finance themselves than many people expect. \u201cIt could be muted in the other direction,\u201d Mr. Leary added.Minimal disruption would most likely be a welcome bonus for Republicans whose main priority is to find ways of paying for their corporate tax cut. Eliminating the interest deduction could raise a ton of money. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a big deal,\u201d said Mr. Cole of the Tax Foundation, \u201cand it definitely helps lower the corporate rate, and that\u2019s definitely a policy goal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christie Lies Low, but Can\u2019t Avoid Wrath of Commuters", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byAs train delays, cancellations and gridlock set off by a small derailment at Pennsylvania Station stretched into a third day on Wednesday, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey remained largely silent while his constituents screamed. In fact, the governor was far from where the chaos was unfolding, choosing to go to Atlantic City to celebrate the opening of a casino while travelers vented their frustration on social media, on radio call-in shows and on packed platforms.The derailment on Monday of a New Jersey Transit train did not just cripple New Jersey Transit; it also disrupted service on Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road, the two other rail systems that share Penn Station. But it has been riders of New Jersey Transit, the nation\u2019s third-busiest railroad, who have endured the worst travel experiences.Along with anger, many riders said someone had to be responsible for the missed hours of work, the lost wages, the extra costs from extended day care, the wasted \u2014 and increasingly expensive \u2014 gas. And many of them set their sights on Mr. Christie.\u201cHe\u2019s nowhere to be found, while literally hundreds of thousands of his constituents are struggling and businesses are losing money,\u201d said Dave Geller, 44, who had to work from his home in Maplewood on Wednesday. \u201cAt some point the buck has to stop where? You\u2019re the man in charge.\u201dOne possible reason: Mr. Christie is seen as a main villain in New Jersey\u2019s transit woes. Many of those enduring the upheavals on the rails and on the highways this week know that without a new tunnel under the Hudson River, days like Wednesday or Tuesday or Monday will become more frequent. They also know that in 2010, Mr. Christie scuttled plans for a new tunnel that had been scheduled to open next year.On Wednesday, Mr. Christie\u2019s only public appearance was the one in Atlantic City, in the southern part of the state, where he celebrated the opening of the Hard Rock Casino in Atlantic City.\u201cWe have shown that we\u2019re committed to doing the hard things in Atlantic City,\u201d he said. He refused to answer questions from reporters and said nothing about the commuting woes.Privately, however, Mr. Christie, a Republican, was apparently fuming about the continuing disruptions, directing New Jersey Transit officials to hold a news conference to offer explanations. His office issued a news release later on Wednesday afternoon, the governor\u2019s first public comments about the derailment, ordering New Jersey Transit executives \u201cto personally appear at stations,\u201d calling the situation \u201cunacceptable\u201d and adding that \u201cthe governor remains fully aware of commuter frustrations.\u201dSteven H. Santoro, the executive director of New Jersey Transit, told reporters that his office was in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with the governor.\u201cA nightmare is not even the word for what\u2019s going on in the tristate region right now,\u201d said Mr. Booker, a Democrat. He added: \u201cMy office phone is blowing up. There is anger. There is frustration as people have their lives undermined.\u201dThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the Long Island Rail Road, pointed a finger of blame at Amtrak, and not New Jersey Transit, for the \u201cunacceptable infrastructure failures\u201d and for \u201cnot aggressively maintaining its tracks, switches and related equipment at Penn Station.\u201dThe M.T.A. is overseen by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who also has seemingly not focused on the commuting snarls. On Tuesday, he issued a news release about a barge running aground on the Hudson River north of New York City.In New Jersey, many commuters seem to have reached a breaking point both with New Jersey Transit and their governor, who oversees the agency.Michael O\u2019Keefe, 24, a carpenter from Harriman, N.Y., who was among the masses idling at Hoboken Station, said responsibility for the problems plaguing New Jersey Transit, from its unreliability to its antiquated equipment, stops at the governor\u2019s office in Trenton. \u201cIt\u2019s Christie, it all goes down to him, right?\u201d he said.David Sandt, 80, a stockbroker who lives in Hoboken and commutes to Hackensack in northern New Jersey, specifically faulted Mr. Christie for stopping the Hudson River tunnel project seven years ago. \u201cStupidity \u2014 somebody should have lost their job,\u201d Mr. Sandt said. \u201cThe governor vetoed that and put us years behind.\u201dWhat began as a minor train malfunction has stymied hundreds of thousands of commuters on four major transit systems in the Northeast.Mr. Christie\u2019s checkered record on transportation in his home state may be indeed be influencing the opinions of many commuters. Two former associates of Mr. Christie\u2019s face prison sentences for orchestrating traffic jams near the George Washington Bridge as political payback against a Democratic mayor who declined to endorse the governor\u2019s re-election.But the current plan for a new tunnel, known as the Gateway Project, is a long way from completion, and its future is unclear after President Trump reduced funding for it in his initial budget.\u201cEven though the ARC tunnel project wouldn\u2019t be done now, we\u2019d be able to say, \u2018When this project finishes, this is going to get better,\u2019\u201d said Daniel De Simone, 37, whose commute to Midtown Manhattan from South Orange took about an hour longer than usual on Wednesday.Political opponents of Mr. Christie, who is prevented by term limits from running again, also trained their sights on him, including Democrats lining up to run in November\u2019s election.Phil Murphy, who has emerged as the party favorite, released a statement saying, \u201cFor seven years, commuters have seen fares skyrocket and customer service diminish, all while Governor Christie pulled funds from NJ Transit to fill his budget holes and canceled the ARC tunnel to set up his run for president.\u201dJim Johnson, another Democratic candidate for governor, announced that he would visit the Broad Street train station in Newark on Thursday to talk to commuters.But for Rowland Dickens, 50, who works in production oversight, train delays have caused so many problems in his 12 years of commuting that constantly readjusting his schedule has simply become a way of life.\u201cEvery day I get on a train unsure if I\u2019m getting home,\u201d he said.Nate Schweber contributed reporting from Hoboken and Newark, and Jon Hurdle from Atlantic City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Witches, Beasts, Sorcerers: The Gothic Horror of Michael Reeves", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byOn DVDCredited with directing three d\u00e9class\u00e9 horror movies, dead from an overdose of barbiturates at 25, the British filmmaker Michael Reeves (1943-1969) is a quintessential cult figure.Reeves, like Steven Spielberg and the avant-gardist brothers George and Mike Kuchar, made eight-millimeter films in his movie-obsessed youth and, on a trip to America, paid an unannounced visit to his Hollywood idol, the genre director Don Siegel \u2014 an act of chutzpah that actually resulted in a job. After working in commercials and as an assistant director, Reeves made and even partly financed his first feature, \u201cRevenge of the Blood Beast\u201d (1966), newly out on Blu-ray from Raro Video.This amalgam of the awful and the audacious is a demented gross-out comedy that often evokes the early work of John Waters. It clearly amused Reeves to depict modern Transylvania as a shabby police state ruled by inept policemen. Much of the action takes place in the run-down Hotel Moskva; one gruesome attack winks at Communist iconography when the weapon \u2014 a sickle \u2014 is tossed away to land neatly on a hammer. There is also some effective filmmaking. A flashback in which an accused witch is put to death by hysterical townspeople previews similar lynch-mob sequences in Reeves\u2019s last and strongest film, \u201cWitchfinder General\u201d (1968).As self-reflexive as it is, \u201cThe Sorcerers\u201d (available on DVD from Warner Archive) has been compared to Michael Powell\u2019s \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d (1960). Better written than directed, \u201cThe Sorcerers\u201d is at once an evocation of psychedelic fascism and a Freudian comedy with a hapless protagonist subject to subliminal prompts from two parental figures.\u201cWitchfinder General\u201d has been released on disc several times, most recently on Blu-ray as one of six films included in Scream\u2019s \u201cVincent Price Collection.\u201d Perhaps some altruistic distributor will thrill cultists with a Reeves collection, even including \u201cCastle of the Living Dead,\u201d a 1964 French-Italian vehicle for Christopher Lee that some fans believe was mainly shot, uncredited, by Reeves, the second-unit director.The suitably outlandish plot, loosely adapted from a novel by Bram Stoker, concerns an outbreak of pagan snake-worship in present-day Derbyshire. The young Hugh Grant is surprisingly intense as a drawling young lord, but the movie is stolen by a neighboring aristocrat, played by Amanda Donohoe (known then mainly as an associate of the New Wave singer Adam Ant). Fabulously chic and seductively sinister, Ms. Donohoe is actually a vampire priestess, prone to coldblooded hissy fits, sprouting fangs at will and spraying a venom that transports victims into a mad delirium of screaming nuns, rampaging serpents and bloody crucifixions.One of Mr. Russell\u2019s most enjoyable films, \u201cWhite Worm\u201d seems a uniquely British amalgam of high camp, lurid psychedelia and rowdy Celtic folk-punk. As regional as \u201cWitchfinder General,\u201d it feasts on the Midlands countryside. Setting the movie in England rather than Transylvania, Mr. Russell told Film Comment magazine, \u201cmade it potentially more alarming \u2014 and, of course, absurdly comical.\u201dNEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Learning to Love the Nuclear Option", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThis article has been updated to reflect news developments.The word \u201cfilibuster\u201d sounds silly, like the name of a pompous but ultimately well-meaning character in a Dickens novel. The phrase \u201cnuclear option,\u201d on the other hand, sounds terrifying.So now that the Republicans have used the nuclear option to kill the poor filibuster to clear the way for the elevation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, we can lose perspective. In truth, eliminating the filibuster is a minor change compared with the problem that such a move takes a step toward solving: the recent rise of a system based on supermajority rule rather than majority rule.Of course, the modern filibuster, which remains in effect for legislation, doesn\u2019t require senators to give speeches through the night. It\u2019s all very abstract; in the case of nonspending bills, the minority party simply let it be known that it has enough votes to block the legislation.In effect, the minority party now gets to decide when a bill should require 60 votes instead of 51.It\u2019s also confusing that the Republicans are saying: Don\u2019t worry. Although we\u2019re ending the filibuster against Supreme Court nominees, we\u2019ll still allow the procedure to block legislation. If anything, there\u2019s more of a case for eliminating the filibuster for congressional bills than for the court. If a horrible justice gets on the court, he or she is there for life; if a destructive piece of legislation gets through, it can be repealed.In the middle of the process, the White House was notified that they would need 60 votes, not 51. No Republicans staged a sit-in. No one wheeled in cots so that elderly lawmakers could nap during long hours of speechifying. The minority leader, Bob Dole, just informed the majority leader that 40 Republicans opposed the bill, so they were going to switch to the supermajority system, thank you very much.And if the Senate had been operating under majority rule during the Obama and Bush administrations, the following bills would have gained Senate approval: the Toomey-Manchin background check bill for guns; the provision allowing people to have a \u201cpublic option\u201d for health care on the Obamacare exchanges; comprehensive immigration reform; an increase in the minimum wage; and the bipartisan campaign finance bill, called the Disclose Act.If the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, next eliminates the filibuster on legislation, the Democrats\u2019 reaction may end up being less anger than regret (as in, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we think to do that?\u201d). President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy would have been different had majority rule been in effect.This may be an area in which President Trump\u2019s disregard of tradition can work to his advantage, at least in the short run. Democrats are justified in worrying that Mr. Trump could get through more of his agenda in a majority-rules environment.But in the long run, if Republicans remove the filibuster for legislation, they may regret it. They have been the bigger beneficiary of the practice. From 1999 to 2006, when the Republicans controlled the Senate, the Democratic minority used the filibuster 272 times. By contrast, from 2007 to 2014, when the Republicans were in the minority, they used it 644 times, more than twice as often. The average filibuster per congressional session under President Obama was 158; under President George W. Bush it was 85.Much has been written about why use of the filibuster grew rapidly in recent decades. From World War I until 1970, Congress averaged less than 10 filibusters each congressional term. In 1975, the Senate eliminated the requirement that to maintain a filibuster, senators had to literally stay on the floor talking. It went from being arduous to easy. Some argue that the situation worsened as voters elected fewer conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans, who had made bipartisanship more common and filibusters less necessary.Perhaps more modest reforms \u2014 like restoring the \u201ctalking filibuster\u201d \u2014 should be tried first. That would reduce the abuse and instill more accountability. Elected officials could better fulfill their campaign promises, and voters could better judge whether they like the result.But if the Republican leaders decide to go all the way and drop the filibuster on legislation too, let\u2019s at least remember that the bigger threat to democracy is not the scary-sounding nuclear option but the thing it blows up.Advertisement"}

Before the emissions scandal, diesels once accounted for about a quarter of the sales of some Volkswagen models in Canada, particularly the Golf.In September 2015, in what it said was a voluntary move, Volkswagen Canada halted sales of new and used vehicles that used the emissions-cheating software and said the matter was being investigated by Environment Canada, the federal regulator. That investigation is continuing.The combination of the scandal surrounding the carmaker\u2019s diesel vehicles and the subsequent improvements to some models, particularly the Golf, means that the cars that had been kept off dealership floors are being heavily discounted. The dealer in Vancouver was offering discounts of 9,500 Canadian dollars (about $7,000) for cash sales and 7,500 Canadian dollars, plus zero percent interest rates, for customers seeking financing.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely taking a risk, no question,\u201d said Jake Fisher, the director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, about buying a Volkswagen diesel today. \u201cThe question is: How are these cars performing after the fix?\u201dHowever, it added that it did \u201cnot expect any significant changes in fuel consumption or driving characteristics.\u201dMr. Fisher said that cars with the emissions-control fix would need to be tested to determine whether Volkswagen\u2019s assessment was correct. But he said he was sure there would be differences after the repairs, and perhaps not for the better. The new equipment and software could also reduce the longevity of engines, he said.\u201cIf they had the ability through software to make these engines comply with emissions rules, they would have done that in the first place, so obviously there will be differences,\u201d Mr. Fisher said.Volkswagen settled class-action lawsuits in Ontario and Quebec on Friday, involving owners nationwide, affecting about 105,000 Volkswagens and Audis with the 2.0-liter diesel engine made from 2009 to 2015; the company also said it would offer owners cash payments and other remedies, including repair or repurchase.

One year ago, 1MDB defaulted on the bonds, setting off a dispute between the two countries over who would pick up the tab. Last year, the Abu Dhabi fund and its subsidiary, Aabar Investments PJS, said they were taking both 1MDB and Malaysia\u2019s finance ministry to arbitration in London, seeking $6.5 billion.But 1MDB isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The fund remains the subject of investigations in Singapore, Switzerland, the United States and other jurisdictions. American officials are still seeking to recoup $1 billion they say was ultimately spent in the United States on purchases like luxury homes in Manhattan and Los Angeles and expensive paintings by Picasso and Monet, and on financing for the Hollywood movie \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201dIn Singapore, officials have closed branches of two Swiss banks and jailed a number of private bankers in relation to the case.Mr. Low and Mr. Najib have previously denied wrongdoing.\u201cThe government is pleased that IPIC and 1MDB have resolved their differences in an amicable manner,\u201d Tengku Sariffuddin, the press secretary to Mr. Najib, said in a written statement on Monday.\u201cThese significant events represent the continued positive progress made by 1MDB,\u201d he added.Goldman Sachs \u2014 which, according to American officials, received fees as high as 11 percent of the proceeds from the two 1MDB bond sales, which were code-named Magnolia and Maximus \u2014 put its main banker on the 1MDB account, Tim Leissner, on leave last year. Mr. Leissner has since left the bank, and in March, Singapore regulators banned him from dealing in securities in the city for 10 years. Goldman has said it is cooperating with the investigations.Abu Dhabi dismissed the head of IPIC, Khadem al-Qubaisi, in 2015. That year, it also dismissed Mohamed Ahmed Badawy Al-Husseiny as the chief executive of one of IPIC\u2019s subsidiaries, Aabar Investments PJS, which was tied to the 1MDB deals. Both men were identified by American officials in their civil lawsuit in July.IPIC did not return phone calls and a fax to its headquarters in Abu Dhabi on Monday, and attempts to reach Mr. Qubaisi through his former employer were unsuccessful.Advertisement"}

You can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Lang said. \u201cThe chances are the child will be derailed, and you have to be there and be sensitive and reach out and try to bring the child back on track.\u201d\u201cI know I\u2019m going to make it,\u201d Aristides Alvarado, then a 20-year-old junior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, told an interviewer in 1989. \u201cAnd someday I\u2019ll be big \u2014 real big \u2014 and pay the tuition for my own class of Dreamers.\u201dMr. Lang persuaded a roster of high-profile New Yorkers \u2014 among them the financier Felix G. Rohatyn; James Bush, a nephew of President George Bush; and Reuben Mark, the president of the Colgate-Palmolive Company \u2014 to sponsor public-school classes by depositing $300,000 into foundation-operated annuities and personally shepherding the students, just as vigilant parents might do.Wealthy patrons found themselves trooping through seedy housing projects, and impoverished children found themselves sailing on boats in the Hamptons.Some years into the program, Mr. Lang said that he, too, had realized that by the sixth grade it was \u201ctoo late\u201d to begin trying to interest poor children in college, so he shifted its emphasis to third and fourth graders. Roughly 200 I Have a Dream programs have operated around the country and in New Zealand, serving more than 16,000 students.Eugene Michael Lang was born on March 16, 1919, and grew up in a $12-a-month railroad apartment on East 83rd Street in Manhattan. His father, Daniel Lang, having been found guilty of distributing subversive literature as a socialist in Hungary, escaped in 1911 to the United States and took a job at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.After P.S. 121, Mr. Lang went to Townsend Harris High School, from which he graduated at 14. While working part time at a restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, he fell into a conversation with a regular customer, who persuaded him to consider Swarthmore instead of City College and arranged an interview for him at the Harvard Club in Manhattan. Mr. Lang was accepted on scholarship.\u201cI remember getting this letter was an experience in itself because I never got mail,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was the first letter I remember getting from anyone.\u201dEntering Swarthmore at 15, he majored in economics and, while attending classes, showed his entrepreneurial spirit by starting a business that manufactured pennants. He graduated in 1938 and, in 1940, went on to receive a Master of Business and Science degree from Columbia while also taking courses in mechanical engineering at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute.When World War II broke out, Mr. Lang was rejected for military service because of his flat feet. He took a job at Heli-Coil, an aircraft parts factory in Long Island City, Queens, rose to a managerial position and later became a part-owner. In 1949, he expanded Heli-Coil to make precision wire inserts, industrial fastenings and tools. It later became a division of Stanley Black & Decker.Much of his fortune stemmed from the Refac Technology Development Corporation, a public company he founded in 1952 that specialized in the licensing of patents and financing high-tech ventures.In 1996, President Bill Clinton awarded Mr. Lang the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Among other positions, he served as chairman of Swarthmore\u2019s governing board, managing director of the Metropolitan Opera Association and chairman of the Circle in the Square Theater. He also gave substantial gifts to New York Hospital, Columbia Business School and many other organizations. His philanthropy reflected his personal philosophy.\u201cGiving should not be mechanical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be the fruit of one\u2019s feeling, love and sense of responsibility. Giving is not giving back. There is no quid pro quo. Giving is self-fulfillment.\u201dAn obituary on Monday about the investor and philanthropist Eugene M. Lang, using information from his family, omitted the name of a survivor and misstated the number of his great-grandchildren. In addition to a daughter and two sons, he is survived by a sister, Barbara Lang, and by eight great-grandchildren, not five.Matthew Haag contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Far-Right Leaders Loathe the European Parliament, but Love Its Paychecks", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byEven so, Ms. Le Pen is willing to accept a salary of 101,808 euros (about $110,000), a generous per diem and an annual staff and office budget in excess of \u20ac340,000. In February, the Parliament halved her compensation after fraud investigators concluded that she had wrongly diverted money to pay for National Front party activities in France.The scandal, which has not fazed Ms. Le Pen\u2019s supporters in France, is another example of how Europe\u2019s right-wing parties happily provoke populist fury by attacking the European Union \u2014 yet also happily pocket government salaries and other benefits. For some far-right politicians, a perch in the European Parliament can mean a lucrative sinecure, easy news media exposure and immunity from criminal prosecution at home.For decades, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front and other parties on Europe\u2019s far right have drawn a strange legitimacy by winning seats in the European Parliament. They blame European institutions for being onerous bureaucracies and lacking democratic accountability even as they enjoy the perks of office and generally shun the daily grind of legislative work.European institutions in Brussels are routinely criticized as lacking democratic accountability. The European Parliament, whose members are directly elected, is supposed to be the answer to that complaint. But anti-Europe lawmakers instead often use the Parliament, based in Strasbourg, France, to attack the European Union.The overall expenses of salaries, benefits and other funds for far-right Euroskeptic lawmakers and their staffs cost European Union taxpayers about \u20ac55 million this year, according to Thilo Janssen, a political scientist who has studied the far right and who advises a left-wing lawmaker in Parliament.Even more ironic, the Parliament provides a platform for these lawmakers to network and coordinate their anti-Europe efforts \u2014 and to get paid for it. They have formed political groups, the main organizational units of Parliament, which allow them to qualify for an array of privileges.\u201cMore and more people see through the lies of the E.U. establishment and are joining the patriots,\u201d he told colleagues during a recent address on the floor of Parliament. \u201cThe E.U.\u2019s end is approaching.\u201dTwo years ago, when Ms. Le Pen was absent for some votes, Mr. de Graaff covered for her, casting her ballots. She later praised his \u201cchivalrous spirit.\u201d Other lawmakers were less amused. Mr. de Graaff was fined \u20ac1,530.Yet Mr. de Graaff and others mostly shrug off the criticism. Mr. Farage, who helped lead the \u201cBrexit\u201d campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, soaks up free media attention by giving strident, anti-Europe speeches.But the U.K. Independence Party used it instead to conduct opinion polls on Brexit, officials found. (The alliance\u2019s executive director said the audit procedure was \u201cbiased\u201d and aimed at \u201csilencing\u201d critics of European integration.)Other lawmakers fume at the antics of the far right, but have little recourse.Prominent members like Mr. Weber want to block funding for anti-European parties \u2014 including the Alliance for Peace and Freedom, which has three representatives from Greece\u2019s neo-fascist Golden Dawn and one from the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party of Germany in Parliament. That entitled the party to nearly \u20ac400,000 last year.Mr. Weber acknowledged last month that nothing could be done to turn off the money spigot immediately, partly because the rules need to be tightened.Ms. Le Pen, for one, has benefited from leading one of the far-right blocs. It entitles her to a prominent placement on the parliamentary benches and choice speaking slots. Eighteen months ago, when President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany tried to rally support for migration policies on the floor of Parliament, Ms. Le Pen rose to give a stinging, and widely publicized, rebuke.She belittled Mr. Hollande as a German puppet, the \u201cadministrator of the province of France.\u201d Her rant, which evoked the Nazi occupation of France during World War II, has been watched at least a half-million times on YouTube.When he visited the Parliament in February, Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, did not have lunch with the heads of the political blocs \u2014 to avoid encountering Ms. Le Pen, officials speculated at the time.Meanwhile, Ms. Le Pen has also enjoyed another privilege of being a European parliamentarian: immunity.Lawmakers are still considering yet another French request to lift her immunity, in a case of alleged defamation against a former mayor of Nice.But for now, Ms. Le Pen continues to receive legal protection from a European Parliament she wants to bring down.Advertisement"}

Beyond the farm, a Chevron refinery pumps plumes of smoke into the atmosphere. The farm won\u2019t remove the pollution, but Robinson believes it can make the city\u2019s residents healthier in other ways, specifically by showing them that \u201ctheir actions have an impact.\u201d\u201cDown here it\u2019s hard to see what matters,\u201d Robinson says, \u201cthat you matter, that your neighborhood matters.\u201dRichmond officials became interested in \u201cHealth in All Policies\u201d about a decade ago, when they spoke with Jason Corburn, an urban planner and epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Corburn showed that a person\u2019s ZIP code is more predictive of longevity than his or her genetic code \u2014 and that Richmond\u2019s ZIP codes did not fare well. The root of the problem wasn\u2019t the individual, he maintained, but rather the environment. \u201cWe all knew that it went beyond saying, you are unhealthy because you don\u2019t exercise and eat bad food,\u201d he says. \u201cI talked about toxic stress and structural racism as a driver of poor health outcomes.\u201d\u201cThe police chief immediately got it,\u201d he said, \u201cthe mayor got it, and the city manager eventually got it too.\u201dOver the next few years, Richmond worked on incorporating health and wellness policies within plans for transportation, parks, policy and housing, as opposed to keeping health a separate issue. And they began to identify organizations that were sympathetic to this holistic approach. For example, the city partnered with the nonprofit organization Pogo Park on a project to develop safe parks and walkable streets downtown. And they supported the Contra Costa Family Justice Alliance, a nonprofit organization that helps victims of domestic violence who struggle to find services because of their race, citizenship status and level of poverty. Specifically, the Alliance serves as a one-stop shop for people who have experienced domestic abuse and sex trafficking and would otherwise need to navigate a complicated and physically dispersed system. Before the Alliance set up shop, said Susan Kim, executive director of the group, \u201cIf a woman wanted to file a restraining order, she would have to go to Martinez, which is about four hours away if you\u2019re going by public transportation. If you need child support from your abuser, you have to travel somewhere else. Without resources, most victims give up.\u201dAlmost immediately, the number of restraining orders picked up, and in 2015, the city essentially gave a concrete building in downtown Richmond to the group. Today, it houses 14 \u201cpartners,\u201d including a police unit, an office for attorneys and clinical rooms for medical care. If a sex-trafficked woman comes in to the center about a toothache, she\u2019ll be counseled about her legal options without feeling as dangerously pressured as she might when walking into a police station.Richmond officials survey residents annually to get a sense of whether they\u2019re on the right track. On average, residents seem to be doing better since health equity became intertwined with the city\u2019s plans. Surveys show that 43 percent of residents rated their health as excellent or good in 2015, up from 32 percent in 2011. Only 12 percent called the city a poor place to live in 2015, down from 32 percent in 2007. And with police reforms and community nonviolence campaigns, there\u2019s been a 75 percent reduction in firearm-related homicides since 2007. Residents said they feel safer.Desmond Carson, an emergency room doctor in Richmond, says it\u2019s premature to celebrate the city\u2019s progressive policies. \u201cWe\u2019re in a crisis,\u201d he says. Last year, the county allowed the hospital where he worked \u2014 the primary hospital serving Richmond\u2019s low-income residents \u2014 to close because of bankruptcy.Corburn is nevertheless eager to see if the city\u2019s interventions \u2014 whether encouraging youths about their power to make change or assisting victims of sex trafficking to seek protection \u2014 will translate into health gains. The only way to know what may work is to try, he says. Admitting it\u2019s anecdotal, Robinson says she draws inspiration from young people who seem to transform over the course of a season.\u201cWhen kids first come here, they say black people don\u2019t do this \u2014 this is for white people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I tell them that\u2019s ridiculous and we talk about where that idea came from. If you understand that you a part of a historical trajectory and not innately defective, there is a possibility for change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Leonard Litwin, New York Real Estate Mogul, Dies at 102", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byLeonard Litwin, a rental-property developer who began with his father\u2019s Depression-era plant nursery on Long Island, built a New York City residential real estate empire and paid millions to Republican and Democratic leaders to ensure tax breaks, government financing and favorable rent laws, died on Sunday at his home on Long Island, in Melville. He was 102.His death was confirmed by Charles C. Dorego, general counsel for the Litwin family and Mr. Litwin\u2019s company, Glenwood Management Corporation.In the small circle of wealthy, sometimes flamboyant real estate moguls in New York, Mr. Litwin was almost invisible: a secretive man who kept his company private and his books closed; lived quietly on Long Island, in Great Neck; shunned publicity; and said little about his assets and activities that was not good for business or required by law.But his imprint is on the Manhattan skyline in dozens of buildings he built, owned and operated \u2014 more than 8,700 apartments with high-end amenities and lofty rents. The holdings were assembled over six decades in a father-and-son enterprise that ventured into the city rental market in the early 1950s and expanded into an archipelago of towers with names like the Pavilion, the Lucerne and Liberty Plaza.Behind the scenes, Mr. Litwin\u2019s influence and that of Glenwood Management reached far beyond the buildings he owned. He forged political connections in Albany and City Hall with campaign contributions, lobbying and payments that shaped rent laws affecting millions of tenants, as well as state and city regulations that helped the real estate industry thrive in New York.In 2015, two extraordinary federal corruption trials in New York led to the convictions and resignations of the state\u2019s two most powerful legislative leaders in Albany and exposed long-hidden bribery connections to Mr. Litwin\u2019s empire, laying bare a seamy world of payoffs, political favors and legislation that reaped staggering profits and savings for the real estate industry, and for Glenwood Management in particular.Mr. Litwin was not charged with any crime, though he was named a co-conspirator in one case, and never appeared in a courtroom for either trial as the juries convicted Assemblyman Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat and former Assembly speaker, and State Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican and Senate majority leader, of bribery, extortion and conspiracy charges.In both trials, prosecutors showed that Glenwood had received favored treatment in Albany by giving $10 million to political campaigns since 2005, mostly through a maze of 26 limited liability companies. Under a nonprosecution agreement, Mr. Dorego, a senior executive of Glenwood, testified that payoffs to leaders and members of the State Legislature assured Glenwood of continued benefits in taxes, state financing and rent laws. One program alone, he said, saved up to $100 million.In the Skelos case, the jury found that the senator and his son, Adam B. Skelos, had pressured Glenwood and two other companies into providing benefits worth $300,000 to the son, who was also convicted. By naming Mr. Litwin a co-conspirator of Dean Skelos, prosecutors were able to elicit testimony from Mr. Dorego about conversations he had with Mr. Litwin on the amounts and recipients of payments.By 2006, when Forbes listed him as a billionaire \u2014 No. 374 among the 400 richest Americans \u2014 Mr. Litwin was one of a core group of builders and property owners that dominated the city\u2019s residential real estate industry. It was an exclusive club that included Stephen M. Ross of the Related Companies, the Elghanayan family, Donald Zucker, the Resnick family, the Rudin family and Larry A. Silverstein.Even to tenants who never knew his name and could never afford to live in one of his buildings, Mr. Litwin was an unseen power: a voice in the Rent Stabilization Association, the landlord organization that battles tenant groups annually over rent increases, set by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, that may legally be charged in hundreds of thousands of rent-stabilized apartments in the city.Mr. Litwin retired in his late 90s, although at 96 he was still actively involved in business.\u201cHe comes to the office every day, goes to all of our meetings and has the final say on almost everything,\u201d Gary Jacob, the executive vice president of Glenwood, told The New York Times in 2011. \u201cHe\u2019s actively involved in our new construction projects \u2014 he pores over the architectural plans to make sure we have the proper amount of closet space, and is very detail-oriented.\u201dWhile Mr. Litwin carefully avoided publicity, he was in the news periodically for his political donations. Campaign finance records showed that over many years he gave millions to governors, state legislators, City Council members, candidates for office, and Republican and Democratic organizations. Public records also showed that he spent millions on lobbying.In July 2013, the New York Public Interest Research Group reported that Mr. Litwin had given Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo a total of $625,000 in campaign contributions since December 2010, apparently making Mr. Litwin the governor\u2019s largest donor. At the time, Mr. Cuomo was raising $1 million a month from contributors for his 2014 re-election campaign.Mr. Litwin also gave large sums to former Gov. Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, and to many Republican officials, including former Gov. George E. Pataki and state legislators, particularly members of the Senate who favored real estate interests. Money trails in the 1990s showed that Mr. Litwin and other developers were heavy supporters of Republicans who pledged to abolish or limit tenant rent protections.Like other wealthy campaign donors, Mr. Litwin circumvented contribution limits by funneling many smaller gifts through dozens of limited liability companies he controlled. While legal, such gifts are worrying to advocates of campaign finance reforms, especially when the donations are made by individuals or companies doing business with the government.While politicians tend to minimize the impact of such donations, tenant advocates and others contend that the money is a prime mover in debates over rent laws and state and city regulations affecting the real estate industry. In any case, Mr. Litwin\u2019s corporation benefited from special state financing, tax breaks, construction subsidies and other largess.In 2002, federal investigators said Mr. Litwin and dozens of other property owners had received illegal tax breaks arranged by a consultant who was charged with bribing tax assessors in a scheme that cost the city $160 million in revenue over four years. But the suspect, Albert Schussler, died of a stroke before he could testify, and Mr. Litwin and other owners denied knowledge of a crime and were not accused of wrongdoing.Starting in 1997, his company financed a series of buildings in New York using more than $1 billion in tax-exempt bonds issued by the state, a form of taxpayer subsidy that reduces interest costs to a borrower. The buildings included Liberty Plaza, a 45-story residential tower near the World Trade Center site.Liberty Plaza won approval for nearly $100 million in special state financing and a 20-year real estate tax exemption, and was the first new apartment building erected in Lower Manhattan after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.Leonard Litwin was born in New York City on Oct. 16, 1914, to Harold Litwin and the former Gertrude Meyer. The boy and his sister, Faye, grew up in Queens, attending public schools. Their father wrote two volumes of poetry under the name Harry Woodbourne. In 1933, Harold Litwin founded Woodbourne Cultural Nurseries in Melville, N.Y., with his son, who attended Columbia University briefly. The business, still in the family, did landscape work for builders.The father and son went into building themselves in 1946, erecting garden apartments on Long Island, followed by a 105-family complex in Queens and a 400-family high-rise in Riverdale, in the Bronx. After his father died in 1962, Mr. Litwin built numerous apartment towers on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, including one of the city\u2019s largest, the Pavilion on East 77th Street near York Avenue.Over the next half century, Mr. Litwin built dozens of properties in Manhattan, almost exclusively rental towers with amenities like swimming pools, fitness centers and concierge services, charging rents of $7,000 a month for some one-bedroom layouts, and more than $30,000 a month for penthouses. He rarely took on cooperative conversions and almost never a condominium project.Mr. Litwin and his wife gave millions to philanthropic causes, hospitals, and medical research on cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. He and Mr. Zucker founded a center on Long Island for the study of Alzheimer\u2019s. The Litwin charitable investments were nearly all managed by Bernard L. Madoff and substantially lost in his Ponzi scheme, which swallowed up many fortunes before being exposed in 2008.Mr. Litwin was a longtime governor of the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry trade group, and in 2012 was named its lifetime honorary chairman. In 2009, he received the organization\u2019s highest honor, the Harry B. Helmsley Distinguished New Yorker Award for lifetime achievement.Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Offshore Money, Bane of Democracy", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorGreedy rulers around the world steal billions from their people, then disguise the money and stash it offshore, usually in the West. The extraction of this much capital cripples the economies of source countries like Afghanistan, Nigeria or Ukraine, and breeds insecurity and violence there. Offshoring is also a problem for host states. If a government doesn\u2019t know who owns the country it runs, how can it know how those owners will behave in a crisis?It wasn\u2019t supposed to work this way. At the end of World War II, the Allies decided to build an international financial system that would safeguard their victory. Central to their plan were restrictions on the streams of hot money that had so unsettled the world between the two wars. Because these governments prioritized global stability over return on investment, they would control how investment moved between countries.Investors in the new bonds were primarily tax-dodging Westerners, but they also included kleptocrats and organized-crime groups. By making the bonds anonymous, portable and redeemable anywhere, the London bankers deliberately made it easy for buyers to hide their identity.This is the original sin that explains why the offshore system has remained so durable. The privacy it allows, either through shell companies or anonymous bank accounts, is as useful to regular businesspeople as to fraudsters or kleptocrats. Any effort to crack down on, say, mobsters who stash their money in New York real estate also inconveniences corporations seeking to minimize their taxes, and thus triggers concerted opposition.But what\u2019s good for large corporations and rich individuals can be disastrous for society. Experts at the F.B.I., Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office and other leading investigators of grand corruption say shell companies are the primary obstacle to bringing the world\u2019s fraudsters to justice. One Miami lawyer told me they are like armor plating: Shell companies own other companies across multiple jurisdictions, creating layers of corporate plating so thick it becomes all but impenetrable.These two measures alone can\u2019t be enough to reveal the true owners of the anonymous money that is buying up so much of the West. But they can go a long way toward depriving dictators and thieves of a haven for their dirty cash, while helping officials in democracies regain control over who is buying the countries they were elected to run.Oliver Bullough is the author of \u201cLet Our Fame Be Great: Journeys Among the Defiant People of the Caucasus.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After spending a couple of pages ticking through top Wall Street givers, he assures readers: \u201cI could name many additional donors coming out of finance, like Jeremy Grantham, Seth Klarman, Louis Bacon, George Roberts, Glenn Dubin, Kenneth Griffin, Michael Milken, Henry Kravis and Leon Black.\u201d All right already. You know your stuff. Can we please move on?Happily, Callahan hustles through the preliminaries and into a sweeping exploration of what makes mega-givers tick, how they operate and how they differ from their predecessors. Today\u2019s masters of the universe, for instance, are donating at a much younger age and taking a much more hands-on approach. Forget spending decades amassing piles of cash to be handed over in the twilight of life to endow some foundation. These folks want to start saving the world right now.Especially absorbing is Callahan\u2019s probing of mega-givers\u2019 psyches. Of course tech billionaires are all about risk-taking and disruption and tackling problems no one else is addressing. That\u2019s how they got to be billionaires in the first place. (They are \u201cmore ready by disposition to embrace the adage that philanthropy \u2018is society\u2019s risk capital.\u2019\u201d) Wall Street donors are often drawn to the \u201cstewardship model of philanthropy\u201d and prefer to support well established institutions \u2014 universities, hospitals, land conservation trusts and so on. (\u201cThey\u2019re more into charity than change.\u201d) \u201cTitans of the old economy\u201d tend to be older, more methodical, less creative and more political.Another significant development is the growing focus on data. (Even the philanthrosphere, it seems, has been invaded by the quants.) Givers are demanding an ever-clearer picture of what\u2019s working and how to get the biggest bang for their bucks. Callahan devotes a chapter to givers\u2019 quest for \u201cleverage points,\u201d most notably the strategic use of the court system to effect change.As suggested by the book\u2019s subtitle, Callahan is not here merely to praise the new philanthropists. His core mission is to sound the alarm about how even the best intentioned among them are distorting American society and eroding \u201cthe egalitarian ethos so core to our national identity.\u201dBy now, pretty much everyone recognizes the potentially corrupting aspects of big-dollar political giving. Callahan\u2019s contention is that big-dollar philanthropy affords its purveyors even greater influence, with fewer downsides and vastly less accountability. Sinking millions into, say, a presidential campaign subjects givers to intense public scrutiny and may ultimately win them nothing. Funding a nonprofit to sway thinking on, say, climate change or marriage equality or school choice \u2014 pick your issue \u2014 is a lower-profile, less risky, more enduring investment.\u201cThe Givers\u201d is not a big-P political book. While Callahan takes issue with ideologically motivated giving dressed up as philanthropy (and with politically minded nonprofits enjoying the same tax status as traditional charities), he endeavors to be bipartisan in his scolding. For every tale of a conservative pushing supply-side economics or traditional marriage via \u201ccharitable\u201d giving, he spotlights a liberal bankrolling gun control or clean energy. One positive byproduct of the swelling pool of mega-givers, he notes, is the philanthrosphere\u2019s growing ideological diversity. You may hate how Charles Koch doles out his billions but delight in how George Soros uses his. Or vice versa.Indeed, the book can be exhausting in its quest to hammer home the warping nature of Big Philanthropy. By the time Callahan makes the case that charitable giving actually perpetuates dynastic influence more than simply leaving one\u2019s offspring a big pile of cash, many readers will be ready to throw up their hands in exasperation. So now we\u2019re supposed to fret about rich people being too socially conscious? What exactly does this guy want?For all his efforts toward partisan balance, Callahan has a clear political perspective. A co-founder of the progressive think tank Demos, he is an unapologetic fan of big government \u2014 which, as he sees it, is the proper shaper of society. Central to his concern about philanthropy\u2019s clout is that it is waxing as government\u2019s is waning. He warns in the prologue, \u201cWe face a future in which private donors \u2014 who are accountable to no one \u2014 may often wield more influence than elected public officials, who (in theory, anyway) are accountable to all of us.\u201d (That \u201cin theory\u201d covers a multitude of sins. While it\u2019s not Callahan\u2019s aim to grapple with the gross dysfunction of our political system, his periodic touting of the oh-so-democratic accountability of public officials nonetheless comes off as vaguely credulous.)It is not until the epilogue that Callahan really lets his progressive flag fly. He offers a handful of reform ideas that will feel familiar to anyone who has followed the money-in-politics debate over the years: greater transparency (especially when it comes to the \u201cdark philanthropic money\u201d channeled through opaque vehicles like \u201cdonor-advised funds\u201d), stricter tax guidelines and increased government regulation. (He suggests a new \u201coffice of charitable affairs\u201d to help on that front.)With such prescriptions, Callahan seeks \u201cto target the philanthropic behavior that\u2019s most troubling, not hobble the sector as a whole.\u201d But this also means that, as Callahan acknowledges, even the most ambitious of his reforms would do little to alter the fundamental nature, or spiraling influence, of the greater philanthrosphere.As Callahan sees it, the only way to knock us off the path of \u201cbenign plutocracy\u201d is \u201cto revive government as a dynamic agent of change\u201d \u2014 which is the modest proposal he presents in literally his final three pages. Such a revival would involve huge shifts in spending priorities, tax hikes on the wealthy and an overhaul of agencies. In other words: It would require an entirely different political and social climate than the one we have. Then again, tackling seemingly intractable problems is what Big Philanthropy is all about. As such, it seems uncharitable to deny Callahan his dreams of a more egalitarian world.Many readers no doubt will share Callahan\u2019s views on the dark side of Big Philanthropy, and his ideas for addressing it. But even those who don\u2019t should give \u201cThe Givers\u201d a go. Callahan offers a peek inside a rarefied, poorly understood world with ever greater power to remake the broader world. It\u2019s an engaging, thought-provoking tour well worth the taking.Michelle Cottle is a contributing editor at The Atlantic, covering the culture and politics of Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Coming Crisis With Iran", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWhile Iran\u2019s economy has been growing, the recovery has been driven by renewed oil exports. As a result, most Iranians have yet to see much economic benefit from the sanctions relief brought by the nuclear deal. Real economic growth will require sizable foreign direct investments but international banks have remained hesitant about financing projects in Iran largely because of lingering American sanctions and the fear that the Trump administration will scrap the nuclear deal.If Mr. Rouhani is punished at the ballot box, there will be trouble. It would have been difficult enough for the deal to survive a Trump presidency. But to survive both Mr. Trump and a hard-line president in Iran may prove impossible.A third threat may prove the most potent: the Trump administration\u2019s adoption of Saudi Arabia\u2019s obsession with \u201ccountering Iranian influence\u201d in the Middle East. While the Obama administration viewed the Saudi-Iranian rivalry as a source of instability and urged the two Middle Eastern powers to learn to share the region, the Trump administration seems to have opted to make the Saudis\u2019 conflict with Iran its own. The main arena for this confrontation is Yemen, where the United States is ramping up its support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s bombardment as a means to combat what it believes is Iranian influence.For the nuclear deal to endure, tension between Washington and Tehran on other issues must be contained or the nuclear deal must be sufficiently insulated to survive external turbulence. It is difficult to see, for instance, how the deal can remain in place while the United States and Iran engage in direct or indirect confrontations throughout the region.If the United States reneges on its obligations under the deal, Iran is likely to follow suit and start expanding its nuclear activities \u2014 regardless of who wins the presidential elections. As Iran gets closer to possessing a nuclear weapon, the United States will once again inch closer to war. That was precisely the situation in 2012 and 2013: Faced with the realization that the United States\u2019 sanctions policy was more likely to lead to war than to Iran\u2019s capitulation, President Barack Obama decided to double down on finding a diplomatic solution through secret talks held in Oman. This time around, the American president won\u2019t have a diplomatic exit ramp.For many of the hawks in Washington, this is a lesser problem than the constraints the nuclear deal has imposed on the United States\u2019 ability to confront Iran elsewhere. That is not an accident: The deal aimed to make an escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran more difficult and costly for both countries. For Iran, this has restrained its policy on Israel. Iran\u2019s actions and rhetoric on the Jewish state have shifted remarkably ever since nuclear negotiations began. Iran\u2019s stance on the 2014 Gaza war is a case in point: Tehran remained relatively silent and did little to add fuel to the fire compared with what it might have done under other circumstances. The Iranians understood that they could not secure and sustain a nuclear deal with the United States without shifting their posture on Israel.And therein lies the true promise of the nuclear deal: Precisely because of its value, both sides are incentivized to contain their other disputes to ensure its survival. Over time, this could convert the United States and Iran from sworn enemies into mere competitors.During the negotiations, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, told me numerous times that he was frustrated that Washington didn\u2019t recognize that the nuclear deal could be a base rather than the ceiling for American-Iranian relations. It could create the possibility of America losing an enemy in the Middle East. When was the last time that happened?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Vancouver: An Ever-Unfolding Story", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Where I LiveFor the author, this gleaming, complex city in British Columbia is \u201ca rolling, improvisatory work in progress.\u201dSupported byVancouver has what you might call an improvisational air. The city makes itself up as it goes along because we are all really complete newbies here, excepting, of course, the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh peoples on whose unceded territory the whole Vancouver project has been and continues to be built.I make this observation with the blend of affection and impatience one tends to acquire after decades in a place. But I say it also knowing that\u2019s how I got here.Vancouver was my father\u2019s idea. The son of an Irish blacksmith, made good with a degree in engineering, he had lived all over the world \u2014 a restless young man who had ended up in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where he met my mother, a holocaust survivor whose family had washed up on those unlikely shores. A dozen years later \u2014 having lived in Brooklyn Heights and in Jackson, Mich. \u2014 the family found itself in San Tom\u00e9, Venezuela, where (in my imagination, at least) my father counted five kids at the table one morning and decided maybe it was time to settle down. I see his finger tracing its way westward across a map of Canada, the names of cities and towns becoming less and less familiar. When he ran out of continent, he had found his spot. I\u2019m quite sure my mother had never heard of Vancouver.Terminal City, they used to say. The end of the line because the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway ended here. But it was a last stop in other senses as well, carved out of a rain forest that seemed ready to overwhelm it. You can still see it that way, nature leaning in around the city. To the north: the snow-capped Garibaldi Highlands, their timbered slopes plunging into a cobalt ocean, gulls crying above the still fish-filled waves. Viewed from the pebbly sand of Kitsilano Beach, the skyline of Vancouver, the actual built substance of the place, can seem on occasion like a glimmering mirage, a seam of mirrored glass suspended between what lies above and below, a recent and provisional thing, reflecting what is permanent around it: the sky and mountains, the endless sea.But if that is our contact with what is established and certain, then the rest of the Vancouver experience lives in the contrast. I recently conducted an informal Facebook poll on Vancouver that ended up proving this point. Citing Peter Ustinov\u2019s long-ago quip that Toronto was \u201cNew York run by the Swiss,\u201d I asked what parallel statement might be made about Vancouver.Still, for me, West Coast wackiness doesn\u2019t capture it entirely. Sure, Vancouver can be seen as culturally contiguous to other coastal urban zones that celebrate individual expression: the Castro district in San Francisco, Echo Park in Los Angeles, Portlandia, etc. But what really defines it is a relative lack of assumptions. I travel a lot and I love urban life generally. And what strikes me about where I live is that local residents cannot resort to a unifying clich\u00e9. Parisians and Romans, Shanghainese and Chicagoans seem always to know the essential civic myths. In Vancouver, ask a random citizen and you\u2019re liable to get anything.In fairness, it has to be noted that this exact improvisational quality is also a real source of vulnerability. What\u2019s fresh about this place, a kind of cultural and economic tabula rasa, has provided for some highly unstable outcomes. It\u2019s noteworthy that on only two occasions has the city found itself on the brink of a sports championship: Game 7 of the Stanley Cup playoffs in both cases, in 1994 against the New York Rangers and in 2011 against the Boston Bruins. Both times, on losing, Vancouver descended into manic violence with stores looted and cars burned. There\u2019s a troublingly adolescent quality to these disturbances, which I theorize are less likely to occur in cities that are soberly aware of their own capacity for self-harm. In Vancouver \u2014 where cyclists wear helmets and nobody carries a concealed weapon \u2014 I\u2019ve often wondered if in our youthfulness we also lack the maturity to see our own hypocrisies. A city smugly in the downward facing dog.But don\u2019t bet on us trying. We choose freedom in this town, including all of its attendant complications. In the end, that will remain the beautiful problem that Vancouver will have, mayoral daydreaming notwithstanding. People will continue to come here and make up their stories as they go along. And if the sense of impermanence gets to us on occasion \u2014 which it will as we age, as we see ourselves ever more clearly, more soberly, more compassionately aware of all that we still do not do well \u2014 then we Vancouverites can take a moment to raise our eyes out of the city to those towering highlands, to the crisp lattice of snow. We\u2019ll picture the cougars still prowling there, the swaying trees. We will see ourselves as if from a pebbly shore, a mirage trapped between what is above and below: a rolling, improvisatory work in progress.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Neil Gorsuch Confirmed by Senate as Supreme Court Justice", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Judge Neil M. Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate on Friday to become the 113th justice of the Supreme Court, capping a political brawl that lasted for more than a year and tested constitutional norms inside the Capitol\u2019s fraying upper chamber.\u201cAs a deep believer in the rule of law, Judge Gorsuch will serve the American people with distinction as he continues to faithfully and vigorously defend our Constitution,\u201d the president said.The final tally was 54-45 in favor of confirmation.The Senate is expected on Friday to confirm President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil M. Gorsuch.The confirmation saga did not help the reputation of the Supreme Court, either. The justices say politics plays no role in their work, but the public heard an unrelentingly different story over the last year, with politicians, pundits and well-financed outside groups insisting that a Democratic nominee would rule differently from a Republican one.Judge Gorsuch possesses the credentials typical of the modern Supreme Court justice. He is a graduate of Columbia, Harvard and Oxford, served as a Supreme Court law clerk and worked as a lawyer at a prestigious Washington law firm and at the Justice Department. He joined the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, in 2006, where he was widely admired as a fine judicial stylist.During 20 hours of questioning from senators during his confirmation hearings last month, Judge Gorsuch said almost nothing of substance. He presented himself as a folksy servant of neutral legal principles, and senators had little success in eliciting anything but canned answers.But neither side harbored any doubts, based on the judge\u2019s opinions, other writings and the president who nominated him, that Judge Gorsuch would be a reliable conservative committed to following the original understanding of those who drafted and ratified the Constitution.Judge Gorsuch will be sworn in on Monday, in two ceremonies: a private session at the Supreme Court, where Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. will preside, and a public event at the White House, where Justice Anthony M. Kennedy will administer a second oath.A week from Monday, he will hear his first arguments. A ninth chair, absent since the spring of 2016, will be waiting for him.The court has been short-handed since Justice Scalia\u2019s death on Feb. 13, 2016. Within hours, the Republican majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said the seat would not be filled until a new administration came to power.It was perhaps the most audacious escalation in a series of precedent-busting Senate skirmishes in recent decades \u2014 tracing from Democratic opposition to Judge Robert H. Bork and Justice Clarence Thomas to the wide-scale use of the filibuster by Republicans under Mr. Obama.In an interview on Friday, Mr. McConnell said that he viewed the elevation of Judge Gorsuch as quite likely the most consequential accomplishment of his career. He also played down the long-term consequences of the recent rancor.\u201cEven though the rhetoric was kind of hot, frankly I think it was an act,\u201d he said of Democrats. \u201cI don\u2019t think the well has been poisoned in any permanent way.\u201dRepublicans have pinned any blame squarely on their opponents, citing Democratic blockades of judicial nominees under President George W. Bush and a rule change in 2013, when Democrats controlled the Senate, barring the filibuster for lower judgeships and executive branch nominees.But by design, that move left the Supreme Court filibuster untouched. Democrats have insisted that history remember who toppled this final emblem of minority party influence over confirmations.Over the last year, the eight-justice court has deadlocked a few times, but it has employed all kinds of strategies to avoid being completely hobbled. The justices have ducked some cases, issued vanishingly narrow decisions in others and slow-walked still others, waiting for a ninth justice to resolve what would otherwise be a 4-4 tie.On his third day on the bench, Justice Gorsuch will hear what may be the most important case of the term, a church-state clash with accessible facts and vast implications. On the Federal Court of Appeals in Denver, Judge Gorsuch was receptive to claims based on religious freedom, and he may make an early mark at the Supreme Court in that same area.There is good reason to think he may cast the decisive vote in the case, Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, No. 15-577. The court has signaled that it feared a deadlock, taking an extraordinarily long time to schedule arguments.The justices agreed to hear the case in January 2016, when Justice Scalia was still alive. Indeed, he may have cast the fourth vote required to place the case on the court\u2019s docket.Other cases the court agreed to hear that day were argued and decided by the end of the last term, in June. But the court put the religion case on a very slow track, scheduling it for argument in the waning days of the current term.The case arose from a program in Missouri that helps schools use recycled tires to resurface playgrounds. State officials rejected an application from a Lutheran church that wanted to participate in the program for a playground at its preschool and day care center.The officials based their decision on the Missouri Constitution, which bars spending public money \u201cin aid of any church.\u201dThe church argued that the state\u2019s Constitution violated equal protection principles and the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free exercise of religion. Missouri said states should have leeway to decide for themselves whether and how much to help religious groups.One of Justice Gorsuch\u2019s earliest votes, then, will be in a case that could refashion the rules for how much state governments can keep their distance from religion.Should the court deadlock in cases it has already heard this term, as is possible in ones on a cross-border shooting and fair housing, it could order them reargued so that Justice Gorsuch might break the tie. In all likelihood, such rearguments would come in the court\u2019s next term, which starts in October.Among the cases the court has already agreed to take up next term are three about whether companies can use employment contracts to prohibit workers from banding together to take legal action over workplace issues. In the time before Judge Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation, Democrats expressed particular concern about his record on workers\u2019 rights, suggesting that his rulings tended to favor the privileged.Cases concerning arbitration clauses with class-action waivers in other settings have divided the court along ideological lines, with the conservative justices voting to uphold the provisions. Here, too, Justice Gorsuch may hold the decisive vote.The court will also hear a case on whether corporations can be sued for complicity in human rights abuses abroad, a question that has echoes of the court\u2019s 2010 decision in Citizens United, which allowed corporations to spend unlimited sums in elections.The court divided 5-4 along ideological lines in both Citizens United and an earlier human rights case, meaning that Justice Gorsuch\u2019s vote may once again prove crucial.Advertisement"}

Supporters of Mr. Zuma and his governing African National Congress held smaller counterprotests in Durban and Johannesburg.The protests were prompted by Mr. Zuma\u2019s abrupt dismissal of the finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, in a midnight cabinet reshuffle last week. Mr. Gordhan, known for his fiscal prudence and oversight of state enterprises, was regarded as a bulwark against the A.N.C.\u2019s perceived culture of corruption and patronage that Mr. Zuma has come to symbolize.\u201cOne person cannot hold the rest of the country hostage,\u201d Mmusi Maimane, the leader of the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said at a march in central Johannesburg.\u201cJacob Zuma is not fit to lead South Africa,\u201d he added.In response, hundreds of veterans of the African National Congress\u2019s former military wing, dressed in camouflage and singing revolutionary songs, formed a shield in front of the party\u2019s headquarters in Johannesburg. The police fired rubber bullets to disperse A.N.C. supporters who were headed toward Democratic Alliance marchers, and clashes between rival protesters were reported elsewhere in the country.With the party expected to select a new leader at a national conference in December, Mr. Zuma appears to have firmed up his position and influence. His critics in the party were forced to apologize this week. His cabinet is now stacked with loyalists. His new finance minister is a longtime ally who is more likely to give the president and his allies easy access to the state coffers.Thousands of demonstrators, many with \u201cSave South Africa\u201d banners, gathered in Pretoria to march to Union Buildings, the seat of the presidency, after a court lifted a police ban on the protest late Thursday evening.\u201cThe presidency respects the right of South Africans to protest peacefully,\u201d Mr. Zuma said in a statement about the march in Pretoria, but he has not commented further.In the Cape Town area, demonstrators formed an intermittent human chain from the Cape Peninsula into the city.

But it began another uncertain chapter for the company at an increasingly tremulous time for the industry.Print advertising and circulation revenues continue to fall, starving magazine companies of the lifeblood that long sustained them. Most publishers have shifted their focus to increasing nonprint revenue, but new revenue sources have yet to make up the shortfall. To compensate, publishers continue to slash costs, transforming themselves into leaner companies with fewer employees and diminished resources.\u201cThey have substantial challenges ahead as a public company,\u201d Reed Phillips, a media investment banker at DeSilva & Phillips, said about Time Inc. in an email. \u201cThere will be pressure from shareholders wanting to see growth at a time when the magazine industry is receding.\u201dPotential buyers circled Time Inc. for months, and the company\u2019s board \u2014 while pointing out that it had not initiated a sale process \u2014 had been considering a number of options, including selling itself or bringing on an outside investor.Time Inc. previously rejected an offer of at least $18 a share from Mr. Bronfman\u2019s group late last year.But despite rumblings of interest, the bidding process for Time Inc. dragged on without an agreement. About two weeks ago, the company\u2019s board, worried about morale and the cloud of uncertainty, began considering whether to end the discussions, according to a person briefed on the process. On Thursday, the directors officially decided to call off the sale talks, the person said.Meredith, which came to be considered the most likely acquirer, had been unwilling to pay what Time Inc. sought. The most significant issues for Meredith were concerns about pension liability connected to Time Inc.\u2019s business in Britain, and Meredith\u2019s inability to secure sufficient financing from banks because of Time Inc.\u2019s financial situation, according to a person briefed on Meredith\u2019s thinking.But the person briefed on the process said the pension was nearly fully funded and that the company had affirmed its financial outlook for the year.Time Inc.\u2019s share price, which has been propped up for months on deal expectations, was down about 17 percent at the close of the market Friday.Founded in 1922 by Henry R. Luce, Time Inc. long embodied the free spending of the magazine industry, with offices overlooking Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. As a publisher of magazines that highlighted stellar photography and weekly updates on news, sports and celebrities, Time Inc. was an empire that left an indelible mark on American culture.But like many magazine publishers, Time Inc. has struggled to adapt to a digital age. The brutal economics of the publishing industry have made that challenge more daunting. In the last decade, Time Inc.\u2019s revenue and operating profit have fallen sharply. Its work force has dropped from 11,000 to just over 7,000.Although Time Inc.\u2019s challenges are endemic to all publishing companies, other forces have contributed to the company\u2019s troubles. Executive churn has roiled the company for years, and cost cuts have bled off its resources. After Time Warner spun off Time Inc. in June 2014, the publisher struggled to find its footing. It has reported revenue declines each year since the spinoff.But there have been some positive signs for the business. Mr. Battista, who took the helm of Time Inc. in September, and the new chief operating officer, Jen Wong, recently embarked on an aggressive strategy to increase Time Inc.\u2019s digital revenue, including enhancing advertising technology abilities and offering customers paid services, such as a food-and-wine club.Last year, advertising revenue increased 3 percent, driven by substantial growth in digital advertising. Executives project that digital advertising revenue will increase to more than $600 million this year and $1 billion in the coming years.But Time Inc.\u2019s overall financial results have yet to improve, in large part because the company is still tied to its declining print business. About two-thirds of its annual revenue is still derived from magazines.The company will report its first-quarter earnings on May 10.Time Inc. is aiming to make $100 million in cost cuts this year, and Mr. Battista said the company would continue to be aggressive about cost management, particularly in its print business. He did not rule out selling individual magazine titles.Mr. Battista added that he was eager to continue transforming Time Inc. from a print publisher to a multimedia company. He planned to hold two town hall-style meetings with employees Monday morning.\u201cThe focus right now is on executing on this plan and moving forward,\u201d he said.So for now, Time Inc. soldiers on.Earlier this week, it held its annual black tie Time 100 gala to honor what it had deemed the year\u2019s most influential people. In a glass-walled concert hall overlooking Central Park, celebrities and prominent media executives dined on poached Maine lobster and listened to performances by Demi Lovato and John Legend. Even the pouring rain could not ruin the night.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After French Vote, Mainstream Europe Breathes a Sigh of Relief", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisAfter other recent electoral setbacks for far-right populists, and the far right\u2019s flagging momentum in Germany\u2019s election campaign, some even suggested that the French election could represent the high-water mark of the populist surge that has voted Britain out of the European Union and Donald J. Trump into power in the United States.If this is a high-water mark, though, the water remains quite high.For the moment, the parties and personalities that have energized far-right populism have not fully crystallized electorally. But the issues that have animated the movements \u2014 slow economies, a lack of jobs, immigration \u2014 are not going anywhere, and the far right has already moved the political terrain in its direction.\u201cThere is a sigh of relief,\u201d said Jan Techau, the director of the Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin. \u201cIt\u2019s good that in addition to all the other issues on the agenda, we don\u2019t also have an extremist French problem.\u201dAfter a year of unpredictable elections in Europe and the United States, it would be unwise to discount Ms. Le Pen entirely, even if her odds are long. Still, the French result was particularly welcomed by Brussels and Berlin, which have been praying for a French partner willing to challenge both the statist structure of France and the complacency of the European Union. And after weeks of market jitters, investors on Monday cheered the results, with global stocks surging and the euro reaching fresh highs.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, broke protocol to congratulate Mr. Macron and wish him continued success, as did the German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, who said, \u201cHe will be a great president.\u201dBy winning more votes than Ms. Le Pen, Mr. Macron, who at 39 is on course to be France\u2019s youngest head of state since Napoleon, seemed to many to be a new generation\u2019s centrist answer to sclerotic and corrupt establishment politics and the challenge of populism and the far right.Even so, candidates of the far right and far left did very well in the voting, reflecting strong and skeptical views among the French public.\u201cOf course many people in Brussels and so on are relieved that we don\u2019t have two extremists in the last round, but only one,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, a German who directs Bruegel, a Brussels-based research organization.\u201cBut the fact of the matter is that we still have a little bit more than 40 percent of the electorate having voted for an extremist,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cSo that shows that a large part of the French population doesn\u2019t seem to be very happy with his or her own position and pretty dissatisfied with the political system.\u201dThe question for many is whether a centrist reformer like Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, is prepared to seriously take on board the dissatisfaction of ordinary working people.\u201cBut the threat from the far right is not over,\u201d they were quick to add. \u201cIf Macron is to take it on and defeat it, he needs to get real on social justice and do more for those who feel marginalized.\u201dStill, for a majority in Europe, the far right has not provided answers either, as it has fallen short of predicted triumphs.Yet on traditional measures, Ms. Le Pen did very well in the first-round vote on Sunday. She received nearly 7.7 million votes, compared with her 6.4 million in the first round in 2012 and the 4.8 million that her father, Jean-Marie, received when he advanced to the second round in 2002.While Ms. Le Pen is expected to lose in the runoff, Mr. Macron \u2014 as a youthful banker with an elite education \u2014 is an easy target for her. French unhappiness with establishment parties is sure to be reflected in the June votes for the French legislature, in which Mr. Macron and his year-old movement, En Marche!, will have to work hard to cobble together a working majority.Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, a research institute in London, cautioned that populist views have been growing for many years, not just in southern Europe but in \u201cmore settled northern Europe,\u201d like Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands.\u201cIn a time of economic turbulence, there\u2019s been a search for national identity and individual identity, a feeling that national identities are being stripped away at a pace people can\u2019t control,\u201d he said. \u201cThe E.U. is seen as an expression of that loss, and even a vehicle for it.\u201dAs important, the far right\u2019s nationalism and opposition to multilateralism have split mainstream parties and pushed the national conversation to the right.\u201cAt the moment, conservatives are doing a better job at coalescing support and co-opting aspects of the populist message,\u201d Mr. Niblett said. Each country has its own specific political context, he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see the validity of the populist message declining.\u201dGermany especially is looking forward to a more like-minded French partner, as together they make up about 47 percent of the eurozone\u2019s gross domestic product, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.\u201cMacron understands Europe and the need to change things, and that means changing France, too,\u201d she said, noting a speech by Mr. Macron in Berlin that directly linked \u201creform and modernization in France with reform in the E.U.\u201dThat is the perfect line for Germany, she said, \u201cwhich fears pressure for more burden-sharing with countries who haven\u2019t done their economic homework.\u201dMr. Macron has said he wants a common eurozone budget under a eurozone \u201cfinance minister\u201d and has proposed \u201cdemocratic conventions\u201d to identify reform priorities for the European Union.The Germans fear that if the eurozone integrates further with a budget and banking union, but without prior economic changes from its members, Germany will end up bailing out everyone else forever. So Mr. Macron, vowing economic reform in France, is singing a song much more attuned to German ears.But Mr. Macron, if elected, is also expected to push a harder negotiating line with Britain over its exit from the European Union \u2014 especially on the issue of financial services, about which he knows a great deal.\u201cWith his background, we assume Macron sees much more clearly where the actual issues lie and will work to prevent Europe from facing a competitive disadvantage,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said.But there is much to play for, not just in Britain\u2019s election in June but especially in Germany\u2019s in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a strong challenge from the center-left Social Democrats, and the far-right Alternative for Germany is likely to win seats in the federal Parliament for the first time.At the far right\u2019s party conference this past weekend in Cologne, there were strong themes of nationalism and distaste for immigration despite the party\u2019s internal disputes, in which Frauke Petry, one of its leaders, lost her effort to pull the party away from the hard right.Her rivals brought delegates to their feet with speeches that pandered to identity loss. Whether or not the party succeeds, the issue seems likely to continue to resonate broadly.J\u00f6rg Meuthen, a professor who leads the party with Ms. Petry, said that few Germans could be seen as one walked around a typical German town.\u201cThis is our country,\u201d he told cheering delegates. \u201cThe country of our grandparents and parents. We must take it back.\u201dSteven Erlanger reported from London, and Alison Smale from Cologne and Berlin. James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Plan Is a Reckoning for Republican Deficit Hawks", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported bySome skeptics are already ringing alarm bells, fearing that Republicans will sign on to what critics see as a dangerous plan composed by a president who called himself the King of Debt.\u201cIt seems the administration is using economic growth like magic beans: the cheap solution to all our problems,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that advocates fiscal restraint. \u201cBut there is no golden goose at the top of the tax-cut beanstalk, just mountains of debt.\u201dA point-by-point look at how much it will increase the federal deficit.While Mr. Trump and his team point to the growth linked to tax cuts passed by previous presidents, today\u2019s economy is different from that of 1981 or 2001, when Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush cut tax rates.The office\u2019s predictions have been off before, and the impact of tax cuts on the economy is a matter of debate, as so many variables determine a country\u2019s economic fortunes. But tax historians and veterans of previous tax fights are quick to point out that lower rates are not necessarily a panacea for slow growth.\u201cThis is fool\u2019s gold that you\u2019ll cut taxes, everybody will work harder, more money will come and you\u2019ll erase the fiscal impact,\u201d said Steve Bell, who was a Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee from 1981 to 1986. \u201cIt never happens.\u201dJoseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, said the Trump plan appeared to have strong parallels with Reagan\u2019s 1981 cuts. Mr. Thorndike recalled that the Reagan administration soon realized the problem of the red ink it was facing and started looking for new sources of revenue.\u201cThis looks like \u201981, where they said, \u2018Deficit be damned, we want to do a tax cut,\u2019\u201d Mr. Thorndike said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cautionary tale.\u201dTwenty years later, the Bush tax cuts, which reduced the top individual tax rates and increased the standard deduction for low-income households, took place in a different environment. Mr. Bush made the case that it was time to spend the nation\u2019s surplus to jump-start a flagging economy.\u201cIt\u2019s very important to recognize that the fiscal situation today is not what it was in 2001,\u201d said Scott Greenberg of the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group. \u201cInstead of facing a large projected surplus, the country faces a large projected deficit.\u201dThe White House\u2019s outline was too thin on details to allow for a concrete analysis of how much deficits would grow. There were no specifics about what income would fall into the three, instead of seven, individual tax brackets. The explanation of how the mammoth switch to a territorial corporate tax system would work was vague. There was no word on how low the tax on repatriated foreign corporate earnings would be. And Gary D. Cohn, the director of the president\u2019s National Economic Council, could not say how much of a tax cut a middle-income American would get.The debate over the impact of the plan is only beginning. If Republicans are not able to make the cuts revenue-neutral \u2014 that is, causing no increase in the deficit \u2014 they will need the support of Democrats to get 60 votes in the Senate and make the legislation permanent under budget reconciliation rules. Otherwise, any changes to the tax code will expire in 10 years.While Republicans in the House, Senate and Trump administration have said they do not want to add to the deficit, there is a growing acknowledgment of the possibility that they will need to settle for temporary tax cuts. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday that short-term cuts were better than nothing. And Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said this week that he could live with cuts that added to the deficit if it meant getting the economy moving faster.Republican budget hawks will need to decide whether they want to stick to the arguments of fiscal responsibility that they used to bludgeon Democrats during the Obama era. One of those hawks, Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, said Wednesday, \u201cRather than conforming to arbitrary budget constraints, the president\u2019s plan rightfully aims to jump-start investment, which will produce significantly more revenue for the Treasury over the long term than any revenue-neutral tax plan could generate.\u201dMick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, who was a fierce critic of deficits when he was a member of Congress, offered a glimpse of the rationale his former colleagues might embrace. \u201cAs a conservative, that bothers me a little bit,\u201d he said Tuesday on CNN of the possibility that Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan would increase the deficit. \u201cBut we also look at deficits through sort of a different lens.\u201dFor Democrats, now out of power, the reversal is bitterly ironic, and several lawmakers assailed the president for, they said, preparing to cripple the country with debt.\u201cI\u2019m not the first to observe that a Republican Congress only cares about the deficit when a Democrat is in the White House,\u201d said Alan B. Krueger, the Princeton economist who was chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIt may be that Dick Cheney is right and that deficits don\u2019t matter to the public, but they do matter to the economy.\u201dBut for Republicans who have been craving big tax cuts for years, confidence was high that the worries about deficits were overwrought.\u201cThis is a thing of beauty, a thing of wonder,\u201d Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, said of Mr. Trump\u2019s one-page plan. \u201cGrowth, growth, growth!\u201dAdvertisement"}

What made sense on the campaign trail may have little bearing on reality in the Oval Office, and the education of a president can be rocky even for former governors or senators. For Mr. Trump, the first president in American history never to have served in government or the military, the learning curve is especially steep.\u201cAs he governs, he is realizing that the campaign talk doesn\u2019t fit neatly into governing and he needs a different approach, one that gets results,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of the president\u2019s. \u201cSo he will discard things and people that don\u2019t work out, and those that do work, he will magnify. That\u2019s how he became successful in business and entertainment.\u201dPresident Trump has reversed himself on several longstanding positions over the past week.But he arrived at the White House surrounded by advisers who, like him, were neophytes to governing. His White House chief of staff, chief strategist, senior adviser, counselor and national economics adviser have no prior government experience of consequence. Nor do his secretaries of state, Treasury, commerce, housing or education.\u201cI\u2019ve probably never met a chief executive who didn\u2019t have a different perspective when they occupy that chair than when they\u2019re on the outside, whether you\u2019re a mayor or you\u2019re running a company,\u201d Mr. Hochberg said. \u201cAnd we ought to applaud people when they learn and they change their minds.\u201d\u201cAfter listening for 10 minutes, I realized that it\u2019s not so easy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou know, I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power over\u201d North Korea, he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s not what you would think.\u201d\u201cYou look at the president\u2019s position, where he wanted to see NATO, in particular, evolve to, and it\u2019s moving exactly in the direction that he said,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday.But the alliance has hardly changed in three months. Just three more members out of 28 have committed to raise military spending to target levels by next year, and the only shift in NATO\u2019s approach to terrorism was to create a new intelligence office before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u201cObviously, most presidents aren\u2019t nuclear scientists,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is important is that the White House provide a disciplined process for the experts to present their views, which are often differing. The president\u2019s role as the chief executive and decision maker is to listen to, question and probe the expert recommendations, then apply informed judgment to the decision.\u201dFollow Peter Baker at @peterbakernytAdvertisement"}

That valuation makes it the second most valuable start-up in the world, behind Uber.The new financing could bring Didi Chuxing back into competition with Uber: Analysts expect the Chinese company to use the funds to push into new markets and to develop autonomous driving technologies.The fund-raising efforts indicate just how valuable it can be to dominate China, an internet-savvy market with the world\u2019s largest smartphone-using population, which is nevertheless largely closed to foreign competition. Despite having done little outside China, Didi Chuxing has been able to raise almost as much money as Uber.With the infusion, Didi Chuxing\u2019s expansion will be watched closely as a signal of the ability of Chinese start-ups to expand beyond their home market.While Chinese internet companies have innovated at home, becoming some of the largest businesses in the world, they have a mixed track record in expanding abroad.Didi Chuxing was also expected to use part of the new funds to develop next-generation technologies. There, too, it faces stiff competition. Google, Uber and the Chinese search engine Baidu all have a lead in development of autonomous driving. In March, Didi Chuxing said it was creating an artificial-intelligence lab in Silicon Valley to help it create driverless car and security technologies.Advertisement"}

Chris Christie of New Jersey, who had already threatened to halt his state\u2019s payments to the railroad as a result of the earlier derailments.\u201cThe number of trains and the number of people going through there are double what they were years ago,\u201d Mr. Moorman said in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve had this place where we weren\u2019t putting enough money in while the demand was growing.\u201dAmtrak has struggled, amid competing demands, to schedule maintenance work at the congested station, Mr. Moorman said. Not only must the railroad coordinate track closings with other railroads, but it also has to juggle the needs of bigger projects like building a new train hall in the James A. Farley Building across from Penn Station, a plan important to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York.\u201cWhat we have to do is work with these folks and make sure that we prioritize correctly,\u201d Mr. Moorman said. \u201cClearly, my priority is to make sure we do the work so this kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201dTo address safety concerns, Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration are inspecting all of the track infrastructure at Penn Station. Mr. Moorman also said he would lead a review of Amtrak\u2019s maintenance practices and its engineering departments.There were 178 derailments on Amtrak from 2010 to 2016, and 73 of the accidents, or 41 percent, were a result of track problems, according to federal statistics. Still, despite recent high-profile accidents, the number of derailments at Amtrak has remained relatively flat in recent years. There were 22 last year, down from 79 in 2000.Ever since Amtrak was created in 1971 to bring together many ailing rail lines, it has struggled to become profitable. It now carries more than 31 million riders annually, up from about 22.5 million in 2000. More than a third of Amtrak\u2019s trips take place on the Northeast Corridor.Federal subsidies to Amtrak, which reached a high of $1.7 billion in 1999, have remained relatively flat in recent years even as its needs have grown. Last year, Amtrak requested about $1.8 billion from the federal government, but wound up getting about $1.4 billion.For much of Amtrak\u2019s history, a tight budget has forced it to make difficult choices between spending on maintenance or new equipment, said John C. Spychalski, professor emeritus of supply chain management at Pennsylvania State University.\u201cIt\u2019s existed hand-to-mouth, patchwork to patchwork, to a great degree,\u201d he said.In an interview with The New York Times this month, Mr. Trump refused to say whether he would support the Gateway tunnel. But Mr. Christie, a Republican who once led Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team and backs the tunnel plan, said recently that he had discussed the project with Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019ve spoken personally to the president about the project many times, and I am absolutely convinced that the president understands the importance of the project,\u201d Mr. Christie told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him talk about this and say that it\u2019s the most important infrastructure project in the country.\u201dStill, Mr. Christie held a news conference recently alongside Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, to urge the new federal transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, to visit New Jersey to see the tunnel\u2019s crumbling walls for herself. A spokeswoman for Ms. Chao said that was on her to-do list.Amtrak\u2019s decision to hire Mr. Moorman, a former chairman of Norfolk Southern, a freight rail operator, was widely praised. After earning millions of dollars in his previous job, Mr. Moorman declined to accept a salary and says he simply wants to help.\u201cIt is a big catch to get a major, experienced, well-respected private sector rail operator,\u201d said Ms. Kanter, the Harvard Business School professor. \u201cThat adds a lot of credibility.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said Amtrak\u2019s recent problems might prompt Congress to offer more support for the railroad.\u201cThe most vexing thing here, that really is just troubling, is this could have been prevented,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in an interview, referring to the derailments.In a letter to Congress in February 2016, Amtrak\u2019s last chief executive, Joseph H. Boardman, warned that the railroad\u2019s \u201coutdated and inadequate infrastructure\u201d must be replaced. After nearly eight years on the job, Mr. Boardman called once more for higher levels of federal investment.The letter was prescient.\u201cMy successor, if he or she is fortunate enough to spend as many years in this position as I have, will not have much time,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto reverse current trends before they adversely affect our performance and the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Armed Civilian Bands in Venezuela Prop Up Unpopular President", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 The bikers thundered up in a phalanx of red jackets and dark clothes, some with faces covered, revving motorcycles before a thousand protesters in Caracas. They threw tear gas canisters to disperse the crowd. Then, witnesses say, they pulled pistols and fired.Someone fell. Carlos Moreno, 17, lay sprawled on the ground, a pool of blood around his head.\u201cHis brain matter was coming out,\u201d recalled Carlos Julio Rojas, a community leader who witnessed the fatal shooting in Venezuela\u2019s capital on Wednesday.The uniformed men who shot Mr. Moreno were not government security forces, witnesses say. Rather, they were members of armed bands who have become key enforcers for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as he attempts to crush a growing protest movement against his rule.The groups, called collectives or colectivos in Spanish, originated as pro-government community organizations that have long been a part of the landscape of leftist Venezuelan politics. Civilians with police training, colectivo members are armed by the government, say experts who have studied them.Colectivos control vast territory across Venezuela, financed in some cases by extortion, black-market food and parts of the drug trade as the government turns a blind eye in exchange for loyalty.Now they appear to be playing a key role in repressing dissent.Hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Caracas and other cities demanding elections in Venezuela. Galvanized by a ruinous economy that has left basic foods and medicines scarce \u2014 as well as a botched attempt by leftists to dissolve the country\u2019s congress last month \u2014 they present the largest threat to the country\u2019s rulers since a coup that briefly ousted Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, in 2002.Mr. Maduro has responded by sending National Guardsmen armed with water cannons and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds. But alongside the security forces, experts and witnesses say, are the enforcers from the colectivos, who engage in fiercer and often deadly intimidation.\u201cThese are the true paramilitary groups of Venezuela,\u201d said Roberto Brice\u00f1o-Le\u00f3n, director of the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, a nonprofit group that tracks crime.The presence of the colectivos hardly ends with demonstrations on the streets.As rising foreign debt and falling world oil prices have depleted the Venezuelan government\u2019s coffers, it has increasingly turned to colectivos as enforcers. From labor disputes with unions to student demonstrations on university campuses, colectivos are appearing almost anywhere the government sees citizens getting out of line, Venezuelans say.Eladio Mata, a hospital union leader, says he was shot last year by colectivo members when negotiations deadlocked with the University Hospital of Caracas.Mr. Mata said he had arrived to the front door of the hospital to find colectivo members blocking it. They were called, he said, by the hospital management. Staff members tried to help him force his way through, he said, but a colectivo member shot him in the back. He was then dragged into an operating room for emergency surgery.\u201cIn this country, it\u2019s prohibited to dissent,\u201d Mr. Mata said.Dr. Oscar Noya, a tropical infectious disease researcher, said his laboratory had been vandalized almost 30 times by colectivo members, who had destroyed equipment and taken electrical cables.Dr. Noya said his repeated complaints to the authorities had been met largely with silence and that the colectivos had \u201creached a level of total impunity.\u201dExperts say the colectivos date to the early days of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who originally conceived them as social organizations to advance his vision of a Socialist revolution to transform Venezuela\u2019s poor neighborhoods. Many had their own names, flags and uniforms. The government eventually handed them arms and security training as well, deploying them as a separate militia.As the groups became more powerful, they exerted their own influence independent of the government, most notably in controlling organized crime like drug trafficking in Caracas barrios.Their power was so great that some even clashed with the police in 2014, part of an effort to oust an interior minister who had sought to curb them. More recently, others have fought deadly shootouts with soldiers in military operations to stop organized crime.Today, the groups control 10 percent of towns and cities in Venezuela, according to Ferm\u00edn M\u00e1rmol, a criminologist at the University of Santa Mar\u00eda in Caracas. Mr. M\u00e1rmol said the deep left-wing ideological bent of the groups means they will defend Mr. Maduro at any cost.\u201cIf tomorrow the revolution loses the presidency, the colectivos will immediately change to urban guerrilla warfare,\u201d the criminologist said.The colectivo bands have been accused of repeated attacks on journalists covering their activities in the streets. However, in rare interviews in the past, group leaders have denied criminal activity and said they primarily defended the leftist cause.Despite their attacks against dissenters, for some poor Venezuelans, the colectivos are a source of order that people have come to accept.On Thursday, in the neighborhood of La Vega, a working-class Caracas area roiled by protests, residents looked on as a band that they identified as members of a local colectivo stopped at a traffic circle during a patrol.Haide Lira, 58, an administrative assistant who lives on the edge of the neighborhood, said clashes between protesters and the colectivos had startled residents. Her sympathies were drifting away from the protesters. \u201cYou don\u2019t push out a government this way,\u201d she said.Of the colectivos, she said: \u201cThey put order where there is disorder. It\u2019s true, they are armed civilians, but what can you do in this upside-down world of ours?\u201dBut their attacks on protesters have traumatized many demonstrators in Caracas, like Mr. Rojas, who witnessed the death of Carlos Moreno, the teenager.The demonstrators, he said, had tried in vain to save Carlos, pushing his limp body onto a motorcycle to be taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.Some of the crowd tried to pursue the assailants, but were restrained by others who said it would be useless, witnesses said.Mr. Rojas, who works with opposition politicians, said he had become used to the attacks, which have long been a fixture of his activism.\u201cThey attack your neighbors when they are in food lines and are identified as opposition members, they attack store owners by making them pay extortions, they attack bakers by taking away part of their production which they later sell on the black market,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not true collectives, or political actors \u2014 they are criminals.\u201dPatricia Torres reported from Caracas, and Nicolas Casey from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

{"Headline": "Bring Back Glass-Steagall? Goldman Sachs Would Love That", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneIt\u2019s getting a fresh look after Gary Cohn, the powerful head of President Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, supposedly told a private gathering of the Senate Banking Committee recently that the Trump administration would be open to the idea. The president has yet to confirm publicly that he would support such legislation.The concept is nothing new, of course. After the stock market crash of 1929, the so-called Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 gave banks a year to choose between commercial banking and investment banking. For the next 66 years, the law more or less stood until Congress repealed it, making de facto what had long been de jure. (Many banks had been violating it for years without consequences.)Then in 2013, a bipartisan group of United States senators \u2014 led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona \u2014 proposed what they called the 21st-Century Glass-Steagall Act with the goal of breaking up banks with assets greater than $50 billion. They argued \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that what caused the 2008 financial crisis was big banks again using their customers\u2019 deposits to take big risks.Their bill went nowhere. They reintroduced it in 2015. It went nowhere again, in large part because it was a bad idea.But here\u2019s the thing: In 1933, separating investment banking from commercial banking was akin to separating a yolk from the white; today, it would be like unscrambling an egg, and about as useful an exercise.The truth is that the most acute problems in the years leading up to the financial crisis occurred in what we would traditionally think of as pure investment banks \u2014 Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Those had generally gone hog wild in the manufacture and sale of squirrelly mortgage-backed securities, billions of dollars of which they allowed to build up on their balance sheets.When the banks\u2019 short-term lenders no longer wanted these assets as collateral for overnight loans, the investment banks could not finance their daily operations and sent up the white flags of surrender. As we all remember, JPMorgan Chase rescued Bear Stearns and Bank of America rescued Merrill Lynch. Both JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America were already in the investment banking and commercial banking businesses when the federal government encouraged them to save the two failing investment banks.It was clear that the path to salvation for the financial system \u2014 at least in 2008 \u2014 was through the big banks that were already in the investment banking business. (The glaring exception was Citigroup, the global commercial bank, which would surely have failed without its government rescue, in large part because of the behavior of its investment bankers in packaging up defective mortgages.)If Ms. Warren had had her way, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s rescue of Bear Stearns and Bank of America\u2019s rescue of Merrill Lynch would have been prohibited. Ironically, if she has her way in the future and investment banking is once again separated from commercial banking, the biggest beneficiary of a new Glass-Steagall law would be the Wall Street firm she surely hates the most: Goldman Sachs, which just happens to be Mr. Cohn\u2019s old firm (and which paid him hundreds of millions of dollars during his 26-year tenure).Unlike JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, Goldman Sachs has no physical retail bank branches and only a sliver of its rivals\u2019 trillions of dollars in deposits. What better way for Mr. Cohn to repay his former colleagues than by endorsing a plan that would virtually eliminate Goldman\u2019s remaining competitors and cause them to spend years, and billions of dollars, going down the rabbit hole of separating their commercial and investment banking businesses? Goldman Sachs would love nothing more than a return to a form of Glass-Steagall.Let\u2019s be clear: The problem on Wall Street is not the size of the banks, their concentration of assets or the businesses they choose to be in. In fact, the big Wall Street banks are global leaders and the envy of competitors \u2014 especially in Western Europe and in Asia \u2014 that are struggling to figure out how to survive in a world of higher capital requirements, less leverage and more rules and regulations.The problem on Wall Street remains one of improper incentives. When people are rewarded for taking big risks with other people\u2019s money, that\u2019s exactly what they will do. It\u2019s a problem made worse when top bankers, traders and executives on Wall Street collectively no longer have enough of their own skin in the game to make a difference to them when the things that they do go awry. They get rich either way.That is what needs to change on Wall Street, not some outdated, cockamamie notion of having the government dictate what businesses Wall Street can be in or how big a bank can be. Chances are that Ms. Warren leaked the news that Mr. Cohn might be willing to support one of her pet projects. That is what savvy politicians do, I guess.What\u2019s unfortunate is that she has yet to figure out that not only is the idea of separating investment banking from commercial banking not the panacea she is hoping it will be, but it is also not something banks\u2019 clients, customers and counterparties want to have happen.The crafty Mr. Cohn is playing the senior senator from Massachusetts for the fool.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Recording Puts Shell\u2019s Nigerian Oil Deal Under a Harsh Light", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Just hours after the Dutch police raided the offices of Royal Dutch Shell last year as part of an investigation into a controversial $1.3 billion Nigerian oil deal, Ben van Beurden, the chief executive of the oil giant, placed a worried call to its chief financial officer.The investigators were \u201cquite forceful and brusque\u201d and \u201crattled a few people,\u201d Mr. van Beurden told the finance chief at the time, Simon Henry, when Mr. Henry returned his call. But Mr. van Beurden said he was also worried about something else: Shell\u2019s own investigators had discovered internal emails that could cast the company in an even more negative light and widen the investigation by drawing in the United States law enforcement authorities.In what he called \u201cloose chatter,\u201d Mr. van Beurden told Mr. Henry \u2014 who had been on leave \u2014 that the emails among employees contained language like, \u201cI wonder who gets a payoff here.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen them,\u201d Mr. van Beurden told Mr. Henry, \u201cbut apparently they were judged to be, y\u2019know, just pub talk in emails, which was stupid, but nevertheless, it\u2019s there.\u201dThe call was recorded and has now been made public, offering a rare window into the murky and intrigue-filled business of international oil dealing. The recording and other aspects of the investigation show a world involving onetime British intelligence operatives and payments made to a former Nigerian oil official to complete a deal.Shell\u2019s worries revolve around a deal in 2011 in which the Anglo-Dutch giant and Eni, the Italian oil company, paid about $1.3 billion to secure a coveted and contested license tract known as OPL 245 in the Atlantic Ocean off Nigeria that is believed to contain large quantities of oil.Since 2014, Italian prosecutors have been investigating whether the money Shell and Eni paid was used to pay off Nigerian officials and whether the companies knew those payoffs would take place.On Monday, Shell said that it knew that some of the money paid to the Nigerian government would be passed on to a company called Malabu Oil and Gas, which claimed the same tract. In an unrelated 2012 civil suit in New York against Malabu, court documents said Malabu\u2019s principal was Dan Etete, a former Nigerian oil minister.On Monday, Mr. Norman, the spokesman for Shell, said in an email that the company assumed it had no choice but to come to a sort of deal with Mr. Etete and Malabu.\u201cOver time, it became clear to us that Etete was involved in Malabu and that the only way to resolve the impasse through a negotiated settlement was to engage with Etete and Malabu, whether we liked it or not,\u201d he wrote, adding that Shell knew that the Nigerian government \u201cwould compensate Malabu to settle its claim on the block.\u201dStill, Mr. Norman said, \u201cwe believe that the settlement was a fully legal transaction\u201d with the government of Nigeria.In a statement on Sunday, Shell said that if it turned out improper payments were made by Malabu or others, \u201cit is Shell\u2019s position that none of those payments were made with its knowledge.\u201d Shell also said it believed that there was no basis to prosecute the company or any current or former employees.Eni has said an internal investigation found no wrongdoing.In the phone call, Mr. van Beurden expressed worries that the internal emails Shell\u2019s investigators had uncovered could draw the attention of the United States Justice Department. In particular, he cited emails written by former members of the British spy agency known as MI6 that Shell had hired. American officials have a reputation for being tough on international bribery cases.Shell should have been \u201cmore open with the D.O.J. than we now find we have been,\u201d he said.Mr. Norman said that Shell had informed the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission of the aid and the results of an internal investigation conducted by the law firm Debevoise and Plimpton.Eni has also faced pressure. Italian prosecutors recently recommended that the two oil companies and officials at Eni, including Claudio Descalzi, its chief executive, stand trial in the case. A judge is expected to decide this year whether a trial will occur.The Eni board has expressed its \u201ctotal confidence\u201d that neither the company nor Mr. Descalzi was involved in illicit conduct. He is expected to be appointed to a second term at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on Thursday.\u201cThis would help to prevent companies from scheming with greedy government officials to get rich at the expense of ordinary people,\u201d the report said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron Wants to Change France. But Will Voters Elect an Unknown?", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byBAGN\u00c8RES-DE-BIGORRE, France \u2014 In the final days before France\u2019s presidential election on Sunday, Emmanuel Macron was tramping through the snow high in the mountains near the Spanish border for a critical campaign stop near this tiny village where his grandparents once lived.With the race exceptionally tight, it seemed an unlikely place for any candidate. Hardly a voter was in sight. Instead, what Mr. Macron later described as a \u201cpilgrimage,\u201d with some 20 journalists in tow, was in part intended to show his human side, to reflect his connection to a \u201cterroir\u201d \u2014 a definable place and personal history \u2014 that French voters could latch onto.With no political party to speak of, and never having held elected office, Mr. Macron, 39, a onetime investment banker and former economy minister, is leading an improbable quest to become modern France\u2019s youngest president. His profile is that of an insider, but his policies are those of an outsider. If the ever-precocious Mr. Macron is to succeed, his first challenge is to sell a product still largely unfamiliar to almost everyone: himself.Mr. Macron is so close to Ms. Le Pen, leader of the National Front, that it is difficult to say who is the front-runner. But Mr. Macron is buoyed by the fact that more than half of French voters support candidates other than those from the traditional, mainstream parties.Mr. Macron has begun a new political movement, En Marche!, which means \u201cForward\u201d or Onward,\u201d that draws from both sides of the political spectrum. He is gambling that his postpartisan philosophy matches the national mood.But the smartest kid in the class is not always the one who wins. Though he has already checked virtually every box required for a successful career among the French elite, Mr. Macron may actually be the kind of change agent France fears.In a runoff \u2014 presuming both he and Ms. Le Pen get through to the final round \u2014 she would be the political placeholder, the vote to preserve or restore a nostalgic (critics say outmoded) vision of France and one that revives nationalism and fans anti-Muslim sentiments. She has expanded her movement by assailing globalization \u2014 the European Union, the loss of French jobs and an influx of migrants.Mr. Macron is the establishment\u2019s anti-establishment candidate. He tilts at sacred cows \u2014 retirement benefits, employee protections \u2014 with an eye toward making France more business-friendly, while professing he will preserve its social safety net. Many question whether he will really be able to do both at the same time.Despite the political risks, Mr. Macron has proudly embraced an unpopular European Union, and preached tolerance toward immigrants and Muslims never beloved in France, and even less so since the 2015 terrorist attacks.Yet he has clearly struck a chord with many voters, despite being \u201can unidentified political object,\u201d as Pascal Perrineau, a political science professor at Sciences Po in Paris, described him.\u201cThis is a man who, certainly, began his career in the Socialist Party, and he says that he is not a centrist,\u201d Mr. Perrineau said. Yet, \u201che is, as he says, from the right and from the left and this is an invention that our political family has not seen before.\u201dThe visit to Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre \u2014 almost four years to the day since Mr. Macron\u2019s grandmother died \u2014 was a chance for the candidate to further define himself. At once sincere and strategic, the excursion was designed to portray him as someone with roots in the \u201creal\u201d France of villages and hard-working rural people.\u201cThe journey I made today brought to mind many memories,\u201d Mr. Macron later told a crowd of 5,000 at an evening rally nearby in Pau, a city of nearly 80,000, adding that it was where he used to reunite with his grandmother, \u201cwhom I loved so much.\u201d\u201cIt was she and my grandfather who for years and years led me to live in Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre, to walk there, to run there, to learn how to bicycle, to ski, to be rooted in our country,\u201d he said.Born and raised in Amiens, about 70 miles from Paris, Mr. Macron is the eldest of three children. Both parents are doctors. He attended a parochial school founded by Jesuits. When he was 15, he met Brigitte Trogneux, a teacher of French and drama with whom he fell in love. About 24 years his senior, she tried initially to discourage him, but he was determined and she was eventually smitten.In a documentary broadcast on the France 3 television network, she recalled the year he went off to finish high school in Paris at the prestigious Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV. \u201cHe called me all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe spent hours on the telephone. Little by little he conquered all my resistance in a manner that was incredible \u2014 with patience.\u201dShe ultimately divorced her first husband and the father of her three children. One of them, a daughter, is working on Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign. The student and his teacher married in 2007.Their love affair was the kind of audacious undertaking that has defined Mr. Macron\u2019s life and career. His sheer drive, his focus and his willingness to leapfrog in a country where most success is built step by step make him more like the entrepreneurs he admires than a typical politician.A product of top schools, including the prestigious Sciences Po and the \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration, Mr. Macron won a coveted place in an elite auditing body at the Finance Ministry before leaving to join the investment bank Rothschild & Company.Although he knew little about investment banking, in four years at the firm Mr. Macron was promoted from director to managing director. He earned nearly 2.9 million euros ($3.1 million) in those years, according to the financial disclosure form from when he was economy minister.By 2014, at 36, he was appointed minister of economy under France\u2019s current Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, before leaving to begin his campaign. His one significant achievement was passage of what became known as the Macron Law, a hodgepodge of economic policies mostly designed to cut red tape and make markets more flexible.Those who have worked closely with Mr. Macron, both in government and in the private sector, are almost uniformly impressed by his grasp and dedication, but some said that at times they felt misled as Mr. Macron pursued his ambitions.Francis Vercamer, a member of the center-right Union of Democrats and Independents, remembers proposing several amendments to the Macron Law in private and said that the economy minister spoke positively about them. But when Mr. Vercamer later brought them up in debate on the legislation, Mr. Macron turned down every one, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it was dishonest because that\u2019s not the right term,\u201d said Mr. Vercamer, who was a vice president of the committee that examined the bill. \u201cBut for someone who comes to a private meeting and says, \u2018This is good,\u2019 and then comes to a public meeting and doesn\u2019t support you and doesn\u2019t give a reason, that\u2019s not worthy of a representative of the Republic.\u201dThe idea of what Mr. Macron represents as a candidate \u2014 a novel amalgam of pro-business and pro-social welfare policies, with an optimistic outlook on France\u2019s future \u2014 often seems to inspire more than Mr. Macron himself.At his recent rally in Pau, the crowd seemed a bit more enthusiastic before he spoke than afterward when some seemed baffled by his lofty proposals. He has been criticized as being technocratic, abstract and sometimes lacking in empathy.The young man called out to the neatly attired former banker, saying he had \u201cnot a penny to pay for a suit like that one.\u201dMr. Macron responded: \u201cThe best way to pay for a suit is to work.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve worked since the age of 16,\u201d the man shot back, in an exchange popularly interpreted as having put Mr. Macron in his place.Mr. Macron\u2019s policy proposals, while numerous, have been assailed as vague and hard to define politically, particularly for a country that thinks in terms of the political left and right.

{"Headline": "Trump Is Said to Abandon Contentious Border Tax on Imports", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration has dropped any support for a so-called border adjustment tax on imports, according to two people who have been briefed on the matter.The tax was intended to be the keystone of a tax reform proposal developed by Republican leaders in the House of Representatives. But it faced immense pushback from influential companies including Walmart and Toyota.If enacted, a border adjustment tax would have effectively imposed significant levies on billions of dollars of imported goods. Retailers in particular would have been hard hit, as products ranging from tires to T-shirts, which are imported from overseas, would have suddenly cost more. Automakers and other manufacturers that rely heavily on foreign parts and supplies would have also been hit.The border tax may be revisited later, one of these people said, but it was shelved ahead of the Wednesday release of the White House\u2019s new tax plan. A White House spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters, did not respond to requests for comment. President Trump had always seemed ambivalent toward the border tax.In a late February interview with Reuters, Mr. Trump said the border tax \u201ccould lead to a lot more jobs in the United States.\u201d But the proposal received a mixed reception among his top aides; whereas chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon supported it, National Economic Council director Gary Cohn opposed it.The change of heart comes as Mr. Trump is rushing to reveal bold policy ideas ahead of the 100th day of his presidency, which falls on Saturday. In a public announcement on Wednesday, Mr. Trump is expected to lay out a broad tax plan that includes lowering corporate taxes to 15 percent.Dropping the border tax intensifies the political challenges of his plan for taxes. Under the plan by House Republicans, it was supposed to offset the revenue lost by other tax cuts. By just lowering corporate taxes, the budget deficit is expected to increase.Increasing the deficit has always been a deal killer for most Republicans in Congress. However, the powerful chairman of the Senate finance committee said Tuesday he was prepared to support President Trump\u2019s plan to cut corporate tax rates to 15 percent even if it added to the budget deficit.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Republican finance committee chairman, is a critical voice on tax issues in Congress and support from him could make the difference in whether members of Congress fall in line and support the president\u2019s proposal.Republicans in Congress have generally been against tax cuts that add to the deficit. But many argue that now is the party\u2019s opportunity to bring sweeping and enduring changes to the tax code.\u201cI\u2019m open to getting this country moving,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. He said that if the tax cut could stimulate the economy, then he was not as bothered by the impact it had on budget deficits. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure we have to go that route, but if we do, I can live with it,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.The comments came as Republican congressional leaders were preparing to huddle with President Trump\u2019s economic team ahead of the administration\u2019s rollout of its tax plan on Wednesday. Mr. Trump has told his staff that he wants to slash the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent even if doing so increased the federal budget deficit.Mr. Hatch, of Utah, said that he was not sure how the Congressional Budget Office would analyze the corporate tax plan that Mr. Trump is expected to propose. Republicans are planning to rely on \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d that accounts for economic growth created by the tax cuts to show that they would not increase the deficit.\u201cWhether 15 percent is the right figure or not, that\u2019s something to be determined,\u201d Mr. Hatch added.Mr. Hatch had expressed skepticism on Monday about such a low corporate tax rate because, under the Senate\u2019s reconciliation rules, changes to the tax code that reduce tax revenue expire after 10 years. Republicans are looking to use this maneuver to pass legislation with a simple majority that does not need to rely on votes from Democrats.Democrats remain vehemently opposed to any tax legislation that offers big tax cuts for the rich. The idea of slashing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent appeared to be a nonstarter with Democrats, who have been critical of Republicans for shutting them out of discussions about tax reform.\u201cWith respect to taxes, getting both sides together is the winning way,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the finance committee.Mr. Wyden said that Mr. Trump should heed the lessons from the failed effort of Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act without input from Democrats. He also warned that using reconciliation to approve tax cuts would not fulfill the president\u2019s promise to make the economy more competitive.\u201cThe track record shows it\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Here Lies a Graveyard Where \u2018East and West Came Together\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported bySingapore JournalNow neglected and overgrown, it offers an incredible array of tombstones, statues and shrines just four miles north of downtown banks, malls and regional headquarters.For years, the 213-acre site was a destination for Halloween thrill seekers and bird watchers, a haven of green in an overcrowded land. But in recent years it has become something much more powerful: a pilgrimage site for Singaporeans trying to reconnect with their country\u2019s vanishing past.That has put Bukit Brown at the center of an important social movement in a country that has rarely tolerated community activism: a battle between the state, which plans to level part of the cemetery, and a group of citizens dedicated to its preservation.Surprisingly, in a culture of relentless modernization, its advocates are scoring some successes in limiting damage to the cemetery and raising consciousness about the island\u2019s colorful history.Built in 1922, Bukit Brown was the final resting place for about 100,000 Singapore families until it was closed in 1972. Its importance is greater than its relatively recent 50-year history implies because many historic graves were relocated there from other cemeteries that were paved over.Add in an abandoned cemetery next door for a prominent Chinese clan, and experts estimate that up to 200,000 graves are sprinkled amid the surrounding rain forests, including those of many of Singapore\u2019s most famous citizens.\u201cYou have to think of the cemetery as an amazing historical archive,\u201d said Kenneth Dean, head of the Chinese studies department at the National University of Singapore. \u201cBut given how things have developed recently, I have deep concerns about how long it will survive.\u201dThose worries have to do with this city-state\u2019s insatiable appetite for land. Singapore\u2019s 5.7 million residents live on 277 square miles, a bit less than the area of New York City, but the land has to accommodate more than a municipality\u2019s needs. It must hold the infrastructure of a country, including military bases, landfills, reservoirs, national parks and one of the world\u2019s busiest airports and harbors.More than 20 percent of the country is built on reclaimed land, leading its two immediate neighbors, Malaysia and Indonesia, to ban the export of sand to Singapore in order to protect their own land. And with plans calling for Singapore\u2019s population to increase to 6.9 million by 2030, land is at a premium.Part of the solution has been to look inward. In 2011, the government decided to smooth out a bend in the island\u2019s north-south highway by cutting through Bukit Brown. Soon after, the government announced that within 40 years the rest would be paved over, too.After watching many of their best-known monuments and neighborhoods leveled over the past decades, Singaporeans began to take action \u2014 a turning point that people here compare to the 1963 destruction of Pennsylvania Station, a Beaux-Arts masterpiece in New York City whose loss catalyzed historic preservation in the United States.One of the first Brownies was Raymond Goh, 54, a pharmacist who used to lead Halloween tours around the cemetery. (As in many parts of the Chinese cultural world, Singapore is obsessed with ghost stories and ghoulish legends.) After a while, Mr. Goh began to read the inscriptions on the tombstones carefully and was surprised at the antiquity of the graves.When the government\u2019s plans were announced in 2011, Mr. Goh and his brother Charles wondered how to save Bukit Brown. They began training other volunteers, including professors familiar with the world of academic research, former journalists who help with public relations and business people who provide community outreach and funding. In other words, it was a cross section of middle-class Singaporeans who felt nostalgic about the lost city of their youth and were eager to better understand their cultural roots.Brownies have guided me through the site several times over the past few months, and I thought it was indeed a marvel. The lush vegetation made us feel cut off from the thriving modern city, while the tombstones were beautiful in their own right, even without explanations.Some are like mini-fortresses, guarded by stone Chinese or British lions, or even Sikh soldiers. Others were decorated with Taoist and Confucian images and symbols. Some told of the dead person\u2019s loyalty to a political party or a lost dynasty.Thanks to explanations by guides like Ian Chong, a professor at the National University of Singapore; Ang Yik Han, an engineer; Fabian Tee, a lawyer; and Claire Leow, a former journalist, I began to understand how this city-state was crucial to the British Empire\u2019s Asian holdings.Many of the tombs were decorated with the distinctive tiles used by longtime Chinese immigrants to these regions, while others showed the strong influence of Malayan culture.\u201cThis is where East and West came together,\u201d Mr. Ang said. \u201cWe are standing at the center of the island, the belly of the dragon, and we can\u2019t let it be cut open.\u201dFor Professor Dean, these tombstones show the rich links between Southeast Asia and specific regions of China. Under his direction, a team of researchers is entering data from the gravestones into databases, allowing the development of maps showing how clans and villages migrated from coastal China to these faraway shores.Recently, one of Professor Dean\u2019s projects received government financing. Although officials refused numerous telephone and fax requests for interviews about the cemetery, they seem to be coming around to understanding its importance.Already, the government has yielded to some of the Brownies\u2019 demands. Originally, 5,000 graves were to be moved, but that number has been reduced to 3,700. And instead of pulverizing the tombstones, they are being cataloged and stored in a warehouse. In addition, the government has set up a heritage-assessment board to review future projects.This willingness to compromise seems to reflect a broader sentiment in a society that has moved so quickly that people feel rootless and without deep ties to their country.During one walk through the cemetery, I met a Ministry of Defense official who asked that only his first name, Pete, be used because of the sensitivity of his position.\u201cOur nation is a young one, and we\u2019ve been so focused on the future that we sometimes forget the past,\u201d he said. \u201cBukit Brown is a huge trove of stories.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Germany Strikes Offshore Wind Deals, Subsidy Not Included", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byOn Thursday, the Danish company Dong Energy, the largest offshore wind developer, won the right to build two large wind projects in the German North Sea with no government subsidies \u2014 a highly symbolic first for the industry.The company will receive the revenues from the electricity generated by the wind farms. German consumers will pay the substantial costs of connecting the wind farms at sea to the power grid.Offshore wind dates back only a quarter-century; developers in Denmark were the first who took to the sea to gain access to wide open spaces and stronger breezes.The industry has always seemed promising because its installations could generate large amounts of electricity without the greenhouse gas emissions produced by coal- or natural-gas-fired plants. In this way, offshore wind projects helped meet governments\u2019 goals for tackling climate change. Costs, though, remained stubbornly high until the past two years.Governments have recently become much more sophisticated at designing auctions to reduce the costs of building offshore wind projects, and that change is forcing developers like Dong to adjust.Last year, highly competitive auctions in Denmark and the Netherlands resulted in low bids from developers such as the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell. The German auction for the two projects to be handled by Dong, called OWP West and Borkum Riffgrund West 2, continued the pattern.In the same auction, a German power company called EnBW won a no-subsidy bid for a project called He Dreiht, and Dong won a third project called Gode Wind 3 with a guaranteed electricity price of 60 euros ($64) per megawatt-hour, a wholesale measure of electricity.In a news release, Dong cited several factors that underpinned its bids. By the time the projects are completed in 2024, the company said, it expects turbine makers to offer a new generation of machines almost double the size of the largest current models.In recent years, turbine makers like General Electric in the United States, Vestas in Denmark and Siemens in Germany have produced larger and more powerful machines up to 600 feet high. That means more power can be produced by fewer windmills, reducing costs.Dong also said that the new sites offered very high average wind speeds and that it can combine the operations with others in the area, further lowering costs.In addition, Dong assumes that electricity prices will rise from current levels, about 40 euros per megawatt-hour.\u201cIf we did not think we would be creating value for our investors, we would not have made this bid,\u201d Tom Lehn-Christiansen, a Dong spokesman, said in a phone interview.Analysts say that the high financial returns that operators like Dong have had in recent years may eventually come under pressure as subsidies decline. Dong and other developers have benefited from guaranteed prices for their power that may be double or more those of current tariffs. Dong says it earned a 16.5 percent return on capital last year.The biggest uncertainty may be future electricity prices. Dong, without disclosing precise figures, says it expects power prices to rise in Europe as nuclear and coal-fired power plants are retired, increasing demand for new sources.Analysts, though, say that fast-growing renewable energy sources like wind and solar may bring electricity prices down.Dong\u2019s German bid may turn into a costly mistake \u201cif their cost reduction or power price assumptions don\u2019t materialize,\u201d Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Sandford C. Bernstein & Company in London, said by email. Because the project is several years away, the company can walk away from the deal if trends do not go its way.The offshore wind industry is expanding beyond its stronghold in northern Europe, and long-term investors such as pension funds are showing increased interest in financing these projects, which can cost $1 billion or more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Top Philanthropists Wield Power Through Their Donations", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersBig philanthropic donations garner big attention. And any criticism of them often comes long after the ribbon-cutting, and even then it can seem churlish. These megadonors are giving money to benefit the public good that they could be spending on jets, estates and club memberships \u2014 or in most cases, more of the above.David Callahan, author of \u201cThe Givers: Money, Power and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age,\u201d published this week by Knopf, sees both sides of the story, with a healthy dose of skepticism. His interest from the first pages is to examine \u201cthe power of philanthropists to shape America.\u201d\u201cJust how much influence are the givers wielding these days, and to what ends?\u201d he writes early on. \u201cHow should we feel about that clout here in the world\u2019s oldest democracy?\u201dHe adds to those questions some statistics he has marshaled. Those on the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans \u2014 all billionaires, not counting the 100 or so billionaires who didn\u2019t make the cut \u2014 have wealth greater than the bottom 61 percent of Americans. The billionaires who have signed the Giving Pledge, which asks them to donate at least half of their fortunes to charities, have wealth equal to all 90,000 foundations in the United States. And for all their donations, they receive healthy tax breaks that the United States Treasury estimated would cost $740 billion in lost tax revenue over the next decade.\u201cAmong all the sectors in our society, philanthropy has the most freedom to take big risks and tackle big challenges,\u201d Mr. Callahan said over lunch in Manhattan this week. \u201cThat\u2019s an advantage of not being accountable to shareholders or voters. You can do whatever you want and take more risk.\u201dPlus, with the New York City school system having an annual budget of close to $25 billion and more than one million students, a quick change isn\u2019t realistic.Mr. Callahan offers critiques of the leading approaches to giving today. And he does so in a way that is highly readable to people who may never have billions (or even millions) to donate to causes. He also shows why the rest of us need to be more skeptical about the praise heaped on big donors.One big point is that philanthropy has changed greatly from the days when wealthy people donated to a museum or hospital and got their name on the wall (though that still happens). The big money now is going to a battle over ideas shaping political discourse, education policy, health care research and more.While Mr. Callahan sees nothing intentionally nefarious in these donations \u2014 even the ones from philanthropists on the other side of the political spectrum from him \u2014 he does want people to be more aware. Whether you side with the conservative funder David H. Koch or his liberal opposite George Soros, both, he asserts, are giving to tax-exempt entities that he calls \u201cde facto partisan attack dogs.\u201d\u201cThe rich are very different from us in their views of policy,\u201d Mr. Callahan said. \u201cThey\u2019re more economically conservative, more socially liberal and more internationalist.\u201d\u201cIt would be one thing if all this philanthropy really reflected the full spectrum of American public opinion,\u201d he added \u2014 but, he says, it doesn\u2019t.For instance, very little philanthropic money was spent on questioning free trade over the past 15 years \u2014 until Donald J. Trump focused on it in his campaign. And when it comes to education, Mr. Callahan said, a lot of dollars have been thrown around that do not address important structural issues.\u201cFor all the education donors out there, very few of them, actually none of them, have sought to challenge the school segregation that underscores a lot of these problems,\u201d Mr. Callahan said. \u201cAll that money has come in and talked a lot about charters and teacher accountability.\u201dHe said that some of the smartest philanthropic money had gone after solvable problems. He singled out Michael R. Bloomberg for his donations aimed at reducing deaths from traffic accidents and tobacco and Mr. Gates for his focus on public health and vaccinations.He took to task billionaires who say issues like climate change are important, but do not accelerate their giving to address the problem now. A private foundation is required to give away 5 percent each year, he noted, but could give a lot more.Even if these super citizens were doing everything right with their giving, Mr. Callahan said he wouldn\u2019t see that as an unalloyed good.\u201cOne of the most concerning issues in this is philanthropy is rising as government is falling,\u201d he said. \u201cOrdinary citizens do not feel like their voice counts. They feel the wealthy have too much power and call the shots. That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s fed the populism of recent years.\u201dMr. Callahan says he thinks there needs to be curbs on the philanthropic power of super citizens. First, their operations and giving need to be more transparent. An easy fix would be to make the grants listed on tax returns public more quickly.Second, he calls for limits to be placed on the tax deductibility of political philanthropy. Whereas a donation made directly to a candidate is not tax deductible, donations to advocacy groups that back candidates and issues allow people to get tax deductions for the whole amount.And third, he calls for greater accountability of foundations, which have enormous latitude with their giving and enjoy many tax benefits. One suggestion is to require boards to become more representative of the people the organizations serve if they want to maintain their tax advantages.As for Mr. Callahan, he gives his philanthropic dollars to think tanks. \u201cI think that\u2019s the highest leverage giving,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can change the narrative and determine what ideas have legitimacy, you can shape the broader debates. I practice what I preach.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What life demands from us is courage. With courage you can face adversity. Obviously, I am dealing with hardship. I had, during my life, to face two coups: one by the military and the other by the Congress. Both of them were extremely difficult. In one there was the physical threat of being jailed and tortured, in the other an even bigger threat for the whole Brazilian population, the rights of its citizens and democracy.If you could turn back time, what would you have done differently? Usually I don\u2019t ask myself this question. Unfortunately we cannot turn back the hand of time. But I can answer in a theoretical way. One thing I would not have done is approve extensive tax cuts. I did that based on the belief that companies would then invest more and generate more jobs. But that was not what happened: The companies increased their profits without investing more. Also, I did not realize clearly that the \u201ccenter,\u201d a crucial part of the democratic body which was essential in the fight against the military dictatorship, was shifting to the right. It became an opposition to my government. It is like the story of the Trojan horse, which brings the enemy inside the city. Not realizing that was indeed a mistake.I don\u2019t think that the sentencing of Eduardo Cunha should be considered a personal revenge. Before he was sentenced, there was a movement in some sectors of the government to save him. The sentencing of Eduardo Cunha does not atone for the fact that this very corrupt person led the impeachment against me. He is the person behind the Dante-esque scene that took place on April 17 of last year.After you were ousted, your successor, President Michel Temer, appointed a cabinet entirely composed of white men. What did you make of that? White, wealthy old men. It is an eminently anti-women government. I am saddened by it, very disheartened. First of all, there was a very misogynist element in the coup against me. They had double standards for men and women. They accused me of being overly tough and harsh, while a man would have been considered firm, strong. Or they would say I was too emotional and fragile, when a man would have been considered sensitive. I was seen as someone too obsessed with work, while a man would have been considered hard-working. There were also other very rude words used. I was called a cow about 600,000 times.In a few months, when President Michelle Bachelet of Chile steps down, all the heads of state in the Western hemisphere will be men. What does that say about the empowerment of women in politics? This is not a coincidence. In politics women are not treated in the same way as men. Women face disproportionate discrimination. This does not mean that women are weak. On the contrary, women are very resilient and very capable.Do you think the Workers\u2019 Party can return to power during next year\u2019s presidential elections? We have a meeting with democracy in 2018. It does not matter who wins, as long as it is a clean game, and as long as this person brings political and economic stability, and the return of growth. But there has to be an election. It is not shameful to lose an election. What is shameful is a person who does not know how to lose an election and accept it. You cannot change the rules of the game while the game is being played.When your obituary is written, what aspect of your legacy do you hope will stand out? We will be remembered for the social policies that we created. It was during my government that we overcame poverty. It was during my tenure that we consolidated the social protection network.

The club had its heyday in the 1960s, when it produced a string of talented young players. It was in the era before the transfer market took off, when commercialism had yet to take hold in the game. In 1964, the club\u2019s manager, Ron Greenwood, had wrapped the F.A. Cup trophy in cloth and taken it home on a London Tube train after the Hammers had beaten Preston North End in the final. Two years later, three members of his team \u2014 Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters \u2014 helped England win the World Cup, snapping the dominance of Pel\u00e9 and Brazil.However, West Ham had dropped out of the Premier League in 2003, the same year that Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea and \u2014 although it returned two years later and continued to produce talented players \u2014 it did not have the financial clout to compete with the biggest English clubs.

The story has its roots in South America, but was also tied to the riches that accompanied the breakup of the Soviet Union and to an Israeli dealmaker called Pini Zahavi, who was never far away from soccer\u2019s biggest transfers.Scudamore was already aware of wealthy individuals buying the transfer rights of players as early as 2000, a year after he took the job at the Premier League. Zahavi had told him all about it.Zahavi was suave and smooth-talking, and had parlayed a career as a soccer journalist in Israel into being a transfer broker. His first deal, while still working as a reporter, had been to take Avi Cohen to Liverpool from Maccabi Tel Aviv in 1979. After 20 years as an agent, he had turned his attention to acting as a dealmaker to help a small group of wealthy individuals, some of them from the former Soviet Union, to invest in the transfer market. He called the business Soccer Investments & Representations.Zahavi\u2019s office was on a tree-lined boulevard near the Mediterranean Sea in Tel Aviv, but he spent much of his working life in five-star hotels across the globe or in his apartment in London\u2019s Marble Arch. He had learned how this South American business model worked from his partners in Argentina: Fernando Hidalgo and Gustavo Arribas. Together they had founded the HAZ agency, which took its name from the first letters of their surnames and used a series of companies domiciled in Gibraltar, Luxembourg and Malta to buy and sell transfer rights. The business was so successful that the three men set up their own motor-racing team in 2006, and even considered entering the Nascar series before one of their drivers died in a 120 m.p.h. crash at the Aut\u00f3dromo Juan Manuel Fangio on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. The sudden and shocking death had ended their appetite to pursue the racing adventure.Zahavi was well known in the Premier League\u2019s offices in London. At Christmas he would send a box of oranges to Scudamore from back home. Over a cup of tea one day, Zahavi told Scudamore that he was moving into owning transfer rights. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not an agent anymore. I own players. I actually own them,\u2019\u201d Scudamore recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s the future.\u201dIn 2001, Zahavi had helped Gustavo Mascardi, the first registered FIFA agent in Argentina, earn as much as half of the $12 million transfer fee Aston Villa paid River Plate for the Colombian striker Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel. Mascardi owned 50 percent of \u00c1ngel\u2019s transfer rights through a company called Siglo XXI (21st Century). Aston Villa almost pulled out of the deal at the last minute after hearing of the unorthodox arrangement, but in the end the signing went ahead.In the spring of 2003, Zahavi was introduced by another soccer agent, Jonathan Barnett, to Chelsea\u2019s chief executive, Trevor Birch, at Les Ambassadeurs, a private club in London\u2019s Mayfair, in a move that would help Zahavi \u2014 with his contacts in the former Soviet Union \u2014 become a broker in the takeover of the then struggling club.While Zahavi and Barnett loved the high life, fine clothes and trappings of success \u2014 like Les Ambassadeurs, which served French Champagne, Belgian chocolates and Cuban cigars \u2014 Birch was a more low-key character. He had a first-class degree in accounting from Liverpool Polytechnic and specialized in corporate restructuring. He was an employee of Ken Bates, a gruff Londoner who had bought Chelsea for 1 pound in 1982.Birch had briefed Zahavi on Chelsea\u2019s financial woes, how it could barely pay the players\u2019 salaries and how Bates wanted to sell up. Zahavi relayed the information to Abramovich. A few weeks later the Russian billionaire, dressed in jeans and accompanied by a Citibank banker and a lawyer from Skadden Arps, came to meet Birch in one of the executive boxes overlooking the pitch at Stamford Bridge stadium. The rendezvous lasted less than an hour and ended with an outline for a deal, which was agreed on a handshake.Chelsea\u2019s executives were stunned by how fast the Russian was moving. They did a Google search on his name but little came up. Still, he seemed to be bona fide and his advisers clearly worked for serious organizations. Three weeks later, on July 1, 2003, contracts were signed and Abramovich became the first Russian owner of a Premier League club.Three years later, two more oligarchs who had been close to Abramovich became involved in the Premier League via a different route. Boris Berezovsky and Arkady Patarkatsishvili took control of the transfer rights of Tevez and Mascherano through a series of offshore companies, and their aides arranged for the Argentines to join West Ham.According to The Observer newspaper, which secured a rare interview with Zahavi that year, he acted as an adviser to West Ham in the deal just as he had done for Abramovich in his acquisition of Chelsea.Berezovsky, a mathematician, had built his fortune after the fall of the Soviet Union by investing in Lada cars and Aeroflot planes. After surviving a car bomb that decapitated his driver, he masterminded Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s rise to the presidency in 2000. But once Putin was in power, he vowed to get rid of the oligarchs for meddling in politics, forcing Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili to flee to Britain with their fortunes.Initially, the exiled oligarchs\u2019 link to the two Argentine players was not known. West Ham did not disclose the terms of the agreement, instead employing the clich\u00e9d patter of English soccer. The Hammers said that Tevez and Mascherano had \u201cput pen to paper\u201d on permanent contracts and that all other details would remain confidential.However, there was more going on behind the scenes. A couple of days earlier, West Ham\u2019s legal and commercial director, Scott Duxbury, had called the Premier League\u2019s secretary, Jane Purdon, to make an inquiry about the possibility of signing two players whose transfer rights were owned by offshore companies. The companies, Duxbury said, wanted the players to join West Ham free of charge should the club agree to allow them freedom to move them on. Purdon said the arrangement would breach league rules that forbade any third party having influence over the buying or selling of players. She advised Duxbury against the transaction.The next day, Purdon spoke to him again and asked if there were any third parties involved in the signings. Duxbury ducked that question, according to Purdon\u2019s comments in the minutes of a Premier League hearing. \u201cHe did not say yes, he did not say no,\u201d Purdon recalled. \u201cHe merely replied that all documents required for registration had been provided. In doing so, he was in the belief that no rule had been broken.\u201dWhen Scudamore personally went to West Ham to hear the club\u2019s version of events, Aldridge sought to calm him. He said there was nothing untoward. Investors were going to buy the club and therefore they were just placing these players there in anticipation of the sale.Scudamore, whose organization had no power to raid the club\u2019s files, went back to the Premier League\u2019s office and fumed. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve worked with these people for so long, when you\u2019ve looked them in the eye and asked them a direct question, you get a direct answer,\u201d Scudamore said. \u201cThere\u2019s really not a lot more you can do.\u201dIf the oligarchs had been passive investors in the two players, West Ham would have complied with the rules, but it would become clear that they had complete control over the next transfer of the Argentines. According to Premier League rules, that was not allowed. Third parties could not acquire the right to \u201cinfluence\u201d the policies or performance of teams.The companies in the British Virgin Islands that controlled where the Argentines played next were owned by Patarkatsishvili, although Berezovsky said they were a joint venture with him under a series of gentlemen\u2019s agreements they had embarked on together. They had previously held stakes in a Russian car dealership, the oil company Sibneft and the Kommersant newspaper.The two men now lived in exile in mansions a 20-minute drive from each other in the Surrey commuter belt west of London. Berezovsky lived in Ascot, in an ivy-clad home with its own lake and manicured lawn. Patarkatsishvili, who had a distinctive white handlebar mustache, resided in an even grander pile with chandeliers, gold fittings and ornate sculptures.Under the deal that the two oligarchs had financed, West Ham would be a temporary home for Tevez. The club, which was founded by workers from a shipyard at the end of the 19th century, would get \u00a32 million, about $4 million at the time, should he be transferred in the January transfer window. After that, the compensation would fall to \u00a3100,000. West Ham would get \u00a3150,000 on the transfer of Mascherano.Patarkatsishvili had appointed Kia Joorabchian, a young businessman to head up their soccer operation. Joorabchian was raised in Britain and had helped his Iranian father run car dealerships in Essex and Kent. In what Time magazine called a \u201csurreal\u201d sale, the businessman in his early 30s was part of an offshore group that battled with Berezovsky for control of Kommersant. According to Joorabchian\u2019s version of events, he sued the oligarch over the sale before they agreed to settle out of court. \u201cThat\u2019s how I met Boris Berezovsky,\u201d he said.Joorabchian then moved to S\u00e3o Paulo to manage Corinthians, one of Brazil\u2019s biggest soccer clubs, on behalf of the oligarchs. Patarkatsishvili\u2019s London-based Media Sports Investments had agreed to pay $35 million to take control of the team for 10 years in return for a share of the team\u2019s profits from marketing and buying and selling players. As part of the deal, Media Sports Investments would get 51 percent of the net profit from television revenue, sponsorships and ticket sales, and 80 percent of transfer fees. Joorabchian hired Tevez from Boca Juniors and Mascherano from River Plate.Tevez\u2019s arrival thrilled Corinthians fans, who were surprised that such a big-name player had arrived on their doorstep. At $16 million he was the most expensive player ever signed by a Brazilian club. He delighted them with a never-say-die attitude that yielded 46 goals in 78 games. Tevez would celebrate each goal enthusiastically, at one point pulling a pacifier from his sock and sucking on it to mark the birth of his child.Using the wealth of the oligarchs, Corinthians went shopping in European soccer and added other prominent players to its squad, including Nilmar from Lyon, Gustavo Nery from Werder Bremen and Carlos Alberto Gomes de J\u00e9sus from Porto. The team swept to the Brazilian league title.With Tevez\u2019s form pushing up his market price and triggering interest from clubs abroad, Joorabchian\u2019s job was to extract the highest possible fee for the investment fund\u2019s biggest asset. He announced that the striker would leave Corinthians only if another team paid the release clause in his contract of between \u00a369 million and \u00a383 million. Even the lowest amount would have been a world record transfer fee. There was no suitor willing to hand over such an enormous sum, and so he ended up at West Ham.The memory of the Tevez and Mascherano affair remains painful for Scudamore a decade later. \u201cI can give you dates, I can give you times,\u201d Scudamore said, sitting at a table in his glass office that looks out at the Premier League\u2019s headquarters in a smart townhouse in London\u2019s West End. The office, with a small plaque next to the black front door, could pass for that of a law firm or accounting practice.In Scudamore\u2019s opinion, West Ham executives broke the rules because they were blinded by the possibility of deep-pocketed owners buying the club. \u201cWhat was more tantalizing was the acquisition of the club\u201d as opposed to the Argentine stars, Scudamore said. West Ham officials were probably \u201cjust so wrapped up in the idea of new owners, and becoming key in the new ownership structure.\u201dIn the end, neither Patarkatsishvili nor Berezovsky bought West Ham. A few weeks later, Brown, the club\u2019s owner, sold his majority stake to a group from Iceland. Mascherano was traded to Liverpool, earning the oligarchs \u00a318 million. A Premier League panel then issued West Ham with a record fine of \u00a35.5 million, though it stopped short of handing down a points deduction.To Scudamore\u2019s horror, the fallout continued. As the season reached its climax, Tevez found his form to boost West Ham\u2019s battle to avoid relegation. He scored seven goals in the last 10 games of the season, including the only one in a 1-0 win on the last day of the season at Manchester United, which kept West Ham in the top division. Tevez\u2019s goal meant that Sheffield United was relegated instead, and its coach, Neil Warnock, raged that Scudamore should be fired.That single goal by Tevez made the affair \u201cseismic rather than containable,\u201d Scudamore said. Sheffield United immediately challenged the Premier League\u2019s decision not to dock points from West Ham.As the scandal was unfurling, Berezovsky was wrestling with dark thoughts at his home in London\u2019s commuter belt. He was feeling glum about how he had to flee Russia and how he had fallen out with Abramovich, who he felt had forced him into selling Sibneft, his oil company, below the market price. While the Chelsea owner had left Russia on a high, the former mathematician was pushed out of his country against his will. Now Abramovich, a high school dropout, was the 15th wealthiest person in the world \u2014 worth $24 billion according to Forbes magazine \u2014 and had just led Chelsea to its first English league title in half a century, endearing himself to fans. Berezovsky was at 897th on the rich list, with $1.3 billion.Berezovsky could console himself that he was on course to make more money from soccer. Abramovich\u2019s Chelsea had not posted a profit in each of the five years since he took charge. The London club was hemorrhaging money in the race to win trophies: In the year ending June 2007 alone, Abramovich had to soak up its loss of \u00a375 million.Berezovzky\u2019s bet with Patarkatsishvili to buy Brazil\u2019s Corinthians was much cheaper and, despite the Premier League hullabaloo with the Tevez affair, they were now on course to turn a handsome profit by trading him for many times the $16 million they paid for him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conservative Split Over Import Tax Imperils Trump\u2019s Overhaul", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byAll three organizations share a common lineage: They are part of the political network overseen by Charles D. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative businessmen. Now they are among a host of conservative organizations mounting a furious campaign against a new tax on imports proposed by House Republicans, imperiling what is supposed to be a centerpiece of the Republican tax overhaul effort.Their opposition threatens yet another rupture with President Trump, some of whose advisers see the provision as a critical way to bring about tax reform while protecting American manufacturers.The battle could not only jeopardize Mr. Trump\u2019s second major legislative initiative, but also redefine the boundaries of conservative economic policy. Much like the failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the import tax is dividing conservatives, the business sector and some of the deepest-pocketed groups funding conservative politics. Along the way, it is exposing the broader ideological divide between nationalist policies embraced by Mr. Trump and the traditional small-government movement that his election ejected from the driver\u2019s seat of Republican policy-making.\u201cTrump ran on a different set of economic issues than traditional conservative Republicans have,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation who favors the border tax on intellectual grounds, but said he had come to see it as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d for broader tax reform.\u201cThe baton has been passed on from Reagan to Trump,\u201d Mr. Moore continued, \u201cand there\u2019s no doubt he ran on a much more populist economic message.\u201dThe idea of a border adjustment tax has percolated among academic economists and in think tanks since the 1970s, as the United States has considered ways of harmonizing its tax code with countries that use value-added taxes. Central to the plan is a provision that would tax imports at a rate of 20 percent while exempting exports from taxation. In theory, this would buttress domestic manufacturing, make American products more competitive with foreign goods and encourage American companies to bring home cash they have been parking overseas.\u201cIt is a simple and elegant way to get good tax compliance,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist and president of the right-leaning American Action Forum, a nonprofit tied to a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that backs House Republicans.Some conservatives oppose it for the same reason: In their view, such a tax would be too easy to increase, with the potential costs to Americans hidden behind rising prices.The Koch network and groups like the Club for Growth, which for years have targeted what they call \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d in Washington, have opposed the border tax as an unnecessary tax increase and a form of favoritism that would hurt the economy. But Mr. Trump and his team have pledged to target what they see as a more insidious kind of cronyism, including unfettered free trade that some Trump advisers say benefits wealthy elites at the expense of American workers.The dispute echoes Mr. Trump\u2019s battles with his party last year, when the Club for Growth, a group of wealthy conservatives that backs anti-tax candidates in Republican primary races, financed a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign against him. The Koch network, uncomfortable with Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals on trade and immigration, sat out the presidential election entirely, turning its advertising dollars and activists to down-ballot races.Now, some of the same groups are organizing visits to lawmakers and paying for an online advertising campaign attacking the border tax proposal.The roster includes Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network\u2019s flagship political advocacy group; the Libre Initiative, which is aimed at Latinos; and Generation Opportunity, which focuses on young adults. In 2015, the most recent year for which tax returns are available, the three groups took in a combined $34 million from Freedom Partners, an umbrella group representing the Kochs and other donors who pool money for political and educational initiatives.Americans for Prosperity is calling on Mr. Trump to rely more on spending cuts, rather than on a border adjustment tax, to finance the tax overhaul. The group\u2019s list of proposals include indexing Social Security benefits to a different measure of inflation \u2014 a popular idea in conventional conservative circles but one that could violate Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to protect the program\u2019s beneficiaries.\u201cWhen you look at the network broadly, we\u2019re all guided by the same vision,\u201d said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to be active on the major policy decisions that are happening in Washington.\u201dMore recently, Koch has circulated studies indicating that the tax would increase the price of gasoline, which the company says would lift its profits in the short term but harm the economy in the long term.Philip Ellender, a top executive at the company, said in an interview that Koch Industries was lobbying against the new tax out of principle, not for profit.\u201cIn the short term, Koch would profit handsomely from it,\u201d Mr. Ellender said. His summary of the company\u2019s case against the tax: \u201cIt would stifle free trade, it picks winners and losers, and it raises prices on consumers so that corporations can get a tax break.\u201dThe debate has divided the White House, too.A profusion of strategic and political motives also divides Republicans on the issue. To enact a tax overhaul that does not increase the federal deficit but delivers rate cuts to wealthy taxpayers and corporations, Mr. Trump and Congress need to find some source of new revenue \u2014 hence the border tax. For Mr. Ryan, who holds more conventional free-trade views than Mr. Trump, the new tax provides a way to satisfy Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist impulses without imposing punitive, and potentially even more disruptive, tariffs.But some conservatives are not so sure. In opposing the tax, Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Walmart\u2019s home state, Arkansas, finds himself in the position of defending his local corporate giant and the conservatism that he thought he knew.\u201cMost conservatives I know have long believed that tax reform would look at all of the carve-outs in the tax code,\u201d Mr. Cotton said, \u201cnot introduce a whole new concept of taxation.\u201dAn article on Sunday about tax reform efforts supported by conservative groups referred incorrectly to one proposal for indexing Social Security benefits. The proposal includes indexing those benefits to a different measure of inflation, not to inflation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Visit to the Met Could Cost You, if You Don\u2019t Live in New York", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byThe museum, grappling with a multimillion-dollar budget deficit, has been quietly talking to city officials for a year about a mandatory fee for nonresidents. But thorny questions still must be resolved, like how to verify that visitors are not New Yorkers, whether it is fair to charge people who work in the city or are from the suburbs and what amount would be required.The move could also have unintended consequences for municipal financing of the museum, for its reputation as a public institution, for tourism and even for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s re-election campaign.At a news conference, Mr. de Blasio said he thought it would be \u201cfair\u201d to impose a fee if it specifically affected \u201cnon-city residents.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Russian oligarchs paying more to get into the Met,\u201d he said.Yet the possibility of distinguishing among visitors \u2014 and even of making the admission \u201csuggested\u201d for city residents but required for state residents \u2014 risks alienating tourists and New Yorkers alike, especially if people see the fee as a way for the Met to solve financial and governance missteps that have led to a budget deficit of about $15 million. Met leaders have resorted to cost-cutting moves, including trimming staff and reducing the number of annual exhibitions to about 40, from nearly 60; a fee would establish the kind of large and consistent revenue stream that private museums already enjoy.Unlike several Manhattan museums that charge admission, the Met is considered a public museum: New York City owns its building and also gives the museum $26 million a year \u2014 the largest amount that the city provides to an arts institution. Still, the city\u2019s appropriation to the Met covers just about 8 percent of the museum\u2019s $332 million annual operating costs.The Met\u2019s current \u201csuggested\u201d adult admissions fee, $25, generated about $39 million in the fiscal year 2016, or 13 percent of the museum\u2019s overall revenue. A mandatory fee would be likely to generate tens of millions of dollars more a year, providing a much-needed shot in the arm.Should the Met earn these additional millions, the city might become more inclined to shift public money to other arts groups, a prospect that city officials are now considering as part of a new Cultural Plan, to be released soon. The city may view the Met\u2019s new income as a replacement for its public dollars, which could be risky if admission fees prove less reliable than annual city funding.But the mayor said Wednesday that an admission fee would not necessarily jeopardize city support.\u201cI don\u2019t think we have an assumption about city funding,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cIt\u2019s about them being able to sustain their operations long term and would actually mean they wouldn\u2019t need additional city funding, in theory. But no, the real issue is just to allow them to defray some of their costs in a way that\u2019s fair to city residents.\u201dThe Met board and the mayor will both have to agree on an admissions fee and navigate the symbolic shoals of making a taxpayer-supported institution no longer free to all.The discussions about an admissions fee come at a precarious time for the Met. The Met\u2019s director, Thomas P. Campbell, resigned under pressure in February, and the board of trustees has been criticized for poor oversight.Daniel H. Weiss, the Met\u2019s president and its acting chief executive, acknowledged this week that the museum is \u201clooking at everything to bridge our budget deficit, including the pricing structure we have with the city, which is something we have done throughout our history.\u201dMr. Weiss issued a statement on Wednesday after the mayor endorsed the fee idea for nonresidents.\u201cWe are very pleased to be working with Mayor de Blasio and his team,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. \u201cThis is a strong partnership. They want what\u2019s best for the city and the museum, as do we. We look forward to working with the mayor in the months and years ahead.\u201dThe Met\u2019s discussions with the city \u2014 which people inside the museum and city government recently confirmed to The Times \u2014 had been confidential, since the issue is considered so sensitive. There is great importance attached to the idea of the city\u2019s pre-eminent museum remaining free to enter, even though the Met has for more than four decades had a suggested admission fee. The 1893 law providing state support to the museum mandated that its collections \u201cshall be kept open and accessible to the public free of all charge throughout the year.\u201dDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by over 6,000 years of history at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. We\u2019re here to help.There are models for admissions fees at public museums: Entry to the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris, for example, is free to residents of the European Union younger than 26; others have to pay 15 euros, or about $16. Institutions like the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum charge $25 for adults, and the Whitney Museum of American Art $22.\u201cI\u2019m not opposed to museums and cultural institutions charging out-of-city residents,\u201d said Jimmy Van Bramer, the majority leader of the City Council and the chairman of its Cultural Affairs Committee, who said he was unaware of the Met talks. \u201cWhen I go to Paris and Madrid and the Pergamon in Berlin, I expect to pay.\u201dMoreover, the political optics of instituting an admissions fee could impact Mayor de Blasio\u2019s re-election campaign, especially if the museum is seen as gouging tourists or reversing a historic principle of making a cultural institution free to the public.\u201cThis risks being a classic case of \u2018penny wise and pound foolish,\u2019\u201d said Mark Green, the former New York City public advocate. \u201cRevenue is good, but so is our reputation of being a tourist-welcoming city.\u201dThe talks between the Met and the city are taking place as the de Blasio administration prepares in the next couple of weeks to release a draft report of the city\u2019s first Cultural Plan, which would manage and organize the city\u2019s resources for arts groups. A 2016 law passed by the City Council requires the city\u2019s Department of Cultural Affairs to present the plan to the council by July 1.This process has included a re-evaluation of the financing formula that for years has dictated how much each of the 33 organizations on city-owned land that make up the Cultural Institutions Group receive to help cover basic costs like security, maintenance and energy. The city also provides funding for building projects from a separate budget.Given Mayor de Blasio\u2019s focus on equal access, many arts groups are concerned that the new cultural plan will markedly redistribute the city\u2019s $181.2 million arts budget, directing somewhat less to large institutions like the Met and more to smaller institutions.A change in the Met\u2019s admissions policy could also have an impact on tourism, which both museum and city officials are taking into account.Christopher Heywood, a spokesman for NYC & Company, the city\u2019s tourism organization, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough information on this at this point to make a relevant comment.\u201dUnder the legal settlement, which awaits final court approval, the Met agreed to tell visitors on its signage and websites that \u201cthe amount you pay is up to you\u201d and to describe the $25 full-admission charge as \u201csuggested\u201d instead of \u201crecommended.\u201dIn addition to making cuts, the Met has been trying to build revenue \u2014 in part by improving its retail shops, which were formerly losing money. The prospect of charging admission could represent a significant infusion of income when the museum needs it most.\u201cWhatever we do is going to be collaborative and mutually supportive,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. \u201cAll we\u2019re doing is exploring.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly the relationship between the Metropolitan Museum of Art and New York City. The city owns the Fifth Avenue building that houses the museum; it does not own the museum.William Neuman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Le Pen Aide Is Fired Over Holocaust Comments", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The interim leader that Marine Le Pen chose to run her far-right party while she ran for the presidency has been forced to step down because he praised a Holocaust denier and expressed doubt that the Nazis used poison gas to murder Jews.Ms. Le Pen called the outrage directed at Mr. Jalkh a \u201cdefamation\u201d on Friday morning.The negative news, however, was somewhat offset by day\u2019s end, when Ms. Le Pen got an endorsement from a defeated right-wing presidential candidate, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, who won less than 5 percent of the vote nationwide.\u201cMarine Le Pen is not on the far right to me,\u201d he said.Ms. Le Pen is one of two candidates to advance to the second round of the presidential race, and announced on Monday that she would temporarily step down as National Front leader to focus on defeating the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, considered to be the favorite in the election on May 7.Revelations that Mr. Jalkh, who is also a member of the European Parliament and a vice president of the National Front, had praised a Holocaust denier quickly prompted the party to react, fearful that his comments might cast a shadow on Ms. Le Pen\u2019s campaign.Mr. Aliot said on BFMTV that Mr. Jalkh wanted to \u201cdefend himself; he\u2019s going to press charges because he believes that his honor is being sullied.\u201dFew of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s voters are expected to switch to Ms. Le Pen. But high abstention in their ranks could favor her.\u201cYou don\u2019t need me to tell you what you have to do,\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said, before adding that he would organize the coming legislative elections for his movement, Unbowed France, without saying whether he would run in those contests.It was difficult to estimate the impact of Mr. Jalkh\u2019s Holocaust denial on Ms. Le Pen\u2019s campaign, which has centered thus far on a bitter competition between Ms. Le Pen\u2019s protectionist views and Mr. Macron\u2019s support for globalization and the European Union. The economy is at the top of the country\u2019s priorities and security is also a major issue.While Ms. Le Pen was still trailing in opinion polls, which forecast that she would not get more than 38 to 40 percent of the votes, her campaign had gained momentum after the first round.\u201cFrench politics are not only about the Holocaust. It\u2019s an important topic, because it has to do with the memory of the Second World War, but it\u2019s not an everyday issue when you are president,\u201d Jean-Yves Camus, a scholar of far-right politics and director of the Observatory of Radical Politics at the Jean Jaur\u00e8s Foundation, told the Anglo-American Press Association on Thursday.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Congress Made Taxes Fairer", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byOpinionThat bill\u2019s success relied on a clear set of principles, a committed president, an effective Treasury secretary, bipartisan support and congressional committee chairmen willing to put their reputations on the line. Few of those pieces seem in place today, and the Trump administration hasn\u2019t even begun to face the trade-offs necessary to cut rates without increasing the deficit or widening the gap between rich and poor. But perhaps the lessons of the past show a way forward.After World War II, federal tax rates rose steadily, loopholes proliferated, and the tax code grew more complex. By the 1980s, its unfairness was indisputable. Middle-class taxpayers shouldered the burden for the wealthy, who often paid little tax. Republicans liked lower rates, and Democrats wanted loopholes closed, but no one had put the two together. So how did we make that combination?It took years of work. In 1983, Representative Dick Gephardt of Missouri and I introduced a tax reform bill that cut rates and closed loopholes, one I outlined in a 1984 book, \u201cThe Fair Tax.\u201d I tried to sell the idea to Walter Mondale, the Democratic presidential nominee, but he rejected it. President Ronald Reagan, however, worried that Mr. Mondale might embrace reform and seize the initiative on cutting tax rates, so he asked the Treasury Department to study the issue and report back after the election.The department\u2019s first study called for rate cuts and closing loopholes. The latter was predictably savaged by special interests. A subsequent, watered-down but still useful report offered a framework based on four principles: equity, so that equal incomes paid equal taxes; efficiency, to let the market allocate resources more freely; simplicity, to reduce loopholes; and fairness, to ensure that those who have more income pay more tax.In 1985, President Reagan met in the West Wing with a bipartisan group of senators \u2014 not unusual in those days. I jokingly told the president that he and I backed reform for different reasons: As an actor, he\u2019d paid a marginal rate of 90 percent; as a professional basketball player, I\u2019d been a depreciable asset. We all agreed that the system was broken.The task of getting the president\u2019s bill passed fell to Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Bob Packwood, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. It was tough sledding in the House, where all revenue bills start. After failing to eliminate a tax break for banks, the bill stalled. But Mr. Rostenkowski persevered, and thanks to his clout and deal making, a bill limped to the Senate. It was far from what Mr. Reagan wanted, but he\u2019d urged House Republicans to support it to \u201ckeep the process alive.\u201dSenator Packwood held 33 days of hearings before rewriting the bill in committee. Things took a familiar route: Lobbyists swarmed the halls outside the hearing room, which the press called \u201cGucci Gulch.\u201d Because the committee didn\u2019t follow the Treasury Department\u2019s four principles, there was no rationale to resist the lobbyists. So the business deduction for excise taxes, benefits for the timber industry, the capital gains exclusion and other loopholes went untouched, making it impossible to lower rates without increasing the deficit. An unnamed White House source called reform \u201cmoribund,\u201d and Mr. Packwood abandoned the fight.Then, over a beer with his chief of staff at the Irish Times pub, Senator Packwood decided to give the bill-writing one more chance. But this time he decided to embrace Treasury\u2019s principles and to do the work in private.Mr. Packwood convened three Republican and three Democratic Finance Committee members in his office. He knew we had to act fast before the special interests got organized. We met every morning from 8 to 11 during one week and for 10 hours on Saturday. When we disagreed on what to do about a loophole or rate reduction, we\u2019d vote. Sometimes the winning side had three Democrats and one Republican, sometimes three Republicans and one Democrat. Whatever the outcome, we supported the majority.With seven respected committee members backing the bill, Bob Packwood cajoled, threatened and persuaded others on the committee to embrace it, outmaneuvering senators who wanted higher rates and real estate lobbyists eager to protect tax shelters. There were a few perilous moments. We came up short on revenue at one point, increasing the deficit in a supposedly revenue-neutral bill. Initially we missed our agreed income-distribution goals. But in the end, the bill passed committee 20 to 0; and then, after a big battle on I.R.A.s, it passed the Senate 97 to 3. That kind of vote really used to happen.As a conference committee then negotiated differences between the House and Senate bills, Representative Rostenkowski hovered large. Like Senator Packwood, he wanted to show he was a chairman who could complete what Washington insiders said was impossible. He called in chits, delivering reluctant Democrats.The final bill chopped the top rate to 28 percent from 50 percent, closed nearly $100 billion a year in loopholes, taxed labor and capital at the same rate, and gave low-income Americans one of the biggest tax cuts of their lives. Most people got to save more of every dollar they earned, corporations were treated more equally, and the wealthy ended up paying a higher share of total income tax revenue because they\u2019d benefited disproportionately from the loopholes we\u2019d eliminated.Treasury Secretary Jim Baker\u2019s role was critical, particularly on corporate tax changes. High-paying companies benefited from a rate cut to 34 percent, but those who lost loopholes and paid higher taxes \u2014 real estate, oil and gas, and some manufacturing industries \u2014 would appeal. Secretary Baker had to back up the \u201cno\u201d that they\u2019d heard from Mr. Packwood and Mr. Rostenkowski. He knew that the president\u2019s goal was lower rates and that giving up loopholes was the way to get them. A man of substance and political smarts, he knew, as they said in his home state of Texas, when to hold and when to fold.Throughout, the press played a positive role. Its scrutiny was a bulwark against special interests. More important were the tireless staff members who knew the arcane details of tax policy and were savvy enough to understand the explosive political terrain.In the end, the Tax Reform Act upheld the general interest over the special interests, showing that clear principles, legislative skill and persistence could change a fundamentally unfair system.After it was over, the team gathered at the White House on a bright October afternoon as President Reagan signed the bill. But Senator Packwood and I were stuck by chance in Oregon campaigning \u2014 he for re-election and I for the Democratic candidate for governor \u2014 and fog made us miss our flight back to Washington. Yet, at Mr. Packwood\u2019s suggestion, we did our own news conference. Bipartisanship then was something to be proud of.Over the years, bill after bill has chipped away at the changes we made, and people today once again see unfairness everywhere in the code. Tax liability appears to be totally random. Loopholes cost over $1 trillion, and equal incomes don\u2019t pay equal taxes. The question is the same as in 1986: Can our leaders put principle and country over politics and party, and work together for the common good?Given the extreme polarization within and between the parties, the odds are against success. Legislating is a very human experience in which trust and mutual respect play critical roles. But 1986 proved that when both are present, big things can get done.Bill Bradley, a former Democratic senator from New Jersey, is a managing director at Allen & Co. and host of \u201cAmerican Voices\u201d on SiriusXM Radio.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Atrocities Mount in Syria, Justice Seems Out of Reach", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byISTANBUL \u2014 The evidence is staggering.Three tons of captured Syrian government documents, providing a chilling and extensive catalog of the state\u2019s war crimes, are held by a single organization in Europe. A Syrian police photographer fled with pictures of more than 6,000 dead at the hands of the state, many of them tortured. The smartphone alone has broken war\u2019s barriers: Records of crimes are now so graphic, so immediate, so overwhelming.Yet six years since the war began, this mountain of documentation \u2014 more perhaps than in any conflict before it \u2014 has brought little justice. The people behind the violence remain free, and there is no clear path to bring the bulk of the evidence before any court, anywhere.But so far, only a handful of war-crimes investigations are being pursued by judicial authorities in Europe, and all the suspects in those cases are at large.No cases have gone to the International Criminal Court. Syria never joined it, so the court\u2019s chief prosecutor cannot start an investigation on her own. The United Nations Security Council could refer a case to the court, but Russia has repeatedly used its veto power to shield Syria from international condemnation. And even if the Council were to take action, President Bashar al-Assad and his top officials are battened down in Damascus, making their arrests difficult, to say the least.As Mr. Assad has consolidated his control of Syria\u2019s major cities, some countries that have long opposed him have signaled a new willingness to accept his rule as the fastest way to end the war, encourage refugees to go home and accelerate the fight against the jihadists. As bad as Mr. Assad may be, some argue, Syria would be worse without him.Mr. Assad\u2019s opponents counter that keeping a head of state with so much blood on his hands perpetuates the war.The chemical attack was just his most recent atrocity, after years of torture, enforced disappearances, siege warfare and indiscriminate bombing of civilian neighborhoods and hospitals. The violence will continue as long as Mr. Assad and his security apparatus remain, his enemies say.Syria\u2019s war has seen atrocities by all sides. Rebels have shelled civilian neighborhoods, and the jihadists of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have deployed suicide bombers, tortured enemies and executed prisoners, often on video.But the largest number of violations by far has been by the Syrian government and its allies, investigators say, because they wield the apparatus of the state, including a formal military with an air force, extensive security services and networks of prisons.The Syrian government portrays the conflict as an international conspiracy to destroy the country and equates all opposition with foreign-backed terrorism. It denies that its forces have used chemical weapons or committed atrocities.\u201cThese are allegations,\u201d Mr. Assad said. \u201cWhat are the facts?\u201dThe United Nations commission, in a report last year, quoted a defector from an intelligence agency as saying officers had orders to arrest male demonstrators between the ages of 16 and 40; another defector described his training in techniques that detainees have described, like beatings with cables, hanging by the wrists and electrocution.Dozens of people over the years have told The Times in detail about their arrests and detentions and the disappearances of their relatives into the maw of the security system, from early 2011 to this month.The arrests cut across political and socioeconomic lines. Yahya and Ma\u2019an Sharbaji, two brothers, were arrested with a friend, Ghiath Matar, in September 2011, after leading protests in Daraya, a Damascus suburb. They had been part of a Muslim student group arrested years before for activities like holding discussions on liberalizing Islam and working for peaceful change. Mr. Matar\u2019s body was returned to his family with signs of torture; the Sharbaji brothers have not been seen since, according to the family.In September 2012, Abdelaziz al-Khair, a leftist dissident, disappeared with his stepson Maher Tahan while leaving the Damascus airport, having flown in from abroad for an opposition conference.His wife, Fadwa Mahmoud, has teamed up with Mr. Sharbaji\u2019s sister Bayan, and other women with missing family members, to fight for the rights of the detained and disappeared.About 100,000 Syrians are still detained or missing, Ms. Mahmoud said in an interview, which affects perhaps a million family members. When men disappear, women, in a society with laws that privilege male authority, are left in limbo.\u201cThey cannot grieve, they cannot remarry, they cannot sell property, the family has lost their breadwinner,\u201d she said.It is rare to meet a Syrian refugee family that does not have a detained or disappeared member, and rarer still to find a former detainee who has not been tortured, said Sareta Ashraph, until recently the chief analyst for the United Nations commission.K.K., a lawyer, was arrested in 2014, two years after he participated in a demonstration \u2014 with government permission \u2014 in Aleppo. He had also represented detainees, acidly commenting one too many times on a court system that finished trials in minutes and gave lawyers no access to their clients or the supposed evidence against them.He described his eight-month ordeal in hours of interviews: daily beatings, a cell so packed that there was no room to lie down. He spent three months, he said, with personal space smaller than the size of a manhole.In one of his first interrogations, he said, he was forced to count the blows, reaching 80 before he passed out.Doused with cold water, he awoke to be hung for hours by his wrists, bound behind his back with handcuffs. Later, he saw a young detainee get doused with kerosene, and set on fire. It took him 20 days to die, untreated, of infection.The torture went on until K.K. signed a confession of financing \u201cterrorist\u201d demonstrations \u2014 entirely fiction, he said, dictated by his captors.Now K.K. works with other Syrian lawyers and former detainees to compile lists of victims, hoping their records will someday make a difference.Other alleged war crimes take place in full view.By 2013, bombings of rebel-held neighborhoods by artillery and warplanes had become routine. Hundreds of videos showed mutilated civilians, including women and children, pulled from rubble.There have been dozens of cases of starvation, many of them children, and ill and elderly people.Since this month\u2019s chemical attack, residents have reported several attacks with incendiary weapons in Idlib and neighboring Hama provinces, uploading videos that show blinding fires typical of weapons like thermite and white phosphorus. They cause severe burns, similar to napalm, and their use is prohibited in civilian areas.Many who have suffered lost hope of redress long ago.A Syrian man who did four stints of detention and torture for taking humanitarian aid to wounded protesters and rebels recounted his experiences, but then expressed despair that anything would come of it.\u201cCountries don\u2019t need this evidence \u2014 they already know what\u2019s happening,\u201d said the man, Abu Ali al-Hamwi, using his nom de guerre because his mother is in government-controlled Syria.\u201cWe are just pawns on a chessboard. I have women friends who were detained, raped, got pregnant, were tortured with acid.\u201dHe shrugged.\u201cThere is no justice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because there is no justice, there is no hope.\u201dAs the war has dragged on, groups of activists, lawyers and others in Syria and beyond are documenting atrocities in hopes of one day bringing perpetrators to account.Some film the aftermath of attacks and compile lists of the dead. Others are experienced war-crimes prosecutors who have begun building cases against Mr. Assad and other government officials.The group, funded by Western governments, now has more than 750,000 Syrian government documents that contain hundreds of thousands of names, including those of top players in Syria\u2019s security apparatus, according to William H. Wiley, the group\u2019s executive director.So far, the group has prepared eight detailed case briefs against ranking Syrian security and intelligence officials, Mr. Wiley said. Seven of them directly implicate Mr. Assad.\u201cObviously, President Assad figures prominently in certain of the case files,\u201d Mr. Wiley said via Skype from his office in a European city that his organization keeps secret for fear of being targeted by the Syrian government. \u201cPretty much the entire military and intelligence security infrastructure of the regime is now featured in one or more of the prosecution briefs.\u201dThe photos have been verified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and determined to contain images of 6,700 individuals, according to Stephen J. Rapp, who served as ambassador at large for war crimes during the Obama administration.More than 700 of the people in the photos have been identified by name, opening other avenues for potential prosecution. Indeed, one of those photos led to the most recent legal action against Syrian officials.In 2014, Amal Hag Hamdo Anfalis, a Spanish-Syrian hairdresser, received a text message from her niece containing a photo of a body she had seen on Facebook. She immediately recognized her brother, a truck driver who had disappeared at a Syrian government checkpoint a year earlier.\u201cAs soon as I saw it, I completely collapsed and my children were wondering why I was crying,\u201d she said by phone from Madrid. \u201cMy children recognized him right away. They looked at the photo and said, \u2018That\u2019s our uncle.\u2019\u201dThe image was from the Caesar archive, parts of which activists had been posting online to identify victims.The defendants include Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa; Ali Mamlouk, head of the National Security Bureau; Gen. Jamil Hassan, head of air force intelligence; and senior officers at the prison where Ms. Hamdo believes her brother was detained and killed.Judges and prosecutors in France and Germany are also investigating war-crimes allegations against Syrian officials for possible prosecution in domestic courts.But even those working for war-crimes prosecutions face substantial barriers during a conflict.The road to the International Criminal Court appears blocked, and European courts have trouble getting access to the accused. So the best-case scenario is often an international warrant that could lead to the suspects\u2019 arrests should they set foot in a country willing to cooperate.\u201cThe problem as I see it is not so much what mechanism one can use to bring accountability, but how you actually get your hands on the people you want to prosecute,\u201d he said.The limited prospects for prosecution have led some to pursue other kinds of justice.Alex Whiting, a Harvard law professor, said accountability is a matter of politics and so far Syria has not been high in the world\u2019s priorities. But he has been surprised, tenuously, since the latest chemical attack.\u201cSuddenly there is a turn in the world against Assad, which could lead to him being pushed from power, opening a space for accountability in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s likely, but it certainly seems more possible.\u201dAn article last Sunday about efforts to investigate and prosecute cases of war crimes committed in Syria referred incorrectly to a case against Syrian officials that has been filed in a court in Spain. It is one of such cases pending, but not the only one. (Investigations are also open in France and Germany.)Anne Barnard reported from Istanbul; Beirut, Lebanon; Damascus, Syria; Geneva; and D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany; Ben Hubbard from Beirut; and Ian Fisher from Jerusalem.

{"Headline": "Retired Miners Lament Trump\u2019s Silence on Imperiled Health Plan", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byUNIONTOWN, Pa. \u2014 Donald J. Trump made coal miners a central metaphor of his presidential campaign, promising to \u201cput our miners back to work\u201d and look after their interests in a way that the Obama administration did not.Now, three months into his presidency, comes a test of that promise.Unless Congress intervenes by late April, government-funded health benefits will abruptly lapse for more than 20,000 retired miners, concentrated in Trump states that include Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Many of the miners have serious health problems arising from their years in the mines.In mining areas like Uniontown, Pa., and surrounding Fayette and Greene Counties, which Mr. Trump carried 2 to 1, it is an upsetting and potentially costly prospect. \u201cIt\u2019s just a terrible, terrible feeling,\u201d said one of the retirees, David VanSickle, who spent four decades at work in the mines. \u201cI think about that 25 times a day.\u201dThe president has offered no public comment on the issue, even as he has rolled back regulations on mine operators, an omission that has not escaped the notice of Mr. VanSickle and other retired miners.\u201cTo me, that was kind of a promise he did make to us,\u201d Mr. VanSickle said about Mr. Trump, whom he supported last fall. \u201cHe promised to help miners, not just mining companies.\u201dResponsibility for the retirees\u2019 health plans has increasingly shifted to the federal government in recent years, as struggling coal companies have shed their liabilities in bankruptcy court. Congress voted last fall to finance benefits for a large group of retirees for several months, but House and Senate Republican leaders have yet to agree on a longer-term solution.The benefits can easily mean the difference between a middle-class retirement and economic hardship, since many retired miners are too young to qualify for Medicare. Others have chronic or debilitating health problems that would require expensive supplemental coverage \u2014 currently provided by the retiree plan \u2014 even with the Medicare benefit.Norm Skinner worked for more than 20 years as a miner in eastern Ohio and had triple bypass surgery in 2010. Without the retiree health plan, he said, the surgery \u201cwould have broke me,\u201d even with Medicare picking up much of the bill.Uniontown, which lies about 30 miles east of two large mines that once employed well over 1,000 miners but are down to roughly 600 after one ceased production in 2015, hints at both middle-class affluence and postindustrial angst.Around the corner from Ptak\u2019s, a formidable-looking formal wear store on Main Street, are a handful of dilapidated storefronts and a vast, empty commercial space that advertises \u201cmental health counseling\u201d and \u201cmotivational speaking\u201d for veterans. The space has the appearance of a renovation that was never completed and, to the naked eye, could pass for a sign of either revival or decline, like much of Uniontown itself.Mr. VanSickle, who lost parts of two fingers on the job, said his doctor advised him to retire two years ago, at 59, because he suffers from black lung, a condition associated with long-term exposure to coal dust.He manages the illness by attaching himself to a breathing machine that essentially props open the airway to his lungs while he sleeps. \u201cMy oxygen content would drop so low without it,\u201d he said, fitting tubes into his nose from the bedroom of his comfortable home in Uniontown.Last fall, Mr. VanSickle priced out a private insurance plan that would provide roughly comparable benefits for him and his wife, who takes about a dozen separate medications to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The estimates came in at $1,500 to $1,800 per month.\u201cI always wanted to be a person who would leave a little legacy for my children,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I lose these benefits and my pension, there will not be enough for me, let alone for my children.\u201d(Mr. VanSickle and his wife could be eligible for thousands of dollars in subsidies if they purchased insurance under the Affordable Care Act, said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. But such a plan would most likely be more limited, and Mr. Trump still maintains that he wants to undo the program.)The miners typically regard their health care with a sense of moral entitlement, having frequently passed up higher pay during contract talks in order to top off their benefits.John Leach, 67, worked in four different mines over 23 years as a miner in western Kentucky. As a result, he said, \u201cI got four of those speeches: \u2018If you work here, you work your 20 years, you are guaranteed insurance for yourself and your family for the rest of your life.\u2019\u201dSince he retired in 2001, that insurance, along with Medicaid and Medicare, has kept him and his wife, Rhonda, 60, afloat. The couple care for two adult children with severe physical and mental disabilities. In 2015, the health plan paid out over $50,000 for Rhonda\u2019s hip-replacement surgery.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever gone through a serious test at the doctor\u2019s office,\u201d Ms. Leach said by phone. \u201cYou wait and wait and don\u2019t hear anything and the pressure starts building up: Am I going to live or am I going to die? That\u2019s exactly what this is like: living and dying.\u201dMany retired miners who supported Mr. Trump understood that his promise to revive employment in their industry was a long shot in the face of cheap natural gas \u2014 \u201ca couple of jobs\u201d might come of it, Mr. VanSickle said.But they believed their wish was a modest one. The price tag for their benefits averages a little under $200 million per year over the next 10 years, which can be partly offset through interest that accrues in a federal fund for reclaiming abandoned mines. Because no new miners would become eligible for the health benefits awarded to this group, the cost would eventually dwindle to zero.Last year, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, appeared reluctant to expedite a vote on a permanent fix despite bipartisan support, and despite representing a state where several thousand retirees are affected.One reason for his lack of enthusiasm may have been the hundreds of thousands of dollars the union spent opposing him in his most recent re-election campaign.Earlier this year, Mr. McConnell appeared to develop a sense of urgency, however, introducing legislation to pay for a once-and-for-all extension of the health benefits. (A McConnell spokesman noted that he had supported a one-year extension late last year.)Some time after that, the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, let it be known that he could abide no more than 20 months, after which the benefits would either lapse or have to be extended again.\u201cIt perfectly lined up with the 2018 election,\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, the Senate\u2019s leading proponent of a permanent resolution. Mr. Manchin speculated that Republicans favored another short-term reprieve so that his Republican opponent next year, who could be one of the House Republicans from his state, could claim credit for yet another extension.A spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee said all 2017 funding bills were still being negotiated.A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.In the last few days, the House Republican leadership has suggested that it, too, might support a permanent fix, according to Phil Smith, the chief lobbyist for the miners union, but only if it can settle on a revenue source to offset the full cost. \u201cIt leaves the door wide open to \u2018Well, we couldn\u2019t find one,\u2019\u201d Mr. Smith said.Many miners in their early 60s are postponing retirement, unsure if their savings will suffice absent the health insurance they have long expected.Tony Brnusak, 62, who has worked for nearly 40 years in the Cumberland mine, said he would probably be retiring, if not for the uncertainty around his benefits.\u201cMy wife works and she\u2019ll be retiring next year, but she won\u2019t have the medical when she retires, she won\u2019t have a pension,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re counting on mine.\u201dHe serves as president of the local mine workers union and estimates that at least 50 to 60 more workers at Cumberland, out of just under 600, are in a similar position.Although he agrees with Mr. Trump on some key issues, not least climate change, he can\u2019t conceal his disappointment that the health care issue has lingered for so long.\u201cI thought he was really going to help people,\u201d Mr. Brnusak said, referring to Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s helped the rich man, the coal operators. But nothing for us so far.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thousands of Russians Present Letters of Protest in Demonstrations", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Thousands of Russians lined up in cities across their country on Saturday to present letters of protest at government offices, the second widespread show of public discontent in two months.Some of the protests turned violent. Nearly 120 people were arrested in St. Petersburg, according to O.V.D. Info, an independent organization that tracks protest arrests, and there were scattered detentions in at least a half-dozen other cities. In Samara, a scheduled rally was canceled because of organizational roadblocks put up by the local government, and because a printer backed out at the last minute, Open Russia said.Pictures of the protest in St. Petersburg, which organizers said had attracted about 300 people, showed riot police officers hustling protesters onto buses, including one older woman holding a sign critical of President Vladimir V. Putin, which said, \u201cV. V. Putin \u2014 there is a way out \u2014 take a pension.\u201dThe overarching theme for the day was \u201cNadoel!\u201d or \u201cEnough!\u201d as in enough of Mr. Putin and his government. Signs and many petitions called on him not to seek a fourth term in next year\u2019s presidential election. He is expected to run, although he has yet to officially declare his plans.\u201cWe have Putin, we don\u2019t need food,\u201d read one sarcastic protest sign in the Siberian city of Tomsk, where some press reports said 500 people had taken part in the event.Before Saturday, Open Russia announced that it had organized protests in about 30 cities. Over all, the number of participants was smaller than the tens of thousands who turned out in about 80 cities for protests called by the main opposition leader, Aleksei A. Navalny, on March 26. Mr. Navalny has called for more demonstrations on June 12.In Moscow, the capital, hundreds of people holding petitions lined the sidewalk near the Kremlin administration building between Red Square and Staraya Ploshad, or Old Square. For a little more than two hours starting around 2 p.m., petitioners filed into a government office to present their letters, many of them written on the spot.In the days before the protest, the government had deployed construction equipment and barriers near the office that handles such letters, leaving organizers to believe the entrance would be blocked.After word went out that the letters were indeed being accepted, many more people arrived to stand in line. Organizers said that an early count found that at least 1,500 people had presented petitions in Moscow.\u201cWe must participate in such events to show the authority that more and more people whose rights are being violated are against this,\u201d a 30-year-old marketing specialist who identified herself only as Veronika said as she wrote her letter. Many participants were reluctant to give their names because of the legal problems faced by numerous people who took part in previous protests. \u201cI want to live in a country where laws are observed,\u201d she said.Another protester who declined to give his full name, Aleksandr, 26, said he had tried to start an emergency services company to work in gas fields and had been blocked at every turn. \u201cThey keep telling me that they don\u2019t have the budget, maybe because the prime minister stole $70 million dollars,\u201d he said, referring to recent accusations against Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev in a YouTube video produced by Mr. Navalny.\u201cThe government does not care about ordinary people \u2014 about our salaries, medication, our rights, nothing,\u201d Aleksandr said.Many of those presenting petitions acknowledged that the relatively low turnout and the government\u2019s general indifference meant the protests would probably not have much of an effect. But they said it was time to start pushing back against an erosion of civil liberties and the country\u2019s poor economic performance.Open Russia\u2019s Facebook page had a few suggestions about subjects to be addressed in the petitions, including \u201cWe are tired of living on poverty-level salaries and pensions\u201d; \u201cWe are tired of listening to lies on television\u201d; and \u201cWe are tired of driving on bad roads.\u201dUnder Russian law, the government is supposed to respond to such letters in 30 days. Two women who were accepting petitions assigned each one a number and gave the writer a slip of paper with a telephone number to call. Few expected answers, especially to the many letters calling on Mr. Putin to quit.\u201cThey will probably answer that the writer was not suggesting any exact problem so thank you very much,\u201d said Aleksandr Y. Soloviev, 29, the chairman of Open Russia.The group\u2019s founder, Mr. Khodorkovsky, a former chairman of the oil giant Yukos, spent several years in prison before being pardoned by Mr. Putin in 2013. Since then, he has lived abroad, becoming one of the Kremlin\u2019s most outspoken critics.Mr. Navalny appears to have hit a public nerve with a series of videos accusing senior government officials of widespread corruption.His latest video focused on what he said was a group of four bogus charities that spend more than $66 million annually to maintain a series of luxurious residences for the prime minister.Mr. Navalny was doused with green dye for a second time on Thursday, and one eye required medical treatment. He appeared on his YouTube channel afterward, tinted slightly green, to answer questions from around the country.He expressed support for the idea of submitting petitions on Saturday, but he said he doubted that doing so would produce any positive results.Asked about the Saturday protest last week, Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, noted that it was illegal and would be dealt with accordingly. The police in Moscow repeatedly ordered anyone lingering on the sidewalk to move on, but otherwise treated the protesters respectfully.A day earlier, the government had declared Open Russia, which has its headquarters in Britain, an \u201cundesirable\u201d organization, making it illegal for the parent organization to operate in Russia. The main reason cited for the designation was that the group had organized protests.On Friday, Ren TV, a Russian television channel that serves as a cheerleader for the Kremlin, broadcast a documentary that portrayed Open Russia as a collection of criminals and drug addicts who cultivate ties with the United States.No reports about Saturday\u2019s protests appeared on Rossiya 24, the main cable news channel. Reports included one about the opening of Fountain Season in the capital, with the water being turned on after the long winter freeze, as well as the bike-sharing system.There also seemed to be a less-than-subtle message directed at the protesters, whom the government often accuses of being financed from abroad. The cable station showed a documentary about treacherous military officers who served the enemy during World War II.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the cancellation of a planned rally in Samara. Open Russia said it was canceled because the local government put up organizational roadblocks and a printer backed out, not because of a heavy police presence.An article on Sunday, about demonstrations in Russia, misquoted an outspoken critic of the Kremlin, Aleksei A. Navalny. In a recent video, Mr. Navalny said that four charities had spent $66 million to maintain luxury residences for Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, not $66 billion. The incorrect figure was repeated in a quote attributed to a protester.Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Chairman Should Listen to Investors and Step Down", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsIt\u2019s time to add Wells Fargo\u2019s chairman, Stephen W. Sanger, to the list of firings over the creation of millions of fake accounts.Just 56 percent of shareholders backed Mr. Sanger at the bank\u2019s annual meeting on Tuesday. That\u2019s a stinging rebuke for his failure as lead director. After 5,300 employees and the chief executive, John G. Stumpf, paid with their jobs, Mr. Sanger and other board members with lackluster support should go, too, to help the bank rehabilitate.Much of the nearly three-hour gathering in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. \u2014 clear across the country from Wells Fargo\u2019s San Francisco headquarters \u2014 felt like a full-blown airing of grievances. Investors, customers and employees past and present took turns denouncing executives and directors.The duping of customers dominated, however, with shareholder dissatisfaction coalescing around a dozen of the company\u2019s directors up for re-election. None of them secured more than 80 percent of the vote. Only the newcomers Karen Peetz, Ronald Sargent and Timothy J. Sloan, the chief executive, won nearly unanimous support.Mr. Sanger, the 71-year-old former boss of General Mills who took the chairman\u2019s seat when Mr. Stumpf departed, wasn\u2019t the only one to just squeak by. Although Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway voted its 10 percent stake in favor of the whole board, the directors Enrique Hernandez Jr., Federico F. Pe\u00f1a and Cynthia H. Milligan fell short of the 60 percent mark. Each leads or sits on one or more of the risk, governance and corporate responsibility committees.Five more directors failed to clear the 70 percent threshold that typically denotes a serious protest vote and which often forces companies to respond on such matters as \u201csay on pay.\u201d Not only does it suggest shareholders are displeased that board members were too slow to act, but also that the bank\u2019s internal investigation into the yearslong affair was too soft on them.Mr. Sanger called it a \u201cclear message of dissatisfaction\u201d that \u201cthe board has heard.\u201d The appropriate response now is for him and some of his colleagues to step down.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the South Bronx, Lives Marred and Erased by Firearms", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byMurder in the 4-0Daniel Rice and Kevin Thomas were living emblems of the ravages of gun violence in the South Bronx.Mr. Rice found trouble with striking regularity, despite being in a wheelchair since a bullet hit his spine two decades earlier. Mr. Thomas had been shot twice before and carried two slugs in his body from the first attack, in 2011, when he took eight bullets to the torso.One weekend last October, the men came face to face in the Mott Haven Houses, the authorities say.Mr. Rice, 39, rolled his wheelchair into a small fenced courtyard where an impromptu birthday party was in progress, accompanied by his brother, Darrell, and three friends, the police said. He wore dreadlocks, glasses and a black down vest.Mr. Thomas, 28, rose to to meet them. It was about 1:50 a.m. on Sunday, Oct. 23. Known as Biggie, Mr. Thomas stood 6-foot-3 and weighed about 300 pounds. He had been expecting trouble for weeks, his friends said. He told his mother that the Rice brothers might be looking for him because he had beaten up their uncle.Mr. Rice and Mr. Thomas had long arrest records on charges including crack dealing and gun possession. Both had served time in prison. Both had been suspects in other shootings. Both were feared figures in the Mott Haven Houses and the nearby Patterson Houses, projects notorious for gun violence and feuds between street gangs.The guns are used not only in crimes like robbery and drug dealing, but also in a struggle for respect in some of the city\u2019s most impoverished neighborhoods.That Sunday morning, security cameras recorded a confrontation in the courtyard, the police said. Mr. Rice\u2019s brother, Darrell, walked up to Mr. Thomas and threw the first punch, detectives said. Mr. Thomas absorbed the blow, unfazed, and took off his jacket, squaring up to brawl. Then Daniel Rice, who calls himself Capone, drew a .45-caliber pistol, leveled it at Mr. Thomas and, investigators believe, started firing. Ten bullets tore into Mr. Thomas\u2019s chest, arms, legs and groin.He went down on his belly, blood fanning out. He had a puzzled look, said a friend who arrived just after the shooting but did not witness it.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even talk,\u201d the friend said, asking that his name not be published for fear of the Rice family. \u201cHe died right in my arms right there on the floor. I watched him take his last breath.\u201dThe Rices left the scene with no evident alarm, Darrell Rice pushing his brother calmly toward Willis Avenue, detectives said. They headed several blocks west on East 141st Street and disappeared into an apartment building, their retreat recorded by security cameras along the way.\u201cHe knows no one is ratting him out because they are scared of him,\u201d Detective Oscar Rosa, the lead investigator, said a few days later. \u201cThey fear him.\u201dSigns of gun violence are ubiquitous in the 4-0, which has some of the highest rates of shootings and of gun seizures in the city. Bullet holes pock walls in the area\u2019s projects and the doors of some all-night bodegas. On the sidewalks, wounded men in the prime of life walk with canes or ride in wheelchairs.Gunshots at night are not uncommon in and around the Mott Haven and Patterson projects, residents say. So many shootings between warring crews have occurred along East 143rd Street near Third Avenue \u2014 the nexus between the two developments \u2014 that the police have raised extra lights and an observation tower with cameras.\u201cYou have to have a gun to protect yourself,\u201d said Jesus DeJesus, 46, one of Mr. Rice\u2019s friends. \u201cIt\u2019s the norm.\u201dStill, criminologists say there are small zones where shootings remain a stubborn problem, particularly in public housing complexes, where one in five New York City shootings happen. And agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives say the flow of guns into the city has not diminished, despite efforts to crack down on gunrunners.Guns produce money in New York: A pistol bought for $200 out of state can go for $700 on Brook Avenue in the Bronx. But unlike many drug dealers, gunrunners tend to rely on personal connections and rarely sell in the open, federal officials said. New Yorkers visiting relatives in Virginia or Ohio, for instance, may take orders from people they know and buy guns at pawn shops, at sporting-goods stores, at gun shows or from private sellers, then haul them back, often on economy buses run out of Chinatown, law enforcement officials said. The sales are sometimes arranged on social media, they said.The firearms remain in circulation for decades, being resold again and again, studies show. Some are kept by street gangs as community weapons, stashed in mailboxes, trash cans or the wheel wells of cars, available to use at a moment\u2019s notice, the officials said.In 2015, about 3,674 guns were recovered in the city, with 89 percent of them originating in other states, according to the state attorney general\u2019s office. The Bronx had the most guns recovered per capita in the city, with 902, or 62 for every 100,000 residents. Brooklyn was close behind, with 55 for every 100,000. The South Bronx and northern Brooklyn are also where two-thirds to three-quarters of the city\u2019s shootings take place, Chief Shea said.A 30-year-old man who helps run a heroin-dealing operation in the 40th Precinct said that procuring a gun was simple. \u201cI can walk down the street and buy a gun right now,\u201d said the dealer, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified by name. \u201cIt\u2019s probably used. It\u2019s probably got a body. Somebody\u2019s going to sell it to you.\u201dFive days after he was killed, Mr. Thomas was laid out in a dust-blue coffin with a floral pattern at the Porta Coeli San German Funeral Home on Westchester Avenue. His mother, Rosa Martinez, sat opposite him on a couch, while his girlfriend, Shantice Murphy, handed out prayer cards with his photo.His uncle, James Thomas, a Brooklyn pastor, implored the mourners not to seek vengeance. \u201cThis pain we are going through in my family \u2014 I don\u2019t want any of my loved ones causing it to someone else,\u201d he said.Ms. Martinez said most of her children managed to find jobs and move out of the Mott Haven Houses, but not Kevin, her third and most impulsive son. He began smoking marijuana and getting in trouble with the law when he was 12 years old, around the same time she separated from his father, remarried and moved into the development.She lost control over him, she said. When he was 14, she persuaded a judge to send him to a state-financed boarding school for troubled teens in Westchester County. But he ran away twice and eventually dropped out. Soon he was dealing crack and marijuana behind 350 East 143rd Street, a high-rise in the Mott Haven complex.Mr. Thomas\u2019s family said he seemed happy hustling his nights away in the courtyard, selling drugs, smoking marijuana, bingeing on Netflix and doing as little as he could for money \u2014 not much of it legal. \u201cI can\u2019t say he was an ambitious person, like he had dreams and goals,\u201d said Kary Thomas, his sister. \u201cHe just lived for the moment. He worried about having the latest Jordans, MCM belts and being in fashion, being popular.\u201dBesides stylish clothes and Hennessy Cognac, Mr. Thomas had one other obvious passion: a shiny red motor scooter. He would race around Upper Manhattan and the South Bronx, his huge frame barely fitting on the seat as the machine careened around corners.At 19, he was arrested in the courtyard with his best friend, Alex Martinez, on charges that they tried to kill a father and son. According to court papers, Mr. Thomas was charged with attempted murder after he pistol-whipped the son, Angel Cruz Jr., and tried to shoot him. The gun went off three times during the struggle, hitting Mr. Martinez. Arrested on drug charges while out on bail, Mr. Thomas later pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to nine months in jail.Over the next four years, Mr. Thomas was arrested more than a dozen times on assault, weapons possession and drug-selling charges. He pleaded guilty in March 2009 to selling crack cocaine and was diverted into a drug-treatment program. But he failed to attend, and in February 2012, a judge sentenced him to three years in prison.When he wasn\u2019t behind bars, Mr. Thomas would occasionally find his own place to stay, usually a cheap rental, but always ended up back at his mother\u2019s place. He worked off and on as a janitor and hauled boxes around a warehouse.But mainly he sold drugs, always with the same cadre of friends in the fenced courtyard behind 350 East 143rd Street. He operated independently of other dealers and often fought with them, the police said. \u201cHe sold whatever he wanted; he sold to whomever he wanted,\u201d Detective Rosa said. \u201cThere were no rules in his game.\u201dMr. Thomas\u2019s sister said he enjoyed intimidating rivals. \u201cHe was a never-back-down type of person,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like anybody really liked him. They feared him. That was the problem. They feared him.\u201dHis pugnacity led to trouble. In July 2011, Mr. Thomas became embroiled in a fight with Jamel Fielder, then 21, a diminutive man from the Patterson Houses known as Pee-wee. Mr. Thomas stripped Mr. Fielder of a gun near the Mott Haven Houses and shot him in the buttocks as he ran away, the police said.A month later, Mr. Fielder ambushed Mr. Thomas as he emerged from a pizza shop, shooting him eight times as he crossed the street, the police said. Mr. Thomas collapsed on a metal bench, a half-eaten pizza slice still in his hand, according to the police and the account of a witness. Doctors could remove only six of the slugs, and Mr. Thomas was left with long scars on his torso and arms. (Mr. Fielder was charged with attempted murder but later pleaded guilty to gun possession and received a two-year prison sentence.)After the attack, Mr. Thomas\u2019s mother tried to be moved to an apartment in a different project, arguing that her family had been traumatized. But she was never relocated. Once her son recovered, he went right back to selling in the courtyard, she said, despite her pleas.In September 2015, Mr. Thomas again became a shooting victim. It happened after he accused another person in his circle of having been an informant in a federal drug case and took a swipe at him with a knife, according to one witness. The man shot Mr. Thomas in the leg, leaving him with a limp.Though the police arrested a suspect in the shooting, Mr. Thomas refused to testify and the charges were eventually dropped, the police said. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I say something, they\u2019ll come and kill me and all of us,\u2019\u201d his mother recalled.Among the people who regularly bought crack from Mr. Thomas was Joshua Rice, 57, an addict known as Pop Bucket because he carried a pail and rags everywhere. He washed cars to earn drug money. He was Daniel Rice\u2019s uncle, though he had little regular contact with his relatives and could not be located for comment.Sometime in early October \u2014 no one is sure of the date \u2014 Mr. Thomas gave Joshua Rice a few dollars to wash his prized motor scooter, but the older man never got around to the chore, the police said. Angry, Mr. Thomas confronted Mr. Rice and broke his jaw, the police said.That night, Mr. Thomas told his mother he had been warned the Rice brothers might retaliate. \u201cHe told me his family said they are going to come for him,\u201d Ms. Martinez recalled. Daniel Rice was especially feared, known to carry a pistol secreted in his wheelchair, several acquaintances said.Mr. Rice and his lawyer declined requests to be interviewed for this article. So did his father, his daughter, two of his uncles, his grandmother and several other relatives. Efforts to contact Darrell Rice at his apartment and on the telephone were unsuccessful.The details of the shooting that left him without full use of his legs remain murky. Whatever the cause, it did not deter Mr. Rice from committing crimes. Starting in 1994, he was arrested three times on charges of gun possession and ended up serving a three-year stint in prison after guilty plea.He had been out on parole for just five months when the police barged into his family\u2019s apartment in May 2002, searching for Darrell Rice, who had fled the police and left behind a car full of crack. The officers did not catch him that night, but they found Daniel in his bedroom with a gun and a large quantity of cocaine. This time, he was charged in federal court, where sentences for gun crimes are stiffer.During court proceedings, Daniel Rice\u2019s lawyers argued that the shooting that put their client in a wheelchair as a teenager had left him psychologically scarred. Paranoid about another attack, he had developed an \u201cinfatuation with guns,\u201d his lawyers said.But prosecutors noted the evidence that Mr. Rice dealt drugs. \u201cRice is a crack dealer who also uses guns, not a person scared of being the victim of another random shooting,\u201d the prosecutor, Steven D. Feldman, argued in papers.In the end, Mr. Rice was sentenced to 10 years in a federal penitentiary.After he returned in 2012, he demanded that young people in the projects show him respect, a former friend said, and he talked tough with men like Mr. Thomas, almost daring them to mock him for his disability.\u201cHe\u2019s not to be played with,\u201d the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIt was a lot of people testing him because he was in a wheelchair.\u201dThe man who was with Mr. Thomas when he died said he also had known Mr. Rice for more than 20 years. He said that Mr. Rice was quick to brandish a pistol if he felt slighted. \u201cHe really thinks he\u2019s Al Capone and people owe him and his family respect,\u201d the man said. \u201cHe was a bitter guy.\u201dMs. Martinez \u2014 Mr. Thomas\u2019s mother \u2014 said she could see the spot where he died from the window of his room. She sat there often after he was buried at a cemetery in New Jersey and thought about how he had been murdered \u201cfor slapping\u201d Joshua Rice. \u201cEvery little fight, they take out a gun,\u201d Ms. Martinez said. \u201cYou lose a life for nothing.\u201dIt did not take long for the 40th Precinct\u2019s detective squad to hear chatter that Mr. Rice was behind the shooting, and investigators believed that the man in the wheelchair with long dreadlocks seen on security camera footage matched his description.Still, they waited to question him. The images were too grainy to make out the shooter\u2019s face clearly. As a rule, detectives in the Bronx rarely charge someone on video evidence alone, because a defense lawyer can easily cast doubt on the identification. The investigators needed a witness to confirm the shooter\u2019s identity.\u201dThey\u2019re both scared to death,\u201d said Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the squad commander.Tests on shell casings at the scene linked the gun used to kill Mr. Thomas to another shooting. And the police had evidence that Mr. Rice had provided the pistol used in an additional attack, the 2014 shooting of Latroy Tarver, another Mott Haven man with a history of drug offenses.With no witnesses, Detective Rosa thought the only way to move the case forward was to ask federal prosecutors to step in and use racketeering laws to wrap the three crimes together in one indictment against Mr. Rice.Then the squad caught a break. In late November, the police arrested a man on unrelated charges who said he had seen Mr. Thomas get shot.Sergeant LoPuzzo said he was skeptical at first. \u201cI said, \u2018I ain\u2019t interested in what you heard in the street.\u2019 He says, \u2018I didn\u2019t hear anything, I was there,\u2019 and everything fell into place.\u201dOnce they had a witness, the detectives persuaded a judge to let them track Mr. Rice\u2019s cellphone to locate him. On Jan. 20, it pinged in a barber shop at Westchester and Waterbury Avenues. Mr. Rice, fresh from a haircut, was arrested as he left the shop. He had a loaded Glock pistol tucked under his belt, according to a criminal complaint.Back at the station house, detectives helped Mr. Rice up the stairs, half-carrying him to an interview room. He asked for a lawyer right away. \u201cHe was kind of laughing,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said. \u201cLike he wasn\u2019t taking anything seriously.\u201dIt turned out the gun he was carrying was not the one used in the shooting of Mr. Thomas. Still, the detectives held him on a gun possession charge, and four days later, prosecutors brought the witness before a grand jury and obtained a murder indictment.At his arraignment, Mr. Rice pleaded not guilty and complained to Justice William I. Mogulescu that his court-appointed lawyer had prevented him from testifying before the grand jury. \u201cYou are telling me I have no right to go before the grand jury?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want this lawyer. I want to go before the grand jury.\u201dDuring his next appearance, Mr. Rice sounded nonchalant as he pleaded not guilty to the gun possession charge. As he was wheeled out, he yelled \u201cI love you\u201d to his adult daughter, then glanced at a reporter in the court, smiled and said, \u201cCheese!\u201dBenjamin Mueller and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "U.S., Canada and Mexico Announce Shared Bid for 2026 World Cup", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byThe documents signed and the hands shaken, U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati and his counterparts from the Mexican and Canadian soccer federations had every reason to smile broadly on Monday as the photographs were made. Each knew the hard work was behind him.Their public bid to co-host to 2026 World Cup, less than 20 minutes old in strictly legal terms, was already off to a great start. Their biggest rivals had been sidelined from bidding by FIFA rules. Most of the stadiums, hotels, highways and airports were already built. President Trump, the one wild card none of them could control, had sent word that he, too, was behind the plan.Even the toughest task of all \u2014 negotiating the division of the matches for what will be the first expanded, 48-team version of FIFA\u2019s quadrennial championship \u2014 was detailed in the paperwork.The United States, they had agreed, would be the senior partner in the three-nation bid, and would host 60 of the 80 games and every game of the quarterfinals through the final. Mexico and Canada would each host 10 games. FIFA would manage the rest of the details \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s their tournament,\u201d Gulati said \u2014 but the broad picture of a plan that most think will come to fruition was already done.It was not what everyone had wanted, the Mexican federation president, Decio de Mar\u00eda, acknowledged, \u201cbut it is what we got.\u201dGulati acknowledged the difficulty of negotiating the split of the matches. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say both countries would have liked more games,\u201d he said, \u201cand they will say it was hard to sell me on 60.\u201dWhat they agreed on in the end was this: As soon as this week, the United States, Mexico and Canada will present to FIFA, world soccer\u2019s governing body, a paradigm-shifting plan for the World Cup that will involve more cities, more teams, more players and, perhaps most important, more profits.It is quite possibly all of those things, but the sheer scope of an 80-game event (up from the current 64) played out over more than a month requires a reserve of stadiums, practice sites, hotels and transportation infrastructure that few countries can offer. By bidding as a unit, the three rivals from Concacaf, the regional confederation that encompasses North and Central America and the Caribbean, most likely assured that their bid will be accepted.Gulati pressed that reality, saying, \u201cA World Cup in North America, with 60 games in the United States, would be, by far, the most successful World Cup in the history of FIFA, in terms of economics.\u201dGulati, who is also a senior economics lecturer at Columbia University, said that the United States-Mexico-Canada bid had the full support of President Trump, whose tough talk about Mexico was a major theme of his campaign. Gulati said that talks with the president, carried out by an intermediary in the past 30 days, revealed President Trump to be supportive and, according to Gulati, especially encouraged about Mexico\u2019s taking part. Concerns about visiting teams and fans from countries like Iran, Mexico and elsewhere \u2014 and especially those targeted by President Trump\u2019s immigration restrictions \u2014 were most likely assuaged in those conversations as well.\u201dYou\u2019re always concerned about things,\u201d Gulati said. \u201cBut I think in both countries, Canada and Mexico, they got sort of an unofficial or semiofficial O.K. from the very top to go forward.\u201dStill, significant issues \u2014 and potential disagreements \u2014 remain. Prize games like the opening match and the final are always the most desirable for cities, even when only one country hosts, but in demanding all of the later-round matches, U.S. Soccer has effectively laid claim to most of the biggest games. Mexico City\u2019s Estadio Azteca, which hosted the 1970 and 1986 finals, could serve as a grand stage for the opening match, but only if de Mar\u00eda pries it away from Gulati.Mexico and Canada are expected to host matches in three or four cities each \u2014 Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara in Mexico and Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto in Canada were among those mentioned Monday \u2014 and the United States is expected to host matches in many more. Gulati predicted a tournament with more cities than ever before \u2014 the United States used nine when it hosted in the 1994 World Cup, and Brazil hosted matches in a dozen in 2014 \u2014 and he said regional groupings would help manage travel, at least initially.Despite secondary roles, Mexico and Canada have obvious reasons for signing on to a joint bid. Mexico, the 1970 and 1986 World Cup host, would become the first nation to host matches at three World Cup finals. And Canada, led by its federation president, Victor Montagliani, a rising power in FIFA, would join the United States, Sweden and Germany as the only countries to have put on a men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cup. France will join that exclusive club when it hosts the 2019 women\u2019s championship.In Mexico, some commentators saw only positives in the partnership, even if the country would host only a handful of matches. Alfredo Dom\u00ednguez Muro, a television broadcaster, echoed de Mar\u00eda in saying that the United States could easily have planned a solo bid, so he praised what he saw as a spirit of symbolic collaboration.\u201cThis sends the message to the Trump administration about the great benefits of cooperation that is simply not worth undermining,\u201d Dom\u00ednguez Muro said, adding: \u201cIt is excellent news precisely because of the political moment, for the three countries to host the most important event in the world. Let\u2019s not forget soccer is the most important thing of all the unimportant things.\u201d\u201cThere are times in life when you have to keep your ego tight,\u201d de Mar\u00eda said of the plan announced Monday. \u201cI think that trying to get in a football war \u2014 \u2018Oh, fine, you\u2019re going to do it alone, I\u2019m going to do it alone\u2019 \u2014 is a stupid thing. Wise people should be able to sit in a room and find out a solution.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Secret A.T.F. Account Paid for $21,000 Nascar Suite and Las Vegas Trip", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives used a secret, off-the-books bank account to rent a $21,000 suite at a Nascar race, take a trip to Las Vegas and donate money to the school of one of the agents\u2019 children, according to records and interviews.Agents also used the account to finance undercover operations around the country, despite laws prohibiting government officials from using private money to supplement their budgets, according to current and former government officials and others familiar with the account.The A.T.F. has also refused to say who authorized the account, which was created by agents based in Bristol, Va., who were investigating tobacco smuggling. One government official said the bureau regarded the account as a hybrid of government funds and private money, a combination that is not authorized under federal law. Ryan Kaye, an A.T.F. supervisor, is quoted in public court documents as saying the agents received \u201cverbal directives\u201d from unidentified officials at headquarters to open the account.The arrangement dates back at least to 2011, court records show. Records show that a pair of A.T.F. informants who ran a tobacco warehouse in Bristol, Jason Carpenter and Christopher Small, opened the account. The informants helped the bureau\u2019s investigations into tobacco smugglers, who move cigarettes across state or national borders to avoid taxes.Sometimes, the A.T.F. agents used the money for expenses that normally would be paid from the agency\u2019s own budget, such as leasing cars and renting warehouses under fake names to conceal the government\u2019s involvement in undercover investigations. The account also helped pay for a trip to a tobacco convention in Las Vegas in early 2012, according to a former law enforcement official and a former industry official. The officials said the A.T.F. supplemented its travel budget with money from the management account.Current and former government and industry officials who discussed the case did so on the condition of anonymity because the Justice Department has argued successfully to keep nearly all the records in the case sealed. The Times has been fighting since last summer to make the documents public.Other expenses, such as renting a 16-person suite at Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, had no obvious connection to law enforcement operations. A.T.F. agents, along with some community members, used the suite in 2012 for the Irwin Tools Night Race, a Nascar event, according to two people who worked closely with the bureau at the time. A receipt obtained by The Times shows the suite cost $21,000.Agents also donated money from the account, according to documents and interviews, including thousands of dollars to the high school and volleyball team of the daughter of an A.T.F. agent in Bristol. The agent, Thomas Lesnak, is now retired and did not respond to messages seeking comment. He has previously dismissed suggestions that anything was done improperly.A.T.F. agents also had their credit card bills paid with money from the account, according to a former law enforcement official and two former industry officials. It is not clear whether the bills involved personal credit cards or government-issued cards, but both possibilities might violate federal laws.Government spending typically requires a strict audit trail, but the money deposited in the bank account came from an unlikely source. A.T.F. agents told the informants to buy untaxed cigarettes, mark up the cost and sell them at a profit. The sales made millions of dollars, which poured into the account.The A.T.F. did not answer any of a list of questions about its policies and the expenses, not even whether management accounts remain in use and, if not, whether they were ever considered legal. The agency issued a statement acknowledging problems with undercover tobacco operations, but only from 2009 until 2011.\u201cSince that time, A.T.F. has implemented substantial enhancements to its policies, and has markedly improved leadership, training, communication, accountability and operational oversight,\u201d the statement read.When it was pointed out that the Bristol account was opened after the new policies went into effect and continued at least until 2013, the A.T.F. did not elaborate.The management account made the Bristol warehouse an important part of many A.T.F. investigations, according to former law enforcement and industry officials.It is not clear whether Obama administration officials authorized the unorthodox account, which was opened at a time when the A.T.F. said it was tightening restrictions on undercover operations. The agency was also moving to improve its management after a botched gun trafficking investigation known as Fast and Furious.Normally, agents use government-controlled funds known as \u201cchurning accounts\u201d to finance tobacco smuggling investigations. The new rules imposed greater oversight over churning accounts. By using the secret bank account, agents in Bristol avoided that oversight.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Reaches Beyond West Wing for Counsel", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Relationships have always been President Trump\u2019s currency and comfort, helping him talk his way into real estate deals over three decades in New York. Those who know him best say that his outer confidence has always belied an inner uncertainty, and that he needs to test ideas with a wide range of people.As Mr. Trump\u2019s White House advisers jostle for position, the president has turned to another group of advisers \u2014 from family, real estate, media, finance and politics, and all outside the White House gates \u2014 many of whom he consults at least once a week.The media mogul Rupert Murdoch is on the phone every week, encouraging Mr. Trump when he\u2019s low and arguing that he focus on the economy rather than detouring to other issues. The developer Richard LeFrak is a soothing voice who listens to Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints that cost estimates for the border wall with Mexico are too high. Sean Hannity tells the president that keeping promises on core Republican issues is crucial.Mr. Trump\u2019s West Wing aides, like President Bill Clinton\u2019s staff two decades before, say they sometimes cringe at the input from people they can\u2019t control, with consequences they can\u2019t predict. Knowing these advisers \u2014 who are mostly white, male and older \u2014 is a key to figuring out the words coming from Mr. Trump\u2019s mouth and his Twitter feed.Here, based on interviews with more than a dozen friends, top aides and advisers inside and outside the White House, are 20 of Mr. Trump\u2019s outside touchstones.Rupert MurdochMr. Trump\u2019s relationships depend on two crucial measures: personal success and loyalty to him. Mr. Murdoch excels in both categories. His New York Post vaulted Mr. Trump from local housing developer to gossip-page royalty, and his Fox News Channel was pro-Trump in the 2016 general election.Mr. Murdoch even called the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, to buck him up after Mr. Spicer was savaged for a remark about Adolf Hitler.Sean HannityPresidents always deploy surrogates to appear on television to spout their talking points, but Mr. Trump has expanded on that by developing relationships with sympathetic media figures like Mr. Hannity who also serve as advisers. Mr. Hannity, the Fox News host, defends Mr. Trump\u2019s most controversial behavior in public, but privately, according to people close to Mr. Trump, he urges the president not to get distracted, and advises him to focus on keeping pledges like repealing the Affordable Care Act.Chris RuddyThe chief executive of Newsmax Media is a longtime Mar-a-Lago member and was a Trump cheerleader among conservative media well before the website Breitbart joined the parade. He employs writers and editors who tracked Mr. Trump\u2019s career when they were at The New York Post. He recently visited the Oval Office, and he and Mr. Trump kibitz in Florida and by phone.Sheri A. DillonMs. Dillon seemed out of place when she spoke at a too-large lectern in the lobby of Trump Tower on Jan. 11, describing the steps Mr. Trump planned to take to separate himself from his business. But Ms. Dillon, a tax lawyer who worked out a highly criticized plan for Mr. Trump to retain ownership of his company but step back from running it, has repeatedly counseled the president about the business and made at least one White House visit. (Michael Cohen, a veteran Trump aide, has been serving as his personal lawyer.)Corey LewandowskiDespite his \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d slogan, the president dislikes dismissing people. Mr. Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s hot-tempered first campaign manager, was fired in June but never really went away. A New England-bred operative whose working-class roots and clenched-teeth loyalty earned him Mr. Trump\u2019s trust, he continued to be in frequent phone contact with Mr. Trump until the election and beyond. Friends of Mr. Lewandowski say that he can see the windows of the White House residence from his lobbying office on Pennsylvania Avenue, and that the view is even better during his visits to the West Wing, including when the New England Patriots were there this past week.Newt GingrichThe former House speaker talks more with Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers than he does with the president, but his presence permeates the administration. Mr. Gingrich\u2019s former spokesman is at the State Department, and two former advisers work in the West Wing. Mr. Gingrich has relentlessly promoted Mr. Trump\u2019s policy adviser, Stephen Miller, as the West Wing conservative ballast as the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, has been under fire.Richard LeFrakTheir fathers were developers together in New York, and the two men have been friends for decades. Mr. LeFrak is a Mar-a-Lago member, and he agreed to be part of an infrastructure effort that Mr. Trump hopes to put forward. Mr. Trump has turned to him to vent frustrations about the slow pace of bureaucracy.Thomas Barrack Jr.Mr. Trump divides the people around him into broad categories: family, paid staff and wealthy men like Mr. Barrack whom he considers peers. A sunny and loyal near-billionaire who has socialized with the president for years, Mr. Barrack is less a strategic adviser than a trusted moneyman, fixer and sounding board who has often punctuated emails to Mr. Trump with exhortations like \u201cYOU ROCK!\u201d He has urged Mr. Trump to avoid needless, distracting fights.Under Mr. Barrack\u2019s leadership, Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee raised a record $106.7 million, much of it from big corporations, banks and Republican megadonors like the Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson. Mr. Barrack also helped usher Paul Manafort, the international political operative now under scrutiny for his ties to Russia, into the Trump fold last year. The velvet-voiced Mr. Barrack does not seek out attention for himself, one of the most important and elusive qualities by which the president judges people.Stephen SchwarzmanThe chairman and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, Mr. Schwarzman is the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory council. He and the president don\u2019t speak daily, West Wing aides said, but do talk frequently. Mr. Schwarzman has counseled him on a number of topics, including advising him to leave in place President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order shielding young undocumented immigrants, known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d from deportation.Steve RothA good way to get on Mr. Trump\u2019s side is to do a deal with him, particularly if it means rescuing him from his own financial crisis. That\u2019s what Mr. Roth, a real estate tycoon, did a decade ago when he bought out Mr. Trump\u2019s share in a West Side real estate deal that went sour. Mr. Roth, head of Vornado Realty Trust and a longtime Democratic donor, also helped Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, when he injected $80 million into 666 Fifth Avenue, a Kushner family property in danger of defaulting on $1.1 billion in loans. Mr. Trump speaks with Mr. Roth frequently, and is leaning on him to help develop a trillion-dollar infrastructure package expected this year.Phil RuffinMr. Trump has 20-odd business partners, but none is closer to him than Mr. Ruffin, 82, a Texas billionaire who has lent his ear and private jet. The president was best man at the 2008 wedding of Mr. Ruffin to his third wife, a 26-year-old model and former Miss Ukraine. Mr. Ruffin has a knack for showing up when Mr. Trump needs him most and remains a die-hard defender. \u201cThis stuff about him having financial investments all over Russia \u2014 that\u2019s just pure crap,\u201d Mr. Ruffin told Forbes. \u201cI went to Russia with him. We took my airplane. We were having lunch with one of the oligarchs there. No business was discussed.\u201dCarl IcahnRounding out Mr. Trump\u2019s roster of wealthy octogenarians is this 81-year-old corporate raider and real estate mogul, who occupies perhaps the most respected perch in the president\u2019s circle of businessmen buddies. The affection is longstanding: The Queens-bred Mr. Icahn has known Mr. Trump and his family for decades. It\u2019s also numerical: Mr. Icahn is worth an estimated $16 billion, a major plus in the eyes of a president who keeps score. Mr. Icahn serves as a free-roving economic counselor and the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to reduce government regulations on business.Roger J. Stone Jr.Few alliances in politics are as complicated as the 40-year relationship between the Nixon-tattooed Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump. Mr. Stone won\u2019t say how frequently they speak these days, but he shares the president\u2019s tear-down-the-system impulses and is ubiquitous on cable news, radio and the website InfoWars defending Mr. Trump.Ike PerlmutterMr. Perlmutter, the chief executive of Marvel Comics, who is so reclusive that there are few public photographs of him, has been informally advising Mr. Trump on veterans issues. The two men are old friends, and Mr. Perlmutter has been a presence at Mar-a-Lago.Robert KraftThe owner of the New England Patriots is a Democrat, but his loyalty to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kraft once said, dates partly to the president\u2019s thoughtfulness when Mr. Kraft\u2019s wife died. Mr. Trump loved talking about the Patriots during the campaign, and Mr. Kraft has been a Mar-a-Lago presence since the transition.Melania Trump Mrs. Trump is uninterested in the limelight, but she has remained a powerful adviser by telephone from New York. Among her roles: giving Mr. Trump feedback on media coverage, counseling him on staff choices and urging him, repeatedly, to tone down his Twitter feed. Lately, he has listened closely, and has a more disciplined Twitter finger.Chris ChristieMr. Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and palace gatekeeper, has shown a capacity to hobble his rivals, but few have been finished off. The most durable has been Mr. Christie, whose transition planning, several West Wing aides now concede, should not have been discarded. He has been a frequent Oval Office visitor and has worked with the White House on the opioid addiction crisis.Paul D. RyanMr. Trump and the clean-cut and wonky Wisconsinite aren\u2019t exactly best friends forever. But their relationship is closer than in the bad old days of the 2016 campaign when Mr. Ryan delayed a hold-my-nose endorsement of Mr. Trump, whose morality he had long questioned. But as the president\u2019s agenda passes through the razor-blade gantlet of the House, where Mr. Ryan faces the constant threat of opposition and overthrow, the two men have become foxhole buddies.Donald Trump Jr. and Eric TrumpThe two sons and the president insist they no longer discuss company business. But the family is close, and Mr. Trump still speaks to his sons frequently, inquiring about their lives and searching for gut-checks on his own.An article on Sunday about people outside the White House whose advice is sought by President Trump referred incorrectly to one such informal adviser, Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots. Mr. Kraft\u2019s loyalty to the president dates partly to Mr. Trump\u2019s thoughtfulness when Mr. Kraft\u2019s wife died, not when his father died. The article also referred imprecisely to the legal credentials of Sheri A. Dillon. While she has advised President Trump on ethics issues, she specializes in tax law; she is not an \u201cethics lawyer.\u201dClockwise from top left; Kevin Hagen for The New York Times, Al Drago/The New York Times (2), Kevin Hagen for The New York Times, Emily Berl for The New York Times, Andy Kropa/Invision, via Associated Press, Marc Serota for The New York Times, John Minchillo/Associated Press, Al Drago/The New York Times, Michael Loccisano/Getty Images, Joshua Roberts/Reuters, Jemal Countess/Getty Images, J.

As a holding company with a stake in the publicly traded Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corporation, LeEco was once just one of a number of Chinese online video streaming companies. But its founder, Jia Yueting, invested in a dizzying array of new business lines \u2014 movie production, smart TVs and phones, sports broadcasting and goods, electric cars and car sharing, cloud computing and online finance.The conglomerate embarked on a string of debt-financed acquisitions, including stakes in the Chinese electronics companies Coolpad Group and TCL Multimedia. LeEco also acquired the car sharing start-up Yidao Yongche.Mr. Jia adopted a high profile. He publicly pledged to take on Apple and Tesla and began wearing black hoodies and black long-sleeve shirts like the tech icons of Silicon Valley, adopting just the initials YT in contacts with his employees. Regarding Apple, last year he said the iPhone maker\u2019s pace of innovation had become \u201cextremely slow.\u201dThe year before that, Mr. Jia posted an image to one of his social media accounts comparing Apple to Hitler, though he later apologized.LeEco \u2014 a name that links its Chinese name Le with the word ecology, representing Mr. Jia\u2019s dream for a range of interconnected gadgets and services \u2014 also began looking abroad.Those dreams sent the shares of Leshi Internet soaring in 2015, and made Mr. Jia one of China\u2019s richest men on paper, according to the Hurun Report, which tracks the country\u2019s wealthy.But the pace of deals began to take a toll. A rising group of Chinese companies, including the longtime telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies, ramped up competition in smartphones, while LeEco faced well-funded rivals in areas like video streaming.\u201cThey think China\u2019s companies are copycats, plagiarists, incapable of big innovation,\u201d he told the audience in Beijing, according to a publicly filed transcript of the event, acknowledging that further debt financing would be harder to come by. \u201cOn the contrary, this is a country with heroic companies.\u201dIn the first nine months of 2016, the conglomerate\u2019s mobile affiliate alone posted an $820 million loss on $1.6 billion of revenue, according to investor materials seen by The New York Times.Other businesses face challenges: Electric cars are years away from mass production, and the smartphone market remains intensely competitive.LeEco\u2019s own suppliers have grown antsy. On Monday in Beijing, a dozen people who said they worked for unpaid suppliers held a sit-in in the lobby of LeEco\u2019s office tower. They were escorted into the company\u2019s offices before they could be interviewed.In January, workers from Tianjin Hong Furui Electronics, a company LeEco contracted for after-sales cellphone repairs, sat on a patch of grass in front of LeEco\u2019s office tower to protest.\u201cThey delayed our payments four or five months,\u201d said Jacky Yu, an employee in Hong Furui\u2019s sales department, adding that the bill totaled roughly $850,000 to $1 million.By March, the company had been paid and declined to comment further.The LeEco spokeswoman said the company had already solved some payment problems and was working on others.\u201cLeEco\u2019s earlier financial problems have already been systematically resolved,\u201d she said in the emailed statement. \u201cPrevious supplier problems are being resolved through multifaceted and innovative methods.\u201dYufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Singapore Is Creating More Land for Itself", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "The Climate IssueThe island off the southern tip of Malaysia reveals the future of building in an epoch of dwindling territory.Supported byAs a concept, underground reservoirs are not new. Sweden has been building them since the 1950s; a pair in the port of Gothenburg has a titanic capacity of 370 million gallons of oil. So the Jurong Rock Caverns are less an emblem of the marvels of technology than of the anxiety of a nation. Singapore is the 192nd-largest country in the world. Tinier than Tonga and just three-fifths the area of New York City, it has long fretted about its congenital puniness. \u201cBigger countries have the luxury of not having to think about this,\u201d said David Tan, the assistant chief executive of a government agency called the Jurong Town Corporation, which built Jurong Island as well as the caverns. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been acutely aware of our small size.\u201dThe caverns were designed to free up land above ground, Tan said. I remarked that the phrase \u201cfreeing up land\u201d occurs like clockwork in conversations with Singapore\u2019s planners. He laughed. Land is Singapore\u2019s most cherished resource and its dearest ambition. Since it became an independent nation 52 years ago, Singapore has, through assiduous land reclamation, grown in size by almost a quarter: to 277 square miles from 224. By 2030, the government wants Singapore to measure nearly 300 square miles.But reclaiming land from the ocean has its limits, particularly in an age of a warming planet. Scientists warn that by 2100, sea levels may rise by as much as six feet, and furious storms will pound our coasts. All over the world, the governments of small islands are working to respond to these hazards. Kiribati, an island nation in the Central Pacific, has bought 6,000 acres of forested land in Fiji, more than a thousand miles away, hoping to resettle some of its 100,000 people if a crisis hits. The Maldives, similarly, has talked about buying land in Australia. People have begun to leave Tuvalu, in the South Pacific; the Marshall Islands; and Nauru, in Micronesia. Five of the lowest Solomon Islands have already vanished. In humanity\u2019s battle to save itself from a harsher climate, these diminutive islands find themselves on the front lines.Most of these islands \u2014 in the Pacific or in Asia \u2014 are impoverished, reliant on larger nations for assistance and resources. Singapore is an exception. In countries ranked by per capita gross domestic product, it places fourth \u2014 far above Nauru, at 112, or Kiribati, at 212. Over the past half-century, building upon its function as one of the world\u2019s great ports, Singapore has turned into a capital of finance and services. The country is so devotedly pro-business that it can feel like a corporation; its constitution includes several pages on how the government\u2019s investments should be managed. Singapore doesn\u2019t reveal how much money its two sovereign wealth funds administer, but a senior economist at the Macquarie Group estimated their value at just under a trillion dollars.Among the world\u2019s smattering of small islands, then, Singapore, with a population of 5.6 million, is a special case: a country that\u2019s also a city, a government that owns 90 percent of all real estate, a one-party state in all but name. But how it fends off the ocean will be of deep interest to many other populous and productive cities near the water: New York, Miami, Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai, Guangzhou, all miniature nations of a sort.Much of Singapore lies less than 50 feet above sea level. A third of the island sits around 16 feet above the water \u2014 low enough to give planners the jitters. Coastal roads are being raised; a new airport terminal is being built 18 feet above sea level. All the while, the island receives more and more rain each year. \u201cIf global temperatures continue to rise,\u201d a government official said last year, \u201cmany parts of Singapore could eventually be submerged.\u201dThe Jurong Rock Caverns are just one answer to a pair of intriguing questions: What does a tremendously rich and ambitious country do when it is running out of land? And what can the rest of the world learn from these experiments?The island is still awash in his apprehensions. Bureaucrats assemble reports on topics like Maximizing Value From Land as a Scarce Resource. The government works from a Concept Plan, a land-use scheme that looks half a century into the future; the plan itself is reviewed every 10 years. On the first floor of a city museum in the Urban Redevelopment Authority building, a wall is engraved with letters that spell SMALL ISLAND. It\u2019s not until the second floor that the second half of the message materializes: BIG PLANS.A 10-minute walk from the museum is Boat Quay, the site of the island\u2019s very first land reclamation. In 1822, having just colonized Singapore, the British dismantled a hill and packed the material along the bank of the Singapore River. \u201cSome two or three hundred laborers were paid one rupee per head per day to dig and carry the earth,\u201d Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, who acted as an informal secretary to British officials at the time, wrote in his 1849 memoir. \u201cEvery afternoon, sacks of money were brought to pay the workmen.\u201d Boat Quay\u2019s old shop-houses \u2014 shops that doubled as their owners\u2019 residences \u2014 have been converted into restaurants, bars and massage parlors. In the evenings, the tables heave with workers from the nearby financial district, much like Manhattan\u2019s South Street Seaport and other ribbons of waterfront realty around the world. In the spirit of preservation, the buildings of Boat Quay have remained low, crouched close to the ground. One street away, however, Singapore\u2019s skyscrapers begin in earnest. At the spot where the hill was broken down and carted off to build Boat Quay, there now stands One Raffles Place, clad in steel and glass, taller, in all probability, than its rock-and-mud forefather.Lim is able to narrate, practically by himself, a fine-grained history of the island\u2019s reclamation projects. He pointed me to one of the videos in \u201cSea State,\u201d which he has uploaded onto Vimeo. It stars an engineer who surveyed Singapore\u2019s neighborhoods in the 1990s to determine where it would be best to haul away sand for reclamation. Close to the coast, he found more silt than sand, so he and his colleagues went farther out to sea, to \u201csuck the sand into the barges and deliver the sand over to Singapore.\u201d Once, having strayed into Indonesia\u2019s territorial waters without a permit, they were arrested. \u201cWe weren\u2019t criminals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were just doing our job.\u201dSeveral countries have tired of feeding Singapore\u2019s endless appetite for sand; Indonesia, Malaysia and, most recently, Cambodia have halted exports altogether. These bans have affected some of Singapore\u2019s reclamation schedules, David Tan said, although he insisted that the supply lines from Myanmar were \u201cstill robust.\u201d In any case, Singapore is trying to shrink its reliance on sand imports. \u201cWe do a lot of tunneling work for the subway, so that material goes into reclamation,\u201d he said. Most of the infill in the reclamations under a coming shipping-container terminal \u2014 planned to be the world\u2019s largest \u2014 is rock and soil debris from construction projects.But the desire to reclaim never-ending shelves of land, farther and farther into the sea, will inevitably be outfoxed by physics. On a whiteboard, Tan drew me a diagram of the process: first, building a wall in the water, reaching all the way down into the seabed; next, draining the water behind the wall and replacing it with infill. As the ocean grows less shallow, it becomes harder and harder to build the wall, to stabilize the infill, to protect it all from collapse. \u201cWe\u2019re already reclaiming in water that is 20 meters deep,\u201d Tan said. \u201cMaybe it would be viable to reclaim in 30 meters, if land prices go up. But 40 and 50 meters would be very difficult. It\u2019s physically difficult and economically unviable.\u201dLim had told me that Singapore holds a strategic sand reserve, for emergencies. It lies somewhere in the area called Bedok, he said. I spotted it one day as I rode past in a taxi. The site was strewn with No Trespassing signs installed by the Housing and Development Board, a government agency. Fenced off from the public, the giant trapezoidal dunes shone bone-white in the sun and caramel in the shade, as the sand waited to be summoned.C.M. Wang, a professor of civil engineering at the National University of Singapore, served as a project reviewer for L2 NIC, sifting through proposals for how Singapore might create more space. Wang even has an idea of his own. Approached by Singapore\u2019s ports authority six years ago, he developed and patented a way for coastal cities to create land in the sea. At least, this is the way his staple PowerPoint presentation describes his idea for Very Large Floating Structures, which can bob about on the ocean, hold a range of facilities and \u201cfree up land.\u201d \u201cSingapore is the largest bunkering base in the world,\u201d Wang told me when I went to see him in his office at the university. \u201cShips sail from the Suez, where they refuel, and then the next refueling stop is Singapore.\u201d To be the Texaco station of the high seas, the island needs to maintain vast farms of oil tanks, enough to store the 53.6 million tons of fuel sold to ships last year.\u201cA logical move would be to store fuel in the sea, because fuel is lighter than water, so it should float,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWhat we need is a skin to go around it, a container.\u201d He sketched a plan on a scrap of paper: two rectangular concrete decks laid out in parallel, holding oil tanks made of prestressed concrete partly submerged in the water. A ship could slide between the two decks, refuel and steam back out. Wang is working on making his design more economical, but he already has other ideas for floats. On his computer, he flicked through them: dormitories, a restaurant that resembles a crab, bridges, even miniature cities. Last October, to test a proposal from two government agencies, Singapore floated a hectare of solar panels in one of its reservoirs; it hopes, eventually, to build a four-gigawatt solar plant at sea.Wang urged me to visit the Float at Marina Bay, the world\u2019s largest floating stage, a 107,000-square-foot slice of steel that clings to the lip of Singapore\u2019s esplanade. The afternoon I went, a shroud of smog covered an already sunless sky, and the artificial grass on the Float\u2019s soccer field seemed wan and uninviting. Life preservers were fastened to the railings around the field, lest a player tumble into the sea. I sat on a bench for a while, with my back to the skyscrapers, watching office workers limber up for a friendly game. They looked happy enough with this insertion of playtime into their day, but watching them rattle around on this unnatural parcel of green was, somehow, dispiriting.Still, unnaturalness may well be the world\u2019s conceivable future; certainly it will be Singapore\u2019s, as the country prepares to terraform itself in search of space. There will be more underground caverns, David Tan told me: a warren of research laboratories within the folds of Kent Ridge, right under the university; perhaps a warehousing facility beneath Jurong Bird Park. \u201cMost of this space will be for industrial use,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t likely to live underground.\u201d The island\u2019s geology \u2014 a heart of granite in the west, compacted alluvium in the east \u2014 is such that most of it could be hollowed out. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying we should use it all,\u201d he went on, in the tone of an eminently prudent man. Then he added, \u201cBut we can use two-thirds of it.\u201dSingapore also plans to reclaim its air. \u201cTwelve percent of the island is occupied by roads,\u201d Tan said. \u201cWhat\u2019s above roads? Nothing! If you put roads under buildings, you free up some land.\u201d Sky bridges and midair concourses are already a part of some public-housing estates. As Wang told me: \u201cIn the future, you might see a little town or offices above the expressways. We might create space above our container ports.\u201dSingapore already has high-rise factories: towers occupied by dozens of manufacturing units, all sharing amenities like cargo elevators, electricity and truck ramps. Since 2012, the government has funded vertical farms, shelves of aluminum planters that grow spinach, lettuce and Chinese cabbage. Singapore grows only 7 percent of its food, having decided long ago that its land has more profitable uses. In the 1980s, it began dispatching its pig farms to outlying Indonesian islands like Batam, which still supplies Singapore with pork. The government has invested $380 million in agricultural projects in Australia, and it is renting land in northeast China to build itself a farm that will measure double the area of the island of Singapore. The farm will take 15 years to complete and will cost $18 billion. Given enough ready money, thorny issues of territorial sovereignty swiftly dissolve.Whether many of these ventures will bear fruit is difficult to say. When you\u2019re talking to a typically matter-of-fact city planner, each of these ideas seems to possess the heft of certainty. Collected together, though, this vision of Singapore \u2014 on the ground and under it, in the air and beneath the sea, a city and a country and a transnational entity all at once \u2014 feels fantastic. Then again, even Singapore as it is \u2014 born a slum-ridden speck with no oil, no hinterland and a volatile mix of ethnicities, raised with an authoritarian hand and transformed into one of the most prosperous, most politically meek nations on earth \u2014 even this Singapore tugs at the bounds of our credulity.The Bukit Brown Municipal Cemetery lies as close to Singapore\u2019s geographical midpoint as is possible without intruding into the grounds of the Singapore Island Country Club. No one has been buried here since 1973, but it still holds more than 200,000 human remains within its 400 acres, making it one of the largest Chinese graveyards outside China. Burials began on this site in the 1830s, and the interred include several Singaporean pioneers, men and women who settled and built the island. Someone told me that the man who introduced the governess Anna Leonowens to the king of Siam was buried in a Bukit Brown tomb, but the casual visitor will be hard-pressed to find it. The cemetery is so overgrown with weeds that it is one of Singapore\u2019s few truly untended spaces. There is no signage, and most inscriptions are in Chinese. The tombs are dignified affairs, shaped like thrones, broad enough to hold full families. On some of the short plinths, in front of the headstone, people had placed lighted joss sticks that had long since burned down; only their stems remained, like the surviving bristles of an ancient toothbrush.One side of the path into the cemetery was lined with a green metal fence hiding construction work on a new expressway that will soon tear through the heart of Bukit Brown. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that graveyard in the center of the island forever,\u201d a former city planner told me. Singapore prefers columbaria, in which urns of cremated remains are stored in cavities on a wall. \u201cAll our graves are high-rise too!\u201d he said with a laugh. A group of citizens is campaigning to save Bukit Brown, calling it a vital piece of the island\u2019s heritage, but more than 4,000 graves have already been exhumed, and the ground that contained them has been leveled.In a restless polity, such single-mindedness would earn the ruling party a risky degree of unpopularity, but nothing seems to dent the P.A.P. It won an election in 2011, even though Singaporeans were angry over housing shortages and an overburdened public-transportation system. It won even more handily in 2015, after land prices rose by 30 percent three years in a row and after the government\u2019s migration-led population target of 6.9 million by 2030 \u2014 necessary to fill out the work force, but also a strain on the island\u2019s finite resources \u2014 kindled a public protest, a singular event in this country. But stopping the state from doing something it wants to do is, in Singapore, a task primed for defeat. An inert citizenry gives the government the freest of hands in confronting climate change, just as it does in every other sphere, far into the foreseeable future.The wind rose and fell in heavy gusts; Lim\u2019s hair, tousled even indoors, grew still more animated. He pointed out a man-made hill eastward along the coast from the marina, where trucks and earthmovers milled about. This was the Changi East reclamation: more than a thousand hectares of land, designed to hold the new airport terminal and its three runways. In trying to edge closer, we must have wandered into sensitive waters. A loudspeaker screamed from the naval base, punctuated by three types of sirens: \u201cYou are entering a prohibited area! Please clear now!\u201d Lim instructed me to pull at various ropes, and we tacked hurriedly out.A couple of hours after we cast off, we came upon Tekong Island, sitting in the strait between Singapore and Malaysia, owned by the former but nearer the latter. The two countries bickered over reclamation activities here in 2002; it took three years of negotiations before Singapore could proceed. The part of the island where Singapore\u2019s army units train was a smoky smudge on the horizon. Our boat nuzzled against a rock wall that marked out reclamation work. The wall began on the northern coast of the island, ran eastward to sea and then looped back to a point on the southern coast. In outline, it resembled a porpoise\u2019s nose.\u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d Lim said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here.\u201d No trucks, no security guards, no bulldozers. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve stopped work because of a shortage of sand.\u201dLim held the boat steady while I waded into the shallows for a better look, careful not to trespass on the island. The rocks underfoot were slick, and I barked my shin.\u201cHow does it look?\u201d Lim called.A few feet from the outer wall was an inner one, and packed between the two was sand: lovely, pristine sand the color of milky Ovaltine. It was held firm and tight in its sleeve of rock, its surface so level that had I walked on it, I might have been the first visitor on undiscovered land. Trapped beyond the inner wall was a low pool of water, yet to be filled in. Around us, the ocean lay idle in the sun, ready to challenge Singapore\u2019s ingenuity with its patient, adamant rise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank Lending Stalls on Doubts About Trump\u2019s Pro-Growth Agenda", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byMany business owners and corporate executives have expressed unbridled optimism that President Trump can fuel economic growth and increase their profits.Their borrowing habits, however, may tell a different story.Some of the nation\u2019s top bankers said on Thursday that businesses were feeling less certain that Mr. Trump can pull off his ambitious agenda to deregulate and cut taxes.\u201cThey all want to believe that there is more growth ahead, but they need to see something out there before they act,\u201d John Shrewsberry, the chief financial officer of Wells Fargo, said in an interview.Wells Fargo, a leading lender to American consumers and businesses, said its outstanding loans in the first quarter had increased just 1 percent from a year earlier.Citigroup, which has a large global presence operating in dozens of countries, said its lending growth wasn\u2019t that much larger, with overall loans rising 2 percent.Earnings reports on Thursday from three of the nation\u2019s biggest banks \u2014 Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase \u2014 offered the latest indications that corporate America and Wall Street were giving a more sober assessment to the feasibility of the growth-focused Trump agenda.The results followed recent signs that lending has been slowing, and in some cases declining more broadly in the banking industry. Data from the Federal Reserve showed that lending in February was flat, while lending to manufacturers and energy companies was in decline, after many months of growth.\u201cIf this continues, it is definitely concerning,\u201d said Leo Mourelatos, a United States country risk analyst with BMI Research. \u201cIt would signal that the U.S. economy is much weaker than the current consensus.\u201dYet the banking data may be sending out some mixed signals.Some economists said the lending decline reflected in the Federal Reserve data \u2014 particularly commercial and industrial loans \u2014 was driven not by any broad weakness or lack of confidence but by a decrease in energy lending because of low oil prices.Another factor was the paring of business inventories. Businesses typically borrow from banks to purchase inventories of goods and parts. With smaller inventories, businesses need fewer loans.Bank loans are also not the only way that companies can borrow. Large corporations in particular have also been able to tap the bond market for financing, which may also be taking a share from bank lending.Executives at the nation\u2019s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, played down concerns about slowing loan growth, noting that its loans had risen 6 percent from a year ago.\u201cU.S. consumers and businesses are healthy over all and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve,\u201d said the bank\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon.On a conference call with analysts on Thursday, Mr. Dimon said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t overreact to the short-term thing about loan growth.\u201dHe added that it took time for a new administration to push through an agenda and counseled patience. \u201cTo expect it to be to be smooth sailing would just be silly,\u201d Mr. Dimon said.It was just such optimistic expectations that helped drive a powerful rally in the stock market after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Recently, stock prices have been weaker as investors have grown a bit more pessimistic. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index fell 0.68 percent on Thursday, led by energy and financial shares. For the holiday-shortened week, the index closed down 1.1. percent.Mr. Shrewsberry of Wells Fargo noted that the optimism about a pro-growth agenda had buoyed the spirits of business community after the election and into February.But after the health care overhaul failed, he noted a change. \u201cThere is more waiting and seeing going on,\u201d he said.Citigroup\u2019s chief financial officer, John Gerspach, also said businesses might be looking for more certainty from Washington before ramping up their borrowing.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen concrete changes yet in policies,\u201d Mr. Gerspach said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday.The banks themselves are also waiting to see whether President Trump delivers on his promise to roll back the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a financial regulatory overhaul passed in the wake of the financial crisis that has required banks to hold increasingly more capital and restrict certain types of trading.At the same time, the Trump administration has thrown the banking industry a curveball by raising the possibility of restoring a version of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which required banks to separate their commercial and investment banking activities. The idea also has the support of liberals like Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and one of Wall Street\u2019s toughest critics.The Glass-Steagall law was repealed in 1999, paving the way for the creation of sprawling mega-banks like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.Big banks have argued that the current model \u2014 in which banks fund their investment banking activity with customers\u2019 deposits \u2014 has helped provide credit to companies and consumers across the world. It is at the core of the large bank\u2019s profits, giving them a big advantage over smaller competitors.Efforts to bring back Glass-Steagall \u2014 which would effectively break up the big banks \u2014 has left the industry slightly perplexed.\u201cI would have to wonder how that would be consistent with deregulation or boosting growth, which is the goal of this administration,\u201d Mr. Gerspach, the Citigroup chief financial officer, said on Thursday.Kate Kelly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall \u2018Will Get Built,\u2019 Trump Insists, as He Drops Funding Demand", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump insisted on Tuesday that he remained committed to his hotly disputed plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, despite backing off a demand that the project be funded in a short-term spending measure that must be passed by Friday to avoid a government shutdown.By easing off the proposal for a down payment on wall construction, Mr. Trump may have cleared one of the biggest obstacles to passage of the spending bill before financing for most government operations expires at the end of the week.Mr. Trump told a group of conservative journalists at the White House on Monday evening that he might accept a spending bill that included money for border security without setting aside as much as he had sought for the wall.The current spending legislation would keep the government operating through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. But the president could refocus his battle for wall construction in spending bills for the next fiscal year.Democrats welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s decision not to hold out for the money this week. \u201cIt would remove the prospect of a needless fight over a poison-pill proposal that members of both parties don\u2019t support,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said on the Senate floor.The promise to build a wall \u2014 or actually to extend a series of barriers that already exist on part of the border \u2014 was a central theme of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign last year. Not only would he protect the United States from a tide of immigrants coming across the border illegally, he said, Mexico itself would pay for it.But the cost estimates for the wall have gone up, and Mexico has made clear it has no intention of spending money on it.Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Monday that Mr. Trump was still determined to make Mexico pay, but that he would proceed first with American tax dollars.\u201cThe president has been very clear\u201d that \u201cin order to get the ball rolling on border security and the wall, that he was going to have to use the current appropriations process,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cBut he would make sure that that promise would be kept as far as the payment of it.\u201dSo, he was asked, Mexico will eventually pay? \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Spicer said.Even without the wall, illegal crossings of the Southwest border have been falling drastically.As lawmakers on Capitol Hill continued feverish negotiations on Tuesday, White House and Senate staff members seemed to agree that the wall had been reduced to something like a metaphor for broad-based border security funding, which is all but certain to end up in a final spending package.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, suggested that Congress could well meet its Friday night deadline to get a funding package completed. \u201cThese talks have been part of a bipartisan bicameral process from the start,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to more productive conversations with senators, our House colleagues and the White House so that we can get this important work done soon.\u201dBut other issues remain.But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have strikingly avoided the sort of inflamed talk that is often a part of fights over budgets, suggesting that Republicans and Democrats alike have gotten much of what they wanted in the spending bill.Matt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facing Tough Odds in French Vote, Le Pen Assails Macron", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byNICE, France \u2014 France\u2019s far-right presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, came out swinging against her centrist opponent, Emmanuel Macron, on Thursday night, depicting him as an unpatriotic out-of-touch banker in a tough, slashing speech intended to fuel her uphill bid for an upset in the May 7 runoff.The showdown is a clash of opposites, a contest between her superheated anti-immigrant, xenophobic language and his cool and lofty formulas for restoring France\u2019s economy while upholding its global alliances. On Thursday, to an adoring crowd of thousands in Nice, Ms. Le Pen made the most of that contrast in her first speech since finishing second in the first round of voting on Sunday.Mr. Macron, a former economy minister and banker, was a \u201cglobalist,\u201d an \u201cimmigrationist\u201d and someone who is capable of cutting himself off from the country, Ms. Le Pen roared to flag-waving supporters at a vast auditorium at the edge of town. The boos for Mr. Macron lasted for minutes.Still, the odds are sharply against her. Polls show Ms. Le Pen trailing by more than 20 percent. But in the last few days, she has gained some momentum while Mr. Macron has stumbled since the first round.Mr. Macron has dropped slightly in some polls, and commentators have suggested that his campaign is stagnating.Ms. Le Pen came bounding onto the stage at the Palais Nikaia on Thursday night, evidently buoyed by the media attention of the last few days. She immediately lashed out at her younger and more inexperienced opponent, questioning his patriotism, and in one of the far right\u2019s oldest tropes, suggesting that his policies meant that he was not French enough.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to call himself a patriot,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said.\u201cIt\u2019s like the pyromaniac who wants to be called a fireman,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is a referendum for or against France. I ask you to choose France. His horizon is the devalorization of France.\u201d\u201cI think he could be a good banker,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the insensitivity of that profession, with no conscience for the human consequences of his decisions.\u201dAfter Mr. Macron was shown on Wednesday in television images sitting stiffly in a room with union officials while Ms. Le Pen was taking selfies with factory workers nearby, the former economy minister tried to show a more human side on Thursday, kicking a soccer ball around in an immigrant Paris suburb where \u201cMrs. Le Pen can\u2019t come,\u201d he said, because \u201cshe wants them all to get out.\u201dBut in a possibly ominous sign for Mr. Macron, thousands of people demonstrated against both candidates in several cities across France, shouting for the so-called neither-nor option. A low turnout in the second round would help Ms. Le Pen, and she appears to be acutely aware of that. On Thursday she repeatedly tried to sow doubt about her opponent\u2019s commitment to the welfare of the working class, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s base of support, which she wants to grab.\u201cWhose ambitions is he really serving?\u201d she asked.\u201cHe\u2019s preparing a lightning strike against the workers,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said. \u201cThe country that Emmanuel Macron wants is not a country anymore. It\u2019s a place where the law of the strongest rules.\u201dAnd in Nice, a city still reeling from a terrorist attack in July that killed dozens, she painted a picture of an Islamist menace, vowing to confront \u201cprovocations from the Islamists in the cafeterias, in the hospitals, in the streets.\u201d As is often the case in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s speeches, this was linked to what she calls \u201cthe migratory submersion,\u201d identified with her opponent.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s aides said before Thursday\u2019s rally that they were convinced that she was gaining momentum, for the moment. Mr. Macron \u201chas revealed himself as the puppet of the old system, of the right and the left,\u201d said Gilbert Collard, one of only two lawmakers affiliated with Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front and a constant presence at her side. \u201cHe\u2019s shown his inconsistency,\u201d Mr. Collard said. \u201cThere\u2019s a dynamic there, for sure.\u201dMr. Macron \u201cis trying to defy her,\u201d said Julien Sanchez, a leading National Front mayor in the south. \u201cHe realizes he\u2019s lost something, and he\u2019s trying to catch up.\u201dThose words were echoed by her fans in the stands, as were the candidate\u2019s now familiar anti-immigrant themes. Mr. Macron \u201cdoesn\u2019t have enough experience,\u201d said Sandrine Berett, an office manager. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop giving handouts to foreigners,\u201d Ms. Berett said. \u201cThey come here just to profit from the system.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California\u2019s Marrakesh: A Country Club That\u2019s Chic Again", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byPALM DESERT, Calif. \u2014 It was Jingle Mingle Night at the Marrakesh Country Club. Inside its serpentine pink walls, past the entry gazebo\u2019s cone roof, up the drive flanked by petunia beds and olive trees clipped like standard poodles, a line of cars disgorged guests swathed in Santa suits and stocking caps and sweaters with blinking LED lights.Sawing into a slab of prime rib, Stephen Drucker, the former editor of several lifestyle publications, announced that he had just spruced up the portico of his Marrakesh villa with a pair of white canvas drapes \u2014 an Old Hollywood touch, he said, that reminded him of \u201cthose birthday parties where \u2018Uncle\u2019 Gary Cooper would take little Christina Crawford for a pony ride.\u201d\u201cExactly the kind of thing I\u2019m excited the committee is making provisions for,\u201d said Steven Price, an architecture historian who wears his silver hair in a bob, referring to the club\u2019s Architecture and Landscape Committee.Patrick Dragonette, a modern furniture dealer from Los Angeles, concurred. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the house with the pushed-out columns,\u201d he said, his undertone the verbal equivalent of a raised eyebrow. \u201cNobody is happy about it.\u201d\u201cThe desert used to be driven by golf,\u201d Mr. Drucker said. \u201cNow the big engine of the economy in the desert, certainly Palm Springs, is style. You can\u2019t buy architecture of this quality, at this price, in Palm Springs.\u201dIn 1967, when Mr. Bono was still married to Cher, an amateur golfer and golf course architect named Johnny Dawson (he also developed Thunderbird Country Club in Rancho Mirage and Eldorado Country Club in Indian Wells) leased 155 acres in Palm Desert and, inspired by the property\u2019s similarities to the Atlas Mountains-ringed city of Marrakesh, conceived of a new club with a Moroccan theme. The community\u2019s salmon-pink palette was suggested by the rosy sandstone walls, and its hilltop clubhouse, introduced by a Middle Eastern-style water stair, was placed to overlook the villas like a casbah surveying so many riads.After that, the Moroccan trope kind of trails off. That is because John Woolf, hired to design the club in 1968, had a vernacular all his own. Mr. Woolf had come to Los Angeles from Atlanta to become an actor \u2014 he hoped his Southern roots would help land him a role in \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d But he had also studied architecture at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and when the acting career fizzled, he leveraged his Hollywood ties to become an architect to the stars.In the Los Angeles real-estate market, Woolf houses are considered trophies. Recent owners of the designer\u2019s homes include the producer John Goldwyn and his husband, the hotelier Jeff Klein; the designer Nate Berkus and the night life impresario Sean MacPherson. Last fall, Jill Tavelman Collins (the former wife of Phil Collins, mother of Lilly) bought a Woolf house in Beverly Hills for $12.5 million, 40 percent over the asking price.The one-, two- and three-bedroom duplex villas at Marrakesh, while more modest in both scale and price \u2014 units can still be had for under $400,000 \u2014 do not stint on Woolfian drama. They all have deep courtyards, tiered mansard roofs and tall, skinny front doors that make anyone passing through them feel like Loretta Young (who had a Woolf house). Inside there are 10-foot ceilings, closets the size of bedrooms and airy atriums off the master baths.\u201cThe kitchens were clearly designed for some sort of staff person to slip in every day through a side door,\u201d Mr. Drucker said. \u201cPrepare the chicken salad, read a magazine on a little stepladder and then come serve the ladies in the corner of the living room designed for bridge parties.\u201d Originally marketed to the local gentry (specifically members of the Los Angeles Country Club) as well as snowbirds from Canada and Chicago, Marrakesh memberships offered a slice of the good life early-1970s-style. Picture a Cadillac or a Lincoln, a station wagon and a golf cart in every oversize garage.The promise of that era is enshrined at a bougainvillea-draped condo between the eighth green and the ninth tee. The unit, which Ann Judy, a Santa Ynez Valley resident, inherited from her parents, has remained virtually untouched since it was first decorated over four decades ago. Its original color scheme of white and lime green extends from a white shag rug and floral print drapes to white and green dishes to a Zenith television encased in white lacquer trimmed with the drapery fabric. You can almost hear Karen Carpenter singing \u201cClose to You.\u201d\u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, why fix it?\u201d Ms. Judy said. \u201cIt\u2019s light, it\u2019s bright, it\u2019s fun. And unique.\u201dOne could argue that, despite the consistency of their exteriors, every residence at Marrakesh is unique. \u201cWoolf designed these clean Hollywood Regency shells that gave every owner the ability to adapt them,\u201d Mr. Dragonette said.In his home, Mr. Drucker channeled \u201cRobsjohn-Gibbings in Athens,\u201d he said, referring to the historicist designer\u2019s apartment overlooking the Acropolis.

Until recently the club leased the property it sits on from a private owner, but in fall 2015, it bought the land. Since then, property values have surged \u2014 as have the ambitions of local remodelers.

He now works for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency tasked with finding and deporting people living in the United States illegally.His last Twitter post, on Jan. 20, read simply: \u201cIt\u2019s time to make immigration policy great again.\u201dIt's time to make immigration policy great again.For years, a network of immigration hard-liners in Washington was known chiefly for fending off proposals to legalize the status of more people. But with the election of a like-minded president, these groups have moved unexpectedly from defense to offense, with some of their leaders now in positions to carry out their agenda on a national scale.Julie Kirchner, who served for a decade as executive director of the organization, also known as FAIR, is now working as an adviser to the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. Kellyanne Conway, before she was known for campaign work and spirited defenses of Mr. Trump on cable television, worked regularly as a pollster for FAIR.\u201cYou would have to go to the 1920s and 1930s to find a comparable period in which you could point to people within the executive agencies and the White House who favored significant restrictions,\u201d Mr. Tichenor said.Their influence is already being felt. Mr. Trump is known for his sound-bite-ready pledges to deport millions of people here illegally and to build a border wall, but some of the administration\u2019s more technical yet critical changes to immigration procedures came directly from officials with long ties to the hard-line groups.These include expanding cooperation between immigration agents and local law enforcement officials; cracking down on \u201csanctuary cities\u201d; making it more difficult for migrants to successfully claim asylum; allowing the Border Patrol access to all federal lands; and curtailing the practice of \u201ccatch and release,\u201d in which undocumented immigrants are released from detention while their cases plod through the courts.\u201cTrump has put together the people who are taking this thing down to the operating-instruction level,\u201d Mr. Stein said.Even those who have labored for decades to scale back immigration did not expect such a dramatic change. \u201cThis is inconceivable a year ago,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s almost inconceivable six months ago.\u201dWhen Mr. Feere asked him for a leave of absence to work on the Trump campaign, Mr. Krikorian said he granted it without necessarily expecting it to lead anywhere. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t think that would pan out,\u201d he said, but recalled telling Mr. Feere, \u201cLook, you know we\u2019ve always got a job for you if it doesn\u2019t work out.\u201dDr. Tanton came under sharp criticism for corresponding with white nationalists and for couching the fight to reduce immigration as a racial and demographic struggle. \u201cFor European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that,\u201d Dr. Tanton once wrote to a friend, elsewhere expressing his fear of a \u201cLatin onslaught.\u201dThe Southern Poverty Law Center has long been especially critical of FAIR, which had in the past received money from the Pioneer Fund, a foundation that has financed research on the relationship between race and intelligence. Mr. Stein of FAIR rejected the attacks as politically motivated, prompted by the group\u2019s success in helping defeat an immigration overhaul in Congress.This month, FAIR filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service accusing the Southern Poverty Law Center of committing \u201cflagrant and intentional\u201d violations of its tax-exempt status by criticizing Republican candidates during the 2016 presidential race.Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said it never crossed the line into improper political activity. \u201cI think we have an obligation to expose hate not just in the dark corners of our society but also in the mainstream,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten under FAIR\u2019s skin many times, and now they feel like they have allies in the administration and they\u2019re going for it.\u201dAlthough immigration advocates call them xenophobic, people at all three groups say they do not like to be labeled anti-immigrant; the Center for Immigration Studies uses the motto \u201clow immigration, pro-immigrant\u201d on its website. They say they just expect to see the nation\u2019s immigration laws enforced and that those living here illegally are caught and deported.They also say they want legal immigration brought down to what they view as more sustainable levels, in particular to help buoy the wages of lower-income Americans who compete with unskilled migrants on the bottom rungs of the work force.\u201cThe average American basically likes the idea of immigration, maybe loves the concept \u2014 it\u2019s played an important historic role in our history \u2014 but would be perfectly fine if we didn\u2019t have another immigrant for 50 years,\u201d Mr. Stein said.FAIR lobbies members of Congress and their staff from its offices on Massachusetts Avenue, a short walk from Capitol Hill, while maintaining strong contacts with talk-radio hosts. There is even a radio studio in the group\u2019s office.With roughly two dozen staff members and fellows, the Center for Immigration Studies provides research, filling the traditional think-tank role.\u201cWe feel like we are going to continue to need to bring grass-roots influence on this administration because there\u2019s a lot of competing interests,\u201d said Mr. Beck of NumbersUSA.\u201cThe biggest enemy we face right now is complacency,\u201d Mr. Stein of FAIR said, \u201cbecause Trump\u2019s people have our ideas.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When clients seek his help with a loan default, he said, \u201cI assume they\u2019ll have a refund issue.\u201dThe government notifies borrowers ahead of time that their refunds (and other expected government payments) may be withheld. However, borrowers may not always receive the notices, perhaps because they have moved. Or they may simply be overwhelmed by their financial circumstances and fail to open their mail, said Betsy Mayotte, director of consumer outreach at American Student Assistance.(American Student Assistance, a private nonprofit that has owned and managed student debt since its early days as a federal loan guarantor, now offers counseling and educational services to help families make decisions about college financing.)\u201cMost people don\u2019t know it\u2019s coming,\u201d Mr. Minsky said.The average federal tax refund is about $2,800, according to the Internal Revenue Service \u2014 which means that missing out on a refund may have a big impact on a borrower\u2019s finances.About eight million federal student loan borrowers were in default at the end of last year, according to Department of Education statistics. (Most federal loans are deemed in default when no payment has been made for 270 days, or about nine months.)The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for information about the number of tax refunds that are withheld because of delinquent student loans.Here are some questions and answers about tax refund offsets:Can I prevent the offset of my tax refund?If a borrower is married and the couple files a joint tax return, Mr. Minsky said, the borrower\u2019s husband or wife can file a claim with the I.R.S. to receive the portion of the refund due him or her.How can I stop the continued withholding of my tax refunds?The government can withhold refunds and apply them to your student loan balance as long as the loans are in default. While some borrowers may actually see that as a repayment strategy, Ms. Mayotte said, \u201cWe encourage people to get into a long-term, sustainable payment plan.\u201dWith rehabilitation, the borrower agrees to make nine affordable, on-time payments to return the loan to good standing \u2014 and then may be eligible for flexible programs that lower monthly payments based on the person\u2019s income.With loan consolidation, the borrower refinances the defaulted loans into a new loan.Do tax refunds withheld while my loans were in default count toward the nine payments needed to rehabilitate my loans?No. Payments must be made voluntarily to count toward the rehabilitation agreement, the Education Department says.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Savages News Media at Rally to Mark His 100th Day", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byHARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 President Trump came to a farm expo center here on Saturday to celebrate his first 100 days in office by bathing in the support of his bedrock supporters, reprising the populist themes of his campaign and savaging a familiar foe: the news media.In a rally timed to coincide with an annual dinner of the White House press corps in Washington, which he declined to attend, Mr. Trump laced into what he referred to as \u201cthe failing New York Times,\u201d as well as CNN and MSNBC, which he accused of incompetence and dishonesty.\u201cTheir priorities are not my priorities, and not your priorities,\u201d Mr. Trump said to a sea of supporters, many in familiar red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps. \u201cIf the media\u2019s job is to be honest and tell the truth, the media deserves a very, very big fat failing grade,\u201d he said, adding that they were \u201cvery dishonest people.\u201dThe crowd responded with a chorus of boos and chants of \u201cCNN sucks,\u201d some turning to jeer reporters. Mr. Trump was interrupted several times by protesters, who were escorted out of the arena by the police, under a rain of catcalls and shouts that recalled the most bitter days of the campaign.Mr. Trump saved some of his most colorful vitriol for The Times, lampooning its sale of its headquarters near Times Square \u2014 a \u201ccathedral to journalism\u201d \u2014 to move into a \u201cvery ugly office building in a very crummy location.\u201d The new Times Tower, designed by the architect Renzo Piano, sits across the street from the Port Authority bus terminal on the West Side of Manhattan.\u201cThey covered it so badly,\u201d he said of the presidential campaign, \u201cthat they felt they were forced to apologize because their predictions were so bad.\u201d The Times did not apologize for its election coverage.After a turbulent debut in the White House, Mr. Trump spent the past week celebrating the achievements of his first 100 days. But his rally on Saturday took on a darker hue, filled with anger and resentment. He touched on familiar themes of lawless immigrants, unfair trade deals and a corrupt Washington establishment.Yet Mr. Trump thoroughly reversed his hard line on another adversary: China. Citing the support of President Xi Jinping in pressuring the rogue government in North Korea, he said it would have been counterproductive to label the Chinese as currency manipulators.\u201cI don\u2019t think right now is the best time to call China a currency manipulator,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that the news media had been wrong in saying that he had reversed a campaign promise on that issue.Mr. Trump hailed his administration\u2019s efforts to reduce illegal border crossings into the United States, and he vowed to fulfill his promise to build a wall on the southern border. \u201cIf the Democrats knew what the hell they were doing, they would approve it,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously they don\u2019t mind the illegals pouring in, the drugs pouring in. They don\u2019t mind.\u201dTo some extent, Mr. Trump\u2019s red-meat tone may have been a political necessity to shore up his base after a week in which he vacillated in budget negotiations with Congress on immediately financing the border wall. His wavering drew charges from conservative radio hosts that he was a flip-flopper.The split-screen image that followed \u2014 journalists dining in black tie at what is normally one of the most fashionable events on the capital\u2019s social calendar while Mr. Trump spoke to the crowd at the farm show center and, before that, toured a factory that makes landscaping and gardening tools \u2014 clearly delighted the White House.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s thumb in the eye to the reveling press corps felt a bit manufactured. He spent much of the past week giving interviews to the same reporters he was to snub on Saturday night, including Jeff Mason of Reuters, who serves as president of the Correspondents\u2019 Association.White House officials had hoped to further vex the journalists by having Mr. Trump announce news in Harrisburg, which would spoil their evening, forcing them to set down their forks and knives and go to work.\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible deal. It was a Hillary Clinton disaster, a deal that should\u2019ve never been made,\u201d Mr. Trump said. In fact, President George W. Bush negotiated the agreement with South Korea in 2007, and President Barack Obama renegotiated it in 2010, which is effectively what Mr. Trump is now proposing to do.On Friday, he taped a weekly radio address in which he declared, with a rare caveat, \u201cI truly believe that the first 100 days of my administration has been just about the most successful in our country\u2019s history.\u201d He did not say which of his predecessors might have outdone him.The choice of Pennsylvania for the rally and factory tour was predictable, given the state\u2019s crucial role in propelling him past Mrs. Clinton in the Electoral College. It seemed calculated to produce a reliable crowd rather than, for example, helping the White House turn wavering Republican votes in its effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Before his rally, Mr. Trump signed an executive order creating an office of trade and manufacturing policy in the White House. Peter Navarro, an academic who shaped the Trump campaign\u2019s hard-line trade message, is to head the office, raising his profile in an administration divided between economic nationalists and more traditional free-traders.\u201cIts creation as a permanent office within the White House sends an important signal to the world that the United States will no longer tolerate trade cheating or allow our manufacturing and defense industrial base to wither and die,\u201d the White House said in a statement.Matthew Haag contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is Said to Seek Cutting Corporate Tax Rate to 15 Percent", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has instructed his advisers to make cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent a centerpiece of his tax-cut blueprint to be unveiled this week, according to people with knowledge of his plans, even if that means a significant reduction in revenue that could jettison his campaign promise to curb deficits.The 15 percent rate is lower than what House Republicans proposed in the tax cut blueprint being pitched by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, and it could be difficult to move through Congress. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said on Monday that such a deep cut might not be well received by Mr. Trump\u2019s party because of its potential to increase the deficit.The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated last year that the corporate tax cut plan Mr. Trump had proposed, which at the time included the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, would cost $2.4 trillion over a decade. Still, Steven Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury, said on Monday that he was confident the administration\u2019s tax proposal would \u201cpay for itself\u201d through economic growth. He said a growth rate of 3 percent was achievable.Mr. Mnuchin also said the Trump administration would lay out plans to cut middle income tax rates, simplify the tax code and make American companies more competitive with foreign ones.White House officials declined to comment on the 15 percent target, which people close to the administration cautioned could change between now and the announcement on Wednesday, perhaps repeatedly. They warned that the details were sketchy at best, and others who have discussed the tax overhaul plan with administration officials in recent days said there was still indecision at the highest levels about what elements to include and in what form.The Wednesday deadline, set hastily by Mr. Trump last week in a comment that appeared to catch some of his closest advisers off guard, was an effort to showcase an ambitious plan for economic growth during his first 100 days in office. During the campaign, he promised to introduce a tax cut proposal to Congress in the first 100 days. But he has had no major legislative achievements to point to as evidence of an activist economic agenda.The 15 percent cut represents a return for Mr. Trump to the economic vision that animated his campaign, and a victory of sorts for Mr. Mnuchin, who has been a supporter of the plan. The cut also helps Mr. Mnuchin jockey for position as the driving force behind the tax overhaul effort.\u201cOur analysis has always shown that of all the economic bang for the buck from all of the changes that were in the original Trump plan, you get the most economic juice from cutting the corporate rate,\u201d said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.One question that Mr. Trump will have to answer, Mr. Moore said, is whether the 15 percent rate would apply only to corporations or to small businesses, as well. But there are plenty of other unknowns, he added.\u201cThey can change their minds,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been all over the map.\u201dMembers of Mr. Trump\u2019s team of economic advisers are set to meet with Republican leaders in Congress on Tuesday to discuss the plan.Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center who analyzed Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign tax plan, said its high cost would make it more difficult to push through Congress.\u201cIt\u2019s very expensive, and that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real heavy lift to get the revenue necessary to pay for these things.\u201dMr. Williams said the president\u2019s recent emphasis on tax \u201ccuts\u201d suggested that he was prepared to lose revenue and hope that economic growth will make up the difference. However, Mr. Williams said, such a plan could be difficult for fiscal conservatives to swallow.\u201cThat makes it a lot harder with the budget hawks in Congress,\u201d he said.Republicans are expecting to pass tax legislation without the support of any Democrats using the Senate\u2019s budget reconciliation procedure. That requires only 51 votes for passage. But if changes to the tax code add to the deficit, they would expire after 10 years, adding uncertainty for businesses and possibly hurting economic growth.Economic advisers from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign had been unhappy that he seemed to be drifting away from the tax principles that helped get him elected. But on Monday, Lawrence A. Kudlow, one of the economists who helped craft Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, said he was pleased that Mr. Trump appeared to be returning to those roots.\u201cWe were at 15 percent from Day 1,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, lamenting that Mr. Trump\u2019s new economic advisers had discussed scrapping the campaign tax plan. \u201cAll the noise in the last week or 10 days sounds like they haven\u2019t junked the plan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great Overseas Cash Grab", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byFor years, corporate chieftains have spoken wistfully of wanting to bring home the more than $2 trillion in cash American companies have socked away overseas \u2014 if it weren\u2019t for tax rates of close to 40 percent.Under President Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress (even one divided over how to overhaul the health care law), these executives may finally get their wish for lower taxes on those funds.And, if so-called repatriation relief comes despite the current political uncertainty, deal makers say it could generate a fresh wave of corporate mergers and acquisitions in the United States.\u201cRepatriation, if it\u2019s actually put in place, will be an important driver of increased M&A activity,\u201d said Blair W. Effron, a co-founder of the boutique investment bank Centerview Partners.As Mr. Trump and Republicans turn their eyes toward reshaping the nation\u2019s tax code, corporate advisers are betting that lower rates will bolster what has already been a respectable level of deal-making. About $3.7 trillion worth of takeovers around the world were announced last year, according to Thomson Reuters, the third-best year for mergers in the last decade.Bankers are betting on one change in particular: repatriation, where American companies bring revenue generated abroad back to the United States. American companies have long kept those proceeds sequestered in bank accounts that are designated for foreign holdings because of how the federal government taxes that money. (It\u2019s worth noting that much of that cash is technically already in American banks.)Few other countries follow the United States rules, which tax revenue no matter where it is earned and subjects it to the standard corporate rates of as much as 39.1 percent.Both Republicans and Democrats have argued that the current system is broken, and that the best way to bring that money home is to lower the tax rate on it. Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York have said that revenue from at least a tax holiday could help finance a national infrastructure bank that could create new employment.And then there is Mr. Trump, who has been outspoken about overhauling the tax code. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, he proposed a one-time 10 percent tax on repatriated cash, followed by an end to the existing system.These proposals generally envision American companies taking those enormous sums and reinvesting them in operations back home, creating new jobs. But deal makers admit that much of the cash would probably go toward mergers, many of which end up leading to job losses.There is precedent for repatriation leading to deals. In the fall of 2004, Congress enacted a one-time \u201ctax holiday\u201d during which companies could bring money home at a tax rate of about 5.25 percent. The move was meant explicitly to promote job creation, and it prohibited using the money for buying back shares, though there was no real way to enforce that rule.What happened instead, according to several studies, was more mergers. The number of deals announced in 2005 was up 9 percent over 2004, while 2006 saw a 26 percent jump over 2004, according to Thomson Reuters. Bankers have conceded that not all of that increase was because of repatriation, but say the inflow of cash absolutely helped increase deal activity.Take Oracle, which told the Senate that it used nearly $11 billion of the money that it brought home to strike two sizable acquisitions, including the $10.3 billion takeover of the corporate software maker PeopleSoft.That would likely happen again under a new repatriation scheme, advisers say. The biggest impact would be in the number of deals struck within the United States, some of them added.\u201cDespite the tax cost associated with mandatory repatriation, U.S. companies who can access their accumulated offshore cash should be more open to U.S. acquisition targets that otherwise would be more difficult to finance,\u201d said Richard Casavechia, the head of mergers structuring at Barclays, although some companies, he added, would choose instead to use offshore cash to invest in overseas operations.Importing trillions of dollars would mesh with other conditions favorable to deal-making, including interest rates that remain low and a domestic economy that continues to perform well. And investors and politicians alike would put pressure on companies to use the money for growth, rather than simply buying back stock.\u201cIn the political environment we\u2019re in, companies will certainly be looked upon more favorably that make capital investments or do M&A,\u201d said Robert Kindler, the global head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley.Mr. Kindler added that the current rate of deal-making in 2017 has been held back because of uncertainties over tax issues.All of this optimism assumes that repatriation ends up inside a politically palatable tax package. Following the failure of the Republicans\u2019 health care bill, the viability of a broad tax overhaul is up in the air. Serious fissures within the Republican caucus emerged during the health care debate, while newly emboldened Democrats may choose to drive a tougher bargain in future dealings with Mr. Trump.Still, an issue like repatriation that has won bipartisan support in some form appears to be one of the more palatable options at the moment.\u201cComprehensive reform seems less likely,\u201d said William G. Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cSmaller tax reforms like tax holidays seem more likely.\u201dMr. Gale cautioned that the House\u2019s repatriation proposal was closely tied to the addition of a border adjustment tax on imported goods, a measure that has drawn strong opposition even among some Republicans.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an administration that has lost a lot of political capital, so it may be hard to get some of those reforms through,\u201d Kurt Simon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s global chairman of mergers and acquisitions, said at an industry conference last week, adding that he remained optimistic that changes to repatriation taxes were more likely than not to happen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Family by Family, How School Segregation Still Happens", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byElana Shneyer and Adam Kaufman live a few hundred feet from Public School 165, the Robert E. Simon School, on West 109th Street, at the edge of Morningside Heights in Manhattan. When they started looking for a kindergarten for their son, who will start in the fall, the school was an early stop.That made them unusual.Although their neighborhood is diverse, the children who go to P.S. 165, its zoned school, are mostly Hispanic and low-income. Most of the white students who live in the area it serves attend school elsewhere.But Ms. Shneyer and Mr. Kaufman, who are white, liked that the school had a Spanish dual-language program and that its kindergarten classes had only 10 to 15 students.They also knew they had options. Community School District 3, where they live, has a long history of giving parents alternatives to their zoned schools. So the couple also looked at the Manhattan School for Children, a progressive school that is open to all children in the district. The couple loved the school\u2019s approach, particularly its commitment to integrating children with physical disabilities. But there was one thing that made them uncomfortable: While most of the students in District 3 are black or Hispanic, nearly two-thirds of the students at Manhattan School for Children are white.\u201cWe noticed that, and honestly, to us it was less appealing,\u201d Ms. Shneyer said.She went to public school in District 3, at P.S. 75, the Emily Dickinson School, on West End Avenue between 95th and 96th Streets. Less than a fifth of the students were white, a percentage that hasn\u2019t changed much over time. She went on to the Bronx High School of Science, one of the city\u2019s most selective high schools.\u201cI think public school shaped me in a lot of ways \u2014 that I feel like I can relate and talk to and be with people who are different from me racially, economically, socially,\u201d Ms. Shneyer said. \u201cIt was very valuable in that way.\u201dIn 1984, two years before Ms. Shneyer started kindergarten, less than 8 percent of the district\u2019s 12,321 elementary and middle school students were white. Not a single school was majority white, and the only school where white students made up the biggest group was P.S. 87 on West 78th Street. At the time, many white parents would not even consider their zoned schools. James Mazza, who served as deputy superintendent, and then superintendent of the district, from 1988 to 1997, recalled in an interview that parents would sometimes come into his office carrying a newspaper with the test scores of every school in the district and explain that they didn\u2019t want to go to their zoned school because of its place on the list. Though scores are often used as a shorthand for quality, they correlate closely with the socioeconomic level of the children in a school.\u201cWe tried to encourage people to make the decision about what school to attend based on more information than test-score results,\u201d Mr. Mazza said, adding that that was often difficult. So the district pursued another strategy for attracting white, middle-class families: adding gifted classrooms, dual-language programs and schools that were open to all students from around the district.P.S. 145, the Bloomingdale School, is on West 105th Street, four blocks south of P.S. 165. A quarter of its students live in temporary housing. Last year, just 15 percent of third- through fifth-grade students passed the state reading tests, and only 7 percent passed the math tests. In recent years, less than half of the kindergartners living in P.S. 145\u2019s zone who attended public school enrolled there. Some go to P.S. 75, others to the Manhattan School for Children or to charter schools.Scott Seamon, a lawyer who works in finance, lives in the area served by P.S. 145 and has twin boys who will start kindergarten in 2018. Given the school\u2019s test scores, he said, \u201cI feel like it would almost be malpractice to send my kids to school there, while the schools in the 70s and 80s have like a 70 percent passage rate.\u201dIn the case of P.S. 165, only two in five of the kindergartners who lived in the school\u2019s zone and attended public school were enrolled there in 2015, according to Education Department data. White families disproportionately shun the school: Roughly a third of the public school students who live in the school\u2019s zone are white, but only 13 percent of the school\u2019s students are white. Its test scores, like those at the other district schools where black and Hispanic children are a majority, lag behind.Brett Gallini was the principal of P.S. 165 from 2010 to 2012, when he left to lead a charter school. Mr. Gallini said the school was underrated by many middle-class families in its zone. \u201cI spent a lot of my time when I was a principal of 165 just advocating for the school, saying, \u2018You know what, I can\u2019t just tell you it\u2019s a great school \u2014 come see it,\u2019\u201d he said. He said the school started offering more tours and parents would host meet-and-greets at their apartments for prospective parents.Mr. Gallini also asked parents in the neighborhood what they were looking for. The school was phasing out its gifted program when he arrived. Based on interest from parents, he decided to revive it, which proved popular, though many of its students come from elsewhere in the district.The current principal, Aracelis Castellano-Folk, attended the school in the early 1970s, and has moved to improve P.S. 165\u2019s instruction, with two full-time teacher coaches for English language arts and math, and a new math program. Her efforts have paid off in higher test scores: Last year 47 percent of third- through fifth-grade students passed the state English exam, and 42 percent passed the math exam, up from 24 percent and 35 percent the year before. But Ms. Castellano-Folk seems to be less effective than Mr. Gallini was at selling the school to prospective parents. Enrollment, after rebounding under Mr. Gallini, has again declined.Some of the school\u2019s Hispanic parents have complaints of their own.Fatima Ortiz, 40, attended P.S. 165 and has sent three children there. Two have already graduated, and one, a son, is currently in fourth grade. She said she didn\u2019t feel the school was safe, adding that there was bullying and children were inadequately supervised. One of her older children attends Mott Hall II, a middle school in the same building, and she said that at that school, parents were welcome to walk into the office anytime. But she said that was not true at P.S. 165. \u201cFrom my point of view, I think, \u2018What are they hiding?\u2019\u201d she said.(Ms. Castellano-Folk said that the students\u2019 safety was her highest priority and that parents were invited to an informal meeting with her once a month.)Ms. Ortiz didn\u2019t think having more white or upper-middle-class parents in the school would necessarily improve it, since she thought that they would mostly push for programs that benefited their own children. She said it seemed that Ms. Castellano-Folk already gave parents in the gifted program preferential treatment.Others expressed positive feelings about the school.Milagros Bueno, whose son is in second grade in the dual-language program, said that the teachers were wonderful, and that her son was thriving. Unlike Ms. Ortiz, she thought that having more racial diversity and more wealthy families would be good for the school.\u201cMore affluent families mean that the school gets a better rating and also that we get more funding, because they definitely advocate,\u201d she said. \u201cAs people of color, unfortunately we don\u2019t do as much advocating as them.\u201dOn a tour for prospective parents in January, Ms. Castellano-Folk answered a query about the construction that had taken over the school\u2019s play yard for younger students by saying she was not sure when it would end. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a plan,\u201d she said of the Education Department\u2019s oversight, adding that it was supposed to be a two-year project but \u201cthings come up.\u201d When another parent asked how the school celebrated religious holidays, she said curtly, \u201cWe can\u2019t use that term.\u201dOn the morning that Ms. Shneyer and Mr. Kaufman visited the school, Ms. Castellano-Folk joined their tour at the end, walkie-talkie in hand. Ms. Shneyer asked several questions: Could the principal talk about the school\u2019s approach to discipline? How did the school challenge students who were advanced? What was the interaction between the upper grades and lower grades?The couple were satisfied with Ms. Castellano-Folk\u2019s answers, but the school\u2019s falling numbers were evident. That morning a dual-language kindergarten class had only five students present. A second-grade class had fewer than 20 students. Several of the schools in the district\u2019s southern portion have kindergarten waiting lists.Ms. Shneyer said later that she was impressed with the math program and liked the small class sizes, though Mr. Kaufman expressed concern about what low enrollment might mean for the school\u2019s budget.\u201cThat was a surprise,\u201d he said.\u201cIt seems like a benefit, smaller classes,\u201d Ms. Shneyer said, adding, \u201cPeople pay a lot of money to send their kids to places with low student-teacher ratio.\u201dThe couple\u2019s kindergarten application was due Jan. 13. Though they remained concerned about Manhattan School for Children\u2019s demographics, they had decided to rank it first on their application.\u201cThere\u2019s a coherent vision for the school,\u201d Mr. Kaufman said. \u201cYou can see that articulated through small and large decisions that are enacted through the school, and that really appealed to me.\u201dBut the odds seemed to be against them \u2014 989 children entered the lottery for 90 seats \u2014 so they figured their son was most likely destined to attend the dual-language program at P.S. 165, their second choice.But roughly a decade ago, the Education Department told the school that it had to run a more formal lottery for kindergarten seats, in which students\u2019 ethnicity could not be considered. Within a few years, the school was mostly white.In the end, Ms. Shneyer and Mr. Kaufman\u2019s son won a lottery spot at Manhattan School for Children, and one of his best friends got a seat there, as well.The deadline to accept the offer was April 7, and after some agonizing, they did so.Mr. Kaufman is happy that the process is mostly behind them, while Ms. Shneyer is still ambivalent, holding out the possibility that they could change their minds and switch to P.S. 165 before school starts.She said that most of all, they had wanted to find the school that was the best fit for their son. But she said she was also aware that decisions like theirs have an impact on whether schools thrive, or do not. In other words, the decision is more than just a personal one.\u201cPutting our child there, we\u2019re investing our time in a school,\u201d Ms. Shneyer said. \u201cWhere do we want to do that?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Le Pen\u2019s Inner Circle Fuels Doubt About Bid to \u2018Un-Demonize\u2019 Her Party", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Little more than a week before France\u2019s presidential election, Marine Le Pen remains a front-runner after working hard to sanitize the image of her party, the National Front, and to distance it from the uglier associations of Europe\u2019s far right.But descriptions of the inner workings of her party by present and former close Le Pen associates, as well as court documents, raise fresh doubts about the success and sincerity of those efforts.Two men in her innermost circle \u2014 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chatillon and Axel Loustau \u2014 are well-known former members of a violent, far-right student union that fought pitched battles with leftists and took a turn toward Hitler nostalgia in the mid-1990s.They have been associates of Ms. Le Pen since her days in law school in the 1980s and remain among her closest friends, according to numerous accounts.French television recently broadcast video from the 1990s of Mr. Loustau visiting an aging prominent former SS member, L\u00e9on Degrelle, a decorated warrior for Hitler and the founder of the Belgian Rex party, a prewar fascist movement.Some in the National Front flatly deny Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau are either anti-Semitic or nostalgic for the Third Reich, while others make no secret of avoiding them, precisely because of their taint.But their lingering presence in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s inner circle has called into question the sincerity of her strategy to \u201cun-demonize\u201d her party and renounce its heritage of deep-rooted anti-Semitism since she took over from her father, Jean-Marie, in 2011.\u201cBy the evidence,\u201d said the historian Nicolas Lebourg, a leading National Front specialist at the University of Montpellier, \u201cshe considers it\u2019s not something very important.\u201dThe two trusted men continue to work closely with the party\u2019s top leadership, including Ms. Le Pen. They have been charged by French prosecutors in an elaborate campaign-finance scheme that has been crucial to keeping the National Front afloat for years.The financial scandals have not dented Ms. Le Pen in the polls before the first round of voting on April 23. Potentially more damaging may be the recent revelations about the people she has surrounded herself with, in particular Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau.\u201cThey have remained National Socialist,\u201d said Aymeric Chauprade, once Ms. Le Pen\u2019s principal adviser on foreign affairs until a falling out, partly over his pro-Israel stance.\u201cThey are anti-Semites, nostalgic for the Third Reich, violently anticapitalist, with a hatred for democracy,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cPeople think they\u2019re marginal. But in fact, I discovered, she protects them. She supports them. They are at the heart of everything.\u201dMr. Chauprade recalled a dinner with Mr. Chatillon and others in the spring of 2014 that was \u201cfull of anti-Semitic jokes.\u201d But he added: \u201cThey are not joking. They are real Nazis.\u201dSeparately, an affidavit filed in a 2014 defamation lawsuit (later dropped) offers a fuller portrait of Mr. Chatillon\u2019s extremist views from that era.In the affidavit, Denis Le Moal, once a member of G.U.D., described Mr. Chatillon\u2019s nostalgia for the Third Reich and his closeness to Holocaust deniers.Mr. Le Moal told of a 1993 rally Mr. Chatillon organized for the student group in Paris that resounded with \u201cSieg Heils\u201d and Nazi salutes.\u201cDuring that period, every year, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chatillon organized a dinner on the birthday of the \u2018fuhrer,\u2019 April 20, to pay homage to \u2018this great man,\u2019\u201d the affidavit states.It goes on to describe a gathering in a Paris restaurant when Mr. Chatillon brought a painted portrait of Hitler \u2014 \u201ca portrait Chatillon showed us during the dinner, saying, \u2018My beloved fuhrer, he is magnificent,\u2019 and kissing the picture.\u201dIt says he also organized \u201cstriped-pajama\u201d parties as a student, an allusion to the clothing Jews wore in death camps and concentration camps.\u201cThe only debatable point, in the use of the term \u2018neo-Nazi,\u2019 is the wrongful qualifier \u2018neo,\u2019\u201d the affidavit states.Requests to arrange interviews with Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau through associates of theirs were unsuccessful. The men have made no secret of their disdain for journalists.\u201cTo hell with Hitler and the Third Reich!\u201d Mr. Chatillon wrote in a recent Facebook posting. \u201cBut to hell also with these \u2018journalists\u2019 who write whatever the hell they want.\u201dOn Twitter, Mr. Loustau denounced \u201cthese activists hiding behind a press card, benefiting from all the means of state television to try to destroy us.\u201dThe National Front\u2019s treasurer, Wallerand de Saint-Just, defended the men. \u201cIn no sense are they nostalgic for the Third Reich,\u201d he said.\u201cThey were turbulent boys, but they have become true professionals,\u201d Mr. Saint-Just said. \u201cThey work closely with us and we have confidence in them, in the conception, printing and delivery of campaign materials.\u201dThat role has been at the center of a campaign finance scandal that has haunted the National Front for years.Mr. Chatillon\u2019s company, Riwal, served as the exclusive supplier of campaign materials to the National Front in elections from 2012 to 2015. Prosecutors suspect it of systematically overcharging for posters, fliers and the like sold in campaign \u201ckits\u201d \u2014 and then, milking giant reimbursements from the state.Under French law, the state reimburses the campaign expenses of candidates who earn more than 5 percent of votes. Mr. Chatillon had refined the system to an art, according to a high-ranking French campaign finance official and Mr. Chauprade, as well as two new books that closely examine the National Front\u2019s finances.A printer would charge Riwal, say, 180 to 220 euros, or $191 to $233, for 400 posters; Riwal would then charge a small front party affiliated with the National Front, called Jeanne, \u20ac500 for the posters. Jeanne, in turn, would charge the candidates the inflated price.After the election, the candidates would claim reimbursement from the state for the inflated amount, and that reimbursement would be turned over to Jeanne.At least some of that money would wind up in the coffers of the National Front, according to the French campaign finance official, who requested anonymity because of the continuing presidential campaign.\u201cThey\u2019ve constructed an economy out of reimbursements from the state,\u201d said Mr. Chauprade, who has been interviewed by prosecutors about the party\u2019s financial affairs.Mr. Chauprade said he had been pressured by Ms. Le Pen herself to buy a kit, but refused, to the fury of party officials.The system operated through a number of recent election cycles \u2014 regional, municipal, legislative \u2014 from 2012 on. And most National Front candidates went along with it, the official said.Once the government oversight agency began to see a pattern of excessive amounts benefiting the National Front, it began to challenge them \u2014 knocking off more than \u20ac1 million in just one campaign, the official said.The National Front treasurer, Mr. Saint-Just, who has himself been charged with embezzlement in the scandal, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done anything wrong, and we think they will be acquitted.\u201dAs for Mr. Chauprade, \u201cHe\u2019s a profound traitor,\u201d Mr. Saint-Just said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to avenge himself.\u201dThe historian, Mr. Lebourg, cast no doubt on the recent revelations about the party, but agreed that Mr. Chauprade was \u201cnot exactly the Virgin Mary.\u201dMr. Chauprade was elected in 2014 as a National Front deputy in the European Parliament. There he was pursued by human rights groups for hate speech for issuing an anti-Islamist diatribe after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris in early 2015.Now on the outside, he has been willing to say aloud what many critics have long suspected about the National Front.\u201cIt is a mafia-like system,\u201d Mr. Chauprade told the newspaper Le Monde last month. \u201cYou stick an arm into it, you are stuck yourself.\u201dHe has also spoken to the police about a phony National Front jobs scheme at the European Parliament, which gives deputies expense money that can be used to pay support staff members.The European Parliament is now demanding that more than \u20ac1 million be returned from six people, including Ms. Le Pen, who are associated with the party. Ms. Le Pen, a European Parliament member, has invoked her parliamentary immunity, although French prosecutors said on Friday that investigators had asked the European Parliament to lift it.All of that money could be applied to National Front operations in France, giving Ms. Le Pen\u2019s party yet another boost. \u201cHer system was illegal,\u201d Mr. Chauprade said.Philippe P\u00e9ninque, a leader of the student movement G.U.D. in the 1970s who remains close to Ms. Le Pen, said he was confident the National Front would be vindicated in its financial scandals.In a lengthy interview at an outdoor cafe in the moneyed 16th Arrondissement of Paris, he also heaped scorn on journalists and others for writing about Mr. Chatillon and Mr. Loustau. And he defended Mr. Chatillon\u2019s visit to the aging SS man, Mr. Degrelle \u2014 \u201cHe didn\u2019t open any concentration camps,\u201d he said.\u201cMy friends\u201d were all about \u201cupside-down humor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t respect anything.\u201dThey were neither Third Reich nostalgists nor any danger to the party, he said. \u201cMarine kicked out her father, and she keeps the Nazis?\u201d Mr. P\u00e9ninque asked incredulously.Mr. Chauprade is not so sure. \u201cShe sacrificed her father, and yet they are much more radical,\u201d he said of her inner circle, making a comparison to President Trump\u2019s senior adviser, Stephen K. Bannon.\u201cIf she enters the Elys\u00e9e\u201d \u2014 the French presidential palace \u2014 \u201cthey will enter as surely as Bannon has entered the Oval Office,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

(Which reminds me of my favorite endangered species: liberals who are actually liberal, who defend diversity of opinion instead of seeking to repress it.)The wall, in short, will be a huge, stupendously expensive advertisement to the world that the United States makes bad investments.It seems to me our borders are well-patrolled already, and I cannot tell you how bored the border patrol folk can be, standing around staring south at nothing all day long. It\u2019s getting very hard to recruit people for the job. Maybe it\u2019ll be easier if we get that pink marble wall you mentioned.Can Trump claim credit for that because of all the bluster and gunsmoke he\u2019s directed at the subject, before the pink marble has even been quarried? He will, of course. And he\u2019d be a fool not to. Is there any place you\u2019d like to see a wall built? I vote for building one around Silicon Valley. Not to keep illegals out, but to keep the tech nerds in. They\u2019re killing more of our jobs than China or Mexico ever could.It\u2019s been a pleasure talking with you, Matt. Hope we can get together again soon. Meanwhile, enjoy that fly fishing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will London Fall?", "Date": null, "News": "London may be the capital of the world. You can argue for New York, but London has a case. Modern London is the metropolis that globalization created. Walk the streets of Holborn, ride an escalator down to the Tube and listen to the languages in the air. Italian mingles with Hindi, or Mandarin, or Spanish, or Portuguese. Walk through the City, the financial district, and listen to the plumbing system of international capitalism. London is banker to the planet.London is ancient yet new. It is as much city-state as city, with a culture and economy that circulate the world. London manages to be Los Angeles, Washington and New York wrapped into one. Imagine if one American city were home to Hollywood, the White House, Madison Avenue, Wall Street and Broadway. London is sort of that.Modern London thrives on the idea that one city can be a global melting pot, a global trading house, a global media machine and a place where everyone tolerates everyone else, mostly. The thought is that being connected to the rest of the world is something to celebrate. But what happens to London when that idea unexpectedly falls away?It was both shocking and thrilling, at first, that you could catch a Eurostar from a platform in London, slide under the English Channel, hurtle through the French countryside and less than three hours later pull into the Gare du Nord in Paris. To ride the Eurostar was to marvel that the capitals \u2014 London so prosaic and straightforward, Paris so romantic and mysterious, the two with their long history of rivalry and discord \u2014 were part of the same larger enterprise.Eurostar symbolized an era in which London seemed to be inevitably rushing toward Europe, too. At least that was the idea until now, and the beginning of the process known as Brexit. The trains are still running, but the era that created modern London appears to be over.This article is part of a series examining whether \u201cBrexit\u201d will sink a great global city.\u201cWe\u2019ve made a horrible statement to the rest of the world, and it\u2019s very sad,\u201d said Martin Eden, a publisher waiting to catch the Eurostar to Paris the other day, to celebrate his 43rd birthday. \u201cWe should be moving together,\u201d he said of Europe, \u201cinstead of moving apart.\u201dI met Mr. Eden as I wandered around St. Pancras at the moment Britain officially filed for divorce from the European Union. It was lunchtime on March 29, Brexit Day, as you might call it, when Britain delivered a letter to Brussels and opened two years of negotiations over the rules of disengagement.But as Britain tries to bid farewell to its now-estranged partner of 44 years, London faces a different sort of challenge: how a great global city whose residents voted overwhelmingly against Brexit in last summer\u2019s referendum should adjust to an uncertain future governed by principles that feel antithetical to its very being. Brexit has divided Britain from Europe but also divided Britain from itself, with London on one side and much of England on the other (Scotland and Northern Ireland, which also voted to remain, are another story).To many people in the capital, the vote last year feels like a rejection not just of Europe but also of the values embodied by London, perhaps the world\u2019s most vibrantly and exuberantly cosmopolitan city: values like openness, tolerance, internationalism and the sense that it is better to look outward than to gaze inward. Even as a sense of melancholy seemed to descend on St. Pancras when I walked around the other day, much of the rest of Britain was celebrating.Brexit has thrown into disarray this great experiment in tolerance. Nobody can predict what the city will look like in 10, 20 or 30 years. If spontaneous travel between Europe and Britain no longer seems so simple, neither does the easy exchange of people, capital, jobs, businesses and languages. Perhaps more significant, it is no longer clear that these are meant to be admirable things, here or anywhere.\u201cLondon is a weird place at the moment,\u201d said the writer Nikesh Shukla, whose book \u201cThe Good Immigrant\u201d is made up of essays by nonwhite Britons about a country from which they feel increasingly alienated. He lives in Bristol now but grew up in London, and the city, he says, \u201cfeels like a uniquely encapsulated version of what Britain means to me.\u201d\u201cThe government says it\u2019s trying to get the country back, but in the process it\u2019s losing the heart of its people in London,\u201d Mr. Shukla said in a telephone interview. \u201cPeople feel uneasy because there are a lot of futures at stake. These are people who live in the city who contribute to society, who have families, social structures and financial commitments, whose futures are now in doubt.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t live in an island and call it your oasis,\u201d said Shirley Watkins, 83, who was waiting at St. Pancras the other day for a train to France. \u201cI think it\u2019s sad that we\u2019re pulling out.\u201dPeople have complicated feelings about what might happen to London. \u201cA lot of people my age are not happy \u2014 are they going to have to move back to France?\u201d said Antoine Nauleau, a dual French-American citizen who works here for now. But he said he can see another side to the argument in the country in general. \u201cIt seems that the U.K. is losing a lot of support, but also kind of defining itself.\u201dI lived in London for more than 15 years, returning home to New York in 2013. The city changed a great deal in that time, and the city I left felt markedly different from the one I found when I arrived. It felt more open, more international, more enthusiastic, more exciting. The food got better, and places stayed open later. My neighbors seemed to come from a United Nations\u2019 worth of countries, our differences somehow erased because we all shared them.The city also grew a lot richer, which was not necessarily a good thing: The center of town became all but unaffordable. Russian oligarchs and other members of the world\u2019s ultrarich elite dug up the streets to build subterranean complexes filled with swimming pools and parking garages for homes they planned to live in only a couple of weeks each year.Europe, which had seemed like a distant concept, suddenly seemed right there on the doorstep. Crowds of French people and then Poles and Spaniards and, later and more contentiously, Romanians moved in. Any time you went to an art gallery or a movie, you saw how British culture was benefiting from European financing. The rise of laughably cheap no-frills airlines made air travel to Europe almost easier than train travel. Tony Blair, prime minister for much of that time, liked to take his vacations in places like Tuscany, in Italy.I\u2019ve been back a number of times since I left, but it was during two visits in the past few months that I encountered something different: fear for the future and a questioning by many non-Britons of whether they even belong here anymore.\u201cEven for those that haven\u2019t talked about leaving, there\u2019s something fundamentally ruptured in their relationship with the country,\u201d said Ian Dunt, editor of the website Politics.co.uk. \u201cWhen people say they\u2019re very anti-immigration, no one thinks that\u2019s directed at German architects or French lawyers. But even those people are beginning to feel that the country is becoming cold and meanspirited and indifferent to their presence, if not openly hostile toward them.\u201dLondon is big and unwieldy and constantly changing. It resists easy definition.Here, despite the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant sentiments that helped fuel the Brexit vote, is London\u2019s first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, whose parents, a bus driver and a seamstress, came from Pakistan. Here are international financiers and playboys, Eurocrats and Eurotrash, as well as economic migrants from Spain and Portugal and other depressed European countries crowding into tiny flats on the edges of town and taking jobs in cafes, on construction sites, in hotels.\u201cIn London I never feel like an outsider, because everyone\u2019s an outsider,\u201d said Paolo Martini, 32, a hairdresser I met in Kentish Town who comes from Brazil and has a Polish wife and a British (by virtue of her birth) daughter. He has lived here for more than a decade; who knows what Brexit will mean for his family?Part of what makes London different is how closely it all knits together, people from different economic backgrounds as much as different ethnic ones. Every borough has its grand houses and its public housing projects, sometimes right around the corner from one another.\u201cIt\u2019s not just me and you and rich and poor,\u201d said Dara Djarian, 25, a real estate agent in Kilburn whose parents are French and Iranian. He compared the jumbled-up neighborhoods of London with the more uniform banlieues at the periphery of Paris, centers mostly for Arab immigrants. \u201cEveryone\u2019s all mixed up here.\u201dI looked down Kilburn High Road from his office and saw what he meant. A Polish delicatessen was next to an Italian restaurant across the street from a traditional London pub beside a Halal butcher shop. There was the Shah furniture store, a classic fish-and-chips place, a ladies-only hairdresser, a luxury bathroom-fixture store, some fancy coffee shops and the highbrow Tricycle Cinema, with a program that appeals to hipsters and cineastes.\u201cThe one thing we don\u2019t actually see a lot of here is English people,\u201d Mr. Djarian said. \u201cThey\u2019ve moved out to the countryside, or to the suburbs.\u201dThe Rupert Murdoch-owned Times of London, which is not a fan of the European Union or, for that matter, of France, sent the political columnist Patrick Kidd to write about the event.He could not tell his readers exactly what Mr. Macron said, however, because, as he boasted in the article, he does not really speak French, although he studied it in school. But why should he make an effort, seemed to be the idea, when it is so easy to ridicule the French for being French, and when to be English is to feel superior to your neighbors?\u201cMr. Macron did not ask for directions to la gare once,\u201d Mr. Kidd wrote, alluding to his French lessons in school. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even say \u2018zut\u2019 or \u2018bof.\u2019 One wondered if he was French at all.\u201dMr. Kidd\u2019s hauteur isn\u2019t surprising, given that Mr. Murdoch\u2019s papers and the rest of the country\u2019s right-leaning news media have spent decades nurturing an ancient anti-Europe narrative long reflected in the Conservative Party\u2019s Euroskeptic wing. If London, or at least much of London, has welcomed or tolerated all the changes, many people around Britain, particularly from older generations, have lamented that they no longer recognize the country of their childhoods.The populist tabloids stoked that anxiety and resentment, often veiling it in easy stereotypes and portraying anyone who objected to the coverage as tediously \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d They used crude World War II metaphors when England played Germany in soccer. They mocked Europe as a place of humorless Krauts and garlic-eating Frogs, deriding the European Union as an impenetrable, out-of-control bureaucracy sucking up British money and imposing risible, onerous laws on an unwitting populace. Multiculturalism, the zero-sum argument went, was causing Britain to lose sight of what it was meant to be.\u201cWe fly the British flag, not these awful things you are putting on tails,\u201d former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher snapped during the Conservative Party Conference in 1997, upon seeing a miniature British Airways 747 whose tail was decorated with an image from a foreign country, part of a short-lived effort to celebrate the airline\u2019s global reach. After unearthing a handkerchief from her handbag, she slapped it across the back of the plane. (\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, can\u2019t we have British designs?\u201d her husband, Denis, added.)It is an irony of history that it was Mrs. Thatcher who may have given birth to modern London, when her government deregulated the financial markets in 1985 in the so-called Big Bang, paving the way for the city\u2019s rise as a global financial behemoth. Nine years later, the Channel Tunnel opened, a victory for common sense (its detractors had argued, among other things, that rabid Continental dogs might use it to sneak into Britain) and a feat of engineering that seemed to defy the physical and metaphorical laws of the English Channel itself.Tony Blair\u2019s election as prime minister, in 1997, ended 18 years of Tory rule and ushered in an era when belonging to Europe felt like something verging on cool. Speaking a foreign language was suddenly, briefly, O.K. And then, in 2012, London hosted the Summer Olympics, advertising itself as a city for the world and proving how smoothly and joyfully this polyglot place worked when it put its mind to something, and how unusually well the people who lived here got along.\u201cPeople here are coming in from every single nation and just walking around so casually,\u201d Cristina Barba, who is 23 and Spanish, told me, \u201cand it all feels very natural.\u201dShe pays $750 a month for a room in a house on the edges of the city (affordable housing is unattainable closer to the center) with seven roommates who include recent arrivals from Italy and Romania. She works on Brick Lane, home to a large Bangladeshi population, in Absence of Colour, a shop selling expensive monochromatic clothing from an Icelandic designer.\u201cIn Spain you feel like there\u2019s a division between Spaniards and people who look differently,\u201d she said. \u201cBut here, there is no division. Everyone just coexists.\u201dIt is strange, the bustle. Construction crews are still putting up buildings, monuments to London\u2019s future, as if nothing has changed. But you can hear faint footsteps, too. Banks, investment firms and other companies are making contingency plans to move elsewhere, if necessary. What then?How do you define London? You don\u2019t, really. \u201cIt\u2019s an accordion breathing in and out,\u201d the Canadian author Craig Taylor wrote in \u201cLondoners,\u201d his portrait of the city, describing its ever-shifting population.Built in 1743 as a Protestant church by French Huguenots fleeing religious persecution, it became a Methodist chapel in 1819 and then, in the late 19th century, a synagogue for Jews fleeing a different sort of persecution in a different part of Europe. Finally, in 1976, it was transformed into a mosque to accommodate the newest wave of immigrants, from Bangladesh. No one seems to think there is anything strange about any of that.At the same time, no one is claiming that London is a utopia. Racism bubbles up, and so do the politics of race. Two years ago, the Bangladeshi-born mayor of the borough of Tower Hamlets was forced out of office after a court found that his campaign had committed election fraud in a number of ways. It was an ugly moment, awash in accusations (and denials) of racism. But people keep chugging along.\u201cLondon seems to work, whether by accident or design,\u201d said John Biggs, who took over as borough mayor afterward. Tower Hamlets encompasses not only Brick Lane but also luxury building complexes and some of the poorest housing estates in the country, so he has a lot of different constituencies to contend with. \u201cWe work because we\u2019re a pretty tolerant bunch and we knock along together.\u201dLike the Brick Lane Mosque, London is facing another incarnation, if an uncertain one. The terrorist attack in March became a Rorschach test of Britain\u2019s views not only on the causes of terrorism but on the city itself. Led by Mr. Khan, the city\u2019s mayor, many in London spoke of the diversity of the victims, from many different countries, and said it was wrong to vilify an entire religion for the actions of a Muslim extremist.Yet in The Daily Mail, the columnist Katie Hopkins wrote that London\u2019s reaction to the March attack only emphasized the chasm between the capital and the rest of the country.It is strange to me that some Britons who live outside London seem to mistrust and feel alienated from it, given how essential, and central, the city is to the country and how much people like it when they visit. But the things London is proud of also make it an easy target. In 2012, Theresa May, then the anti-Brexit home secretary and now the pro-Brexit prime minister, said that diversity of language in the capital was helping rip apart the nation.The rift between what she said and what Londoners think shows why London is struggling so much right now.\u201cThe idea is that we\u2019re all who we are, and we\u2019re all in it together,\u201d said Victoria Prescott, who teaches English and film studies at the Deptford Green School in Lewisham. The students speak 40 different languages at home but acclimate quickly, she said, through immersion courses in English.The school emphasizes strength in diversity, and to visit it during the morning recess is to see a playground full of students of different colors and cultures all intermingling as if their differences did not matter. But of course it\u2019s only part of the story. Rebecca Cummings, Deptford Green\u2019s deputy head teacher, mentioned one of her neighbors, an older Brexit supporter bitter at the very things the school celebrates.\u201cShe\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m sitting in the doctor\u2019s surgery waiting forever next to a Somali immigrant with four kids,\u2019\u201d Ms. Cummings said. \u201cThat\u2019s London, too.\u201dThose feelings are now taking root in the city. Pro-Brexit views are hardening, and many immigrants \u2014 rich as well as poor \u2014 are wondering if there is any point in staying. What London will look like then is anybody\u2019s guess.\u201cMy main concern is that when the E.U. migrants are kicked out, and the students are kicked out, and all the banks that use London as a hub leave because they are no longer part of the E.U., who\u2019s going to be left?\u201d said Mr. Shukla, the author. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be full of tourists who have come to see the queen, and Theresa May.\u201dBack at St. Pancras last month, nothing official happened to commemorate the moment the prime minister put Brexit into motion. The trains to Paris did not stop running. Nobody\u2019s passport was rescinded at the gate. But in the station concourse you could hear piano music, courtesy of a program in which pianos are installed in public places for anyone to play.Standing by the piano, Julie Walker and her husband, Simon, said they had chosen a piece of music that would express their joy that Britain was doing the Christian thing and, as they saw it, \u201ccutting all the ties\u201d to an outside world that threatens British self-determination. The song they requested from the pianist, Stewart Yeff, was Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah.\u201dIt seemed apt, because it sounds like a song of celebration, but it is really one of mourning.Produced by Craig Allen, David Furst and Matt RubyAn article on April 11 about London in the aftermath of the March 22 terror attack described incorrectly a point Katie Hopkins made in a column in the Daily Mail. She wrote that London\u2019s reaction to the attack emphasized the chasm between the capital and the rest of the country; she did not refer to \u201cbombings.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Second Bite of the Wonka Bar: Reimagining \u2018Charlie\u2019 for Broadway", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byWilly Wonka has always known the importance of a good edit.By 1971, it was his own idiosyncratic phraseology he was revising. \u201cStrike that,\u201d he said after one head-scratching formulation. \u201cReverse it.\u201dNow, the quirky chocolatier is himself being reimagined \u2014 this time for Broadway.\u201cI didn\u2019t think they would want to do this \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t want to do it again necessarily \u2014 but they did,\u201d said Jack O\u2019Brien, the show\u2019s new director and a three-time Tony Award winner.The producers declined to discuss their finances \u2014 while most Broadway shows file investment documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this production is exempt because it has not solicited investors. Comparable Broadway musicals often cost between $15 million and $20 million to mount.Storywise, the basics remain unchanged: Charlie Bucket is a sweet, dreamy and impoverished boy, subsisting largely on cabbage while wishing for Wonka bars; Willy Wonka is an inventive candymaker isolated for years in his mysterious factory. The drama takes place when Wonka agrees to open the doors of his factory to five children (and their chaperones) who have found golden tickets hidden in candy bars.In the book, Wonka doesn\u2019t show up until Chapter 14. In London, he appeared to Charlie early in the show, disguised as a tramp, but that approach was deemed too subtle by the New York team. Now he spends a good part of the first act undercover as a candy-seller, running a shop near Charlie\u2019s home, which allows them to bond \u2014 and lets the show open with one of the movie\u2019s most popular songs, \u201cThe Candy Man.\u201d\u201cThe king in a guise amongst his people is such a fantastic theatrical device \u2014 it\u2019s a staple and it seemed like a lovely thread to wind through the first act,\u201d said the Scottish playwright David Greig, who wrote the book for the London show, and then rewrote it (and is still tweaking it) for New York.As in the original film, but unlike in the book, Broadway Charlie\u2019s father has died, creating a psychological context for the evolving connection between the fatherless boy and the childless chocolatier. \u201cThe relationship between the two is the emotional and spiritual heart of the story,\u201d Mr. Greig said, \u201cand I wanted, given a chance to approach it afresh, to dig into that.\u201dThey have made some bold, even risky, creative choices, starting with the casting of adults as the bratty golden ticket winners \u2014 Violet Beauregarde, Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt and Mike Teavee. (The role of Charlie, the one winner who winds up with a prize rather than a punishment, is shared by a trio of child actors named, dizzyingly, Ryan Foust, Ryan Sell, and Jake Ryan Flynn.)The use of adult performers, the creative team says, allows not only for greater precision when singing complex lyrics, but also permits the show to embrace moments that are even darker than Dahl: Violet, after eating the not-yet-ready gum, not only swells up like a blueberry but also explodes, while Veruca, insistent on taking home one of Wonka\u2019s squirrels, is torn apart by the rodents (in the book, they toss her down a garbage chute).\u201cWhen we were doing it in rehearsal, a lot of people said you can\u2019t do that, and then the first audience saw it and they loved it,\u201d said the choreographer, Joshua Bergasse. \u201cWe get away with it because it\u2019s so ridiculous.\u201dThe characters speak with American accents, and the production is set vaguely in the present \u2014 at least to the extent that there are references to social media and smartphones, particularly in connection with Mike Teavee, who in the 1960s was addicted to television, but now has a broader problem with screen time. (Mr. Borle at one point stomps on Mike\u2019s smartphone, which, he said, has been prompting horror from children and delight from parents in preview audiences.)Each golden ticket winner has a distinctive sound or style: for Violet, R&B; for Mike, techno. Veruca is a Russian ballerina (get ready for the black squirrel \u201cNutcracker Sweet\u201d), while Augustus\u2019s aesthetic is Oktoberfest with Bavarian slap dancing (yes, that\u2019s a genre).The design is spare \u2014 dominated by vivid colors, rather than sumptuous set pieces, which is meant to reinforce the show\u2019s oft-stated theme: the importance of imagination. The change was prompted partly by necessity \u2014 the British sets were designed for a West End theater that has a much larger stage than the Broadway house.As for the story\u2019s unforgettable, but also problematic, Oompa-Loompas \u2014 the short, cacao-loving factory workers Wonka says he found on a trip to Loompaland \u2014 the show, as it has done with so many elements of the story, has adopted a mix of the familiar and the newfangled for Broadway.Mr. Twist proposed the use of \u201chumanettes,\u201d human-puppet hybrids in which the performers\u2019 heads are visible above the puppets\u2019 bodies; as a result, the Oompa-Loompas now appear more as a chorus line than an indentured work force, and the audience seems to appreciate the zaniness. And they are introduced with another tune from the movie \u2014 \u201cThe Oompa-Loompa Song,\u201d by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Warns of \u2018Storm Clouds Gathering\u2019 in U.S.-North Korea Standoff", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported by\u201cIf they let war break out on the peninsula, they must shoulder that historical culpability and pay the corresponding price for this,\u201d Mr. Wang said.The comments were unusually blunt from China, which has been trying to steer between the Trump administration\u2019s demands for it to do more to stop North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program and its longstanding reluctance to risk a rupture with the North. The remarks also reflected, American experts said, an effort by the Chinese to throw responsibility for what happens back on Washington, after Mr. Trump declared, in several Twitter messages, that it was up to the Chinese to contain their neighbor and sometime partner.According to officials who have seen notes of the conversations, the Chinese have agreed to crack down on their second-tier banks that have helped finance the North\u2019s trade. But it is unclear what that crackdown would look like: While much has been made by Mr. Trump about North Korean \u201cboats\u201d of coal that have been turned away by China, the most recent statistics show a significant increase in overall trade between the two countries.American officials contend that the two countries have also agreed to share some intelligence \u2014 a highly unusual step \u2014 about suspected North Korean shipments of arms and other illicit goods. That would improve the chances that those shipments can be intercepted, perhaps when they make port calls. The Bush administration began such a program, called the Proliferation Security Initiative, more than a decade ago, but attention to it has waxed and waned.Administration officials flatly denied a report on NBC News that the United States was planning for a pre-emptive strike ahead of any nuclear test. It was unclear what American forces would strike, and the nuclear test site where the North has conducted its five previous tests would make a hard-to-hit target. Moreover, they noted, Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to visit Seoul this weekend, and it is almost impossible to imagine a strike occurring while he was consulting with the South\u2019s acting president about how to respond to the crisis.Even if a nuclear test occurs this weekend or in coming weeks, officials say, the response is likely to be diplomatic, with a ramping up of economic pressure and the deployment of more military assets. A carrier group, led by the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, is headed to the waters off the peninsula. It includes Aegis cruisers with antimissile ability.Growing evidence suggests that North Korea may soon conduct another underground detonation in its effort to make nuclear arms.That is notable because administration officials say they are more concerned about a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the United States \u2014 a feat the North has never come close to accomplishing \u2014 than another nuclear test. According to one official, it\u2019s the combination of a missile and a warhead that is most worrisome.The official, and others cited in this article, asked for anonymity to discuss a matter of national security.The North, for its part, issued a statement that denounced what it called the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaniacal military provocations,\u201d including the deployment of the carrier group.\u201cNothing will be more foolish if the United States thinks it can deal with us the way it treated Iraq and Libya, miserable victims of its aggression, and Syria, which did not respond immediately even after it was attacked,\u201d a spokesman for the general staff of the North\u2019s People\u2019s Army said in a statement carried by Pyongyang\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency.North Korea\u2019s vice foreign minister, Han Song-ryol, said on Friday that the United States was \u201cbecoming more vicious and aggressive\u201d under Mr. Trump and that \u201cwe will go to war if they choose.\u201dThe speculation about an imminent underground detonation arises from satellite photographs that show the test site is fully prepared, and that holes into the site have been plugged, usually a last step to contain radiation. But at times the North, knowing it is under space surveillance, has readied the site but waited to conduct the test.On Saturday, with Kim Jong-un watching from a raised platform, North Korea began a military parade in central Pyongyang to celebrate the 105th anniversary of the birth of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the North\u2019s founding president. The North sometimes uses such occasions to show off its military advances.Japan is clearly examining worst-case scenarios.The Japanese news media reported that the government\u2019s National Security Council had been discussing the possible evacuation of an estimated 57,000 Japanese citizens in South Korea, should war break out. \u201cWe will take all necessary steps to protect our people\u2019s lives and assets,\u201d said Yoshihide Suga, Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary. The Kyodo News agency said the council was concerned about the possibility of North Korean refugees arriving in boats on its shores.In South Korea, whose people have lived through saber-rattling involving the North for decades, there were few signs of panic. Nonetheless, the South Korean Foreign Ministry warned on Friday that if the North conducted another nuclear test or launched an intercontinental ballistic missile, it would suffer an \u201cunbearably strong punishment.\u201d All the major candidates in the presidential election set for next month have called on the United States not to do anything that might initiate war on the peninsula without first seeking the consent of South Korea, its military ally.In his remarks in Beijing, Mr. Wang said there was still hope for renewed negotiations with North Korea on its weapons program. \u201cThere can also be flexibility about the form of renewed talks,\u201d he said.The Chinese made much of their announcement two months ago that they were suspending coal imports from North Korea. But while those shipments seem to have dried up, Chinese overall trade rose 37.4 percent in the first quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016.Later, Air China issued a statement saying that it had not entirely abandoned the route from Beijing to Pyongyang, and would arrange flights if there was enough demand.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of North Korea\u2019s leader. He is Kim Jong-un, not Kim Jung-un.Gerry Mullany reported from Hong Kong, Chris Buckley from Beijing, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

{"Headline": "Integration Is a Two-Way Street", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "The storied city of Weimar, Germany (population 65,000), absorbed 900 refugees in a year. Our journalists spent months on the ground examining integration from all sides.\u2014 In This Story \u2014ANAS ALKARRI, 27, his wife, AYA ALNABULSI, 19, and their son, ZAID, 16 monthsMARGRET AURIN, 28, a German student who volunteered in the resettlement effortBASHAR AL-SULAIMAN, 20, a student and soccer enthusiast from SyriaSARAH ZDUN, 26, a German social worker and her Syrian boyfriend, OMAR, 28Like others, he hoped to take advantage of free language lessons and quickly land a job. But also like others, he found German difficult and was frustrated by the bureaucratic hurdles and internships most newcomers must clear to hold a job in Germany.\u201cThey teach you the rules, and then they teach you the exceptions, and the exceptions are more than the rule,\u201d he said of the language classes he received from the city and local university students. \u201cThe dog is a he, but the table is a she. They have no logic.\u201dRefugees are required to take roughly 700 hours of classes in German language and cultural orientation in exchange for benefits. At the end, if they pass a language test, they are eligible to hold a job and remain in the country permanently.In the first six months of 2016 \u2014 the most recent available figures \u2014 278,404 refugees were enrolled in integration courses across the country, 434 of them in and around Weimar. Nearly 64 percent nationwide passed the test needed to continue studying or pursue vocational training.Anas was an accountant in Syria but gave up on that career in Weimar. \u201cThe training here is clearly superior,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the choice, even I would hire a German over a Syrian.\u201dWith wide, sensitive eyes framed by thick-rimmed glasses, Anas is perpetually alert for an opportunity to press his case that the Muslim world is woefully misunderstood here. He recalled an intense discussion at one of the workshop\u2019s weekend gatherings about homosexuality, something he called \u201cthe monster in the closet.\u201d\u201cWe told them that, worldwide, the majority of people are opposed to homosexuality,\u201d Anas said of his counterparts. \u201cBut the Germans, they want you to be cool with it. Be cool, be easy. But many of us cannot.\u201dThe workshop grew out of a question-and-answer session that Eric Wrasse, 41, organized at a Weimar youth center in November 2015. It turned out that German high school students had a lot of questions for the newcomers, starting with the basics: What was daily life like in Syria? How difficult was the journey to Germany?So with a federal grant of 50,000 euros (about $53,000), the center created the program in which the Germans and refugees spent eight weekends doing bonding exercises, taking field trips, practicing role-playing games and trying to explain their cultures to each other.On a field trip to the Neuk\u00f6lln district of Berlin, a longtime immigrant enclave now home to a new wave of Syrians and others, a guide led the group past storefronts covered with Arabic lettering and windows full of shawarma and grilled vegetables.The guide, also a Syrian refugee, complained bitterly about being forced to live with 39 other men in a cramped shelter and described a \u201ckiller bureaucracy\u201d in Germany. At least back in Syria, he said, one could pay a little money and get to the head of the line.\u201cAre you advocating corruption?\u201d asked Eric, the head of the program.Anas echoed the guide about the sluggish and inscrutable German system. After being invited to present his workshop to a civic education group in France, he applied for permission to leave the country and was told by the German authorities that a decision would take a couple of weeks. But three months later, the permission had still not arrived and he missed out on the trip.\u201cYou benefit from the rule of law in this country,\u201d Eric said. \u201cYou have to trust the system.\u201d\u201cThat is the problem,\u201d Anas explained. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust the system.\u201dEric said, \u201cYou have food, a home, all because of the system.\u201dA crowd of refugees waited outside the locked doors of a Communist-era auditorium complex that Margret had helped transform into a discount department store. Its warren of dark rooms and bland wooden benches now contained mountains of donated linens, toys and other items stacked six-high on metal shelves.\u201cI must charge for the clothes, the city says, but at least I can set the price,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes sense to me. People will be more likely to take only what they really need.\u201dThis was new.When the refugees started arriving, Weimar, like other places, put out a call for donations, and they poured in. \u201cEvery two minutes, a car was coming,\u201d recalled Margret, who was then in her final year at Bauhaus University and, like dozens of other students, got caught up in the welcome-wagon frenzy.She took charge of the clothing shop, which at first gave out items to anyone in need. But city officials shut the operation down in December 2015, citing security concerns and organizational problems.\u201cSometimes the refugees would get angry and aggressive,\u201d Margret acknowledged. \u201cThey would tell me, oh, they are going to kill me, they are going to stab me. I got so stressed.\u201dAt the run-down former student dormitory used to house the new arrivals, rumors circulated that German volunteers were having sex with refugees. Margret said some of the men would send messages on social media with hearts and fireworks and roses; she ended up removing one particularly persistent suitor from her Facebook friends.Student volunteers decided to put together a pamphlet to explain German social customs to refugee men, including what it means if a woman hugs them and how it is perfectly acceptable for women to hold some jobs in Germany that would be forbidden to them in Syria.\u201cThen it just stopped,\u201d Margret said. \u201cThey just hadn\u2019t known how to behave, and once it was explained to them, it became all right.\u201dFor months, she argued with city officials about reopening the clothing shop, something she said was \u201clike fighting with windmills.\u201d In May, they gave permission for a trial run \u2014 but she had to charge money rather than give items away. And refugees had to bring their own bags.\u201cNo bags, we have no bags!\u201d she shouted again and again to women carrying armloads of merchandise.That first day, nearly a year ago, the shop sold 90 T-shirts, 19 pairs of shorts, 15 skirts, one jacket and 19 pairs of underwear for a total of \u20ac170 (about $180), which went to the city government.But one man was caught putting on several pairs of trousers. A pile of toys had been stacked beside a window in an unused room, raising suspicions that someone planned to come back after dark and steal them. City officials were shocked by the scene, which was more Middle Eastern souk than German Kaufhaus.\u201cIt was like an Apple store when a new product comes out,\u201d said Andreas Kohl, head of Weimar\u2019s new Department of Refugee Affairs. \u201cEvery man for himself.\u201dThe city soon shut the store down, again. It reopened in July \u2014 under new management.Beate Weber-Kehr, 56, who had been coordinating volunteer activities for the city, was now in charge. She had cobbled together more racks and shelves from old benches and bunk-bed parts. The shop was open only on Mondays, and refugees from different neighborhoods were invited in different weeks to keep crowds down.Margret declined a request to help out. She had refugee fatigue \u2014 or, at least, an aversion to struggling with the German bureaucracy.And she was not the only young volunteer to feel her enthusiasm slip in the months since the refugees began arriving. One student had tried to start a workshop linking Germans with refugees for language lessons, but only a handful of native speakers turned up. Another wanted to use a website to pair homeless newcomers with Weimar residents who had extra space, but few hosts came forward.Margret took a job with Arrive, one of more than 1,080 programs nationwide aimed at integrating refugees, organizing buddy picnics for them and locals. One August evening, she hung paper lanterns in the park across the street from her apartment, the tiny LED bulbs barely illuminating blankets stacked with sandwiches and snacks.Forty people showed up for that first picnic, but by December, the program had only 85 buddy teams, short of the goal of 100. The group plans to hold more picnics this spring and summer.\u201cIn the first months, everybody was excited, everybody wanted to help,\u201d she said. \u201cThen nothing happened, so the enthusiasm died.\u201d\u201cThe Germans say to me sometimes that they forget I am from another country \u2014 they think I am German, like them,\u201d he said, then paused, fingering the meditation beads he wears looped around his wrist.\u201cIt\u2019s nice when people make you feel you are one of them. But I have not given up on my own country. I can be both.\u201dIt is hard to know what made Bashar\u2019s path smoother than others\u2019. Maybe it was his being Christian, not Muslim. Or maybe it was soccer.Bashar played regularly in the cramped gymnasium behind Weimar\u2019s refugee dormitory when he first arrived, and now he plays most Mondays in a group where he is the only non-German. If asked the most important date in his integration journey, he does not hesitate: Oct. 24, when a German acquaintance offhandedly invited him to play.\u201cFootball is more than a hobby for me,\u201d he said, gulping water during a break in a game. \u201cIt is something I must do. It is my heart.\u201dBashar and an older brother, Yazan, left Damascus, Syria, on Aug. 4, 2015, and arrived in Weimar on Aug. 22.Hababusch, an ivy-covered four-story building in the center of the old city, had been a longtime student shelter for artsy bohemians before morphing into a youth hostel and, a few years ago, into an apartment building full of hipsters. The top floor has eight bedrooms off a central living space; Bashar pays \u20ac170 (about $180) a month for a small room in the back, beyond the kitchen, a tiny square he has filled with pictures of Syria.\u201cI miss my friends, I miss my places, I miss the things I did, I miss what was once normal \u2014 I miss it all,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t miss is the bombs, being stressed all the time, having only bad news every day, the lack of electricity. I don\u2019t miss being in a place where everything is war.\u201dBy late September 2016, a year after he landed in Weimar, Bashar had completed his government-paid language course with exceptionally high marks, bringing his proficiency to a level of B1, the minimum needed for most jobs in Germany. Since the government-financed training stops at that level, Bashar tracked down a free course at a local university; his goal is to reach level C1, which he thinks will take two years. That would qualify him to study medicine at the university in nearby Jena.\u201cWhen you want to be at the top, you must struggle for it,\u201d he said.He has struggled, too, with some of the nuances of his new world.In Syria, he said, people always ask guests twice if they would like something to eat or drink. At first, they refuse. So you ask them again, and only then do they accept.\u201cThis is seen as common politeness,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut here, if you ask someone to do something twice, it\u2019s seen as aggressive, like you\u2019re trying to twist their arm.\u201dEarly on, Bashar was visiting a friend and was offered a coffee. \u201cI said, \u2018No, thank you,\u2019 then I waited for them to ask me again but they never did.\u201cAnd I really wanted a coffee. I was like: \u2018Why? Come on.\u2019 But then I realized they were doing what they thought was polite, too.\u201d\u201cI was with some of my friends, and Omar was there with some of his,\u201d recalled Sarah, 26, a social worker at a group home for unaccompanied Afghan teenagers.Their relationship grew slowly. They saw each other now and again at the cafe; then Omar\u2019s refugee friends and Sarah\u2019s German friends began hanging out together around the city. By late spring, the two were dating \u2014 secretly.\u201cI don\u2019t want people thinking that I have lost myself here in Germany,\u201d explained Omar, 28, who spoke on the condition that his last name not be used for fear of retribution against his relatives still in Syria. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to think that I have changed.\u201dOne spring weekend, the couple huddled together over a fierce game of cards at the cacophonous cafe where they had met. A game of table tennis was underway. People ate, sipped tea, played musical instruments. Women in hijab, a few with baby carriages, chatted quietly in the fading light.Omar \u2014 short and muscled with an infectious laugh \u2014 left his family in Syria in 2013, with an economics degree and a half-baked idea to join relatives in Europe. He languished in Lebanon for more than two years, working as an accountant for a medical company, then as a cashier at a restaurant. Finally, in summer 2015, he got himself to Turkey and then, using a smuggler, across the sea to Greece and through the Balkans by train, bus and foot.Sarah \u2014 watchful, wry and fiercely competitive \u2014 grew up in Leipzig and landed in Weimar after college in the Netherlands when her marriage to a student from India faltered. She took a job with a local foundation that helps troubled young people, and ended up hanging out at the Open Sunday Caf\u00e9.In summer, the couple decided not only to go public with their relationship but also to find an apartment together \u2014 a challenge since many landlords are leery of renting to refugees. They bid on one place (\u201cIt was perfect,\u201d Sarah said), but the owner wrote in a text message that it had gone to someone else. (\u201cThey don\u2019t give you a reason,\u201d Omar said.)When they showed up a few weeks later for an appointment to see another apartment, there was no landlord to meet them. Later, Omar was told about a tiny apartment, really not big enough for both of them, in the historic center \u2014 it also fell through. \u201cThey objected to renting to a refugee,\u201d Sarah said.Things were going better with their families. Sarah\u2019s brother bonded with Omar, and her mother, also a social worker, gave her blessing. One July afternoon, they drove down to Bad Blankenburg, where Sarah\u2019s mother lived in a financially struggling corner of what had been East Germany, fertile ground for the country\u2019s growing anti-immigrant right wing.\u201cSometimes I hear people talking in my office about refugees, and I have to go into the other room,\u201d said the mother, Angelika Zdun, 55. \u201cI can\u2019t listen to it, and I don\u2019t want to argue with them. It is really difficult to change people\u2019s minds.\u201dBy September, the integration workshop that Omar participated in along with Anas had finished. Eric, the organizer, offered jobs and internships to some of the refugees, but many thought the low pay was not worth the time away from family or language lessons; others objected to the mandatory shifts in the center\u2019s kitchen.\u201cI would like to be an integration optimist, but if I am honest, I must say that I am less optimistic now than when we started,\u201d Eric said. \u201cI think the labor market is going to be very difficult for them. I don\u2019t tell them, because I don\u2019t want to dismay them, but they will be in competition with Germans, and they will meet a lot of prejudice from employers.\u201dAt least Sarah and Omar found an apartment \u2014 on a street of grand residential buildings a few blocks from the main train station, on the top floor, with a tiny balcony. They gave a party to celebrate.Sarah\u2019s mother drove up for the event. Bashar was out of town, but Margret from the clothing shop was there, and Anas, and so many of the people whose lives had intertwined in the months since the refugees began arriving in Weimar.At one point, there was a playful jostling for space on the new Ikea sofa. Five crowded on, then six, until there were nearly a dozen refugees and Germans tangled around one another in a human knot.\u201cLook,\u201d Anas said. \u201cWe are integrating!\u201dOmar beamed and rested his arm across Sarah\u2019s shoulder.The storied city of Weimar, Germany (population 65,000), absorbed 900 refugees in a year. Our journalists spent months on the ground examining integration from all sides.The Syrian man, one of 900 asylum-seekers welcomed in Weimar, Germany, was no less upset. \u201cHave you asked them?\u201d demanded Anas Alkarri, 28. \u201cI think you will find it is their choice to wear the hijab.\u201dShe pressed on: \u201cI have heard that women can\u2019t worship in the mosque. Is this true?\u201dHe scoffed: \u201cOf course they can worship in the mosque. This is a misconception. There is a separate section in the back for them.\u201dThe German woman stifled a gasp. \u201cA separate section? Oh my God.\u201dSo it went in a four-month cultural crash course pairing Weimar residents with refugees, and in informal interactions around the city and the rest of Germany, as roughly one million people arrived in galvanic waves from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. The rapid influx shook European social structures, accelerated a rise in right-wing nationalism and saddled social welfare systems with the complex challenge of absorbing so many desperate wanderers at once.The storied city of Weimar, Germany (population 65,000), absorbed 900 refugees in a year.

{"Headline": "Wealthy Chinese Scramble for Imperiled Commodity: U.S. \u2018Golden Visa\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 He has a lakeside villa valued at more than $3 million, two Mercedes sedans in the garage and a butler who fluffs his pillows and shines his shoes.But Liu Xiyu, a real estate executive in Beijing, still lacks the convenience he says he most wants in life: an American green card.Fed up with China\u2019s rampant air pollution and the rigid school system his children endure, Mr. Liu pledged $500,000 to a California housing development last year in hopes of obtaining a special visa for investors, known as EB-5, which would allow his family to spend more time in the United States.Lawmakers are discussing the EB-5 program this week as they try to reach a deal on the budget and avert a government shutdown.\u201cI\u2019m trying to help America\u2019s economy grow,\u201d Mr. Liu, 47, said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why anyone would be opposed.\u201dWealthy Chinese families, eager to move money out of China, have rushed to obtain green cards through the EB-5 program in recent years. In 2016, three-quarters of the roughly 10,000 investor visas issued went to Chinese citizens.The program, sometimes referred to as a \u201cgolden visa,\u201d has helped attract billions of dollars of investment in hotels, highways, casinos and other projects in the United States.The program poses a dilemma for Mr. Trump, who has vowed to tighten immigration policies, but who is also eager to promote job creation.Since taking office, he has sought better economic relations with China after assailing the country during the presidential campaign. And as businessmen, Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, embraced the EB-5 program to help finance real estate projects.In China, many visa applicants hope that Mr. Trump will examine the issue from a business perspective. They say they agree with the president\u2019s call for stricter immigration policies, but they have said he should focus on illegal immigrants, not investors.Li Jing, an entrepreneur from Beijing who applied for an investor visa two years ago, said it was unfair that the United States let immigrants without authorization live in the country but turned away Chinese investors seeking visas through legal means.Ms. Li invested $500,000 in a highway project in Georgia, hoping to get a green card so she could join her son, who is studying at a military academy in the state. She said a booming real estate market in Chinese cities was making it easier for families to sell homes and use the money to invest.\u201cThe most important thing is education for the kids,\u201d she said. \u201cChinese parents are willing to spend anything. They\u2019re trying to give the next generation the best they can provide.\u201dThe program has been so popular that there is a backlog of more than 20,000 applications, resulting in delays of up to five years for green cards. Still, many Chinese say they are willing to wait.Wei Chi, 23, applied for an EB-5 visa two years ago after he was unable to secure a work visa through his employer. His parents in Guangzhou, a southern Chinese city, provided the $500,000 he needed to qualify for the program, which he invested in an apartment building in Washington.\u201cAll I can do now is wait,\u201d said Mr. Wei, a management consultant who lives in New York on a student visa.Ms. Feinstein said the program suggested American citizenship was for sale. \u201cIt is wrong to have a special pathway to citizenship for the wealthy while millions wait in line for visas,\u201d she said in a statement.Some lawmakers are concerned that the EB-5 program favors big cities at the expense of rural regions \u2014 an argument that Mr. Trump may be sensitive to, analysts say, given his political support in those areas.Rather than scrap the program, some have suggested raising the minimum amount required to invest, to $1.35 million from the current threshold of $500,000.

{"Headline": "How Trump Can Improve the Messy U.S.-Chinese Economic Relationship", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byImperfect PartnersThe United States and China are locked in a mutually dependent, frequently dysfunctional economic partnership. The world\u2019s biggest and second-biggest economies are like a married couple that complain about each other constantly yet can\u2019t even contemplate a divorce.The marriage enters a new phase Thursday, as President Xi Jinping of China visits for two days of meetings at the Florida estate of a president who made China a punching bag on the campaign trail.The question is whether President Trump can turn his bellicose language into concrete gains for American companies and workers. A look at the economics of the relationship between the nations, and conversations with former officials with battle scars from past negotiations, show a path for getting a better deal.That path to success may not include the kind of flashy, headline-generating announcements that the Trump administration has tended to celebrate.It is a view that is outdated. For years, China did intervene in financial markets to depress the value of its currency. But now it is intervening to keep the yuan from falling \u2014 actually doing the opposite of what Mr. Trump alleged. Economists generally think that the Chinese currency is close to the levels that would be set by purely market forces.That doesn\u2019t mean currencies shouldn\u2019t come up at Mar-a-Lago. This moment of relative peace between the countries on currency policy could be the ideal time to develop an understanding for the future.\u201cI think currency is still an issue, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to discuss it under the rubric of manipulation,\u201d said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cChina is managing its currency; it\u2019s just that it\u2019s managing it right now in a way that is relatively advantageous to the United States. That understanding of how China intends to manage its currency in the future remains a top-order issue.\u201dIn other words, Mr. Trump could use this moment not to beat China over the head about what happened in the past, or where things stand today, but to develop an agreement on what it will do in the future, if a day comes when market forces start pushing the yuan upward.Mr. Trump has similarly assailed the United States trade deficit with China and other countries, often characterizing it as a scorecard, evidence that China is winning at trade and the United States losing, to the tune of $310 billion a year.The reality is more nuanced. The persistent trade deficit is indeed problematic, but that\u2019s because of the factors that drive it and the imbalances they cause to build. Simply targeting a lower trade deficit could well leave both American and Chinese workers worse off, if carried out the wrong way. For example, a trade war that significantly reduces American imports from China while also reducing American exports to China would reduce the trade deficit but would mean lower incomes and fewer jobs in both countries.The U.S.-China trade imbalance is indeed driven in part by trade barriers that China enacts against American companies, including a 25 percent tariff on imported automobiles and various quotas and restrictions that reduce agricultural imports. If Mr. Trump can persuade China to loosen those restrictions, it might close the trade deficit by increasing American exports \u2014 the healthy kind of trade rebalancing.But the trade gap isn\u2019t driven just by the details of trade arrangements. It is also driven by the flow of capital between countries. To oversimplify, when a company sells more abroad than it buys, it has to do something with that money.The flip side of a current account deficit, as an economist might put it, is a capital account surplus. China\u2019s trade imbalances are a function not only of its trade practices, but also of its very high levels of savings, which are in turn invested around the world.For China to change that, it would have to change the very structure of its economy: away from savings and big-ticket infrastructure investments, and toward consumer demand \u2014 including for products made both domestically and abroad.If the Trump administration really wants the trade deficit with China to come down over time, it\u2019s not enough to look at only one side of the international economic ledger \u2014 flows of goods \u2014 while ignoring the flow of capital.In practice, this would mean making demands on some issues that might seem like purely domestic concerns only tangentially related to trade. That might include pushing China to allow more troubled state-owned enterprises to fail, so that their accumulated profits might be spread through the Chinese economy instead of funneled toward the purchase of foreign assets. A more generous pension system might spur demand among older Chinese citizens.If China allowed global financial companies more access to its market, it could both encourage more domestic spending and give a major American industry an opportunity it has long sought.President Trump prides himself on being a dealmaker, and his negotiating style is to lay out extreme requests in order to work back to agreement. But resetting economic relations with China will prove trickier than any real estate deal.One of the fundamental realities of the relationship is that while neither side is wholly comfortable with how it works, these are big, powerful countries that can\u2019t be easily swayed by what a country on the other side of the Pacific Ocean wants to happen. The leverage that each side has to deploy is limited \u2014 at least so long as neither country is willing to shoot itself in the foot.The United States could conceivably have more negotiating leverage by threatening punitive tariffs or other aggressive measures, as Mr. Trump did during his campaign, but those actions are just as likely to produce a painful blowback from China that damages the United States.Then there are noneconomic issues, which invariably could shape the contours of economic relationships.\u201cIn the Obama administration, China was a good citizen cooperating with us on Iran sanctions and on climate change, which I think made it hard for the U.S. to contemplate anything that harsh in the trade arena,\u201d said David Dollar, a former Treasury Department official in Beijing and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cYou could have something similar if the Trump administration wants China to cooperate more on North Korea. That could be hard to turn around and be harsh on them in the economic realm.\u201dMr. Trump likes to announce big splashy deals, and given that the Chinese are looking for places to invest their capital in the United States, it would be easy enough to find something along those lines to announce.But in the context of the two giant economies, that kind of thing is small bore. This flawed economic relationship has been building for a long time, and the fixes are unlikely to come overnight.It\u2019s unlikely that the first meeting between the new president and the Chinese leader will resolve issues that have been building for years or even decades. Rather, those who have worked in diplomacy advise looking beyond the current headlines to make progress on lowering Chinese trade barriers, increasing its domestic savings and committing not to return to the days of manipulating its currency lower.When you\u2019re talking about commerce between two superpowers, things don\u2019t change overnight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Key Questions on Trump\u2019s Plans for \u2018Maybe the Biggest Tax Cut\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump stunned members of Congress, and his own Treasury Department, when he said last week that he would unveil a plan on Wednesday to deliver \u201cmaybe the biggest tax cut we\u2019ve ever had.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump\u2019s plan is expected to be only a broad outline of his vision for overhauling the tax code, lawmakers, lobbyists and investors will be parsing every word. The key questions will be whether Mr. Trump is aligned with House Republicans, whether he is keeping his campaign promises and, of course, whether his proposal has any chance of turning into law.Here\u2019s what to watch for:Veterans of previous tax fights like to say that rewriting the tax code is the most complicated legislative challenge there is, creating winners and losers across the entire economy.He also wanted to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, and he proposed a one-time 10 percent repatriation tax to entice companies to bring their overseas cash back home.Many analysts think Mr. Trump will return to this framework so that he can say he kept his campaign promise. The simplicity of it might also help him avoid getting bogged down in Congress.Mr. Trump always says he likes to think big, so nipping a few points off tax rates will not satisfy his ambitions of making history. He proclaimed on Friday in an interview with The Associated Press: \u201cIt will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we\u2019ve ever had.\u201dBut Calvin Coolidge followed up with a further 33 percentage point cut.Mr. Coolidge is the president to beat.Mr. Trump is advising his staff to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent even if that means jettisoning his promise to reduce the budget deficit. Many Republicans in Congress would be unwilling to go along with a plan that piled on debt. According to the Tax Policy Center, a liberal-leaning research group, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign plan would add at least $7 trillion to the federal debt over a decade.Mr. Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has said the administration is confident that it can create a plan that \u201cpays for itself\u201d with economic growth.Analysts will be watching the growth estimates the White House provides. Mr. Trump has said he can envision growth as high as 6 percent. Economists scoff at that, but Mr. Mnuchin said Monday that 3 percent growth was attainable.Both Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress have said they want to pass tax legislation that does not add to the deficit. That would allow them to pass a bill with only Republican support in the Senate through a procedure called the reconciliation process, which requires only 51 votes.If Mr. Trump does produce a tax plan that adds to the deficit, and no Democrats get on board, the cuts would have to expire after 10 years. While this might be the easiest situation for Mr. Trump to put a win on the board, it would mean scaling back the ambitions of his tax plan and agitating business leaders, who like to be able to make longer-term investment plans.The biggest debate surrounding tax discussions has been about the \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax that is at the heart of the Republican plan drafted by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The concept of taxing imports while letting exports go tax-free has divided American industries and drawn a fierce response from lobbyists of companies that rely on imported goods.Mr. Trump has generally been cool to the idea, saying in recent interviews that it sounds like a bad deal. His economic advisers have also expressed concern about how taxing imports could affect consumer prices and the dollar, which would rise in value.The president has said he is more in favor of a \u201creciprocal\u201d tax that matches the tariffs other countries impose on American goods. But if Mr. Trump breaks with House Republicans on the border adjustment tax, which could raise about $1.2 trillion in revenue, it would essentially send tax negotiations with Congress back to square one.Bipartisanship has gone out of style in Washington, and it does not appear that a tax overhaul is going to change that.Democratic leaders in Congress lament regularly that they have been shut out of tax talks with their Republican counterparts and Mr. Trump. Democratic aides on the Senate Finance Committee said they were not invited to meet with the president\u2019s economic team when they go to the Capitol for a briefing on the White House tax plan on Tuesday.Thus far, Democrats have assailed Mr. Trump\u2019s tax ideas, arguing that they would help only him and his rich friends.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Encyclopedic\u2019 Brooklyn Museum Vies for Contemporary Attention", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byBrooklyn\u2019s time may have come. But what of the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s?With art enthusiasts and donors increasingly enamored by contemporary art, and the borough now officially hot, the Brooklyn Museum is struggling to preserve and promote its identity as a serious encyclopedic institution that spans thousands of years. As leaders there are finding, it isn\u2019t easy to attract paying customers with historic collections.While many museums with comprehensive collections face similar challenges in keeping up with trends, the Brooklyn Museum is also facing serious financial pressures. To deal with a budget deficit of about $3 million, the museum has undergone two rounds of buyouts and halted acquisitions.Ms. Pasternak says she favors \u201ccontemporary thinking,\u201d not contemporary exhibitions, but that approach \u2014 along with a notably accelerated effort to rethink the museum\u2019s presentation of its American, Egyptian and European collections \u2014 has inevitably required some internal adjustment.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make a turn; it\u2019s not always comfortable,\u201d said Catherine J. Morris, senior curator for the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the museum.\u201cLike all encyclopedic museums, the Brooklyn Museum has to divide its attention between balancing its costly obligation to care for, present and pay for artworks and experiences across 5,000 years of history and snagging the attention of price- and time-conscious smartphone users,\u201d said Maxwell L. Anderson, who has served as director of the Dallas Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art. \u201cBrooklyn is booming, and the museum is therefore striving to tap into the borough\u2019s energy and support while siphoning audiences from across the East River and around the world.\u201dEven trustees acknowledge the pressure to attract contemporary art audiences and collectors.In light of its financial situation, the Brooklyn Museum is regrouping, even as Ms. Pasternak continues to settle in. She faced a steep learning curve when she arrived in 2015, having never run an institution with a $39 million budget \u2014 eight times larger than that of Creative Time, the public nonprofit she ran for 20 years.\u201cAnne certainly came into the museum drinking from the fire hose in terms of getting up to speed on the entirety of the operation of the museum,\u201d said Sharon E. Fay, who last fall became head of the museum\u2019s finance committee and treasurer. \u201cKudos to Anne; her eyes were wide open.\u201dIn part, the museum has been scrambling to replace a five-year, $43.8 million fund for programs and other needs, which was underwritten largely by Robert S. Rubin, who remains on the board.\u201cThat fund is now over,\u201d said David Berliner, a real estate executive who last fall stepped into the newly created position of president and chief operating officer. \u201cWe\u2019ve expanded the program and driven audiences here but did not execute well enough to have the financials keep up with the program.\u201dMs. Pasternak, 52, who succeeded the 18-year veteran Arnold L. Lehman, said the museum is heading in a positive direction, though she admitted that the financial hurdles are real.\u201cWe have an opportunity as an institution to think in very current ways,\u201d Ms. Pasternak said. \u201cEverything gets questioned right now. And how exciting is that?\u201dAlthough the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s suggested adult admission price is $16, half of its 465,000 annual visitors pay nothing, which Ms. Pasternak called \u201ca hardship.\u201d\u201cI hope eventually the city will be open to other ideas \u2014 I think admission policy should be looked at,\u201d she said in an interview that preceded last week\u2019s revelation about the Met. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re free to our community, but we\u2019re not free to people outside of New York City.\u201dStill, Ms. Pasternak points to early signs of progress, like admission revenue, which is up 10 percent over last year; revenue from public programs that has \u201cquadrupled\u201d since she arrived; and school group tours that are up 40 percent over last year, proving, she says, that the institution is \u201cvibing right now.\u201dMr. Berliner also said that annual attendance is 10 percent higher than it was a decade ago and trending upward. And the museum has added 10 board members, in part bolstering the representation of contemporary art collectors.Every category of operations is up for reconsideration, from the costly basement printing press for in-house publications (Ms. Pasternak got rid of it) to how long-held artwork should be presented. Ms. Pasternak has already reinstalled the American collection and refreshed the European as well as half of the Egyptian collections, and plans to reopen the Korean gallery, which has been closed for eight years, she says.The museum reinstalled the entire American collection in six months, a rapid overhaul Ms. Pasternak called \u201ctotally taboo in the museum field.\u201d In the process, she added, the museum explored current issues like immigration and Black Lives Matter.\u201cWhy can\u2019t we rotate our collections every two years? We could do it more often if we had more money,\u201d Ms. Pasternak argued. \u201cThere is not one right way to tell history.\u201dIn covering the colonial period, for example, the museum now features masters like Gilbert Stuart alongside the self-trained black artist Joshua Johnson. \u201cWe want to make sure that our audiences are seeing themselves as part of the history of this country, too,\u201d Ms. Pasternak said.Some curators in more traditional areas say they do not feel neglected. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at historical material through a contemporary lens in a way that feels urgent,\u201d said Lisa Small, who Ms. Pasternak recently promoted to senior curator of European Art.Admittedly, there is one obstacle the museum will never be able to overcome: being in Brooklyn, where tourists and Manhattan patrons will always be less likely to go.But rather than bemoan its longtime status as stepchild to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Ms. Pasternak said the Brooklyn Museum should celebrate its otherness.\u201cHistorically, people have said, \u2018Poor Brooklyn Museum: we\u2019re not as big as the Met, we\u2019re not quite as encyclopedic as the Met, we don\u2019t have the same number of great masterpieces as the Met, we don\u2019t have the endowment of the Met, we don\u2019t have the board of the Met and \u2014 guess what? \u2014 we\u2019re not even in Manhattan; we\u2019re in Brooklyn,\u2019\u201d Ms. Pasternak said. \u201cAnd I thought to myself, \u2018What if just the opposite were true? What if all these things were really kind of strengths for us?\u2019 And that was a very sort of creative and generative thought exercise for me.\u201d\u201cIf we were in any other city in this country, we would be a huge destination,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the truth is, Brooklyn\u2019s time has come.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Shifts Course on Egypt, Praising Its Authoritarian Leader", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe agree on so many things,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he sat beside Mr. Sisi in the Oval Office. \u201cI just want to let everybody know in case there was any doubt that we are very much behind President el-Sisi. He\u2019s done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation. We are very much behind Egypt and the people of Egypt. The United States has, believe me, backing, and we have strong backing.\u201dIn that one moment, Mr. Trump underscored a fundamental shift in American foreign policy since he took office. While his predecessors considered authoritarians like Mr. Sisi to be distasteful and at times shied away from them, Mr. Trump signaled that he sees international relations through a transactional lens. If Egypt can be a partner in the battle against international terrorism, then in Mr. Trump\u2019s calculation, that is more important to the United States than concerns over its brutal suppression of domestic dissent.That big hug was just what Mr. Sisi\u2019s government sought, said Eric Trager, a scholar on Egypt at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cIt wants to see the White House legitimate it, and set it on a new course.\u201dThe scene provided a powerful counterpoint to Mr. Sisi\u2019s many critics, in Egypt and abroad, who know him as the leader of the military takeover that removed an elected president, oversaw a vicious security operation in which hundreds of protesters were gunned down in the streets of Cairo and has cemented his authority by filling prisons with his opponents while strangling the free press.\u201cI just want to say to you, Mr. President, that you have a great friend and ally in the United States and in me,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Sisi.Mr. Sisi responded in kind, sometimes in language mimicking a Trumpian sales pitch. \u201cYou will find Egypt and myself always beside you in bringing about an effective strategy in the counterterrorism effort,\u201d he said. He also vowed to support Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to negotiate peace between Israelis and Palestinians, calling it an effort to \u201cfind a solution to the problem of the century in the deal of the century.\u201dMr. Sisi has rejected suggestions that he rules like a dictator. Speaking to The Financial Times in December, he said he was \u201cbuilding love between Egyptians, a wave of respect for the other that will start in Cairo and spread across the region.\u201dIn Rome, the parents of Giulio Regeni, an Italian postgraduate student found dead in Cairo last year, held a news conference to press their longstanding accusations that Egyptian security officials had abducted, tortured and killed their son, probably on suspicion that he was a spy. The family\u2019s lawyer, Alessandra Ballerini, said they had identified two high-ranking Egyptian national security officials said to be implicated in the case, but declined to give further details.Beyond a shared love for harsh rhetoric warning against the dangers of jihadist Islam, Mr. Trump has striking similarities with Mr. Sisi\u2019s brand of authoritarianism in Egypt, according to Middle East analysts. Both leaders came to power promising splashy projects derided by experts \u2014 an expensive extension of the Suez Canal for Mr. Sisi, and a giant wall along the Mexico border for Mr. Trump. In speeches, both leaders have been ridiculed for making exaggerated claims, embracing conspiracy theories and speaking in a limited rhetorical style.Both leaders are notoriously thin-skinned and project a sense of unfiltered self-regard. In recent months, Mr. Trump branded critics in the \u201cfake news\u201d media as the \u201cenemy of the American people\u201d; last year, in a fit of exasperation, Mr. Sisi told Egyptians, \u201cPlease, do not listen to anyone but me!\u201dYet in many other ways there are vast differences between their styles. While Mr. Trump wrestles with a hostile media and recalcitrant factions in his Republican party, Mr. Sisi\u2019s government has imprisoned dozens of journalists \u2014 fewer only than China and Turkey, according to press freedom groups \u2014 while the national Parliament is stuffed with his supporters.\u201cIf Trump is really interested in getting the Egyptians to fight radical Islam, giving them more tanks will not help our goals,\u201d said Amy Hawthorne of the Project on Middle East Democracy, a Washington nonprofit that has been sharply critical of Mr. Sisi.Some experts worry that Mr. Sisi\u2019s hard-knuckled approach to Islamism \u2014 banning all forms of political Islam, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, as well as fighting jihadist violence \u2014 could ultimately feed a new wellspring of radicalism that could blow back on the United States.\u201cThe authoritarian bargain the U.S. has struck with Egypt might seem to be the right thing, but it never pays off in the long run,\u201d Ms. Hawthorne said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being on the wrong side of history, but about over-investing in a regime that is fueling radicalization that will ultimately harm U.S. interests.\u201dFollow Peter Baker at @peterbakernyt and Declan Walsh at @declanwalshPeter Baker reported from Washington, and Declan Walsh from Cairo.

Zsofi, a young girl, has just arrived in a new school, and she is excited by the opportunity to sing in its award-winning school choir. Erika, the music teacher, permits Zsofi to join but asks her to open her mouth without singing because she is not yet sufficiently skilled.Zsofi agrees. But when her best friend learns of this deal, she confronts the teacher, who says that it was in everybody\u2019s interest that only the best sing; the choir is competing for a trip to Sweden. As it turns out, Zsofi is not the only choir member Erika has silenced. Allowing only a few, talented students to sing is the teacher\u2019s winning strategy. However, Zsofi and her friends are not willing to be party to it. The day of the competition, all the students open their mouths without singing a note. They begin singing in earnest only when an ashamed Erika bolts from the stage.The 2008 financial crisis partly explains the spread of illiberal democracies in Central Europe. Economically damaged by the crisis and restrained by European Union strictures from financing efforts to jump-start their struggling national economies, ruling parties have focused on controlling the news media as a way to shore up power. If Italy\u2019s Silvio Berlusconi was a model of using a media empire to build political power, in Central Europe governing parties use political power to build media empires.The model has been quite simple: The government concocts schemes to channel public or European Union money to the owners of the \u201cfriendly\u201d media groups that side with the government and attack its critics. Those media organizations that are critical of the government don\u2019t get its money.But the model of a corruption-managed democracy creates problems of its own.In societies where political leaders fear that losing elections could result in jail time, any expression of weakness is noticedand any public initiative is viewed suspiciously. So the only outlet for citizens\u2019 voices is taking to the streets. That is why all over Central Europe, the young are loudly protesting.Most of these protesters are young \u2014 some quite so. They have no common ideology, only frustration and anger. It would be wrong to romanticize them too much, but it\u2019s safe to say that unlike older generations, they are dead-set against standing onstage and opening their mouths in some vain hope of winning modest social benefits. They want to sing. (What they want to sing we cannot exactly be sure.)But while ignoring the demands of the youth appears to be a promising electoral stratagem \u2014 it is easier to play on the fears of the old generations than to satisfy the hopes of the younger ones \u2014 it is ultimately self-defeating both socially and economically. The young people will find a way to sing.Ivan Krastev, the chairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies, a permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna and a contributing opinion writer, is the author of the forthcoming \u201cAfter Europe.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The milkman was a World War II veteran, just like Mr. Walowitz\u2019s father.His poem decades later would recount how he raced on his bike to the crash location, gripped by the death of \u201ca man we\u2019d actually met,\u201d Mr. Walowitz said, and whose photo in the paper he would memorize \u201clike a list of spelling words.\u201dBack then, the episode added to the churning mix of fear, excitement and wonder that helped inspire the boy to become a poet.For the milkman\u2019s family, the death was not some childhood rite of passage \u201cone low whistle away,\u201d but rather a direct blow that ripped a hole that never fully healed, said Mr. Maraglino, whose grandfather\u2019s memory is revered in the family.Mr. Lucivero\u2019s son, born a few months after the accident, was named Nicholas, the first of several members of the family \u2014 Nicks and Nicoles \u2014 now named after him.Mr. Maraglino passed the poem around the family, and Mr. Walowitz sent an autographed book of his poems, titled \u201cExactly Like Love,\u201d that includes \u201cThe Story of the Milkman.\u201d It sparked a long overdue, painful discussion about the death and the void it left.Mr. Maraglino\u2019s father, John, was so inspired by the poem that he wrote one of his own. Titled \u201cA Forgotten Hero,\u201d it\u2019s about a milkman who, as the poem reads, was \u201can unspoken hero never given his due,\u201d and whose story was \u201cnever revealed, kept secretive so all involved given time, their wounds could be healed.\u201dAnthony Maraglino said the poem by Mr. Walowitz had \u201copened up a whole Pandora\u2019s box\u201d about his grandfather. \u201cI was blown away because I would never have thought anyone would ever know, much less write about him, 60 years later,\u201d he said.\u201cI work as a director of finance, so writing and poetry are not my thing,\u201d Mr. Maraglino added, \u201cbut it was a fire that ignited me to start researching more about my grandfather.\u201dA history buff, Mr. Maraglino began piecing together his grandfather\u2019s life and military service, which included landing on Normandy Beach in June 1944, fighting valiantly in Gen. George S. Patton\u2019s Third Army and earning a Bronze Star for heroism in the Battle of the Bulge.Then he died delivering milk in a bedroom community in Queens because a sleepy gatekeeper at the Baisley Boulevard crossing failed to put down the gates. A 1:51 a.m. train out of Penn Station carrying eight passengers bore down on the crossing, demolishing the milk truck and killing Mr. Lucivero and his teenage employee.\u201cIt boggles my mind how someone can live through one of the worst battles in one of the worst wars and come home and then die this way,\u201d Mr. Maraglino said.The milkman\u2019s youngest brother, Phil Lucivero, 84, said this very aspect \u2014 \u201cthat he went through hell in the war, and to think he died on his milk route\u201d \u2014 only added to the senselessness of Mr. Lucivero\u2019s death.He described his brother as an athletic and charismatic prince of the family. He was a football and gymnastics standout for Jersey City High School and after the war married a woman from Brooklyn, moved to East New York in Brooklyn and bought a milk delivery business.Mr. Lucivero\u2019s parents were Italian immigrants, and both died from heart failure within two months of their son\u2019s death, Phil Lucivero said.His death so shocked the family that no arrangement was made for a military burial. He was buried in St. John Cemetery in Middle Village because it was convenient for visits from his widow, who never remarried. Ms. Lucivero rarely spoke to the children of their deceased father, and died in 1993.As for Mr. Walowitz, to this day he drives inordinately slow at railroad crossings and still thinks of his fallen milkman, whose death oddly enriched another\u2019s life by helping inspire a penchant for poetry.It is a passion that Mr. Walowitz can now indulge in his retirement, after packing it away for decades to support his family as a teacher.\u201cMarketing poetry is on the same level of delivering milk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to sell.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Souter Killed the Filibuster", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byMaybe it could have persisted had Senate Democrats played a longer game, but only temporarily; however the Senate voted on Neil Gorsuch, the same forces that doomed Robert Bork and Merrick Garland would have doomed the filibuster hereafter.Given where we are now, that Beltway wisdom was probably correct. Whether we had to end up here, though, is a harder question. It\u2019s possible that structural forces \u2014 the ideological sorting of the parties, the decay of the republic toward an executive-judicial diarchy \u2014 were always going to push the filibuster to extinction, no matter whether Bork was Borked or Garland pocket-vetoed. But if agency and contingency have a role in history, there is a crucial turning point that deserves to be remembered: the strange nomination and career of David Hackett Souter.Under our system, control of the Supreme Court functions as a somewhat delayed reward for winning ideological battles at the presidential level, and then as a check on the next ideological coalition as it\u2019s taking power. Thus judicial appointees of the pre-New Deal era restrained Roosevelt\u2019s liberalism for a time, and the judicial appointees from liberalism\u2019s New Deal-Great Society heyday continued to advance liberal causes even as the Democratic coalition fell apart.In a similar way, the many Republican appointees from the long Reagan era, 1980-2008, should have constrained liberalism in our own era even as the Reagan coalition cracked and aged and failed. And to some extent they have: In the last eight years the Roberts court reshaped Obamacare even if it didn\u2019t kill it, limited some of the Obama administration\u2019s power grabs and advanced certain conservative goals left over from the Reagan years (on campaign finance and gun rights, notably).But on issues of burning concern to the Republican Party\u2019s base \u2014 abortion above all, and then the gay-rights revolution and religious liberty \u2014 the court forged by Reagan and the Bushes has often been an enemy, not an ally, either consolidating social-liberal gains or advancing liberal causes even further. True, Anthony Kennedy sided with religious conservatives in the Hobby Lobby decision and on partial-birth abortion. But on the biggest cases \u2014 Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Lawrence v. Texas, Obergefell v. Hodges \u2014 and quite a few smaller ones, the post-Reagan Supreme Court has been an agent of social liberalism notwithstanding its many Republican-appointed members.Kennedy\u2019s role as the swing vote means that most people remember the Bork hearings \u2014 and his nomination as Bork\u2019s replacement \u2014 as the hinge that led to Casey and Obergefell. But a generally right-of-center justice who swings libertarian on social issues is the kind of figure you would expect to crop up in a roster of Republican-appointed jurists. Kennedy is distinctive, yes \u2014 but it was Souter who was the real outlier, Souter who really prevented the long era of Republican appointees from putting restraints on social liberalism, Souter who made today\u2019s judicial battles seem more existential to the right than to the left.The strangeness of the Souter appointment has been magnified by the pitch of the judicial politics since, but it was strange even then. Basically unknown outside of upper New England, Souter was sold to George H. W. Bush by his chief of staff, John Sununu, and the moderate-to-liberal New Hampshire Republican Warren Rudman as an easy confirmation because he lacked a paper trail. Rudman and Sununu were quite right: Souter was confirmed 90 votes to 9, with only liberal activists and Ted Kennedy offering any substantial opposition.That opposition would look ironic in hindsight, since once on the bench Souter spent a brief time voting with the conservatives, then cast one of the crucial votes to uphold Roe, then swiftly evolved into as reliable a liberal as Bill Clinton or Barack Obama could have ever hoped to appoint \u2026 and then, as the by-then-inevitable coup de gr\u00e2ce, retired under Obama, allowing Sonia Sotomayor to take his place. For Republicans and conservatives, it was the most extraordinary of own goals \u2014 as if Obama had been persuaded by, say, Ben Nelson or Joe Lieberman to appoint a jurist who turned out to vote like Samuel Alito.Now imagine a counterfactual without this epic blunder. Had Souter simply voted like a typical Republican appointee \u2014 not in lock step with Antonin Scalia, but as an institutionalist, incrementalist conservative, in line with the current chief justice, John Roberts \u2014 then it\u2019s likely that Roe v. Wade would have been mostly overturned in the 1990s, returning much of abortion law to the states, and that the gay rights movement would have subsequently advanced through referendums and legislation rather than a sweeping constitutionalization of cultural debate.This, in turn, would have dramatically lowered the stakes of judicial politics for many Republican voters, making an untimely event like Scalia\u2019s death less of a crisis moment, a response like the Garland pocket veto less of a necessity and the candidacy of Donald Trump something more easily rejected.Indeed, I strongly suspect that in a world without the Souter own goal \u2014 a world where the Supreme Court had sided with cultural conservatives to the extent one would have expected given the number of recent Republican appointees \u2014 a nominee like Merrick Garland could still have been confirmed with Republican votes, and the filibuster could still persist, reserved for the unqualified, corrupt and genuinely extreme. Oh, and into the bargain, Donald Trump might well not be president.Of course this is just a suspicion, and counterfactuals don\u2019t really work that easily; you can\u2019t change one thing and hold everything else constant. Moreover even if you could, few liberals would trade the kind of big Supreme Court losses on social issues (and not only on social issues, of course) that I\u2019m imagining for more comity in the nomination process and a slightly lower risk of a demagogue capturing the White House. If your foes score an own goal, you don\u2019t hand the point back to them; you welcome the edge and keep on playing, no matter how much they whine about what could have been or make dangerous plays to win the lost point back.But a liberal can be glad that Bush nominated Souter, glad that he effectively betrayed the party that put him on the court, and still recognize the peculiar impact of that nomination. The gears of history grind, the tectonic plates shift \u2014 but individuals and contingencies still matter, and in their desire for a smooth and bipartisan nominating process almost 27 years ago it was Warren Rudman and John Sununu who helped transform it into a ruthless and purely partisan affair.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Solar Panels Became Job Killers", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported byWUHAN, China \u2014 Russell Abney raised two children on solar power. The 49-year-old Georgia Tech graduate worked for the last decade in Perrysburg, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo, pulling a good salary as an equipment engineer for the largest American solar-panel maker.On the other side of the world, Gao Song boasted his own solar success story. A former organic fruit retailer who lives in the dusty Chinese city of Wuhan, he installed solar panels on his roof four years ago and found it so lucrative that he went into business installing them for others. By last summer, he and a team of 50 employees were installing solar-panel systems on nearly 100 roofs a month.Then China shook the global solar business \u2014 and transformed both their lives.\u201cA small vibration back in China,\u201d said Frank Haugwitz, a longtime solar industry consultant in Beijing, \u201ccan cause an avalanche in prices around the world.\u201dLate last summer, Chinese officials began publicly toying with slashing the subsidies they offer domestic solar-panel buyers. Mr. Gao\u2019s business dried up, and he laid off half his workers. \u201cI have been working hard and was just off to a good start,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have to start over.\u201dChina\u2019s solar-panel makers cut their prices by more than a quarter to compensate, sending global prices plummeting. Western companies found themselves unable to compete, and cut jobs from Germany to Michigan to Texas and points beyond.Those points included Perrysburg \u2014 where Mr. Abney and about 450 other employees suddenly found themselves out of work. \u201cWithin just a few months, it all came crashing down,\u201d Mr. Abney said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a death in the family. People feel awkward talking about it.\u201dPresident Trump, who pressed President Xi Jinping of China on trade and other issues this week when they met at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., has vowed to end what he calls China\u2019s unfair business practices. Much of his oratory has involved old-fashioned smokestack industries like steel \u2014 industries in which the jobs were already disappearing even before the rise of China.But economists and business groups warn that China\u2019s industrial ambitions have entered a new, far-reaching phase. With its deep government pockets, growing technical sophistication and a comprehensive plan to free itself from dependence on foreign companies, China aims to become dominant in industries of the future like renewable energy, big data and self-driving cars.With solar, it has already happened. China is now home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s solar-production capacity. The efficiency with which its products convert sunlight into electricity is increasingly close to that of panels made by American, German and South Korean companies. Because China also buys half of the world\u2019s new solar panels, it now effectively controls the market.For much of the past century, the ups and downs of the American economy could spell the difference between employment or poverty for people like Chilean copper miners and Malaysian rubber farmers. Now China\u2019s policy shifts and business decisions can have the same kind of global impact once wielded by power brokers in Washington, New York and Detroit.The story of China\u2019s rise in solar panels illustrates the profound difficulties the country presents to Mr. Trump, or to any American president. Its size and fast-moving economy give it the ability to redefine industries almost on a dime. Its government-led pursuit of dominance in crucial industries presents a direct challenge to countries where leaders generally leave business decisions to the businesses themselves.Already, China is the world\u2019s largest maker and buyer of steel, cars and smartphones. While it does not necessarily dominate those industries, its government ministries are moving to replicate that success with robots, chips and software \u2014 just as in solar.Chinese panel makers \u201chave the capital, they have the technology, they have the scale,\u201d said Ocean Yuan, the chief executive of Grape Solar, a distributor of solar panels based in Eugene, Ore. Of American rivals, he said, \u201cthey will crush them.\u201dBefore he became one of the solar industry\u2019s most powerful players, Liu Hanyuan raised fish.According to Mr. Liu\u2019s authorized biography, he faced local criticism at first for his early embrace of capitalism, and responded by saying that his fish feed was an improved product that followed Deng\u2019s dictum. \u201cWhen my business grows bigger,\u201d he said at the time, \u201cI will build another floor for labs.\u201dPlans to shift into computer chips did not pan out, so by 2006, he shifted to solar technology, after taking control of a company that made chemicals for the production of polysilicon, the crystalline raw material for solar panels. That move proved fortunate: China was just then embarking on a concerted effort to become a solar-industry powerhouse.With ample assistance, China\u2019s solar-power production capacity expanded more than tenfold from 2007 to 2012. Now six of the top 10 solar-panel makers are Chinese, including the top two, compared with none a decade ago. The solar division of Mr. Liu\u2019s company, the Tongwei Group, which discloses few financial details, is one of the fastest-expanding players in the industry.That growth forced many American and European solar-panel manufacturers into a headlong retreat. Two dozen of them filed for bankruptcy or cut back operations during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, damaging the heady optimism then about clean energy.In 2012 and 2013, the United States and the European Union concluded that Chinese solar-panel makers were collecting government subsidies and dumping panels, or selling them for less than the cost of producing and shipping them. Both imposed import limits. Chinese manufacturers and officials denied improper subsidies and dumping, and still do.Several large Chinese manufacturers that had previously overexpanded and had been selling at heavy losses for years then closed their doors. But Western solar companies say Chinese banks still lent heavily to the survivors despite low loan-recovery rates from the defaults of big Chinese solar companies like Suntech, Chaori and LDK Solar.\u201cThe main subsidy is massive, below-market loans by Chinese state-owned commercial banks to finance new capacity and also the massive ongoing losses of Chinese companies,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Stein, the president of American operations for SolarWorld, a big German panel maker.Li Junfeng, a top architect of China\u2019s renewable-energy policies until he retired from that responsibility in early January, said that the West had exaggerated the role of the state in helping to finance Chinese solar-panel manufacturers. \u201cThe market can decide for itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good companies can get money, the bad companies cannot.\u201dLike the Chinese solar industry as a whole, Tongwei is thinking bigger.Mr. Liu\u2019s company bought an enormous solar-panel manufacturing complex in central China in 2013 from LDK Solar, which had run into severe financial difficulties. Now it plans to build factories of five gigawatts apiece in the Chinese cities of Chengdu and Hefei. By comparison, the entire global market is only about 77 gigawatts each year, while world capacity is 139 gigawatts.At the same time, Mr. Liu is dismissive of companies in the West that pioneered many solar technologies but have lost their market shares to China. \u201cThey are very jealous,\u201d he said, \u201cand cannot catch up with China\u2019s pace.\u201dFrom an environmental standpoint, China\u2019s solar push has been good for the world. Solar-panel prices have fallen close to 90 percent over the past decade. Many of the solar panels in America\u2019s backyards and solar power plants are made by Chinese companies.But for the solar industry, Chinese expansion could mean an extended period of low prices and cutbacks for everybody else.\u201cThe solar industry is facing again, I would say, a new winter,\u201d said Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, the chairman and chief executive of Total, the French oil and gas giant, which owns a controlling stake in SunPower, an American solar-panel maker.China now hopes to replicate its solar industry\u2019s growth in other areas.American and European business groups have warned that the China 2025 plan means that a much wider range of Western businesses will face the same kind of government-backed competition that has already transformed the solar industry.\u201cThe policies started in solar and are now starting to infect the higher reaches of the economy with Made in China 2025,\u201d said Jeremie Waterman, the president of the China Center at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington.In the end, China did not slash subsidies for rooftop solar panels, and cut them only slightly for large power-plant arrays. But prices barely rebounded from last year\u2019s slump.Mr. Gao, of Wuhan, is a slender 37-year-old whose dark hair is already thinning. He said that his business had depended not on homeowners but on profit-minded investors who made use of the subsidies.The investors would pay three-fifths of the cost of a homeowner\u2019s system. The homeowner would take only enough electricity from the panels to power the home. The investor would sell the rest of the electricity to the grid at a high, government-assisted price.The suggestion that the government might cut the subsidy, even though the government did not follow through on it, panicked his investors. So they stopped financing further deals.\u201cThey fear that the year after next, they may have nothing,\u201d he said. He recently hired four more employees to drum up sales, even as installations creep along at a small fraction of demand a year ago.In Perrysburg, Mr. Abney lost his job at First Solar, the largest solar-panel manufacturer based in the United States, and looked in vain for a job in the auto industry in the Toledo area. He ended up taking a job three weeks ago at a building materials company in Lancaster, Pa. His daughter is going off to college in the autumn, while his wife and son, a high school freshman now, will follow him to central Pennsylvania this summer.\u201cIt\u2019s hardest on him because we\u2019re pulling him away from his high school and his activities,\u201d Mr. Abney said.\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a shock factor when a lot of families realize they\u2019re no longer going to have a job,\u201d said Michael Olmstead, the Republican mayor of Perrysburg.Though Mr. Abney has started his new job at almost the same pay as his previous one, he says part of him pined for the days when the United States still led in solar energy, and when First Solar was at the forefront of that leadership.Follow Keith Bradsher at @KeithBradsherAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democrats See Opening in Tax Overhaul Fight: Trump\u2019s Own Deductions", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported by\u201cHe hated that idea,\u201d said Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist who counseled Mr. Trump during the campaign.The proposal to scale back interest deductions for companies did not make the cut.As President Trump focuses his attention on overhauling America\u2019s tax code, he has considered turning to the other side of the aisle to reach a bipartisan deal. But an obstacle has already surfaced, dimming the chances that a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d will be achieved: Democrats are sounding the alarm that reshaping the tax code presents Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest conflict of interest yet.A tax code overhaul gives Democrats the chance to again bring up Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns and to press for details of how his business deals are financed. That focus could also affect which tax code items, such as interest deductibility, are included in the overhaul.\u201cThe American people want to see what this is about,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said of Mr. Trump\u2019s presiding over tax code changes. \u201cAre our interests being protected or are these deals that somehow promote his interests?\u201dRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said this week that tax code changes should be delayed until members of Congress can review Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns to see how an overhaul of the tax code might benefit him. And last week Terri A. Sewell, an Alabama Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, declared at a hearing that it was \u201cimperative to know how such tax reform affects the president.\u201dMr. Trump, as president, is legally exempt from the kinds of financial conflicts of interest that other government officials are required to avoid. But that has not stopped questions from swirling beyond Democrats about how he and his family could profit from the presidency.\u201cIf the tax reform proposals start to have discussions of whether or not to drop certain deductions for the real estate business, or to expand those, that now becomes the entire matter of tax reform,\u201d said Richard Painter, who was President George W. Bush\u2019s ethics lawyer.Referring to Mr. Trump, Mr. Painter added: \u201cHe cannot be an honest arbiter.\u201dThe opportunity to use Mr. Trump as a weapon against a tax overhaul could distort the debate in other ways. After the fight over the \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax, the most contentious topic is the deductibility of net interest expenses, the idea Mr. Moore had unsuccessfully proposed to Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s been surprisingly less controversial so far than one would expect considering it\u2019s a $1 trillion tax increase,\u201d said Alan Cole, an economist at the foundation.That is quickly changing. New coalitions are forming to fight back against ending interest deductibility. Some Republicans from rural districts have expressed concern at congressional hearings this week about how scrapping interest deductibility would harm farmers who rely heavily on debt financing. Private equity and real estate lobbyists have also been aggressively mobilizing to resist the potential change.\u201cThis is the next large fight,\u201d said James Maloney, vice president for public affairs at the American Investment Council, which lobbies for the private equity industry and considers the treatment of interest as its most pressing issue.So far Mr. Trump has avoided weighing in publicly on the finer details of the tax overhaul, but industries that could be affected by changes to the tax code hope to reap the benefits of having financial interests aligned with those of the president.But Mr. Berger said he was optimistic that Mr. Trump would not let that happen. \u201cI would hope that his expertise in real estate would make him sensitive to the issues that developers consider,\u201d Mr. Berger said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Renaud Laplanche, Ousted at Lending Club, Returns as Rival to His Old Firm", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byRenaud Laplanche was the quintessential Silicon Valley success story, until he wasn\u2019t.Now, less than a year later, Mr. Laplanche is attempting a comeback.On Thursday morning, he is starting a new company, Upgrade, that will compete with Lending Club head-to-head.Upgrade will begin by offering small loans to Americans who want to refinance credit card debt, the bread and butter of Lending Club\u2019s business. The company\u2019s goal is to move into home and auto lending eventually as well.With Upgrade, Mr. Laplanche, 46, hopes to prove that his vision for changing the lending business can work. And at least some investors seem to believe that it can. Upgrade has attracted $60 million in financing from several prominent venture capitalists, including Union Square Ventures, which previously backed Mr. Laplanche at Lending Club.Mr. Laplanche, in his first interview since leaving Lending Club, said that his sudden ouster had been \u201cincredibly frustrating and disappointing\u201d but that he had taken it as an opportunity to confront some of the problems he was unable to fix at Lending Club.\u201cI didn\u2019t look for a fresh start, but we are trying to make the best out of it,\u201d he said while sitting in a conference room in Upgrade\u2019s offices, which are just a few blocks from the Lending Club headquarters in downtown San Francisco. \u201cAfter 10 years there is a really long list of things where we said, \u2018If we have the chance to do it all over again we would do it differently.\u2019 \u201dThe competition between Mr. Laplanche\u2019s new company and his old one is notable if only because he remains one of Lending Club\u2019s largest shareholders, with a stake worth about $40 million.As he did at Lending Club, Mr. Laplanche is betting that by moving all sorts of borrowing online, start-ups can do away with the expensive physical branches that banks have traditionally relied on and reach more people, while make lending decisions more quickly and transparently.Upgrade\u2019s open-floor-plan offices were buzzing this week with almost 50 employees, including several who had been forced out of Lending Club with Mr. Laplanche.Mr. Laplanche\u2019s comeback, though, is not going to be easy to pull off.The industry he helped invent is crowded now, with established banks like Goldman Sachs competing to issue personal loans online alongside Silicon Valley players like Prosper and Social Finance.Even before Mr. Laplanche\u2019s departure from Lending Club, there were questions about whether the fast-growing industry could continue to attract the money it needed from investors to finance all of its new loans, a problem that all such start-ups have because they do not have bank deposits to fund their lending.Lending Club\u2019s shares are now worth a quarter what they were worth when the company went public.All of the issues facing the industry will be problems for Upgrade as well, but none will loom larger than the need to win over the investors necessary to finance Upgrade\u2019s lending capabilities, many of whom were unnerved by Lending Club\u2019s problems.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a large contingent of investors who are going to need to see a longer track record before they entertain coming back,\u201d said Michael Tarkan, an industry analyst at Compass Point.Mr. Laplanche has already succeeded in winning the support of some big names in addition to Union Square Ventures, including Silicon Valley Bank. The $60 million raised by Upgrade is the largest Series A fund-raising round by an American lending start-up, according to data from CB Insights, and pegs the value of Mr. Laplanche\u2019s company at $168 million.John Buttrick, a partner at Union Square Ventures, said in an interview this week that before making the new investment he had taken a thorough look at the circumstances behind Mr. Laplanche\u2019s resignation from Lending Club and had not found anything that gave him pause about backing Mr. Laplanche again.\u201cHe has an opportunity to start Lending Club 2.0, and we are excited to be a part of it,\u201d said Mr. Buttrick, who previously worked with Mr. Laplanche as a board observer at Lending Club.In a particularly important vote of confidence, Jefferies, the Wall Street bank that bought some of the problematic loans issued by Lending Club last year, has already signed up to buy some of the loans created by Upgrade.The Lending Club board also said that Mr. Laplanche had not properly disclosed personal investments he had made in an outside fund that purchased Lending Club loans.Mr. Laplanche, a former corporate lawyer, said at the time that he did not agree with the way the board characterized the problems, but he declined to say anything more about the events that led to his departure.Those who backed both his new and old companies said they had been shocked by his resignation because Mr. Laplanche had stood out in the tech industry for his careful and deliberate approach.\u201cThere are a whole bunch of cowboys in Silicon Valley, but Renaud is not one of them,\u201d said Alexander Tamas, the founder of Vy Capital and the lead investor in Upgrade.After the resignation, Mr. Laplanche took some time off with his family to go hiking in the Alps and visit his mother in southern France.But he was also working the phones with investors and former colleagues at Lending Club. By August, he had rented an office to begin his new company with five Lending Club veterans as co-founders.Unlike Lending Club, Upgrade will not sell its loans to small-time investors. Mr. Laplanche is looking only to big institutional money managers, and he said that he already had four large investors on board.For customers, the biggest difference is likely to be the free credit monitoring and education, a service already popularized by the start-up Credit Karma.Mr. Laplanche said that Lending Club had rejected nearly 90 percent of loan applicants and had then often lost touch with them. With the new service, Upgrade can help coach rejected applicants on how to improve their credit so they can eventually be approved for a loan from the company.\u201cWe took the opportunity of what happened in May and the broader experience to really rethink every piece of the process and think of how we could build on it and improve on it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Ethics, Cuomo Budget Entered Like a Lion and Emerged Like a Lamb", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported byIt was a flare from Mr. Bharara \u2014 whose many indictments and investigations of elected officials made him the enforcer of Albany \u2014 signifying that ethics changes were not on the horizon.Despite the recent convictions of the leaders of both the Assembly and the Senate and indictments against some of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s own associates, lawmakers failed to take up a raft of ethics proposals included in the governor\u2019s executive budget.The governor had included a string of ethics changes in bills that accompanied his budget proposal. Two would have required amending the State Constitution: limiting outside income of lawmakers to 15 percent of their base pay, similar to restrictions in place for Congress, and imposing term limits of eight years for both legislators and statewide elected officials, including the governor.A number of proposals could have been enacted without changing the Constitution. Among other things, they included creating a voluntary public campaign-finance system, lowering the limits on campaign contributions, and closing a loophole for limited liability companies.\u201cIf you went back \u2014 I was in this building many years ago \u2014 and the disclosure that we now do would have been incredible if you proposed it a decade ago,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThat legislators are going to tell you where they get their outside income? And if they are lawyers, they are going to tell you who their clients are? Never, never. So we\u2019ve made tremendous progress. Have we done enough? No.\u201dIn December, Mr. Cuomo summoned lawmakers back to Albany for a special session, promising to consider a raise for them in exchange for action on ethics and other items. But they demurred.Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, contended that Mr. Cuomo had \u201cpassed more reforms than any other administration\u201d and would continue to press for more.Still, some observers of Albany noted that the governor chose which issues to prioritize. After the budget deal was struck, for instance, Mr. Cuomo said raising the age of criminal responsibility to 18, from 16, ranked among his greatest accomplishments, along with increasing the minimum wage and establishing marriage equality.The budget agreement also drew national attention for a measure on college affordability in which students from households making less than $125,000 a year will be able to attend public colleges and universities in New York essentially tuition-free.\u201cIt\u2019s the simple fact that ethics is not high on the governor\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Doug Muzzio, a professor of political science at Baruch College, one of the colleges of the City University of New York covered by the new tuition plan.\u201cHe knows the Senate would be a block, and it might have cost him too much political capital,\u201d Professor Muzzio said.But some lawmakers, including Senator Daniel L. Squadron, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan, said the Republican majority in the Senate benefited too greatly from the so-called L.L.C. loophole to take meaningful action on ethics.So one real estate executive, through multiple companies, can spread many contributions across the Legislature. Currently, corporations cannot donate more than $5,000 a year to candidates in total. By contrast, individuals \u2014 along with limited liability companies \u2014 can give up to $65,100 a year to a statewide candidate, $18,000 to a member of the Senate, and $8,800 to an Assembly member.\u201cIf you own six L.L.C.s, you can give $100,000 to one Senate candidate, and there is no disclosure of who the underlying funder is,\u201d Senator Squadron said. \u201cCertainly, closing the loophole is something the Senate is allergic to.\u201cWhen you look at the core of what ails Albany, the outsize influence of a small number of heavily invested interests drives the agenda.\u201dAsked to respond, Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, accused Mr. Squadron of \u201cplaying politics,\u201d arguing that he and his Democratic colleagues gained from \u201cvirtually unlimited contributions\u201d from labor unions.\u201cThere are scores of projects seeded through that program,\u201d Mr. McMahon said. \u201cIn the absence of such requirements, who knows whether the park pavilion in a village upstate is enhancing the property value of an assemblywoman\u2019s brother-in-law? It\u2019s fraught with potential conflict.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bringing Family Wealth to Bear Against a Relentless Illness", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersAlice Anane\u2019s father died suddenly of a brutal brain-wasting disease when he was 49. She was 15 at the time and remembers her family thinking that he had contracted mad cow disease on a trip to Britain.Twenty years later, when she was pregnant with her third child, a routine amniocentesis revealed something different: Her father had most likely died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare illness known as C.J.D. that erases the brain as it ends life, typically within three months.Unfortunately, she was a carrier. Worse, the disease could manifest at any time after age 30. Ms. Anane, a hospital administrator at the time, was then 35 and had 8-year-old twins. And if the disease did surface, there would be nothing that could be done to slow its progression.\u201cI couldn\u2019t adjust to this information,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cYou understand the implication for the whole family? We are nine siblings. Your whole, big family is at risk now.\u201dShe started researching the disease, as many people would. But she had an advantage to accelerate her efforts: She and her siblings are part of a family office, a private organization that manages the assets of a single extended family.Ms. Anane\u2019s mother gave the go-ahead for the office to donate to the scientists and clinical trials her daughter had identified. And the office backed Ms. Anane as she traveled to conferences and met carriers of the disease and their families.Family offices typically serve as investment vehicles, financial managers and charitable advisers. Sometimes, they protect profligate offspring from their worst habits; other times, they are the locus of squabbling among heirs. Financial decisions are guided by a mix of paid staff members and relatives.Yet when family offices get it right in the field of medical research, they can have a big impact.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the money \u2014 it\u2019s the celebrity that they can leverage to get other people to commit money,\u201d said Bill Woodson, who runs the family office group in North America for Citibank\u2019s private bank. \u201cIt takes real discipline, outreach and a willingness to be public.\u201dIt also takes someone in the family to make sure all members are on board with what the office is doing.David Dolby, son of Ray Dolby, the sound engineer and founder of Dolby Laboratories, said that when their family first learned their father had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the family made charitable donations to well-known groups supporting research and patients\u2019 families.\u201cWe made a conscious decision as a family that as long as there isn\u2019t a silver bullet, we needed to think about personalized interventions and take more of a portfolio approach,\u201d Mr. Dolby said.This approach has allowed the family to find small markers of success \u2014 say, a treatment that works for 25 percent of the people in a clinical trial \u2014 and avoid getting discouraged.As Mr. Dolby put it, \u201cI\u2019ve crafted a portfolio that has this emotional hedge in it, that if we fail miserably in every one of our targeted therapies, perhaps that disappointment is offset in the tools we\u2019re supporting.\u201dHe added, \u201cAny failure has to be learned from.\u201dFor medical ethicists, wealthy people coming in and funding research to benefit their children or relatives is a complicated proposition. David Wendler, who heads the research ethics section in the bioethics department at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, said nongovernment funding of research was nothing new, with some 70 percent of the money coming from private, for-profit companies.He said he welcomed the charitable and investment dollars of these family offices. \u201cThese things are hard,\u201d Dr. Wendler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like someone knows how to do this and says, \u2018I just need money to do it.\u2019 We need to try different approaches.\u201dBut he had some concerns that in their haste to help family members some family offices might not follow the proper protocols. \u201cYou want to protect the validity of the studies and you want to make sure you protect the subjects participating in these clinical trials,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m imagining what happens if I have my billion dollars and I fund a clinical trial for some disease my son has. And then we screen my son and he\u2019s not eligible for it. I say, \u2018Hey, I want my son in.\u2019\u201dHe added that there were also public policy implications to wealthy people\u2019s funding research for certain diseases over others. \u201cThere\u2019s a significant value in having the American public funding these diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cThese philanthropists are doing great things, but their targets are going to be a function of what their daughter got. Sometimes that\u2019s going to overlap with what the public needs. Sometimes that\u2019s just not going to match up with the priorities that come out of the diseases other people get.\u201dProfessional wealth managers suggest that people seeking to make progress against a disease cast a wide net. Judy Spalthoff, head of family advisory services for UBS Wealth Management in the Americas, said she worked with a client to expand her network beyond her hometown, Houston.\u201cFrom her perspective, she wasn\u2019t networked at all, but she had the dollars,\u201d Ms. Spalthoff said. \u201cNow she has this crazy network. That\u2019s highly effective.\u201dBilly and Jennifer Frist, whose wealth comes from the Hospital Corporation of America (founded by Billy\u2019s grandfather), have a 16-year-old son with autism. Despite the resources of their family office \u2014 and of their relatives, who include former Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, a physician \u2014 they said they struggled for ways to help both their own son and the cause of autism research.\u201cIt was hard for us to figure out how to get involved, where to get involved, how to be effective,\u201d Ms. Frist said. \u201cThe autism community is large but very fragmented. Everyone has these opinions and is trying to make a difference, but people are living in their silos.\u201dAnother challenge \u2014 for those who choose to take it on \u2014 is going public about what would normally be a private battle with a disease. Ms. Anane said she initially wanted to keep her family\u2019s condition secret, but then decided to speak out to draw attention to the disease.She spoke at a conference at Harvard Medical School this month under the auspices of its Personal Genetics Education Project. After the conference, she said, she was hopeful that some Alzheimer\u2019s research might be applicable to C.J.D.\u201cI try in as many ways as I can to make progress,\u201d Ms. Anane said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rely on one option and say, \u2018We\u2019ll keep our faith in this.\u2019 I\u2019m trying to get everywhere I can, to try to connect and see.\u201dMany families have no idea if they have time on their side. At 46, Ms. Anane remains healthy \u2014 as do her siblings, nieces and nephews. But Creutzfeldt-Jakob is mercurial: She had a cousin with the gene mutation who was healthy at 93, but who had watched her daughter and granddaughter die from the disease. Then the cousin\u2019s 86-year-old brother died from it.\u201cI want to find a solution,\u201d Ms. Anane said. \u201cI have a greater mission to bring some new revelation to the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Cuts Off Funding for U.N. Agency That Supports Contraception", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The Trump administration informed Congress on Monday that it had terminated United States funding for the United Nations Population Fund, the world\u2019s leading provider of family planning services, including contraception, to women in at least 155 countries.The United States is one of the top donor nations to the United Nations, and the denial of funding was one of President Trump\u2019s biggest moves yet to reduce financing for family planning.In a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Legislative Affairs said it had determined that the Population Fund \u201csupports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization,\u201d a reference to the Kemp-Kasten Amendment, a 1980s-era law enacted in response to evidence of forced abortions and involuntary sterilization in China.Women\u2019s health advocates contend that evidence has repeatedly shown that the Population Fund\u2019s work in China does not violate the amendment. But opponents of family planning have historically demanded that the United States end its support.The Population Fund is the single largest international provider of contraception, family planning, and other reproductive health services. In 2016, health advocacy groups say, American support for the organization\u2019s work prevented an estimated 320,000 pregnancies and averted 100,000 unsafe abortions, while ensuring 800,000 people had access to contraception.Ms. Haley said Mr. Tillerson would attend an April 28 meeting of the Security Council dedicated to the North Korean nuclear threat. That issue is likely to loom large over this weekend\u2019s planned meeting between Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, she said, adding that she expected the administration to exert pressure on China.\u201cHopefully China will respond favorably,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we all want.\u201d She added, \u201cThat\u2019s the goal of this weekend, to make sure China shows they are willing to act on North Korea, because at the end of the day, the only one North Korea is going to respond to is China.\u201d\u201cFantastic at what?\u201d Ms. Haley said. \u201cYou know, he wasn\u2019t talking about human rights. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t say the president\u2019s been fantastic on human rights.\u201d She continued: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason he didn\u2019t say that. Those are conversations we have as well. That\u2019s what you do with friends.\u201dMs. Haley wants to devote a Security Council session this month to human rights and conflict, broadly speaking, but is getting resistance from other countries, including Russia. She took pains to say that her proposed human rights session was not intended to be \u201ca gotcha game.\u201dThe Security Council discusses human rights fairly often with regard to countries, like Syria, that are already on its agenda. Ms. Haley does not want to focus the session on a specific situation, according to a preparatory note circulated to council members. Critics question the proposal\u2019s utility, beyond undermining the work of another body designed to address the issue, the United Nations Human Rights Council.Advertisement"}

In 2017, premiums for the benchmark plan increased by 22 percent on average. Some places had higher increases (116 percent in Arizona, the only state in triple digits) and some lower (9 percent in Wyoming).March 18Following a news conference with\u00a0Chancellor Angela Merkel\u00a0of Germany, Mr. Trump tweeted a misleading critique of Germany\u2019s NATO\u00a0obligations.

This is false.March 31Mr. Trump again touted many companies\u2019 job creation plans as a direct result of his election, but many of the investments were planned or announced before the election.April 1The Fox News report, which was based on one anonymous source, is not evidence for Mr. Trump\u2019s initial accusation that Mr. Obama spied on him. When Americans are caught in surveillance of foreign targets, their names are typically hidden unless a top official asks for the names to be revealed or \u201cunmasked.\u201d This does not mean that the names were leaked publicly.April 2In an interview with\u00a0The Financial Times, Mr. Trump continued to insist falsely that he had been validated because he meant \u201cwiretapped\u201d in a broad sense. Mr. Trump did use the word \u201cwiretap\u201d in quote\u00a0marks in two Twitter posts, but he specifically accused Mr. Obama of ordering his phones to be tapped in two other posts.April 3At a meeting with\u00a0the\u00a0Egyptian\u00a0president,\u00a0Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Mr. Trump again exaggerated his defense budget request.April 4Mr. Trump uttered versions of this claim twice in the same day, and it is misleading. The United States reported an overall trade deficit of about $92 billion in the first two months of 2017, which is on par with the last two months of 2016. Mr. Trump may have been referring to reports that the trade deficit declined by 9.6 percent from January to February\u00a0of this year, but month-to-month fluctuations are common.April 5April 6Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Mr. Trump again claimed\u00a0undue\u00a0credit for over $728 million in savings on F-35 fighter jets.April 7Border apprehensions, the best gauge for border crossings, declined 64 percent from March 2016 to March 2017. But Mr. Trump\u2019s statement gives the impression that he was talking about a month-to-month decrease, which was about 35 percent from February to March 2017.April 8 to April 10No false or misleading statements.Mr. Trump went golfing.April 11April 12A\u00a0personnel shortage is largely his own doing, even by his own account. As of the day of his interview, Mr. Trump had yet to nominate anyone for 478 positions out of more than 533 key appointments. He told Fox News in February he didn\u2019t want to appoint \u201cbecause they\u2019re unnecessary to have.\u201dApril 13During a meeting with emergency medical workers, Mr. Trump boasted that he had done more against the Islamic State than Mr. Obama\u00a0had\u00a0in a fraction of the time. Under the Obama administration, a military coalition recaptured several major cities from the Islamic State and launched more than 17,000 airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration,\u00a0the Islamic State\u00a0had lost no major cities, and the coalition had conducted about 2,000 airstrikes.April 14No false or misleading statements.Mr. Trump went golfing.April 15No false or misleading statements.April 16Tens of thousands across the country took to the streets as part of Tax March to demand Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, which he has not released. Ezra Levin, a member of Tax March\u2019s executive committee, called Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet \u201cbogus and flat-out false.\u201dApril 17This is false. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly promised to declare China a currency manipulator,\u00a0and\u00a0he\u00a0labeled China that in an\u00a0interview with The Financial Times\u00a0in early April. But he told The Wall Street Journal later that month that he would no longer do so.April 18The gang in question, Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, precedes Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency by decades. By 2005, four years before Mr. Obama took office, the F.B.I. reported that MS-13 had 10,000 \u201chardcore members\u201d active, the same number cited by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the day of Mr. Trump\u2019s claim.April 19April 20April 21In an interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Trump misleadingly suggested NATO\u00a0had\u00a0changed after he\u00a0accused\u00a0it\u00a0of\u00a0not focusing on terrorism,\u00a0and cited a Wall Street Journal article from June 2016 about the alliance\u2019s creation of a new counterterrorism position.\u00a0NATO\u00a0has been engaged in counterterrorism efforts since 1980, and the position isn\u2019t considered a significant step.April 22No false or misleading statements.April 23Mr. Trump falsely suggested on Twitter that he had beaten Mrs. Clinton in the popular vote. In the April ABC/Washington Post poll\u00a0referred to\u00a0by Mr. Trump, 46 percent of voters said they voted for\u00a0Mrs.\u00a0Clinton and 43 percent for Mr. Trump. This is similar to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s popular-vote margin\u00a0from November.April 24Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall would not address several modes of drug trafficking from Mexican criminal networks. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s 2016 report, the most common method\u00a0of\u00a0transporting drugs is in concealed compartments in vehicles crossing ports of entry. Other methods\u00a0rely on\u00a0tunnels, drones and commercial cargo trains and buses. None of these\u00a0methods\u00a0would be prevented by a wall.April 25There are at least a dozen countries that have trade deficits with the United States, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil and Egypt.April 26Judge William H. Orrick of the United States\u00a0District Court blocked Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order to withhold money from sanctuary cities. While he is in\u00a0California,\u00a0the same state as the Ninth Circuit, he does not sit on the Ninth.April 27April 28On the eve of his first 100 days in office, Mr. Trump claimed unprecedented progress. Of course, any productivity comparison is subjective, but his claim is off by a few metrics.During Mr. Trump\u2019s first 90 days in office, he signed 28 bills into law and the Senate confirmed his nominee for Supreme Court justice. Mr. Trump had not signed into law any of the 10 pieces of major legislation in his 100-day plan. The White House has also pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s rollback of Obama-era regulations. At the same point, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had signed 76 bills into law, Mr. Obama had enacted a stimulus package and President George W. Bush had enacted major tax cuts.Advertisement"}

Toutefois, sa directrice Natalia Narotchnitska\u00efa d\u00e9veloppe dans de nombreuses interviews un discours tr\u00e8s hostile : l\u2019Occident voudrait soumettre la Russie, lui imposer ses r\u00e8gles, voire la \u00abd\u00e9membrer\u00bb, et \u00e0 ces fins il instrumentaliserait la question de droits de l\u2019homme. Pour Mme Narotchnitska\u00efa, la Russie propose \u00abune alternative \u00e0 l\u2019Occident\u00bb.La troisi\u00e8me structure via laquelle le Kremlin est pr\u00e9sent en France, plus informelle celle-ci, est le Forum des compatriotes. Il s\u2019est r\u00e9uni pour la premi\u00e8re fois en 2011 et regroupe, dans les locaux de l\u2019ambassade de Russie \u00e0 Paris, des \u00e9migr\u00e9s russophones et des descendants d\u2019\u00e9migr\u00e9s. La cr\u00e9ation de tels forums en France et ailleurs dans le monde est au c\u0153ur du projet politique lanc\u00e9 sous M. Poutine intitul\u00e9 \u00abMonde russe\u00bb: il s\u2019agit de mobiliser les diasporas russophones afin de d\u00e9velopper, dans chaque pays, une force d\u2019action pour les initiatives linguistiques, culturelles ou \u00e9conomiques russes, mais aussi un soutien au Kremlin sur des questions g\u00e9opolitiques, comme par exemple le conflit russo-ukrainienne. Des dirigeants de ces trois structures interviennent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement dans les m\u00e9dias fran\u00e7ais et dans des m\u00e9dias que le Kremlin a cr\u00e9\u00e9s, en fran\u00e7ais et dans d\u2019autres langues, et qu\u2019il finance int\u00e9gralement. Les deux plus importants, pr\u00e9sents sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, sont Sputnik et RT (Russia Today), qui va lancer sa cha\u00eene en fran\u00e7ais en 2017.Sputnik et RT ont consacr\u00e9 de nombreux articles aux probl\u00e8mes que cr\u00e9eraient les immigrants, par exemple, et essay\u00e9 ainsi de renforcer les peurs et les rejets engendr\u00e9s par les r\u00e9cents attentats terroristes. Ils n\u2019h\u00e9sitent pas \u00e0 d\u00e9former les faits, voire \u00e0 en inventer. Cette technique, qui \u00e9tait enseign\u00e9e dans certaines facult\u00e9s de journalisme en U.R.S.S., vise \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un choc \u00e9motionnel et supprimer toute capacit\u00e9 d\u2019analyse. En insinuant que les faits ne comptent pas vraiment, elle alimente aussi le conspirationnisme.Plus concr\u00e8tement, le soutien russe peut \u00eatre financier \u2013 et, si un seul cas a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent en France, il n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas unique.

{"Headline": "As Anger at O\u2019Reilly Builds, Activists Use Social Media to Prod Advertisers", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byIn this age of rage, Madison Avenue is finding itself on red alert.Advertisers are increasingly in the cross hairs of populist activists \u2014 aided by the power and reach of social media \u2014 who are demanding that brands quickly take sides on divisive social and political issues, posing a new challenge to corporations that usually prefer to stay out of the fray.After a groundswell of online anger over reports that Bill O\u2019Reilly, the Fox News host, had settled with at least five women who accused him of harassment, more than 50 companies pulled their ads from Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s popular prime time program. The exodus followed similar campaigns to pressure brands with ties to President Trump, like L.L. Bean, Uber and advertisers on \u201cThe New Celebrity Apprentice.\u201d\u201cAmericans are now demanding that their brands articulate their values and weigh in on political issues, and I think the degree to which they are expecting that is really quite new,\u201d said Kara Alaimo, who teaches public relations at Hofstra University and worked in communications for the United Nations, the Treasury Department in the Obama administration, and the administration of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. \u201cWhat social media is doing is forcing companies to make these decisions much more rapidly.\u201dAd boycotts are not new: provocateurs like Don Imus and Glenn Beck lost their cable news soapboxes in part because an angry public used petitions and letter-writing campaigns to force companies to drop their sponsorship.The rapidity of this cycle has tested even the best-prepared marketing giants, creating a niche for public relations specialists who say they can help companies navigate these instant social media storms. One firm offers software and training sessions that simulate \u201ca real-time online attack\u201d on a brand \u2014 the corporate equivalent of war games.The boycotts may give brief satisfaction to social media activists. But many of the sponsors that turned away from Mr. O\u2019Reilly this week are still advertising on Fox News, which reaches the biggest audience on cable television. Fox says it is working with sponsors to address any concerns about \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor.\u201d And specialists say there will be little to no financial impact on the network in the near future, though that could change over time.Brian Wieser, a media analyst at Pivotal Research, said that for now, Fox News was essentially just shuffling inventory \u2014 \u201cnot unlike if you run a store and have got to figure out what shelf on which you put different products.\u201d In the short term, the fallout could eat into revenue for \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d as cheaper commercials replace big-spending brands, Mr. Wieser said, while the longer-term worry is that advertisers could reassess the annual budgets they spend on Fox News.Even if the effect is more symbolic than financial, there is little question that social media have proved to be potent weapons.Sleeping Giants, whose proprietors have remained anonymous, extended its mission this week, urging its roughly 81,000 followers to post images on Twitter of allegations about Mr. O\u2019Reilly to a list of advertisers. The account has then praised companies that decided to pull sponsorship.But social media are also handy conduits for people to register their anger with brands \u2014 directly and en masse.\u201cThe intensity of this is a lot greater,\u201d said Matthew Hiltzik, a former Democratic consultant who draws on his experience in rapid-fire political campaigns to advise corporate clients. \u201cCompanies need to invest time and resources in developing proactive strategies that advance and protect the brand, so that they are best prepared to deal with the unexpected.\u201dThe pressure represents some whiplash for an industry that had broadly moved away from relying on content as a rough proxy for groups of people, focusing instead on targeting online ads, and to a lesser extent, television ads, by audience size, browsing habits and other user characteristics.Orkin, a pest-control company that removed its ads from \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d does not buy ads on specific shows but instead purchases \u201cbroad day parts on networks that reach our target audience,\u201d Martha Craft, a spokeswoman, said. The company added Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show to a \u201cDo Not Buy\u201d list after learning of the allegations against him, she said.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen brands almost treated as individuals in this way before, and expected to espouse political beliefs and uphold them consistently across platforms in everything they do,\u201d Ms. Alaimo said.Many companies are still figuring out how to cope with these situations, she said, adding that it was crucial to respond during \u201cthe golden hour of crisis.\u201d The term refers to the \u201cgolden hour\u201d in emergency medicine \u2014 the window after a traumatic injury in which treatment is most likely to stave off death or permanent damage.Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer at Procter & Gamble, the world\u2019s biggest advertiser, has overseen global marketing for the company since 2008. He said that when he started in the role, one of the first items on his agenda was working with the media team to \u201crenew our standards\u201d for television and radio ads.\u201cThere were some issues where some of the content was becoming objectionable to a large portion of our consumers, whether it was too much graphic violence, too much either sex or sexual innuendo,\u201d Mr. Pritchard said in an interview at an industry conference this week.He said that while the media landscape has radically shifted since then, his company maintains the same standards for where its ads should appear.\u201cI was once told, very early back in my marketing career, your brands are judged by the company they keep,\u201d he said.Emily Steel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bill de Blasio Speaks at Funeral for Man Killed in Racist Attack", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byOn a raw morning that felt more like winter than spring, they gathered in the little red brick Mount Zion Baptist Church in South Jamaica, Queens, where Mr. Caughman\u2019s father had once been a pastor. They sang the praise of Mr. Caughman \u2014 66 when he was killed by an attacker armed with a sword on the night of March 20 while scavenging in Midtown \u2014 as an individual of quiet dignity and broad interests.On Saturday, Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke for 17 minutes at Mount Zion, towering over the pulpit and over Mr. Caughman\u2019s garlanded coffin. His rhetorical sparks resonated among appreciative mourners.The mayor\u2019s most respectful gesture may have been his simple presence.As if to make a point by his own example that Mr. Caughman had been transformed by events into an Everyman of New York City, Mr. de Blasio remained for the entire funeral, which lasted almost two hours. He sat next to the pastor, the Rev. Christopher N. Howard. He bowed his head when that was called for. He stood and clapped his hands as the chorus sang \u201cWe\u2019ll Understand It Better By and By,\u201d when it would have been impossible to do anything else.\u201cHe stayed,\u201d Mr. Howard said after the service, standing atop the steps of the church while Mr. Caughman\u2019s extended family \u2014 Caughmans, Peeks and Johnsons \u2014 prepared to depart for Flushing Cemetery in Queens for the burial. \u201cWhen the mayor comes like that, it means the world to us in South Jamaica.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s remarks were spirited enough to earn him the title \u201cReverend de Blasio\u201d from Letitia A. James, the city\u2019s public advocate, who followed him to the pulpit.As a pastor, Mr. de Blasio was not entirely conciliatory. Running for re-election and dogged by a sometimes tense relationship with reporters, he obliquely mentioned newspaper articles that had discussed Mr. Caughman\u2019s relatively minor criminal record.\u201cThere were news reports about this man that somehow dwelt on something that happened to him that happened to every single one of us in this room,\u201d the mayor said, \u201cwhich is, somewhere along the way, we made a mistake. So why, if he\u2019s a victim, an innocent victim of a racist attack, does any reporter want to talk about a mistake he made along the way. Why is that pertinent?\u201dAs murmurs of assent began building, Mr. de Blasio declared, \u201cWhat\u2019s pertinent is that he was the victim of a racist attack.\u201d At that, there was applause.\u201cLet me be straightforward,\u201d Mr. de Blasio continued. \u201cWhat if it had been a black man who traveled to another city for the sole purpose \u2014 \u201d when a standing ovation made it impossible to hear the rest of the sentence. \u201cWould that have been front-page news? Day after day?\u201d\u201cStill,\u201d came the quiet answer from Kathy Toliver-Best, who knew Mr. Caughman when they were growing up in the South Jamaica Houses, a housing project just a few blocks down 107th Avenue from Mount Zion.Again, the mayor asked: \u201cWhat if \u2014 instead of an older man of modest means \u2014 it had been a banker or a lawyer or a celebrity, an actor or an actress? Don\u2019t you think that would then still be dominating our attention?\u201dAnd again Ms. Toliver-Best answered, not quite under her breath: \u201cEvery single day. Every channel.\u201dTo the people of the South Jamaica Houses \u2014 the \u201c40 Projects,\u201d as they are called because of the presence nearby of Public School 40 \u2014 Mr. Caughman was Hard Rock; not one to start a fight, but not one to a leave a fight unfinished, either.For 20 years, he lived in the Barbour Hotel on West 36th Street in Manhattan, which houses formerly homeless people transitioning to permanent housing. Because of that, Mr. Caughman was initially assumed to have been homeless. But he was actually a permanent resident.\u201cHe would never have been homeless,\u201d said Mr. Caughman\u2019s brother-in-law, Charles W. Johnson. \u201cNot with the family he had on both sides.\u201dNo matter the subject, Mr. Caughman was always an engaging conversationalist, said Portia Clark, who had known him since they were teenagers. She remembered being a fast walker as a girl and always cursing her fate just a bit when she ran into young Tim Hard Rock.\u201cI knew I had to slow down because I knew it was going to be a conversation,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cBut thank God I did because every conversation was enlightening and educational.\u201dHer husband, Carl Nimmons, stood in the aisle of Mount Zion and glanced over at the body of Mr. Caughman, in a brilliant robe of green polished cotton, a leather crown and white gloves to cover the scars on his hands from trying to fend off the man who killed him. Mr. Nimmons described a get-together a few months ago when the men resolved to let less time go by between reunions.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get together more often,\u201d he recalled them saying to one another. \u201cAnd not just at funerals.\u201dMoments later, the coffin lid was closed and the funeral began.Advertisement"}

In \u201cA Rabble of Dead Money\u201d \u2014 a title borrowed from Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2019s description of the stock market crash \u2014 Morris aims to give the reader a full account. He also offers an overview of the policy response, though here the story is largely restricted to the United States.While many works of popular history tend to shy away from discussing the scholarship that informs their writing, Morris does a splendid job of introducing the fierce academic debates over the Depression\u2019s causes. These excurses, scattered throughout the book, help illuminate why it is so hard to identify a single cause of the catastrophe.One area where Morris avoids placing blame is Wall Street, and he cites scholars who believe the crash of 1929 had almost nothing to do with the ensuing crisis. Morris concedes that the stock market was due for a correction, but he plays down the kind of financial shenanigans that have occupied other writers, save for a detailed account of the mountains of leverage amassed by the public utility magnate Samuel Insull.Morris instead turns his attention to the other side of the Atlantic. \u201cAll of the tangled threads that twisted together to create the catastrophe of the Depression originated in Europe,\u201d Morris declares, though he concedes that the policy response of the United States (along with that of Britain, Germany and France) didn\u2019t help matters. \u201cIt is hard to conceive of the Great Depression absent World War I,\u201d he says, and he begins his book with the colossal military miscalculations that sent Europe into the abyss. Most of the remainder of the book dwells at great length on the \u201cdisordered aftermath\u201d of this conflict overseas, which he believes set the stage for the collapse.This is refreshing, and Morris traces in considerable detail the economic effects of the war, beginning with Europe\u2019s abandonment of the gold standard and, even worse, the attempts to return to it at all costs (France gets particular blame for its \u201csemi-messianic drive \u2026 to force a gold-based deflation on the rest of Europe\u201d). His argument derives in no small part from the economist Barry Eichengreen\u2019s \u201cGolden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919-1939,\u201d and it\u2019s good to see these ideas given such prominence.Still, the average reader may not delight in being subjected to discussions of the nuts and bolts of war reparations and the endless negotiations in Europe over the gold standard. Morris does cover simultaneous developments in the United States, but these tend to showcase the underlying strength and resilience of the American economy. Though Morris acknowledges that the agricultural sector was a \u201claggard,\u201d and grants that the stock market was getting a little frothy by 1929, he insists it was \u201cinternational developments that pushed the United States over the brink\u201d and into the Great Depression.Indeed, if there\u2019s a culprit here, it\u2019s Europe, especially Germany with France a close second. At times, Morris goes out of his way to pillory Germany. \u201cThe Germans paid the reparations by borrowing from the war\u2019s victors, and rubbed it in by defaulting on the loans,\u201d he notes in a typical comment. In this account, Weimar Germany comes across as a nation of hypocritical deadbeats.More than a few historians might quibble with such a characterization, but the focus on Europe also distracts us from what was going on in the United States. Morris offers a quite comprehensive account of the American economy in this decade, but it is one that tends to emphasize the positive. To be sure, there was much to celebrate: The decade witnessed significant gains in productivity, driven by the automobile industry and \u201cthe marriage of electricity with mechanical production.\u201d He does an excellent job sketching these developments without succumbing to a simplistic entrepreneur-as-hero narrative.But there was more going on at this time. Two related trends merit more than a mention. The first was the enormous and growing role of finance. Thomas Philippon, an economist at New York University, has published papers on the financial service industry\u2019s share of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, or G.D.P. In the 1920s, finance\u2019s share of G.D.P. doubled, with most of the growth taking place in the second half of the decade.A comparable boom in the financial services industry took place in the lead-up to the 2008 crisis, and in both cases it\u2019s hard to read these as anything but a misallocation of economic resources. In each instance, the metastatic growth of finance, along with staggering amounts of debt, yielded towers of leverage that came crashing down. And then, as now, this had real effects on the larger economy.As in our own age, the growing dominance of finance in the 1920s went hand in hand with another trend: rising inequality. While Morris grudgingly acknowledges this fact, his claim that \u201cthe good times of the 1920s were such that even people on the bottom rungs of the ladder \u2026 could claim a modest share of the booming consumer economy\u201d is more typical of his rosy view.So, too, is his account of a black sharecropper buying a Model T with cash, to which he devotes three pages. But this was an anomaly. Yes, more people could afford more things, but most of those things came by purchasing on credit, not rising wages. Inequality skyrocketed in the 1920s, and the reason that this unpleasant fact could be ignored was because of the increase of personal debt and financial intermediation, much like the years preceding 2008.There is a growing literature within economics that examines the possibility that inequality, household debt and financial crises may be related, but Morris shows little interest in this kind of work, and he dismisses Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez\u2019s groundbreaking analysis of inequality as a \u201choary theory,\u201d a breezy rejection of some of the most widely discussed work in economics in recent years.Generally, however, Morris is remarkably evenhanded, giving both sides of scholarly debates in deep detail. This is particularly the case in his coverage of the New Deal, where he weighs the practical effects of the dizzying array of policies begun by Roosevelt, from his devaluation of the dollar to the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps. And Morris explains in accessible prose how economists have used modeling to study the New Deal (he wryly notes that this \u201cis still a work in progress \u2014 if only because results are often suspiciously consistent with the political dispositions of the modeler\u201d).\u201cA Rabble of Dead Money\u201d is a deft synthesis, blending colorful accounts of the past with the scholarly literature of the present. It may not be the last word on the Great Depression, but it is hard to imagine a more accessible and entertaining introduction to the subject.A picture caption on April 23 with a review of Charles R. Morris\u2019s \u201cA Rabble of Dead Money\u201d referred imprecisely to the location of the crowd of speculators shown on Oct. 24, 1929. While the speculators were indeed gathered at the New York Stock Exchange, they had spilled across the street to what is now the Federal Hall National Memorial, which is the building shown in the picture \u2014 not the stock exchange.Stephen Mihm is the author of \u201cA Nation of Counterfeiters: Capitalists, Con Men, and the Making of the United States\u201d and, with Nouriel Roubini, \u201cCrisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance.\u201d He teaches history at the University of Georgia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Media Is Subdued in the Face of North Korea-U.S. Standoff", "Date": "2017-04-22", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Commentators around the world are warning of a potential crisis on the Korean Peninsula. But in China, where the state controls much of the news media, the headlines have been subdued.Over the past two weeks, as North Korea has tested missiles and the United States has threatened to send warships to the region, there was just one fleeting front page reference to the tensions in People\u2019s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party.Experts say Beijing\u2019s relative silence may be an attempt to placate both Kim Jong-un of North Korea and President Trump, as well as to prevent the Chinese public from panicking.Here is a look at the themes dominating coverage of North Korea in the Chinese media, and what they reveal about Beijing\u2019s attitude toward Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump.So the news media there seemed to rejoice when, following a recent meeting in Florida with President Xi Jinping, Mr. Trump told Fox News that \u201cChina\u2019s trying to help us.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Trump said of Mr. Xi: \u201cWhat am I going to do, start a trade war with China in the middle of him working on a bigger problem, frankly, with North Korea?\u201d But the Chinese media summed up that sentiment as: \u201cAnd now you\u2019re asking me to stab China in the back? Don\u2019t you have a conscience?\u201dThat remark also inspired memes like the one above, published by Sina Finance, a news portal. The image in the meme, already popular in China, is a visibly perturbed yellow bird, apparently representing Mr. Trump. The caption below it reads: \u201cDon\u2019t you have a conscience?\u201dOn Chinese television, no discussion of North Korea is complete without footage of bombs and warplanes, helping to reinforce an image of American military aggression. In this segment, which aired on CCTV, China\u2019s state broadcaster, such footage accompanied commentary on whether the United States will go to war with North Korea.On North Korea and other issues, the Chinese news media often portrays the United States as a meddling, militaristic force.In this cartoon, published by Global Times, a stridently nationalist tabloid, the United States is depicted as a menacing man in a top hat, falsely accusing other countries of wrongdoing.Mao Zedong once said China and North Korea, longtime Communist allies, were \u201cas close as lips and teeth.\u201d But the relationship has suffered setbacks in recent years as frustration in China has grown over the North\u2019s volatile behavior.In this CCTV clip, a news announcer dryly narrates the parade, commenting on its \u201coriginality\u201d and adherence to Soviet style.The North Koreans proudly displayed missiles at the event, which they claim could soon carry nuclear warheads. But during the segment, any plans for a North Korean nuclear weapon simply went unmentioned.Zoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}

Ces refus concernent des objets consid\u00e9r\u00e9s par le gouvernement comme appartenant au patrimoine national et qui ont, dans la plupart des cas, \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9s sur des sites prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.La plupart des pi\u00e8ces pill\u00e9es dans des villages comme Joinville sont relativement courantes et de valeur bien moindre que celle d\u2019\u0153uvres d\u2019art ou de pi\u00e8ces provenant de b\u00e2timents plus nobles, qui sont souvent des pi\u00e8ces uniques.Mais le march\u00e9 est friand d\u2019objets du quotidien tels que des carreaux anciens ou d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de sols, des boiseries, des chemin\u00e9es et des tablettes de chemin\u00e9es, voire m\u00eame des escaliers. Ces pi\u00e8ces finissent souvent dans des maisons luxueuses en Allemagne, aux \u00c9tats-Unis, voire m\u00eame au Japon. D\u2019autres se retrouvent dans le sud de la France, rachet\u00e9es par des \u00e9trangers qui refont leur maison de vacances.\u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, un carrelage de cuisine en terre cuite du XIXe provenant de Joinville peut valoir environ 6 000 euros, selon la taille de la cuisine et l\u2019\u00e9tat des carreaux. Une tablette de chemin\u00e9e peut atteindre plus de 9 000 euros, et une ancienne porte antique en ch\u00eane 500 euros.Les pertes que subit Joinville vont bien au-del\u00e0 de leur valeur mercantile : une maison d\u00e9pouill\u00e9e de tant d\u2019ornements est presqu\u2019impossible \u00e0 vendre en raison du co\u00fbt des travaux n\u00e9cessaires, parfois de la stabilisation m\u00eame de la structure. La maison voisine perd \u00e9galement sa valeur et son attrait. Le village entier finit par perdre son attrait, sa vitalit\u00e9, voire sa population.Il arrive souvent que les sp\u00e9culateurs ach\u00e8tent un bien dans le seul but de le d\u00e9sosser. Il arrive aussi que ce soit un propri\u00e9taire dans le besoin ou souhaitant simplement r\u00e9nover sa maison qui comprend qu\u2019il peut tirer un profit imm\u00e9diat de la vente de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments, explique M. Koenig.\u201cLe march\u00e9 est assez important en France\u201d signale Simon de Monicault, directeur du d\u00e9partement mobilier et objets d\u2019art chez Christie\u2019s \u00e0 Paris. \u201cLa plupart des gens qui recherchent de l\u2019ancien vont d\u2019abord chercher en France, avant tout autre pays en Europe.\u201dTandis que Christie\u2019s ne vend que des pi\u00e8ces d\u2019exception, antiquaires et entreprises de r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration arpentent les campagnes fran\u00e7aises \u00e0 la recherche de pi\u00e8ces int\u00e9ressantes; ils frappent aux portes, passent des annonces dans les journaux locaux.Quoique le patrimoine national soit prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par des lois assez strictes, celles-ci sont peu respect\u00e9es par les \u00e9lus municipaux. Plus souvent, la restauration du patrimoine les mettrait en porte-\u00e0-faux avec les entrepreneurs immobiliers et les projets de modernisation n\u00e9cessaires, selon eux, au d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique locale.Un exemple en est la destruction \u00e0 Joinville, en 1950, d\u2019un march\u00e9 couvert du XVIIe si\u00e8cle sous pr\u00e9texte que le bois de sa structure pourrissait, mais aussi parce que personne ne souhaitait restaurer la b\u00e2tisse. Un centre commercial a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit \u00e0 la place.Pour Alexandre Gady, professeur d\u2019histoire de l\u2019art \u00e0 l\u2019universit\u00e9 Paris-Sorbonne, les Fran\u00e7ais souffrent d\u2019une schizophr\u00e9nie culturelle, partag\u00e9s entre leur amour pour le pass\u00e9 et leur amour pour la modernit\u00e9.\u201cLes Fran\u00e7ais installeront un jour une \u00e9olienne au milieu de la Galerie des Glaces en disant \u2018mais o\u00f9 est le probl\u00e8me ?\u2019 \u201d dit-il en se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la galerie centrale du Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles.M. Ollivier, le maire de Joinville, n\u2019entend cependant pas se laisser mouvoir. Il a entrepris de sauver ces maisons de son village qui sont pour lui comme des \u00eatres vivants portant dans leur bois, leurs briques et leurs pierres l\u2019histoire de la r\u00e9gion : son ascension et son d\u00e9clin, sa richesse et sa pauvret\u00e9, sa pr\u00e9\u00e9minence et son anonymat.Le maire a entrepris une demi-douzaine de projets en s\u2019appuyant sur les lois et en recrutant M. Koenig, un homme dynamique de 33 ans passionn\u00e9ment engag\u00e9 en faveur de la pr\u00e9servation du patrimoine, ainsi que No\u00e9mie Faux, une amoureuse des vieilles b\u00e2tisses n\u00e9e \u00e0 Joinville.Mme Faux \u00e9tablit un inventaire des vieilles maisons de Joinville qui d\u00e9taille chaque objet du patrimoine. L\u2019adjoint au maire Thierry Paquet a \u00e9galement joint l\u2019\u00e9quipe du projet, persuad\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9servation des b\u00e2timents contribuera \u00e0 attirer au village de nouvelles familles qui souhaiteront y \u00e9lever leurs enfants.L\u2019\u00e9quipe s\u2019appuie sur une loi rarement appliqu\u00e9e donnant au maire le droit d\u2019intervenir lorsqu\u2019il estime qu\u2019une construction (ou, dans ce cas, une d\u00e9construction) peut porter atteinte \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019un b\u00e2timent et n\u00e9cessiter des travaux. Un programme de parrainage d\u2019un b\u00e2timent a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour le financement de travaux de structure.Aujourd\u2019hui, alors que demeurent nombre de panneaux \u201c\u00c0 vendre\u201d dans la ville, la mairie cherche \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les acqu\u00e9reurs ne sont pas des sp\u00e9culateurs. Elle doit m\u00eame parfois puiser dans son propre budget, pourtant limit\u00e9, pour racheter des maisons et assurer leur pr\u00e9servation, avant de chercher un racheteur.\u201cJ\u2019ai propos\u00e9 beaucoup de ces missions dans des villes qui ont des probl\u00e8mes similaires \u201d, explique M. Koenig, ajoutant que la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9tait \u2018non, c\u2019est trop ambitieux, on ne peut pas faire \u00e7a, c\u2019est compliqu\u00e9, c\u2019est priv\u00e9. \u2019 \u201dCelle de M. Ollivier \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente : \u201cQuand on lui propose ici\u201d, continue M. Koenig, \u201cil dit toujours : \u2018oui, c\u2019est normal, pourquoi, il y a des villes qui ne le font pas ?\u2019 \u201dM. Ollivier r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 faire participer les habitants de la ville aux travaux. De nombreux b\u00e2timents sont d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s depuis des ann\u00e9es. Dans certains cas, l\u2019\u00c9tat fournit une aide financi\u00e8re.M. Ollivier a trouv\u00e9 un occupant pour une des maisons en question : une demeure spacieuse qui, contrairement \u00e0 de nombreuses maisons de Joinville, poss\u00e8de un petit jardin dont le gazon est bien entretenu. \u00c0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur, un beau parquet en bois, des moulures gracieusement courb\u00e9es, des miroirs au-dessus des tablettes de chemin\u00e9es en marbre, et des images peintes directement sur le mur au-dessus des doubles portes sculpt\u00e9es qui m\u00e8nent d\u2019une pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\u201cMoi je suis vraiment un Joinvillois pure souche\u201d, assure M. Ollivier. \u201cJe suis tr\u00e8s attach\u00e9 \u00e0 tout ce qui est patrimoine.\u201d\u201cMais on se doit d\u2019\u00eatre modeste\u201d, ajouta-t-il. \u201cCar quand on voit tout cet h\u00e9ritage du XVIIe si\u00e8cle, le ch\u00e2teau du XVIe si\u00e8cle, tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit, on a l\u2019obligation de les surveiller et de les prot\u00e9ger. C\u2019est vraiment notre mission premi\u00e8re.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is Ready for Tax Cuts, but His Treasury Department Isn\u2019t", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byBut two and a half months after taking office, President Trump does not appear to have the personnel in place to get an overhaul of the tax code out of the station.Is Mr. Trump\u2019s Treasury Department ready for such a mammoth task?\u201cThere are no people in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d said Paul O\u2019Neill, the first Treasury secretary to serve President George W. Bush. \u201cI think it\u2019s really a big problem.\u201dBut that\u2019s it. Mr. Trump has blamed Democrats for dragging out the confirmation process on his picks, but 21 out of 28 posts have yet to be nominated. A Treasury spokesman had no comment on the vacancies.At the current pace, Mr. Trump\u2019s Treasury appointees might not be in place until summer or later in the year, leaving the department\u2019s staff of career bureaucrats to handle the number crunching for a centerpiece of the president\u2019s legislative agenda.\u201cYou need someone who is empowered by the secretary to speak on tax issues for the department as a whole,\u201d said Mark Mazur, who served as assistant secretary for tax policy in the Obama administration\u2019s Treasury Department. \u201cThe slow pace of the transition makes it hard on Treasury as tax reform gets underway.\u201dMr. Mnuchin has had to do most of the heavy lifting so far. Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, where tax legislation originates, said last week that he had mostly been dealing with Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, to bridge the gap between the House Republican tax plans and those of the Trump administration. He said he had had little contact lately with Stephen K. Bannon or Stephen Miller, two of Mr. Trump\u2019s other top policy advisers.Mr. Mnuchin has tapped several senior advisers who do not require congressional confirmation to work on tax policy and serve as liaisons to Congress. He has even pulled from the ranks of former opponents of Mr. Trump to fill those positions.He has Justin Muzinich, formerly the president of the investment firm Muzinich & Company, advising him on tax policy. Mr. Muzinich was previously the national policy director for the presidential campaign of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.The Trump administration is weighing questions like whether to sign on to the \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax proposed by House Republicans and Speaker Paul D. Ryan. It must also decide if it wants to ultimately pursue a permanent \u201crevenue neutral\u201d tax overhaul or if it will go for an easier lift and pass a straight tax cut.\u201cThese are hard questions requiring good information and policy direction,\u201d said Fred T. Goldberg Jr., a former Internal Revenue Service commissioner who served as assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax policy in 1992. \u201cThey have the professional infrastructure, but they don\u2019t have the superstructure to provide the guidance on what specifically should be pursued.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bill de Blasio Turns Trump Administration Gibe Into Campaign Fuel", "Date": "2017-04-23", "News": "Supported byIt allowed Mr. de Blasio, in one moment, both to burnish his anti-Trump credentials and to wrap himself up in police uniform blue.The mayor, a Democrat, wasted no time on Friday in summoning the news media to Police Headquarters in Manhattan, where he stood beside his police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill. Mr. de Blasio shot back at Mr. Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who had sent New York and several other cities and jurisdictions a letter renewing threats to cut federal grant money if they did not remove communication barriers between the local police and immigration authorities.\u201cThe mayor\u2019s strategy is Trump, and it kind of gave him a lifeline in a lot of ways,\u201d Suri Kasirer, a Democratic political consultant, said, referring to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign strategy of serving as a foil to a president who is intensely unpopular in New York City. \u201cAnd it is certainly making lots of people who might not agree with him on every issue feel like he\u2019s standing up for them.\u201dShe added: \u201cThe Trump administration doesn\u2019t realize, or isn\u2019t focused on, how every time they hit New York or hit him, they\u2019re actually doing him a favor politically. They\u2019re stepping right into his strategy.\u201dMr. de Blasio called the accusations outrageous and absurd and said at the Friday news conference that \u201cthe notion of calling this city and our Police Department \u2018soft on crime\u2019 is unacceptable on its face and flies in the face of everything we have seen over the last quarter-century in this city.\u201d The mayor and Mr. O\u2019Neill cited police data showing that most major crimes had continued to decline sharply and were at historically low levels.At the same time, the smattering of Republican and independent candidates jockeying to run in November has consisted of untested newcomers who would have a difficult time gaining traction in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans among registered voters by more than six to one.And any Republican who ran against Mr. de Blasio would suffer from associations with Mr. Trump.\u201cAny time Bill de Blasio is talking about Donald Trump, he\u2019s winning,\u201d said William F. B. O\u2019Reilly, a Republican political consultant who has worked with one of the Republicans seeking to run for mayor, the real estate sales executive Paul J. Massey Jr.\u201cIt protects him on his left and in the center with the non-Trump supporter,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly said, \u201cand to some extent it protects him as a crime fighter on the right, so it\u2019s a double win whenever he gets to play that card.\u201dMr. O\u2019Reilly also said Mr. de Blasio\u2019s strategy was an effective way of sidelining the Republican mayoral hopefuls. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for anyone else in the conversation,\u201d he said.Phil Walzak, a senior adviser to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s re-election campaign, said the mayor was right to issue an aggressive response to the Justice Department\u2019s statement.\u201cThis demonstrates very much what Mayor de Blasio is about: standing up for and fighting for the people of New York, the city and the institutions of the city like the N.Y.P.D., against outrageous and factless statements like the one made by D.O.J. on Friday,\u201d Mr. Walzak said.On Sunday, Mr. Sessions appeared to back off the assertion that New York was soft on crime, saying during an interview on \u201cThis Week\u201d on ABC that the comment referred only to the city\u2019s policy toward cooperation with immigration authorities.\u201cFor four decades, New York has been a fabulous city for law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cThey have developed some of the best techniques ever. They\u2019re so far ahead of many other cities.\u201dHe even praised some of the policing strategies supported by Mr. de Blasio, saying, \u201cThey have proven community-based policing, broken-windows policing, to make cities safer, saved lives, and other cities need to be studying what they\u2019ve done.\u201dThe risk for the Republicans and independents hoping to unseat Mr. de Blasio is that confrontations like these might position those who question the mayor\u2019s crime-fighting bona fides on the side of Mr. Trump.Bo Dietl, a former police officer who until recently was a registered Republican, has announced his candidacy as an independent for mayor. Mr. Dietl, who operates a private security company, has been sharply critical of Mr. de Blasio on public safety and policing issues.\u201cYes, I think they\u2019re soft on crime, and it\u2019s the directive right from City Hall down through the police commissioner, and the poor cops have to take the brunt of walking around and being spat on, being treated like garbage,\u201d Mr. Dietl said, pointing to discontent among rank-and-file police officers with Mr. de Blasio.Mr. Dietl voted for Mr. Trump in November, but he said that should not define him as a candidate. \u201cDonald Trump is a narcissistic personality,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a narcissist. I\u2019m not a billionaire.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A New York baker ditched her oven to help organize the Women\u2019s March. And an entrepreneur in Georgia decided to walk away from his business and run for the House of Representatives.The election of President Trump has provoked elation, outrage and self-reflection among Americans across the political spectrum. For some, it has even prompted something more drastic: a career change.In the last few months, professionals across the country have decided to leave conventional jobs and get involved in politics or activism.\u201cIt feels like we are in this existential crisis of democracy,\u201d said Matt Ewing, who abandoned a career at SolarCity to join Swing Left, a group hoping to get out the vote in competitive congressional districts in 2018. \u201cGoing back to work in my comfortable corporate job didn\u2019t make sense anymore.\u201dHere are a half-dozen Americans \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 describing how the election has changed the arc of their careers.Before the election, Ms. Butler said, the closest she got to politics was when she baked sweets for a\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0rally hosted by the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. But after the election, a creeping sense of dread set in.\u201cThere I was teaching people how to make gluten-free cookies,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it seemed so petty and meaningless when all of this was happening.\u201dMs. Butler found an outlet a few weeks later, when she saw a Facebook post from a friend, Bob Bland, a fashion entrepreneur. Ms. Bland was helping to organize the Women\u2019s March on Washington, and Ms. Butler volunteered to help.In the weeks that followed, Ms. Butler became an integral part of a team putting together the Women\u2019s March events, and is now winding down her baking business to continue working with Ms. Bland and the other organizers full time.\u201cI\u2019m making a transition from pastry chef to activist,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of history now.\u201dAs a successful entrepreneur, Mr. Abroms mostly stayed away from politics. He trained as a public accountant, then started a company that converted vehicles to run on natural gas.Mr. Abroms supported Senator Marco Rubio in the primaries and ultimately voted for Evan McMullin, an independent, in the election.He is financing his run with $250,000 of his own money and says he is committed to staying involved in politics, even if he doesn\u2019t win Mr. Price\u2019s old seat.\u201cI enjoy business,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this country is in such crisis that I couldn\u2019t just sit on the sidelines. I needed to participate.\u201dAs a student at Rutgers University, Mr. Hansen majored in American studies and volunteered for various community organizations. But after graduating, he was drawn to the tech scene and learned how to code.By last year, he worked for Shotput, a supply chain logistics start-up based in Oakland, Calif. Backed by the hit-making incubator Y Combinator, Shotput offered Mr. Hansen a good salary and access to the Silicon Valley elite.But\u00a0the election rekindled his latent passion for civic engagement. He quit Shotput and decided to devote himself to repairing the country\u2019s frayed social fabric.\u201cThis election was a reaction to people not being heard,\u201d Mr. Hansen said. \u201cA lot of that is the failure of state, local and federal governments to communicate with people.\u201dMr. Hansen, who walked away from a nearly six-figure job to develop Hey Mayor, has not yet figured out how to pay himself. \u201cMy programming friends are still making fun of me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think I\u2019m insane.\u201dHis parents, too, have their doubts. \u201cThey\u2019re constantly telling me to get a job at Johnson & Johnson,\u201d he said.Mr. Polisner worked at the software company Oracle for decades, moving up to manage cloud computing accounts, and eventually earning about $200,000 a year.He had always dabbled in liberal politics, organizing\u00a0fund-raisers\u00a0for local Democrats, but that was about it.\u201cI am not with President-elect Trump and I am not here to help him in any way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTherefore I must resign from this once-great company.\u201dInitially, Mr. Polisner didn\u2019t know what he was going to do next. He figured he would apply for a job at Google or Salesforce.\u201cPeople are getting frustrated with petitions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to provide the opportunity take lightweight actions to heavyweight actions.\u201dMr. Polisner\u2019s children are grown, and he and his wife have decided to curtail their expenses while he builds Civic Works.\u201cFormer paydays are now days of mourning at my house,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would rather do something of high value to society and earn less money than I would have my soul purchased every two weeks with a big check.\u201dAs an editor at The Wall Street Journal last year, Mr. Carney watched admiringly as upstart media outlets, including Breitbart, the conservative website previously controlled by Steve Bannon, a Trump adviser,\u00a0channeled\u00a0the energy behind Mr. Trump\u2019s political rise.\u201cBreitbart was one of the few places that seemed to understand the pulse of the nation and the direction we were going better than much larger news organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saw what was going to happen more clearly than everyone else.\u201dIn the aftermath of the election, Mr. Carney decided that he should do more than simply read Breitbart; he should work there. In January, he left The Journal and joined Breitbart to lead a new finance and economics section.Mr. Carney said he didn\u2019t believe Breitbart was an inherently pro-Trump publication. \u201cThey\u2019re standing by him so long as he stands by the center-right populism and nationalism that got him elected,\u201d he said.But Mr. Carney, a Republican, was solidly in Mr. Trump\u2019s camp through the election, voting for him during the primaries and in the general election. \u201cIt was the first time I voted in this century,\u201d he said.This isn\u2019t Mr. Carney\u2019s first foray into the political arena. He worked for\u00a0Pat Buchanan\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996, and saw echoes of Mr. Buchanan\u2019s populism in Mr. Trump.Mr. Carney\u2019s last day at The Journal was Jan. 20, the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated.After graduating from the University of Oxford, Mr. Torricke-Barton immigrated to the United States and secured a series of influential jobs.He wrote speeches for executives at Google, became Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s speechwriter at Facebook, then joined as head of communications SpaceX, the private rocket company founded by Elon Musk.Over the years, Mr. Torricke-Barton had never been very political. But last year, he watched in dismay as Britons voted to leave the European Union.

Now he is turning Onwards into a nonprofit organization focused on rebuilding trust in government.\u201cWe need to get more citizens more engaged with these institutions,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ohio County That Backed Trump, Word of Housing Cuts Stirs Fear", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "Supported byKINSMAN, Ohio \u2014 For years, Tammy and Joseph Pavlic tried to ignore the cracked ceiling in their living room, the growing hole next to their shower and the deteriorating roof they feared might one day give out. Mr. Pavlic worked for decades installing and repairing air-conditioning and heating units, but three years ago, with multiple sclerosis advancing, he had to leave his job.By 2015, Ms. Pavlic was supporting her husband and their three children on an annual salary of $9,000, earned at a restaurant. That year, they tapped a county program funded by Congress, called the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, to help repair their house.The next year, they voted for Donald J. Trump, who has moved to eliminate the HOME program.The Pavlics\u2019 ceiling may no longer be cracked, but in the zero-sum game that Mr. Trump\u2019s budget seeks to set up, the nation is showing new fissures. The president\u2019s budget proposal would cut deeply into the Department of Housing and Urban Development, paring rental assistance and eliminating heating and air-conditioning aid, energy-efficiency assistance, and partnerships with local governments like HOME. With the savings, Mr. Trump says, he would beef up military spending and build a wall along the Mexican border.\u201cKeeping the country safe compared to keeping my bathroom safe isn\u2019t even a comparison,\u201d Mr. Pavlic, 42, said. \u201cWe have people who are coming into this country who are trying to hurt us, and I think that we need to be protected.\u201dHis wife is hoping Mr. Trump changes his mind.\u201cI am glad that he is our president, but I do believe, though, that if he could see this from a personal point of view that he would probably maybe change his mind about cutting this program,\u201d Ms. Pavlic, 44, said. \u201cAny mom wants their kids to be safe, so any mom wants their home to be safe.\u201dHOME Investment Partnerships is one of dozens of programs and independent agencies aimed at the poor \u2014 including the Appalachian Regional Commission, AmeriCorps, the Legal Services Corporation and the Interagency Council on Homelessness \u2014 that Mr. Trump has proposed cutting. The budget for the fiscal year beginning in October would cut $6.2 billion \u2014 about 13 percent \u2014 from HUD, eliminating the Community Development Block Grant program, which funds local initiatives like Meals on Wheels and anti-poverty efforts; and the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity and Choice Neighborhoods programs, which aim to replace distressed public housing with mixed-income development.The county, which voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump, is the type of place where people might hope to be great again. Open fields of overgrown grass line winding roads that lead to rusted steel mills and shuttered factories. The median household income in the county, which is about 90 percent white and 8 percent black, dropped by $7,400, to $42,368, from 2006 to 2015, while the population declined by 14,000, to 203,750. Near Kinsman is Masury, which locals have nicknamed Misery.\u201cOur county voted for President Trump, so I\u2019m not sure they quite understand what is going to happen,\u201d Ms. Edwards said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people realize how much we rely on these services. I don\u2019t think people are making the connection between cutting the HUD funds and paving our streets or building new affordable housing.\u201dNo president\u2019s budget is enacted as presented to Congress, and Mr. Trump\u2019s is already facing bipartisan opposition. Representative Hal Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, pushed back hard shortly after Mr. Trump released his proposals. \u201cWhile we have a responsibility to reduce our federal deficit, I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed in the president\u2019s skinny budget are draconian, careless and counterproductive,\u201d Mr. Rogers said in a statement.\u201cThe welfare state is extremely large, far larger than anyone on the left likes to acknowledge,\u201d Mr. Rector said. \u201cWhat is necessary to reform this system is to reduce the amount of waste and take some of that waste and retarget to more effective programs for the poor. And I really think that is what you will see out of the Trump administration in the long term.\u201dMarion McFadden, the vice president for public policy at Enterprise Community Partners, an affordable housing organization, is not so sanguine. In her view, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget would turn Washington\u2019s back on America\u2019s most vulnerable populations.\u201cYou\u2019ve got an extraordinary number of low-income people who are devoting so much of their income to housing,\u201d said Ms. McFadden, who spent 15 years at HUD, including two running the HOME and Community Development Block Grant programs. \u201cThese programs are carefully targeted to ensure they serve people of modest means. Taking the funds away from communities will be really devastating in some places.\u201dTo William Brown, a former trucking company manager in Masury, the proposed cuts are not fodder for an academic argument: They\u2019re just wrong.\u201cEverything he is doing is systematically horrible for this country,\u201d said Mr. Brown, who voted for Hillary Clinton and hasn\u2019t worked since 2009 after he had a heart attack and was laid off from his job. \u201cFor him to even consider taking a program away when we can spend all this money for him to go down to Florida every weekend, how many people can use that money?\u201dMr. Brown, 67, who lives on a monthly Social Security check of $1,400, feared he would have to move into an assisted living facility if he couldn\u2019t repair his decaying home. He said he was ashamed to ask for government help but listened to a township official who encouraged him to apply for HOME money.\u201cThat program saved me,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s life can turn in half a second. You can wake up and be devastated tomorrow. Same as anybody here.\u201dIn Warren, Amber Barr, 34, lives in a women\u2019s supportive housing complex and regrets voting for Mr. Trump. She and her 4-year-old daughter, Brooklynn, survive on a $588 disability check and $340 in food stamps every month. Her rent is $99, and she fears that Mr. Trump\u2019s housing cuts are just the beginning.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have these programs, I wouldn\u2019t have any kind of support, I wouldn\u2019t have any kind of direction as to what to do, where to go, and I wouldn\u2019t have any money to help me find resources,\u201d Ms. Barr said, as she began to cry.Housing assistance has helped her focus on getting treatment for hepatitis C, attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and seeing a psychiatrist for anxiety. It also meant escaping the temporary housing she was in for several months after leaving an abusive relationship.Last week, as she thought of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, Ms. Barr stood outside her building nervously clutching the only money she had left for the month: six quarters she hoped to put under her daughter\u2019s pillow as a gift from the tooth fairy.\u201cI don\u2019t plan on being here forever,\u201d Ms. Barr said, wiping away tears. \u201cPeople that are getting help right now are succeeding. People are not going to succeed. They are going to give up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Delays, Hong Kong\u2019s Ambitious Museum Plan Takes Shape", "Date": "2017-04-18", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetLong famous for its food, finance and shopping, Hong Kong is eager to broaden its image with the opening of M+, a museum of visual culture, in late 2019.Officials expect the $640 million, government-funded museum to stand peer to peer with contemporary art icons such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Tate Modern in London. They want the city to emerge as the cultural capital of Asia as other art venues open nearby.Some critics also wonder how much curatorial freedom M+ will be able to exert, as the Chinese government increases its sway over a former British colony that on paper is supposed to operate under its own laws.Officials from the authority declined to discuss the issue, but stressed that they had seen \u201ccontinuous good progress on the construction of M+ over the past two years.\u201dThe building\u2019s name is meant to indicate that it is a museum and more. Starting with work from the mid-1950s, it will present 20th- and 21st-century Asian art, film, architecture and design with a Hong Kong perspective. It will bring visibility to Chinese and Japanese artists who are unknown today, Mr. Chong said.Museum galleries will be in the horizontal slab while the 17-floor skyscraper will house offices, a members\u2019 lounge and restaurants. The face of the tower will resemble a drive-in movie screen. At night the surface will glow with LED lights, displaying works of still or moving art, visible across Victoria Harbor. The edifice will be set in a grassy park with a waterfront promenade.Public reactions to the design are mixed \u2014 some calling it sublime, others referring to it as bland. \u201cArchitecturally it doesn\u2019t have that \u2018wow\u2019 factor,\u201d said Fred Scholle, owner of Galerie du Monde, Hong Kong\u2019s longest running contemporary art gallery, which has been in operation since 1974. \u201cBut it definitely conveys the fact it is a great museum that visually works extremely well with its location.\u201d\u201cI have no doubt that M+ will be a museum of absolute world class,\u201d Mr. Nittve said. \u201cIt already has an international top class team, and the collection is already amazing. Hong Kong will get the museum Asia does not have, which was the task I was given almost seven years ago.\u201dCitywide programs have been instilling the M+ message into public consciousness since 2012. The message reaches schools through the M+ Rover, a customized art trailer. Lectures, summer camps, exhibitions and films are also part of the promotions.M+ recently gave the public a sneak peek of its Hong Kong collection in \u201cAmbiguously Yours: Gender in Hong Kong Popular Culture,\u201d which examined themes of sexual identity in film, pop music and magazines.Not all are happy with the museum\u2019s direction. Among its critics is Mathias Woo, executive director of the experimental theater company Zuni Icosahedron and a former member of the cultural district\u2019s arts and cultural advisory group. He said the museum did not reflect the Hong Kong voice because the executive staff was not from Hong Kong, and the bulk of the collection did not represent Hong Kong society.\u201cM+ is just a MoMA or a Tate, without a true Hong Kong soul,\u201d Mr. Woo said, adding that top management had \u201cno knowledge about Hong Kong society and Hong Kong arts.\u201dBut Katie de Tilly, co-president of the Hong Kong Art Gallery Association, countered that few locals had experience in starting and running a world-class museum. \u201cWe need to rely on the experts,\u201d she said.At the same time, she added, \u201cThe Hong Kong point of view is as diverse and international as this city is.\u201dAlso at issue is how much freedom of expression M+ will be allowed. Some in the art world say that the new entity will have more license for expression than any other museum in China.\u201cThe threat to freedom of expression does exist, not only to M+ but all cultural institutions and media organizations in Hong Kong,\u201d said Vivienne Chow, an art and culture critic and founding director of the nonprofit Cultural Journalism Campus in Hong Kong.In her opinion, government censorship is not overt, but Hong Kong institutions often self-censor to avoid trouble.Mr. Nittve holds a different perspective. \u201cSo far, Chinese censorship has not affected the cultural activities in Hong Kong, and hopefully that will not change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it were to happen, that of course would severely damage M+. You can\u2019t be world class under censorship.\u201dAs a nod to its freedom, the museum previously showcased works from the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, known for his outspoken criticism of the Beijing government. M+ also displayed photographs of the bloody aftermath of the 1989 China pro-democracy demonstrations.These same works would have been banned in mainland China, Ms. Chow said. \u201cM+ demonstrated its determination in safeguarding artistic freedom when Lars Nittve was the museum\u2019s executive director.\u201dFor now, expectant eyes are focused on the swinging cranes and beams stationed on the M+ property. By 2019, it will have been 10 years in the making.\u201cIf this proves to be what we are all expecting,\u201d said Mr. Scholle of Galerie du Monde, \u201cHong Kong will have one of the finest contemporary art museums in the world, especially for Chinese contemporary art.\u201dA picture caption with an article on the Square Feet page on April 19 about the West Kowloon Cultural District and coming M+ museum of visual culture referred incorrectly to the construction site shown.

{"Headline": "Five Studios\u2019 Mission: Winning the Distribution Rights to James Bond", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 A five-studio tug of war has broken out over James Bond.On Tuesday, for instance, leaders at Sony spent an hour making their case. Kazuo Hirai, the chief executive, helped give the pitch, which emphasized the studio\u2019s deep knowledge of Bond and its ideas for expanding the franchise\u2019s reach. In true Hollywood fashion, Sony gave its presentation inside a sound stage on a recreated set from \u201cDr. No,\u201d which was released in the United States in 1963 by United Artists and laid the foundation for the entire series.Casting for the franchise has not been discussed in the meetings, according to the people briefed on them, although producers hope Daniel Craig will play the lead for at least one more chapter. He has a gap on his docket, according to movie industry databases, that would allow for filming.Representatives for MGM, Eon and the studios pursuing the rights either had no comment or did not return calls.The eagerness to land Bond underscores the continuing strength of the series but also the realities of the modern movie business. As competition for leisure time increases, studios have focused more intently on global blockbusters, and those are in short supply. In some ways, the Bond series was the first to go after a worldwide audience.Yet the deal that studios are hotly chasing is not very profitable.Under its previous agreement, Sony paid 50 percent of the production costs for \u201cSpectre\u201d \u2014 which totaled some $250 million after accounting for government incentives \u2014 but received only 25 percent of certain profits, once costs were recouped. Sony also shouldered tens of millions of dollars in marketing and had to give MGM a piece of the profit from non-Bond films Sony had in its own pipeline, including \u201c22 Jump Street.\u201dWhy, then, do studios want to distribute Bond so badly? Bragging rights, mostly. Having a Bond movie on the schedule guarantees at least one hit in a business where there is almost no sure thing.Bond is gargantuan: The 25 movies have taken in nearly $6 billion at the North American box office, after adjusting for inflation, according to Box Office Mojo. The series has generated billions more in overseas ticket sales, home entertainment revenue, television reruns, marketing partnerships (Omega watches, Aston Martin cars, Gillette razors) and video games.The person Ms. Ellison and the other bidders need to impress the most is Barbara Broccoli, who runs Eon Productions. Moviemaking is a collaborative process, but Ms. Broccoli and her older half brother, Michael G. Wilson, have final say over every line of dialogue, casting decision, stunt sequence, marketing tie-in, TV ad, poster and billboard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.M.F. Torn Over Whether to Bail Out Greece Once Again", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the International Monetary Fund approaches the seventh anniversary of the contentious Greek bailout, it is torn over whether to commit new loans to a nearly bankrupt Greece.For more than a year, I.M.F. officials have been saying \u2014 loudly \u2014 that they cannot participate in a new rescue package for Greece unless Europe agrees to ease Greece\u2019s onerous debt burden.The fund\u2019s reluctance to commit additional money to Greece also highlights a widely held view among I.M.F. officials \u2014 and in the Trump administration \u2014 that the fund overextended itself in Greece. They also see the responsibility for restoring the country\u2019s economic health as resting primarily with Europe, which currently holds 80 percent of Greek debt.At the same time, Greece, which has acceded to demands from the fund to cut spending and bring in more revenue, faces a 7 billion euro debt repayment in July, which it may not be able to meet if the I.M.F. and Europe cannot reach a new bailout agreement.In many ways, the situation in Greece has become an existential question for the I.M.F.The fund has been criticized for overcommitting financial resources to the European debt crisis.For example, the \u20ac30 billion the fund lent to Greece in 2010 was 30 times more than the sum of Greece\u2019s financial contribution to the fund as a member, which is called a quota. The loan is one of the largest in the history of the fund, which was formed in 1944.Yet the I.M.F. has an obligation to lend to countries that are in financial need as well as to safeguard global financial stability.\u201cThe fund is digging in its heels, but if the pattern of brinkmanship that the Europeans and the Greeks have practiced in the past prevails, you will see more instability in the markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is definitely creating anxiety \u2014 both within the fund and within national governments.\u201dUnlike at previous spring meetings, questions about Greece did not monopolize the public discourse this week as finance ministers, central bankers and financiers from around the world gathered in Washington to assess international economic trends.But behind closed doors, how to proceed with Greece consumed a lot of time, as usual, participants said. Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister, met with an array of officials, as he usually does at I.M.F. meetings, but little progress was made according to people who were briefed on the discussions but were not authorized to speak on the record.Publicly, the mantra of fund officials, starting with Christine Lagarde, the managing director, was the same: The numbers had to add up before the fund could consider disbursing new cash.\u201cWe had constructive discussions in preparation for the return of the mission to discuss the two legs of the Greece program: policies and debt relief,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said in a statement on Friday after meeting with Mr. Tsakalotos.That means that for the I.M.F. to lend, Greece must prove that it can be financially responsible over a sustained period, and Europe must address the country\u2019s substantial debt overhang with some combination of interest rate reductions and maturity extensions.Germany and other northern European creditor nations, who are deeply suspicious of Greece\u2019s ability to manage its finances over the long term, have promised voters that they will only agree to another Greek bailout if the I.M.F. provides its imprimatur.Still, despite an unusual economic performance by Greece, which ended 2016 with a budget surplus of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 the highest in recent memory for the notoriously profligate nation \u2014 I.M.F. officials conceded last week that they were not close to a deal.The paper, which addresses the thorny question of how much debt relief Greece actually needs, was published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics this month, and has become required reading for policy makers on all sides of the Greek talks.It made two critical points. It questioned Greece\u2019s ability to consistently deliver large enough budget surpluses to allow it to pay down its debt \u2014 which now stands at \u20ac326 billion, or 180 percent the size of the Greek economy.And while the document accepted that Europe had proposed feasible measures to reduce the debt, such as extending maturities and lowering rates, it argued that for these steps to make a difference, Europe might have to commit as much as \u20ac100 billion in additional loans to keep Greece afloat.As someone who has worked on both sides of the divide \u2014 Mr. Zettelmeyer was also an economist at the I.M.F. \u2014 his goal in producing the paper was to find that elusive common ground that would allow Greece, Europe and the I.M.F. to reach an agreement.But after 53 pages and countless hours of brainstorming, he came to the same conclusion as many others before him: There is no simple way out of the Greek mess.\u201cIt\u2019s dispiriting \u2014 while there are technical solutions there are big political problems attached to all of them,\u201d Mr. Zettelmeyer said in an interview. \u201cThere is a presumption that there will just be more procrastination. And that is hard to swallow because things could get out of control.\u201dThat is why some analysts believe that the I.M.F. and Germany will find a way to compromise, with Europe agreeing to just enough debt relief to allow the fund to come back on board.\u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d Mr. Henning, the author, said. \u201cWith these European elections, the last thing anyone wants is another Greek crisis.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wells Fargo to Claw Back $75 Million From 2 Former Executives", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byThe clawbacks \u2014 or forced return of pay and stock grants \u2014 are the largest in banking history and among the largest in corporate America. A four-person committee of Wells Fargo\u2019s directors investigated the extensive fraud.Wells Fargo\u2019s misdeeds, which came to light in September, have at least temporarily become a more widely recognized symbol of the bank than its signature stagecoach. Bankers across Wells Fargo\u2019s giant branch system were tacitly encouraged to meet their sales goals by committing fraud; opening unwanted or unneeded accounts in customers\u2019 names; and, sometimes, moving money into and out of the sham accounts.While the amount of money customers lost was relatively small \u2014 the company has refunded $3.2 million \u2014 the scope of the fraud was huge: 5,300 bankers were fired for creating as many as two million unwanted bank and credit card accounts. In one detail revealed by the report, a branch manager had a teenage daughter with 24 accounts and a husband with 21.Neither Ms. Tolstedt, who was allowed to retire in July but was subsequently fired, nor Mr. Stumpf, who was permitted to retire in October after being castigated during congressional hearings on the scandal, was available on Monday to comment. Mr. Stumpf cooperated with the board\u2019s investigation; Ms. Tolstedt declined to be interviewed.Ms. Tolstedt\u2019s lawyer, Enu Mainigi of the Washington firm Williams & Connolly, issued a statement challenging the board\u2019s findings.\u201cWe strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt,\u201d Ms. Mainigi said. \u201cA full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion.\u201dThe board\u2019s report, compiled by the law firm Shearman & Sterling after interviews with 100 current and former employees and a review of 35 million documents, said it was obvious where the problems lay. Structurally, the bank was too decentralized, with department heads like Ms. Tolstedt given the mantra of \u201crun it like you own it\u201d and granted broad authority to shake off questions from superiors, subordinates or lateral colleagues.Many things collectively should have raised suspicion, the report said. Customers were failing to fund, or put money into, their new accounts at alarming rates. Regional managers were imploring their bosses to drop sales goals, saying they were unrealistic and bad for customers.Particularly in Arizona and Los Angeles, where the toxic culture was most pronounced, some managers explicitly told subordinates to sell people accounts even if they did not need them.Mr. Stumpf was warned as early as 2012 about \u201cnumerous\u201d complaints about the company\u2019s sales tactics \u2014 from both customers and employees \u2014 but he ignored growing evidence that the problem was pervasive, the board said in its report.Much of the pressure-cooker climate, the report said, stemmed from Ms. Tolstedt, who led Wells Fargo\u2019s retail branch network for eight years. The report casts her as a powerful and insular leader who set unreasonable targets, castigated those who criticized them and actively ignored signs that some managers and employees were cheating to meet them.\u201cShe resisted and rejected the near unanimous view of senior regional bank leaders that the sales goals were unreasonable and led to negative outcomes and improper behavior,\u201d the report said.Timothy J. Sloan, who succeeded Mr. Stumpf as chief executive, was largely exonerated by the report, even though he was also a career Wells Fargo executive. As president and chief operating officer, he became Ms. Tolstedt\u2019s immediate supervisor in November 2015. At that point, the report said, he \u201cassessed her performance over several months before deciding that she should not continue to lead the community bank.\u201dAsked about the timing of Mr. Stumpf\u2019s options exercise, Stephen W. Sanger, the board\u2019s chairman and the leader of its investigation, said at a news conference on Monday that it was a routine move that did not raise concern. The $28 million that the board is taking back from Mr. Stumpf \u2014 the proceeds of a 2013 equity grant \u2014 will be deducted from his retirement plan payouts, Mr. Sanger said.Nearly all public companies have clawback provisions, but boards are typically loath to invoke them. Wells Fargo\u2019s example may inspire future directors, said Charles M. Elson, a professor of finance at the University of Delaware and an expert on corporate governance.\u201cI welcome the move,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a shareholder of Wells Fargo, and I\u2019m glad they did it.\u201dMr. Sanger took over as the board\u2019s chairman from Mr. Stumpf. All four members of Wells Fargo\u2019s independent investigation group were on the board before the settlement was announced.The report depicted the board as hoodwinked by bank executives who withheld important facts. It praised the changes the bank had made recently, which include ending sales goals for its retail bank employees.Such conclusions are unlikely to quiet the bank\u2019s critics. Better Markets, a nonprofit organization that advocates stricter regulation of Wall Street, called the report a compendium of \u201ctoo-little, too-late cosmetic actions\u201d and called on shareholders to oust all of Wells Fargo\u2019s board members at the company\u2019s annual meeting on April 25.Two influential advisory firms have also recommended significant changes to the company\u2019s board.Mr. Sanger said that the report issued on Monday concluded nearly all of the bank\u2019s investigation and that no further terminations or clawbacks were expected. But other investigations \u2014 including criminal inquiries by the Justice Department and several state attorneys general \u2014 remain in progress, raising the possibility of criminal charges.The agency has also warned Wells Fargo that it is likely to order the bank to reinstate another worker who said she was fired in 2011 after trying to call her supervisors\u2019 attention to accounts that she said had been fraudulently created.So far, Shearman & Sterling has found no evidence of retaliation, said Stuart J. Baskin, a partner at the firm.\u201cWe still have a few loose ends, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely to change any findings,\u201d he said.Wells Fargo is eager to put its sales scandal behind it, but customers are not quite so willing to move on. The number of consumer checking accounts opened in February dropped 43 percent compared with a year earlier, and credit card applications declined 55 percent.The financial damage caused to customers by Wells Fargo\u2019s fraudulent acts was relatively minimal, but the issue has loomed large in the public imagination in part because the bank\u2019s transgressions were so blatant \u2014 and so simple.Mr. Sloan, the bank president, said at a news conference after the report was issued that he had some regrets about how the bank\u2019s leadership \u2014 and he in particular \u2014 had handled the years of warnings.\u201cIn hindsight, I wish we would have taken more action and would have done things more quickly,\u201d he said. The bank\u2019s sales incentives should have been eliminated sooner, he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the law firm that compiled a report on the culture at Wells Fargo. It is Shearman & Sterling, not Shearling & Sterling.Advertisement"}

Liveried footmen stood by at dinner. Those who wanted to pray could attend a private chapel.But this was followed by overexpansion and, in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, inescapable debt. Ms. Kluge, who was remarried to William Moses, a former global vice president for IBM for media and entertainment, had to put her vineyard on the market.In 2010, with financial pressures mounting, she needed to sell her furniture and jewelry. A highly publicized Sotheby\u2019s auction brought in $20 million. The sale did not stave off bankruptcy. A year later, when Ms. Kluge filed, her situation was particularly severe, even in today\u2019s world where \u201cmany wealthy widows end up with nothing but houses after their husbands die, and they don\u2019t have the income-producing assets to support their lifestyles,\u201d said William Zabel, a New York lawyer who handles the estates of many wealthy families.There was also a contentious battle over the land held by a trust for her son, John Kluge Jr., that included 217 acres adjacent to the Albemarle property. Access to Albemarle went through the Kluge property, and Trump Virginia Acquisitions had bought this parcel before Mr. Trump acquired the house, agreeing to pay $150,000 up front and 5 percent of the purchase price of Albemarle if he bought it within two years. Strategically it gave Mr. Trump a major advantage. Who else would want the house with another owner holding the adjacent land?Ultimately the Trump company got Albemarle but refused to pay the balance it owed on the land. So the trust took on the Trump interests. In one tactic, the trust lawyer sued to get the land back from the Trumps and said the $150,000 would be returned. Had the trust won, the Trump Organization would have found itself owning the house but not the front yard, exactly what the trust had planned for its adversary.But the lawsuit was settled \u201cin a manner that was acceptable to the trust,\u201d its lawyer, Ed MacMahon Jr., said in a telephone interview.A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization declined to comment.When the bankruptcy was over, Ms. Kluge did not walk away with much. She and Mr. Moses had listed assets of $2.6 million and liabilities of $47.5 million.She spent considerable time thinking about what to do next.\u201cI had to sell both my garden-furniture collection and my jewelry collection at auction,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought about designing garden furniture, but my lawyer thought it was impractical.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t think anyone would buy that stuff, but then he lives in an apartment,\u201d she added, with a laugh, \u201cand jewelry was an easier pitch.\u201dMs. Kluge is hardly the first society woman to try her hand at the decorative arts (Ivanka Trump comes to mind at the moment).But Ms. Kluge, 68, might bring a special perspective. Speaking with the British accent she acquired as a girl at an English-language school in Baghdad, Iraq, where she grew up, she recalled her long history with expensive baubles.\u201cI began getting jewelry when I was 3 months old,\u201d she said, looking easily elegant in wool slacks and a cashmere turtleneck. \u201cIn that part of the world, people give jewelry for events from birth to retirement.\u201dTough as the situation was, \u201cmy grandfather taught me to \u2018get on with it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Kluge said. \u201cI can turn around as quick as a polo pony. People ask me all the time how I go on.\u201d\u201cBut what am I holding onto?\u201d Ms. Kluge asked rhetorically. \u201cI lost nothing that was important. I was taught that if you can\u2019t fix it, move on. You don\u2019t whine and hang on.\u201dKermit Rosenberg, the couple\u2019s personal bankruptcy lawyer, said he had found Ms. Kluge highly unusual because she did not define herself by things. \u201cI have seen people fight over inconsequential things,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said. \u201cBut she just wanted some family drawings and porcelains. For the rest, she said, \u2018This is just stuff.\u2019 She did not come across as materialistic. And that has remained my impression of her since then.\u201dShe has been working with jewel designers who interpret her collection, which she describes to them, and they turn it into drawings. Then Dominique Muller, of Bermudes Joaillerie in Paris, makes the jewelry.Ms. Kluge is focusing on women she thinks know her best. Among her designs is a set of gold coral earrings and a ring for $60,000 and a $36,000 pin. She said the average price was $30,000 to $45,000.Her favorite right now: drop earrings she is calling \u201cbonefish,\u201d with sapphires surrounded by diamonds and moonstones, which she is selling for $40,000.\u201cI like classical style but I also think my jewelry is very chic,\u201d Ms. Kluge said. \u201cThese pieces are for people who dress up and have a big formal life. The colors are seasonal and useful. If you are on your boat, you can wear that fish. On their yacht, in the Hamptons, in the South of France. And yet, they are so beautiful that you can wear them on the dead night of winter.\u201dHow is she financing the effort? \u201cWe scrimped and saved and started it,\u201d said Ms. Kluge, who has returned to Manhattan with Mr. Moses. Several friends as well as her son, John Jr., are \u201cchipping in.\u201dOne longtime friend, Chris Rivers, describes himself as an angel investor. \u201cShe has exquisite taste and style, and she has had the best of the best and knows what it is all about,\u201d Mr. Rivers said. \u201cI think she is approaching it very methodically. She has the best people and the best advisers. She is resolute and indefatigable. She moves on and she moves forward.\u201dMs. Kluge is looking for a backer and said she was in talks with a major retailer, which she declined to name. Mr. Moses has been working with different partners to raise capital to acquire companies in technology and media.\u201cJust because you go bankrupt does not mean you lose your brains,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving up is not in our DNA. I look at guys who are 70 years old and asleep in their chair. I could never do that.\u201dAs for Mr. Trump, one of the 70-year-olds who has not fallen asleep, Ms. Kluge said he had always been very cordial. At the moment she is thrilled that he owns the vineyard. \u201cSo I can say the president of the United States owns my vineyard,\u201d she said, with another laugh.And the litigation over the land?\u201cEverybody who knows Donald knows his shenanigans,\u201d Ms. Kluge said. \u201cBut we resolved that, and it was taken care of.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Economic Crisis, Low Birthrates Challenge Southern Europe", "Date": "2017-04-16", "News": "Supported byCouples insisting on only one child. Women tearfully renouncing plans to conceive. And a surge in single-child parents asking him to destroy all of their remaining embryos.Like women in the United States and other mature economies, women across Europe have been having fewer children for decades. But demographers are warning of a new hot spot for childlessness on the Mediterranean rim, where Europe\u2019s economic crisis hit hardest.As couples grapple with a longer-than-expected stretch of low growth, high unemployment, precarious jobs and financial strain, they are increasingly deciding to have just one child \u2014 or none.Birthrates in the region have slid back almost to where they were before the crisis emerged in 2008. Women in Spain had been averaging 1.47 children per household, up from 1.24 in 2000. But those gains have all but evaporated. In Italy, Portugal and Greece, birthrates have reverted to about 1.3.Maria Karaklioumi, 43, a political pollster in Athens, decided to forgo children after concluding she would not be able to offer them the stable future her parents had afforded. Her sister has a child, and Ms. Karaklioumi is painfully aware that her grandmother already had five grandchildren at her age.Although she has a good job and master\u2019s degrees in politics and economics, \u201cthere\u2019s too much insecurity,\u201d Ms. Karaklioumi said.Unemployment among women stands at 27 percent, compared with 20 percent for men.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have this job in two months or a year,\u201d Ms. Karaklioumi added. \u201cIf you don\u2019t see a light at the end of the tunnel, how can you plan for the future?\u201dOver time, he added, \u201cit suggests that the already divergent economic performance between Northern and Southern Europe may become structural rather than cyclical.\u201dThe lower birthrates have been aggravated by fiscal pressures that constrained countries from offering robust family support programs. Whereas France offers a monthly family benefit of 130 euros (about $138) per child after the second child, Greece provides just 40 euros.Greece, as the weakest economic link, does not have the same options.Struggling to manage a recovery after nearly eight years of recession, the government cannot make the fertility drop a top priority. Child tax breaks and subsidies for large families were weakened under Greece\u2019s austerity-linked international financial bailouts. State-financed child care became means-tested and is hard to get for women seeking work. Greece now has the lowest budget in the European Union for family and child benefits.\u201cWe need to allocate more money to create the services needed for families and children,\u201d Mr. Karellas said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to do amid the crisis.\u201dThe impact is evident in communities across the European south, where smaller towns are increasingly hollowed out and schools emptied.In Tempi, a verdant region in central Greece, many primary schools and kindergartens have closed since 2012 as parents had fewer children and young Greeks left the country, said Xanthi Zisaki, a municipal councilor. Kindergarten enrollment has also slumped elsewhere in Greece and around Spain and Italy.While migration from small towns is nothing new, \u201cthe financial crisis is clearly the problem,\u201d Mrs. Zisaki said. \u201cThere are simply fewer children every year.\u201dAs the crisis persisted, Anastasia Economopoulou, 42, pushed back her dream of having several children. She was fearful of losing her job as a saleswoman at a retail branding company after managers said they did not want women who would get pregnant.Eventually, she turned to in vitro fertilization treatments at Dr. Mastrominas\u2019s clinic. But her salary slumped by 30 percent as company sales fell, and her husband\u2019s by more, cutting the number of treatments she can afford.\u201cI asked them not to put in many embryos because we can only manage one,\u201d she said.For a country like Greece, some see the shifting demographic trends as a blessing in disguise.\u201cAs long as Greece has high unemployment, it may be good luck that there\u2019s not a baby boom,\u201d said Byron Kotzamanis, a demography professor at the University of Thessaly.\u201cIf there was,\u201d he added, \u201cwe might have more problems right now.\u201dBut such optimism will not make up for the frightening consequences for countries struggling to replenish people.\u201cIf we don\u2019t fix this, in 20 years we\u2019ll be a country of old people,\u201d said Mr. Karellas, the welfare official. \u201cThe fact is, it\u2019s a disaster.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens, and Rachel Chaundler from Zaragoza, Spain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Tech Investment Flying Under the Radar, Pentagon Warns", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byThere are few restrictions on investing in American start-ups that focus on artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robotics, the report contends, and China has taken advantage. Beijing, the report says, is encouraging its companies to invest for the purpose of pushing the country ahead in its strategic competition with the United States.In some instances, Chinese companies have made under-the-radar investments intended to dodge the oversight of a government agency, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as Cfius.\u201cIf we allow China access to these same technologies concurrently, then not only may we lose our technological superiority, but we may even be facilitating China\u2019s technological superiority,\u201d the report says.The report found that increasingly sophisticated commercial technology had blurred the lines between what was available to military consumers and civilian ones. Often start-ups and leading internet companies like Facebook and Google are working on products as sophisticated as anything the military has at its disposal.\u201cFor example, V.R. for gaming is at a similar level of sophistication as the V.R. used in simulators for our armed forces,\u201d the report said, referring to virtual reality. \u201cFacial recognition and image detection for social networking and online shopping has real application in tracking terrorists or other threats to national security,\u201d the report continued, which added that much of the autonomous vehicle and drone technology of today was developed using grants from the Pentagon.Last summer, the company received a $150 million joint investment from Ford and the Chinese internet giant Baidu. Baidu declined to comment on the investment.A Velodyne spokeswoman said the round represented its first outside investment.\u201cThe company obtained all necessary government clearances relating to the investment as part of the funding process,\u201d the spokeswoman wrote in an email. \u201cNotably, the investments were designed to make advanced LiDAR sensors more accessible to the broader industry, resulting in the development of safer, less expensive autonomous vehicles.\u201dAshton B. Carter, the former secretary of defense, commissioned the report as an urgent review of what senior Pentagon officials have considered China\u2019s alarming penetration of Silicon Valley, particularly in deals that finance nascent technology that has military applications.The report found that American private industry was mostly unaware of Beijing\u2019s efforts \u2014 many of the deals involve relatively small amounts of money \u2014 and that Washington did not have a strong understanding of the scale of the issue.\u201cThe U.S. government does not have a holistic view of how fast this technology transfer is occurring, the level of Chinese investment in U.S. technology, or what technologies we should be protecting,\u201d the report said.Michael A. Brown, the former chief executive of Symantec, led the study, called \u201cHow Chinese Investments in Emerging Technology Enable a Strategic Competitor to Access the Crown Jewels of U.S. Innovation.\u201d The New York Times reviewed a copy of the unclassified report.Mr. Carter declined to comment on the final document issued to cabinet officials last month.The report does not offer examples of American companies that have accepted Chinese investment and then found that their sensitive technologies were transferred to China.But it does take exception to tactics that it says Chinese funds have used to skirt government oversight. For example, it singles out Canyon Bridge, a venture capital firm that it says was formed to buy Lattice Semiconductor, an American microchip company. The firm has Chinese capital and American management expertise. The purpose of creating Canyon Bridge was to obscure the source of capital to \u201cenhance the possibility\u201d that the transaction would be approved by Cfius, the report said.Peter Kuo, a partner at Canyon Bridge, said that the there was never any intention to obscure the source of the fund\u2019s capital, as shown by meetings it had with Cfius before the deal was signed.Chinese investors plowed about $30 billion into early-stage technology through more than 1,000 funding deals between 2010 and 2016. During that time, participation from China rose to about 10 percent of total venture deals, with investment in crucial industries like artificial intelligence, robotics and augmented reality accelerating in 2016, according to the report.Among the investors identified in the report are well-known private firms and funds like Alibaba and Baidu. It also points to government-sponsored investors like Westlake Ventures, a fund in Redwood City, Calif., that is owned by the Hangzhou government, and ZGC Capital, an investor owned by 17 state-owned enterprises with an office in Santa Clara, Calif.The rising trend in venture capital investments has occurred alongside state-directed industrial espionage and online theft, which the American government has been unable to slow, the report says. In the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Silicon Valley field office, only 10 people are dedicated to counterespionage, and F.B.I. officials said in interviews for the report that it \u201chas very limited resources relative to the threat.\u201d\u201cThe scale of the espionage continues to increase,\u201d the authors say. \u201cDespite the rise in convictions, there is no way to know how big this problem really is.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how much money Chinese investors put into American early-stage technology between 2010 and 2016. It was $30 billion, not $620 billion.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tenants Offered Buyouts Are Left in the Lurch", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported by360 ViewThe tale of the lease buyout is almost mythical in New York.It goes something like this: A tenant with the good fortune of a rent-regulated apartment in a hot neighborhood negotiates a six- or even seven-figure payout in exchange for the keys. On the surface, a buyout may look like a sweetheart deal for a tenant. But tenant advocates say the reality is often dark, with landlords preying on vulnerable tenants and bullying people into leaving their homes for paltry sums.Even under the darkest circumstances, though, plenty of landlords still cut the checks. But what happens if they don\u2019t?On Jan. 31 of this year, Machiveni Tigrai moved out of his rent-regulated, $1,720-a-month one-bedroom apartment in the East Village, expecting to receive a $260,000 buyout. He piled his belongings into a U-Haul and handed in the keys. But his landlord did not give him the money. Instead, when he called, he just got voice mail and silence.So Mr. Tigrai, 37, who works in technology, slept in his U-Haul in the middle of winter, afraid to leave his belongings unattended. As the days wore on, he became increasingly anxious. He did not want to sign a lease on a new apartment until he had the check in hand, and he did not want to pay for storage. So he stayed with the truck, some nights sleeping on friends\u2019 couches. \u201cYou\u2019re always kind of anxious with a deal of this magnitude,\u201d he said.As it turned out, Mr. Tigrai had good reason to worry. His landlord, Raphael Toledano, failed to pay 15 tenants their promised buyouts as his fledgling real estate empire, Brookhill Properties, faltered.What followed was a familiar playbook: Coerce tenants to give up their valuable rent-regulated apartments with threats of eviction or offers of cash payouts, or both. Once the tenants leave, renovate the empty spaces and lease them for considerably more money. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a part of the business plan,\u201d Mr. Toledano said in a telephone interview.\u201cHe made it really clear that he was going to make it a miserable place to live,\u201d said Jen Bekman, 47, an entrepreneur who lives in another Toledano-owned building, on East Fifth Street. She also fielded daily calls and texts from the landlord. \u201cSometimes he\u2019d lose his temper. You could just tell that he was kind of volatile.\u201dThe clock was ticking for Mr. Toledano. His deal with Madison Realty Capital gave him a year to clear out apartments, then renovate and rent them.\u201cHe really came in with the idea that he was going to be able to empty out that whole portfolio and people were going to roll over,\u201d Mr. Chester, the housing advocate, said.As time went on, the buyout offers grew. In June 2016, Ms. Bekman, who had lived in her $1,900-a-month one-bedroom apartment for 25 years, signed a deal for $600,000, the largest payout any of the tenants were offered. In all, 140 of the 300 tenants who lived in the 15 buildings signed buyout agreements, totaling $7 million in payouts, Mr. Toledano said.By last spring, Mr. Tigrai, who had lived in his apartment for almost a decade, was worried a window would close. \u201cI felt like this guy is throwing a lot of money around,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the last guy to take the deal.\u201dBut by the time Mr. Tigrai and Ms. Bekman signed agreements to give up their apartments, Mr. Toledano was unable to pay his debts. To shield himself from personal liability, Mr. Toledano had purchased each of his properties using limited liability companies. Last summer, the L.L.C.s that owned the buildings in the Madison Realty portfolio went into default and Madison stopped funding the buyouts.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t able to renovate the properties as quickly as he expected,\u201d said Brian Shatz, a managing principal of Madison Realty. He \u201cwasn\u2019t able to implement the business plan.\u201dIn early February of this year, just days after Mr. Tigrai moved out, Madison Realty filed for foreclosure on the properties. About two weeks later, Mr. Tigrai received an email from Brookhill Properties: The company did not have the money to pay him.On March 6, a judge ordered Mr. Tigrai back into his apartment, restoring his lease until the case is resolved. He came back to an apartment that still had stains on the ceiling from years of water damage. A few days after he moved back in, he discovered large holes that had been cut in the wood floors without warning. The management told him it had needed to access pipes to repair leaks in another apartment, he said.Ms. Bekman, meanwhile, received $50,000 after she signed her buyout. But the next $100,000 installment never arrived, so she stopped packing, and is still living in her apartment. She no longer pays rent, in keeping with the terms of the deal with Mr. Toledano. \u201cI have a free apartment in New York; I\u2019m living in one of these folklore tales,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019m moving in 30 days for more than a year now.\u201dMs. Bekman worries that she might never get the rest of her money, and might lose the apartment, too. \u201cI have nerves of steel,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is scary.\u201dMr. Chester said that Mr. Toledano\u2019s tactics were no different from those of other landlords hoping to make a quick profit. But being able to return to an apartment in light of a failed buyout usually happens only when the tenant has \u201cgood legal representation and good organizing.\u201dEven Madison Realty, which decided to lend a huge sum to a young, inexperienced landlord, does not see Mr. Toledano as an outlier. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to tell you that Raphael Toledano destroyed this portfolio or mismanaged it completely,\u201d Mr. Shatz said, \u201cthere are a lot of other landlords that are at this level that are operating and running buildings exactly like this.\u201dMr. Toledano insisted that he never intended to violate the agreements of tenants. \u201cAre they upset, are they frustrated?\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I can understand. I\u2019m a businessman, I do business deals, very large ones. I feel their pain. I\u2019m sincerely apologetic. It was ultimately a result of something much larger than I was able to handle.\u201dFor the 15 tenants waiting for their buyout payments, the future is uncertain. Mr. Shatz was circumspect, saying, \u201cOur general intention is to honor those obligations.\u201dMr. Toledano, meanwhile, has been selling off other East Village properties and said he was in contract with an investor to buy a $200 million portfolio of properties in the West Village, a neighborhood where he said tenants were less organized.\u201cI kind of want to get out of the East Village walk-up business, to be honest,\u201d he said, without a hint of remorse. \u201cThere is so much scrutiny of the buyouts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Doctor Linked to Senator Menendez\u2019s Corruption Case Is Convicted of Fraud", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byA Florida eye doctor was convicted on Friday of running a vast scheme to defraud Medicare of more than $90 million in a case that could have significant ramifications for Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey.A jury in Palm Beach County, Fla., found Dr. Melgen guilty on all 67 counts of Medicare fraud, and according to prosecutors in the case, he could spend at least 15 years in prison. The conviction and the sentence he now faces could increase pressure on Dr. Melgen to cooperate with the authorities in the case against Mr. Menendez, his co-defendant in their pending trial.After he is sentenced in the Florida case in July, Dr. Melgen, if he should choose to cooperate, could seek to have that sentence reduced. A provision of federal law allows a judge, upon a motion by the government, to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if the defendant is found to have provided \u201csubstantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.\u201dA lawyer for Dr. Melgen in the Florida trial, Kirk Ogrosky, said the doctor views the two cases as completely separate.\u201cIt will have no impact on what will happen in New Jersey,\u201d Mr. Ogrosky said in a phone interview. \u201cHe intends to go to trial in New Jersey in September, and nothing about the Florida case changes that.\u201dA lawyer for Mr. Menendez said that the senator was \u201csaddened for his longtime friend\u201d but that the conviction in Florida would have \u201cno bearing\u201d on the bribery charges against his client.Dr. Melgen gave $700,000 through his company, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants, to the Senate Majority PAC, a so-called super PAC to support Senate Democrats, and instructed that the contributions aid Mr. Menendez\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign.For the help Mr. Menendez received, prosecutors contend, the senator urged the Obama administration to alter the Medicare reimbursement policy in a way that would make millions for Dr. Melgen. In 2012 alone, Dr. Melgen received $21 million in Medicare reimbursements.In addition, prosecutors said, Mr. Menendez tried to push a port security deal that involved Dr. Melgen and worked to obtain United States travel visas for the doctor\u2019s foreign girlfriends.Federal investigators started to look into Dr. Melgen\u2019s billings to Medicare because he was charging a significantly higher rate for a medication to treat macular degeneration than his peers were. The government said he billed for one vial of the medicine for each patient when he had in fact used one vial to treat three or four patients.Mr. Menendez came under federal scrutiny when he sought to help Dr. Melgen in the billing dispute, calling the Medicare director at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2009 and mentioning it at a meeting with the acting administrator in 2012.William K.

{"Headline": "A Toy for Toddlers Doubles as Code Bootcamp", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipIt took a tentative step forward, turned to the left, took another step and then came to rest under a tree \u2014 at least, a drawing of one.Cubetto does not actually walk, but the smiling wooden robot does wheel around under its own power, along a course charted by the human behind the machine.With a $225 price tag, it is an expensive vehicle for play. Although a remote-controlled car may have been simpler, and cheaper, there was a purpose to the exercise: teaching children as young as 3 the basics of computer programming and developing technological and critical thinking skills.It used to be that mass-market toys were the purview of the Mattels and Fisher-Prices of the world. But new financing avenues, like crowdfunding, have made it easier for entrepreneurs to get into the market.Filippo Yacob, the founder of Primo Toys, was hoping to market to toy buyers and retailers when he attended the Toy Industry Association\u2019s New York Toy Fair in February. Mr. Yacob said he was inspired by classic building blocks to have children teach themselves coding fundamentals.\u201cThis block-based programming language looks and feels like a toy but is in fact a procedural programming language,\u201d he said.He officially started his company on Nov. 20, 2013 \u2014 the same day his son was born.\u201cWhen I found out that I was going to be a dad, I started thinking about the things I wanted my son to learn,\u201d he said. One of those things was coding, a skill set that Mr. Yacob says he believes is now as critical as reading or math.\u201cIt is 21st-century literacy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea behind Cubetto was to create a tool that would make that literacy accessible to this age group, 3 to 6.\u201dAccording to Adrienne Appell, the director for strategic communications at the Toy Industry Association, this segment \u2014 which did not even exist 20 years ago \u2014 has rapidly become a major part of the toy market.A Cubetto kit includes the robot, a programming console and instruction tiles. It also comes with a play mat that represents the robot\u2019s world and a book, which together allow players to follow a story line that the robot roams through. Multiple books and play mats are available, but young coders are free to design their own adventure rather than using a set story if they prefer.Since the kits started shipping to consumers in November, reactions have been generally positive.\u201cIt\u2019s a really tangible example of coding, which is sort of an abstract concept,\u201d said Marissa DiBartolo, a senior editor at The Toy Insider. \u201cKids may not even realize that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201dIn Ms. DiBartolo\u2019s view, technology is an important part of the modern world, and finding ways to introduce technological principles at a young age helps children begin to develop necessary skills.\u201cIf you don\u2019t expose them to any type of technology, it\u2019s not very beneficial to them,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything we look at today functions because of code. It\u2019s like learning a new language, and the younger you start learning a new language, the better.\u201dMs. DiBartolo\u2019s publication also endorses other toys that are similar to Cubetto, including one from established brands like Fisher-Price\u2019s Codeapillar and Learning Resources\u2019 Code and Go Robot Mouse. Both Codeapillar and the Code and Go Robot Mouse are electronic. Codeapillar is controlled by stringing together directional pieces that chart a course for the robot to travel. Code and Go is programmed with cards and also comes with obstacles so players can build a course for their robot mouse to navigate.Robot Turtles, from Think Fun, is a traditional board game, but Ms. DiBartolo said it still taught \u201cif/then\u201d \u2014 a fundamental command in coding \u2014 as players use cards to direct pieces across the board toward a prize in the center.STEM toys, and the skills they promote, are also finding a place in the classroom. Mr. Yacob said one of his goals was to see a Cubetto kit in every early-learning environment worldwide.Teachers see the benefits of learning to code beyond just allowing students to create new computer programs.Amy Flannery, the director of curriculum and instruction for the Wilson School District in Reading, Pa., said that coding helped turn children into what she calls \u201cproblem finders,\u201d rather than just problem solvers.\u201cWhat\u2019s important about this for children is the logic. It\u2019s the \u2018learning to build\u2019 mind-set\u201d of finding problems that need to be solved, she said. Thinking this way, Ms. Flannery said, students can figure out and try a path to solve a problem, and if doesn\u2019t work, they will still have learned something they can apply to their next attempt.For example, learning through trial and error makes students better at logical thinking, Ms. Flannery said. \u201cI call it puzzle brain,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re struggling to figure something out but you know you can do it in the end. Anything that gives them that puzzle brain is something that will make them a thinking student, and that\u2019s what I want to come into my school, someone who will try and fail and try again.\u201dMr. Yacob said that Cubetto was in line with those goals. It can also serve as an introduction to other topics through the accompanying storybooks.As with many other inventors, his goal is to have Cubetto join a long line of technologies that contribute to the human experience.\u201cTechnology allows us to do the things that make us human, so cooking, art, architecture, engineering,\u201d Mr. Yacob said. \u201cTechnology allows us to affirm our humanity, and this is why I think it\u2019s so important.\u201dTo subscribe to the weekly Entrepreneurship newsletter, send an email to newsletters@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Couple, Now White House Employees, Can\u2019t Escape Conflict Laws", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The husband-and-wife team of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, now both senior federal government officials, has been alongside President Trump as the White House has hosted dozens of chief executives and a handful of world leaders in recent weeks.It is a rarefied crowd, one that has included the top executives of some of the world\u2019s largest automobile, airline, chemical, pharmaceutical and tech companies. Mr. Kushner will continue to keep such select company now that he has helped create a new office that Mr. Trump is calling the White House Office of American Innovation.Unlike Mr. Trump, who is exempt from conflict of interest laws, both Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump \u2014 who took a formal White House position this past week \u2014 are forbidden under federal criminal and civil law to take any action that might benefit their particular financial holdings.\u201cDonald Trump can evade legal responsibility even if the conflicts of interest remain,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit group. \u201cHis daughter and son-in-law don\u2019t have that escape hatch.\u201dMr. Kushner did resign from more than 200 positions in the partnerships and limited liability companies that make up the family-run multibillion-dollar real estate business. But the financial disclosure report shows that Mr. Kushner will remain a beneficiary of most of those same entities.Jamie Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general at the Justice Department during the Clinton administration and is now advising Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump on government ethics issues, said that the couple could continue to hold on to so many of their assets because most of the value is tied up in buildings.The mystery behind many real estate investments involving foreigners prompted the Treasury Department last year to push for additional disclosures as a way to combat money laundering.While Mr. Kushner may face a potential ethical minefield, the disclosure form makes it difficult to determine exactly where those mines might be situated. The form, which runs 54 pages and lists hundreds of entities, reveals few details about the underlying investments that make up the Kushner empire, such as the addresses of buildings, sources of financing and names of partners.John Pudner, a conservative who has helped elect Tea Party candidates to Congress and now runs a nonprofit group called Take Back Our Republic, said that Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump, if they wanted to serve in the White House, would have been better off if they had taken the difficult step of liquidating their holdings.\u201cA win-win for the president\u2019s family and everyone else is if there were no question anytime a decision is made that it\u2019s being done for the good of the country,\u201d he said.Mr. Kushner, by contrast, continues to hold multimillion-dollar lines of credit from institutions such as Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, while companies he is still a beneficiary of have billions of dollars in additional loans from heavily regulated institutions.Richard W. Painter, who served as a White House ethics lawyer in the Bush administration, said that Mr. Kushner\u2019s financial holdings would complicate any interactions he might have with such banks. \u201cThe one thing Jared really ought to stay completely away from is anything having to do with Dodd-Frank,\u201d Mr. Painter said, referring to the 2010 law that increased capital reserve requirements and instituted many other regulatory changes that affected the nation\u2019s banks.Mr. Kushner, who frequently speaks with world leaders and is tasked with overseeing Middle East peace negotiations, also has an unsecured line of credit worth as much as $5 million from Israel Discount Bank. Kushner Companies has also taken out at least four loans from Bank Hapoalim, Israel\u2019s largest bank, though they are not disclosed in the filing. That firm is the subject of a Justice Department investigation into whether it helped wealthy Americans evade taxes with undeclared accounts.Another potential conflict rests in Ms. Trump\u2019s continued stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, a project that has drawn protests from ethics experts who worry that people representing special interests could stay there or host events there to gain influence with the White House, which is just a few blocks away.Discussions about changes in federal tax law \u2014 a major agenda item for Mr. Trump that could affect issues such as depreciation on Mr. Kushner\u2019s buildings and clothing imported for Ms. Trump\u2019s brand \u2014 could also pose problems, or force them to recuse themselves from participating.\u201cThey are going to have to walk a fine line between matters they are involved with financially and the policies they are helping create and legislation they may be advocating,\u201d said Scott H. Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group.The federal ethics regulations formally prohibit federal employees from being involved in any \u201cparticular matter that will have a direct effect on a financial interest, if there is a close causal link between any decision or action to be taken in the matter and any expected effect of the matter on the financial interest.\u201dThe disclosures by Mr. Kushner and other White House officials released on Friday demonstrate just how complicated it is going to be to police these rules, given the vast and extremely complex financial assets not only within the Trump family but also among dozens of aides they have selected.The National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, as well as the top White House aides Christopher P. Liddell and Reed Cordish, collectively reported assets with a maximum value of more than $1 billion. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, reported assets worth as much as $53.9 million. Even Mr. Bannon\u2019s aide Julia Hahn, who is 25, reported investments worth between $1 million and $2.1 million, according to a tally by The New York Times, while Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, had assets worth between $11 million and $44 million.Some of those financial holdings are already creating questions.Mr. Liddell, an assistant to the president and the director of strategic initiatives, has participated in White House meetings since January that involved several companies in which he continued at least through February to own stock in, including International Paper and General Motors.Mr. Bannon disclosed more than $500,000 in income from entities linked to the hedge fund manager Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah Mercer, major Republican donors who were crucial figures in Mr. Bannon\u2019s appointment as the Trump campaign\u2019s chief executive last year.\u201cThe White House staff\u2019s massive businesses are creating so many possible conflicts of interest it seems almost impossible for them to avoid running into trouble as they mix their former business interests with their new professional duties,\u201d Mr. Bookbinder said.Eric Lipton reported from Washington, and Jesse Drucker from New York.

{"Headline": "Facing Military Pressure, Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Ousts 2 Top Aides", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Under pressure from Pakistan\u2019s military, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ousted two of his top officials on Saturday in a continuing standoff over leaks to the news media of a meeting at which civilian leaders confronted the military over its alleged reluctance to halt Islamist groups in the country.Saturday\u2019s dismissals were the latest chapter in a showdown over a news story published in October that has infuriated the military. In the article, unnamed sources said government officials bluntly confronted the military over its lassitude in going after militants, saying that the country could be ostracized by the international community.\u201cThe statement by the military will certainly intensify the standoff between the civilians and the military,\u201d said Zahid Hussain, a leading political analyst. \u201cWe all know how powerful the military is in the country, but today\u2019s development takes the civil-military conflict even further.\u201dSyed Tariq Fatemi, a special adviser to Mr. Sharif on foreign affairs and one of his top aides, was removed from his post on Saturday, as was Rao Tehseen Ali Khan, a senior official of the Information Ministry.Cyril Almeida, a well-known journalist there, wrote that the civilian leaders had chided the head of the intelligence agency for failing to act against militants in the country.The news story sparked a furor among powerful generals, who, throughout the country\u2019s history, have never been held accountable for their actions. The military called the leak of the meeting a breach of national security and urged strong, punitive action against those responsible for feeding the newspaper.The flare-up is the latest in a long history of Mr. Sharif\u2019s troubles with the military. His last government was toppled in 1999 in a bloodless military coup.The fact that Mr. Ghafoor, the army\u2019s spokesman and a major general by rank, used the word \u201creject\u201d in his Twitter message was widely criticized, especially on social media, as many wondered how a military official, technically a subordinate to a government leader, could so blatantly defy the country\u2019s prime minister.\u201cSuch tweets are poisonous for the country\u2019s democracy,\u201d said Nisar Ali Khan, the country\u2019s interior minister.The military nonetheless stood by its statement. \u201cThe tweet represented the military\u2019s position,\u201d said a senior security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to reporters. Military officials said the government had initially agreed to make public the results of its inquiry and had also agreed to stern action against those responsible for the leak.But the government did not do so on Saturday, nor did it give any specifics on what role of Mr. Fatemi and Mr. Ali Khan might have played in the leaks in the Dawn article. Some have speculated that the investigation into the leaks implicates persons close to Mr. Sharif.The military ruled Pakistan for several decades \u2014 until the 1999 coup \u2014 and continues to assert itself in foreign and defense policy. It has spurned Mr. Sharif\u2019s independent streak as he champions civilian supremacy. The army is also incensed at the prime minister\u2019s policy on India, the country\u2019s archrival. Mr. Sharif has advocated normalizing links and increasing trade with its neighbor.Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, who became the chief of the army in November, is known to want friendlier ties between the military and Pakistan\u2019s government, but officials say that he finds himself pressured by his own institution to take a tougher line against the government.Mr. Sharif has denied any wrongdoing, but faces mounting pressure to resign. He rejected the calls to resign again on Saturday.\u201cOpponents call for resignation over everything,\u201d Mr. Sharif told supporters in a Punjab district. \u201cNawaz Sharif will not resign at anyone\u2019s insistence.\u201dAnalysts say that while the prime minister remains defiant, his hold on power is slipping.\u201cThe prime minister wants to fight it out, but he is in deep waters. He is weakened politically and morally after the court\u2019s verdict,\u201d Mr. Hussain, an analyst said. \u201cIt is a very tricky situation for him now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They are also responsible for compiling a list of suspected perpetrators of war crimes in Syria, which is kept in a sealed envelope in the custody of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al Hussein. Even Mr. Hussein has not seen the list, Mr. Pinheiro said.Ravi Kumar Reddy, the legal adviser for the Syria commission, said the list was updated annually and would remain secret.Mr. Reddy would not disclose how many people were on the list, saying \u201cit would be unwise.\u201d But Mrs. AbuZayd said, \u201cNot as many as you\u2019d like to think.\u201dMr. Pinheiro, Mrs. AbuZayd and some of their aides were in New York last week to meet with the United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and to speak about some of their findings at an informal Security Council session.Mr. Pinheiro and his aides told them that increasing numbers of civilians were now concentrated in northern Syria, where much of the fighting was among militants whose alliances kept shifting.\u201cNew conflicts are emerging in which civilians are caught up between all these actors,\u201d said Anis Anani, the commission\u2019s political adviser. While the Islamic State militants are losing territory in northern Syria, he said, \u201cit\u2019s also giving way to unstable dynamics on the ground.\u201dThe International Criminal Court, which was created for such a purpose, cannot open a case on Syria without a referral from the Security Council, where Russia \u2014 Syria\u2019s ally \u2014 would almost certainly block it.\u201cThe prospect of an I.C.C. referral is zero,\u201d Mr. Pinheiro said.But Mr. Reddy said the commission had supplied some information to judicial authorities in approximately 10 countries where legal cases related to the Syrian war were underway.He declined to identify the countries or any of the cases.Mr. Pinheiro said that when he agreed to lead the effort in 2011, he believed it would last a year.The commission is already the longest-serving inquiry at the United Nations.\u201cThe war is not winding down,\u201d he said.An article on April 25 about a United Nations commission investigating possible war crimes in Syria misstated the number of witnesses and victims it has interviewed.

The new law appears to require that the university open an American campus, which it says would be financially prohibitive. (After European and American diplomats condemned the measure, the Orban government said it was open to talks with the university about ways to resolve the legal impasse.)Students said they were attracted by Central European University precisely because they wanted an American-style education, with small classes, discussions based on reading, proximity to professors and fewer large lectures. Some 370 academics from around the world teach about 1,400 students here, many of them from Central Europe. Master\u2019s and doctoral degrees are offered in the social sciences, the humanities, law, management and public policy.Some of the areas of study seem to reflect liberal values. Marianna Szczygielska, 31, is a Polish doctoral candidate in gender studies \u2014 a field of inquiry that has drawn scorn from government-friendly news outlets. \u201cIt\u2019s a very easy target when you dismiss a branch of knowledge just because you don\u2019t agree with it and you label it as an ideology,\u201d she said.Central European University\u2019s defenders acknowledge that the campus can appear at times to be an oasis \u2014 or even a \u201cbubble\u201d \u2014 of English and privilege. The university has an endowment of over 500 million euros (over $540 million), in a country where incomes are well below the European Union average.\u201cWhat bugs me the most is that I should be working on my thesis right now, not sitting here talking to you,\u201d Ms. Medzibrodszky said at a cafe near campus.An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Marianna Szczygielska, a Polish doctoral candidate in gender studies.

Raising the standard deduction is smart and would simplify everything, reducing cheating and the need for record-keeping because millions of filers would no longer itemize deductions.So, sure, let\u2019s lower the official corporate tax rate while reducing loopholes, but don\u2019t pretend this will create a ton of new jobs.Where the tax plan would have a big impact is in empowering some very wealthy people, because of another bit of chicanery in the proposal: Trump apparently would allow some business owners to dodge personal income tax by paying at the much lower corporate rate. In other words, tycoons would try to structure their incomes to pay not at a 39.6 percent top personal rate but at a 15 percent corporate rate.This isn\u2019t tax policy; it\u2019s a heist.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Trump\u2019s tax \u201cplan\u201d would be paid for partly \u201cwith growth\u201d \u2014 which means that he has no idea how to pay for it. The Tax Policy Center examined Trump\u2019s campaign tax plan and found it would cause the federal debt to rise by at least $7 trillion in the first decade, and more than $20 trillion by 2036 \u2014 slowing growth, not raising it. To put the latter number in perspective, that\u2019s additional borrowing of about $160,000 per American household.Effectively, we\u2019d borrow from China or other countries to finance huge tax breaks for Trump and his minions. And this is populism?Advertisement"}

You may want to invite lots of guests from the Northeast or the Midwest to the reception.Guests from the Northeast are also more than twice as likely to spend more generously on a wedding gift for a member of their family or a good friend, the survey found. Just under a third of Northeasterners said their typical gift was at least $200 in value, compared with just 13 percent of respondents from the rest of the country.Similarly, almost half of the respondents in the Northeast said they spent at least $100 on wedding gifts for co-workers, acquaintances and not-so-close relatives. Just a fourth of the rest of the country said they gave at least that amount.Gift preferences varied by age. Nearly half of older Americans, and about a third of baby boomers, preferred to give cash or a check. Younger wedding guests \u2014 millennials, who are now in their 20s to mid-30s, and GenXers, ranging from the late 30s to early 50s \u2014 were more likely to give a gift from the registry.\u201cA lot of them feel almost crippled by the amount of weddings they are invited to,\u201d but nevertheless find it hard to say no, she said. Ms. Berger said she had heard about a young woman who attended five weddings over eight weekends, and another who lamented that she had used all her vacation time attending weddings.Twenty-one percent of the people surveyed for the Bankrate study said they had declined a wedding invitation because they felt they couldn\u2019t afford to go. Women (27 percent) were more likely than men (16 percent) to decline because of cost.For the survey, Princeton Survey Research Associates International interviewed 1,000 adults by phone in early April. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points.Here are some questions and answers about wedding costs:How can I manage the cost of attending a wedding?Travel for weddings, particularly destination weddings in exotic locales, is a big part of the cost. Since invitations \u2014 or at least \u201csave the date\u201d notices \u2014 typically go out well in advance, try to nail down flights early to take advantage of lower fares. Ms. Berger suggests using apps like Hopper to target the best time to buy your airline ticket. Then, try to trim your discretionary spending a bit at a time, to build up a fund for the wedding.Kristen Maxwell Cooper, executive editor of The Knot, a wedding planning website, suggests teaming up with other guests to economize: Look for an Airbnb rental to share, and consider giving a group gift. Pooling funds with others can help you stick to a budget, while enabling you to buy a pricier item from the couple\u2019s registry.How can the couple keep their wedding costs down?To rein in costs, consider holding your wedding on a Friday or Sunday night, when venues typically rent for less, Ms. Maxwell Cooper said. Or have a Saturday morning ceremony followed by a midday brunch: Venues are often open to doing so, she said, because they can still book a separate event in the evening.Can I rent a wedding dress to save money?Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can the Kremlin Influence the French Election?", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPARIS \u2014 Never, it is being said, has a presidential election in France seemed so uncertain. And never has there been so much concern about possible attempts by the Russian leadership to shape \u2014 perhaps even interfere with \u2014 the outcome.Last month, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France denounced the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to \u201cinfluence public opinion\u201d through \u201cideological operations\u201d and its \u201cstrategy of influence, of networks\u201d in France. His comments followed another accusation, by Richard Ferrand, the national secretary of the En Marche! (Onward!) movement, who claimed that the Kremlin was responsible for a series of cyberattacks against the party\u2019s website and that it was seeking to undermine Emmanuel Macron, En Marche!\u2019s presidential candidate, for being, among other things, too pro-European Union. The Kremlin has denied this.The French government is worried that hackings or cyberattacks may occur during the upcoming elections \u2014 for president, in April and May, and for the national legislature, in June. Partly as a result, French nationals living abroad will not be allowed to vote electronically in the legislative election. (The option is never available for presidential elections.)Computer breaches, propaganda, disinformation \u2014 even campaign financing \u2014 there are indeed many reasons to worry. And all the more so because the Kremlin\u2019s sapping offensive in France is a vast and long-running project.L\u2019Institut de la d\u00e9mocratie et de la coop\u00e9ration (the Institute of Democracy and Cooperation) was set up in Paris in 2008. Its stated purpose is to create \u201ca bridge of solid friendship between two great European nations, France and Russia.\u201d Yet in numerous interviews its director, Natalia Narochnitskaya, has put forward very hostile views. The West wants to subjugate Russia, impose its rules on it, even \u201cdismember\u201d it, she has said, and to these ends it makes opportunistic use of human rights issues. For Ms. Narochnitskaya, Russia offers \u201can alternative to the West.\u201dThe Kremlin\u2019s third main proxy organization in France is the much less formal Forum des compatriotes (the Compatriots\u2019 Forum). It first convened in 2011 and brings together Russian-speaking \u00e9migr\u00e9s and descendants of \u00e9migr\u00e9s in meetings held at the Russian embassy in Paris. This forum, and others like it in other countries, are at the heart of Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201cRussian World\u201d initiative: an effort to mobilize the Russian diaspora for various linguistic, cultural or economic projects but also to build support for the Kremlin on such geopolitical questions as the war between Russia and Ukraine.The leaders of these three organizations appear regularly in French news outlets and various media, in French and other languages, that the Kremlin has created and is wholly funding. The two most important of these, both active on social-media networks, are Sputnik and RT (Russia Today), which is to begin broadcasting in French this year.Sputnik and RT have published numerous articles about, say, the problems ostensibly caused by immigrants, thereby reinforcing the fear and the backlash triggered by recent terrorist attacks. They do not hesitate to distort facts and even invent some. That technique, which used to be taught in some journalism schools in the former Soviet Union, seeks to create an emotional shock and suppress all capacity for analysis. By suggesting that facts don\u2019t matter, it also fuels conspiracy theories.When it comes to the presidential election, Sputnik and RT attack Mr. Macron while supporting the candidacies of Marine Le Pen, of the far right, and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, of an increasingly hardening mainstream right. It was on Sputnik News (in English) that Nicolas Dhuicq \u2014 a member of the Dialogue franco-russe\u2019s bureau and a representative from Mr. Fillon\u2019s party, Les R\u00e9publicains, in the French National Assembly \u2014 recently accused Mr. Macron of being \u201can agent of the big American banking system\u201d and receiving the support of \u201ca very wealthy gay lobby.\u201dBacking from Russia can also be more concrete, particularly financial. So far only one such case is known in France, but it may not be unique. In 2014 Ms. Le Pen, the leader of the Front National party, received a loan of 9 million euros from the First Czech Russian Bank. (The bank, now in bankruptcy, counted Vyacheslav Babusenko, a former senior official in the K.G.B., among its principal directors.) A Cypriot company gave 2 million euros to Cotelec, the micro-party of Jean-Marie Le Pen, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father and the Front National\u2019s former leader. The company appears to belong to a Russian national who owes his career to connections with the secret service, according to the Russian edition of Forbes magazine.Were those transactions loans, or were they quid pro quos? The Front National has actively supported the Kremlin lately and stated that it is \u201copposed to sanctions against Russia.\u201d Mr. Putin welcomed Ms. Le Pen to Moscow recently, saying he was \u201cvery happy\u201d to see her. She has called him \u201ca man committed to values,\u201d in particular \u201cthe Christian heritage of European civilization.\u201dFrench people, for their part, seem to be skeptical. In a 2015 poll (the most current on this issue), 85 percent of respondents did not trust Mr. Putin or his judgment in foreign policy. Between 2003 and 2015, respondents\u2019 level of trust in him plummeted from 48 percent to 15 percent.Its goal is to build the \u201cpost-West world order\u201d that Sergey Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, called for in a speech he gave in Munich in February. And anyone who is aware of Russia\u2019s internal situation \u2014 generalized corruption, a nonperforming economy, widespread poverty, the obvious deterioration of political and civil liberties \u2014 cannot but tremble at the prospect that Mr. Putin may have any influence on the presidential election in France.C\u00e9cile Vaissi\u00e9 is a professor of Russian studies at Rennes II University and the author of \u201cLes R\u00e9seaux du Kremlin en France.\u201d This essay was translated by John Cullen from the French.Advertisement"}

It involves an American Army base, the late-night pilfering of film canisters, a screening that left Mike Nichols in tears and a fatal review. The long final act ends in redemption at the hands of Martin Scorsese (among others) and includes the film\u2019s long-delayed television premiere, on HBO2 on Monday, April 24.This is the story according to the 89-year-old Mr. Ophuls, anyway, and he tells it \u2014 by phone recently from his home in Southern France \u2014 very convincingly, with frequent bouts of wheezing laughter.The need to put groceries on the table eventually resulted in \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity,\u201d the hugely influential 1971 film about collaboration in Vichy France. A few years later Mr. Ophuls learned that 50 hours of raw footage of the Nuremberg trials, shot by the United States Army Signal Corps, were stored at a Maryland base. He gained access and started viewing the reels, which had to be hand-rolled. Every so often he broke the film, irritating his Army minders.Not all of the producers, a mix of British and German backers, were happy with the results. There were complaints about the film\u2019s length and some brief nudity, Mr. Ophuls said, and requests that more focus be put on Russian actions during World War II and American actions in Vietnam. With the editing nearly complete, an acrimonious meeting at the Ritz bar in London resulted \u2014 depending on whose account you believe \u2014 in Mr. Ophuls either being fired (his version) or walking away.Barred from his own project, he retreated to Princeton. But then the plot turned. Two women who had worked on the film with him hid in the restroom of the London editing suite and sneaked away with a black-and-white work print of his original edit.With endorsements like that, and the financial backing of Paramount, Mr. Fish was able to negotiate Mr. Ophuls\u2019s return and to see that the film was completed the way its director wished. \u201cAn injury had been done to something of great cultural and historical significance,\u201d Mr. Fish said in a recent interview. But it had been healed.\u201cWho else could get the people to see a five-hour documentary?\u201d Mr. Ophuls said. \u201cIt folded after six or seven weeks and hasn\u2019t been heard since.\u201dMr. Fish, as a producer, saw things differently \u2014 he said that for a film of its type, in the days before specialty distributors had taken off, the commercial release was successful, and he discounted the influence of Kael\u2019s review. But he agreed that \u201cThe Memory of Justice\u201d faded out of sight after 1976. \u201cIt just was too difficult to keep in play,\u201d he said.\u201cTragically enough, both of the epic 20th-century subjects tackled definitively by Ophuls, Vichy and Nuremberg, remain as pertinent, if not more pertinent, than ever,\u201d said Mr. Rich, a former New York Times columnist who is now a creative consultant at HBO. \u201cThe restoration could not be more aptly timed, and I imagine it will come as a revelation to viewers not yet born during its first meager release.\u201dIf enough people see \u201cThe Memory of Justice\u201d this time, it might mean that Mr. Ophuls will no longer be known in America largely through Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d in which Alvy and Annie stand in line to see \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity.\u201d But if not, Mr. Ophuls won\u2019t be too concerned.\u201cOh, I love it,\u201d he said of his indirect contribution to \u201cAnnie Hall.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s terrifically funny. I know it more or less by heart.\u201d And then he recited several lines of dialogue involving \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity,\u201d correct down to the reference to a Bloomingdale\u2019s charge card.\u201cI got a letter from Woody Allen thanking me and saying that he would treat the film with great respect etc. etc., which I really didn\u2019t ask for,\u201d Mr. Ophuls recalled. \u201cWho cares if the film is treated with respect?

{"Headline": "Bull Markets Don\u2019t Mean Extra Jobs for Wall Street", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byBull markets aren\u2019t what they used to be, at least when it comes to New York\u2019s economy.Although the stock market is surging and profits on Wall Street last year hit their highest level since 2012, the good times are not translating into jobs the way they did a decade ago, before the financial crisis and the Great Recession hit.Employment in the securities industry in New York City has risen for three straight years. But, at 177,000, there are still 10,000 fewer jobs in the sector than in 2008. And even if the stock market keeps rising and shares of behemoths like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continue to hit postcrisis highs, don\u2019t expect a surge in hiring on the Street.\u201cThe securities industry is still a pretty important source of very highly paid, very highly skilled jobs, but it\u2019s not really contributing to growth in the number of jobs,\u201d said William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.To be sure, financial services and banking remain a key part of the overall economy in the tristate area. The financial services and securities industry is the largest private-sector contributor to tax revenue in New York State.What economists call the \u2018\u2018multiplier effect\u2019\u2019 is especially high for finance jobs, since annual bonuses for bankers end up in the pockets of people like contractors, gardeners, jewelers, car dealers and real estate brokers.What is more, Wall Street remains crucial for the region\u2019s tax base, especially for New York State. The securities industry accounted for 18.5 percent of Albany\u2019s tax revenues last year, and about 7 percent of the city\u2019s tax haul.But as is the case for the rest of the country, the financial sector is no longer quite as dominant as it once was in New York, Mr. Dudley said. Finance has not gotten smaller; instead other sectors, like technology, have grown much faster since the financial crisis.Mr. Dudley added that \u201cNew York\u2019s economy has become more diversified,\u201d citing strong growth in the technology, hospitality and tourism sectors. He said that with roughly 150,000 workers, the tech sector in New York City is quickly catching up with total employment in the securities industry.\u201cNew York is no longer a one-horse town when it comes to what drives the economy,\u201d said Chris Jones, senior vice president at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit research group that focuses on the tristate area. \u201cTourism and technology have generated more jobs in the last decade and helped to diversify the economy.\u201dAnd while bonuses on Wall Street still dwarf those in other industries, annual payouts are also well below what they were before 2008, when Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns still existed.The average bonus for the securities industry in New York City last year stood at $138,210, compared with a high of $191,360 in 2006, according to New York State\u2019s comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli.The sector\u2019s healthy profits ($17.3 billion in 2016) come at a price. \u201cPart of how they\u2019ve kept profits up is that they\u2019ve kept head count down,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said.In fact, the securities industry accounted for just 6 percent of newly created high-paying jobs from 2010 to 2015, compared with 25 percent in the 1990s and 2000s. \u201cWall Street is still an important contributor to the economy, but I wouldn\u2019t expect a lot of growth in employment,\u201d Mr. Dudley said.Very low interest rates for years have also taken a toll, reducing profit margins at big banks, and forcing them to trim head counts and become more efficient.Some jobs also disappeared because the go-go days of huge leverage and light regulation are over, thanks to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms. With higher capital requirements, riskier activities have been pruned back.Even if some of that regulation is reversed, as President Trump has promised, memories of 2008 are likely to curb a return to the days of big bets and crowded trading desks.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of pressure on trading jobs,\u201d said Laila Worrell, a partner at The Boston Consulting Group. \u201cSince 2009, the regulatory climate hasn\u2019t been superconducive for trading volume growth at big financial institutions.\u201dTrading by humans negotiating over the telephone has been replaced by trading via computers transacting in milliseconds.And for jobs that can\u2019t be done by machines, greener and cheaper pastures beckon. While New York State recorded a 5 percent rise in securities industry jobs from 2010 to 2015, employment in the sector increased by 50 percent in Pennsylvania and 33 percent in Texas over the same period.On the other hand, New York could stand to benefit if financial firms exit London in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote last summer to exit the European Union, the so-called Brexit.New York and London have been rivals in the financial world for decades, with London\u2019s location and especially its time zone an advantage for traders dealing with Europe and Asia. Hedge funds expanded in the British capital, too, and some American policy makers feared London might overtake Wall Street.Experts cite locales like Paris, Luxembourg and Frankfurt as alternatives to London, but Mr. Dudley said, \u201cNew York is a potential place where people could ultimately move jobs, and the city could absorb them relatively easily.\u201dThere are also a few niches in New York where head count is growing rapidly, like financial technology, with new hires creating software and applications for banks and brokerages, and designing trading strategies using algorithms and artificial intelligence.\u201cNew York has become the world\u2019s leading center for financial tech innovation,\u201d Ms. Worrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s surpassed Silicon Valley because the financial institutions these companies serve are in New York. Proximity is very important.\u201dWhile the packed trading desks portrayed in 1980s classics like Oliver Stone\u2019s movie \u201cWall Street\u201d or the book \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d by author Michael Lewis may be a thing of the past, not everyone misses that world.Indeed, Mr. Dudley, an economist who joined Goldman Sachs in 1986 and spent more than two decades at the firm, said Wall Street\u2019s flatter trajectory is fine with him.\u201cThe financial services industry is in a pretty good place right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite rock \u2019n\u2019 roll like we had in 2005 and 2006, but I don\u2019t think we want to go back to that period. I would take a more boring financial industry if it helped create a more stable U.S. economy.\u201dMr. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, acknowledged that nearly a decade after the financial crisis, Wall Street remains unpopular in some quarters.

His centrist People\u2019s Party held only 40 seats in the 300-member Parliament. He was barely polling at 10 percent in surveys.The election could not be taking place at a more fraught moment. The victor will be replacing an impeached president and entering office at a time when tensions between the Koreas are as high as they have been in a long time.The outcome is likely to have far-reaching implications for international efforts to deal with North Korea, analysts say.President Trump has been pressing China to exert its influence on the North to forestall more nuclear tests and missile launches. He has threatened to act unilaterally if the Chinese do not prevail. The North, in turn, threatened on Friday to attack American military bases in South Korea as well as the Blue House, where South Korea\u2019s president resides.The Chinese leadership has been calling on both the North and the United States to exercise restraint.Mr. Ahn, a boyish former medical doctor and relative neophyte in politics, calls himself a champion of \u201cnew politics\u201d who would heal a country disillusioned with what he describes as a corrupt and out-of-touch elite.Polling experts say that Mr. Ahn owed his recent popularity to people who shunned conservative candidates after Ms. Park\u2019s corruption scandal but did not trust Mr. Moon either, especially in dealing with North Korea\u2019s advancing military abilities.Mr. Ahn has wooed those people by attacking Ms. Park\u2019s government while promising to honor its decision to allow the United States to deploy an advanced missile defense system in the country against the North, a decision that has infuriated China.\u201cWe should never recognize North Korea as a nuclear power,\u201d Mr. Ahn said recently, emphasizing that he would prioritize national security if elected. \u201cIf the North is about to launch a nuclear attack, we should first strike the source of attack.\u201dWith the two main conservative candidates polling in the single digits, people who would normally vote conservative have been seeking alternatives.Then, they rallied behind Ahn Hee-jung, a left-centrist provincial governor. But Mr. Ahn was eliminated this month when he lost the Democratic Party primary to Mr. Moon.Ahn Cheol-soo\u2019s support has since skyrocketed.\u201cFor many centrist and conservative voters, there is no one else to turn to except Ahn Cheol-soo,\u201d said Kim Jiyoon, a polling expert at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. \u201cWhether he can win the election will depend largely on how many of the anti-Moon voters he can persuade to come out and vote for him.\u201dMr. Moon and Mr. Ahn share remarkably similar views on many issues.And they both emphasize the importance of the alliance with the United States. But they argue that sanctions and pressure alone have failed to stop North Korea\u2019s weapons program and that it is time to try dialogue. During a televised debate on Thursday, both opposed action by the United States that might prompt war on the peninsula, like a pre-emptive military strike against the North.The candidates even grew up in the same town: Busan, a port city in the southeast.But they have vastly different backgrounds and public images. Mr. Ahn is a paragon of elite success. A son of a medical doctor, Mr. Ahn quit practicing medicine in 1995 and built a fortune developing the country\u2019s most successful antivirus software. He later became a graduate school dean at Seoul National University, his alma mater.During the debate, he said he would use his school connections and business background to build a rapport with Mr. Trump. Both Mr. Ahn and Mr. Trump attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\u201cLike Spider-Man, once you have the power, even if you don\u2019t like it, you have to accept the responsibility that comes with it and act accordingly,\u201d Mr. Ahn, a science fiction fan, once said in a magazine interview.The policy brought an unprecedented d\u00e9tente on the divided peninsula. But conservatives argue that it helped finance the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program. They also view Mr. Moon as a replica of Mr. Roh, who once said he would never \u201ckowtow to the Americans.\u201dIn a book published in January, Mr. Moon said South Korea should learn to \u201csay no to the Americans.\u201d\u201cGiven the tough-sounding foreign policy team of the Trump administration, some South Koreans fear that friction with Washington would be more likely under Moon than under Ahn,\u201d said Ko Sung-kook, a political commentator.But Mr. Ahn later changed his stance, saying that it was \u201cirresponsible\u201d for a future president to reverse a deal struck between the two governments. That shift helped him attract conservative voters, analysts said.Because of his business background, Mr. Ahn comes across as more palatable for conservative voters than Mr. Moon, said Bae Jong-chan, research director at Research and Research, an opinion survey company.But many consider Mr. Ahn a na\u00efve populist. He also faces doubts about whether his small opposition party can push policies through a contentious Parliament, Mr. Bae said.\u201cWhat can you do with only 40 parliamentary seats?\u201d Mr. Moon recently said of Mr. Ahn.With Mr. Ahn catching up fast, Mr. Moon has redoubled his efforts to bolster his national security credentials. He said that if the North conducted another nuclear test, dialogue with North Korea would be difficult and the Thaad deployment \u201cinevitable.\u201d\u201cI will create a government most feared by North Korea, most trusted by the United States and most reliable for China,\u201d Mr. Moon said in a nationally televised campaign speech on Thursday.\u201cIf you can\u2019t change yourself, how can you change the nation?\u201d he told the daily JoongAng Ilbo this week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Books Offer Unconventional and Divergent Approaches to Investing", "Date": "2017-04-15", "News": "Supported byOff the ShelfRic Edelman disappoints in his new investing book, left. Gary Smith offers financial formulas to help identify value stocks in his new book, \u201cMoney Machine.\u201dWith the stock market up substantially since the first of the year, and technological innovations continuing to roil the corporate landscape, how should you invest right now?Two new books offer very different answers, with each taking an unconventional approach.In the far better one, \u201cMoney Machine: The Surprisingly Simple Power of Value Investing\u201d (Amacom, $27.95), Gary Smith, a Pomona College economics professor, says you should concentrate on value stocks. In contrast, in \u201cThe Truth About Your Future: The Money Guide You Need Now, Later and Much Later\u201d (Simon & Schuster $26), Ric Edelman says you need to figure out how to capitalize on trends disrupting how business is typically done.Let\u2019s begin with Mr. Smith, who does an excellent job explaining his position.\u201cInstead of trying to predict short-term zigs and zags in stock prices, value investors evaluate individual stocks and the market as a whole by looking for good companies that have low stock prices relative to their dividends, earnings and assets,\u201d he writes.Mr. Smith uses an analogy to make his case.\u201cThink of a stock as a machine that generates cash every few months \u2014 cash that happens to be called dividends,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe key question is how much you would pay to own that machine in order to get the cash. This is the stock\u2019s intrinsic value. Value investors buy a stock because it is an inexpensive money machine, generating bountiful cash it is hoped over many years.\u201dThroughout the book, Mr. Smith provides financial formulas to help you identify value stocks, and his writing is clear and often clever. For example:The book, however, does have its flaws \u2014 one major, a couple minor.The big one first: It is perfectly defensible to pick one approach to investing \u2014 such as loading up on value stocks, companies with solid revenues, earnings and dividends that are trading at a relatively low price \u2014 over all others. As Mr. Smith points out a number of times, Warren E. Buffett is a value investor. And this reviewer understands that Mr. Buffett has done quite well.But financial mavens like Mr. Buffett, the maestro of Berkshire Hathaway, are rare, and as Mr. Smith himself points out, \u201cvery few investors think they are below average, even though half are.\u201d Most of us would be better off with a widely diversified portfolio, something Mr. Smith barely acknowledges.As for the minor nits, Mr. Smith tends to digress, mentioning academic papers he wrote that are at best tangential to the concept of value investing. For example, he says that stocks with ingenious ticker symbols, such as MOO for VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF, tend to outperform the market. That is a fun fact \u2014 especially for us financial nerds \u2014 but I am not sure what it has to do with the matter at hand, and I would not recommend an investment based solely on a cute name.Similarly, while it is possible that a home could be viewed as a value investment, as he explains, I am not sure the discussion was worth 20 pages of a 300-page book.These are small quibbles. For the most part, he states his case well.\u201cThe value-investing philosophy is simple,\u201d he writes. \u201cLook for great companies whose stocks are inexpensive relative to their dividends and earnings.\u201dThat clarity and brevity are lacking in Mr. Edelman\u2019s book. He is a financial planner, but readers expecting detailed investment advice will be disappointed.For example, after writing that it is vital to diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, cash and perhaps other investments such as real estate, how does Mr. Edelman respond to his rhetorical question \u201chow much of your portfolio should be placed into each\u201d of those assets?Like this: \u201cThe answer is \u2026 it depends. I wish I could provide you a more specific answer right now, but this is just a book on personal finance \u2014 it\u2019s not a private, in-depth meeting with a financial planning professional.\u201dHe doesn\u2019t even offer general guidelines. He just moves on.This is already my pick for the most frustrating personal finance book of 2017. And one of the reasons I am so annoyed is that the premise was so promising.\u201cFinancial planning is all about anticipating and preparing for the future,\u201d Mr. Edelman writes. \u201cSo to understand what your future will be like, you need to understand why it\u2019s going to be so radically different from what you have been assuming.\u201dHe then devotes about two-thirds of his more than 300 pages to underscoring things we know but can easily forget: Medical advances could make us live longer, ever-evolving technology will provide more engaging entertainment options, and rapidly evolving workplaces will require continuous education, perhaps extensive enough for us to have to leave the workplace for a while to concentrate on learning new things.So far, so good. But what do these changes mean for the way we invest? Well, when it comes to leisure and learning, for example, Mr. Edelman\u2019s advice is just this: \u201cExpect to spend lots of money on travel and recreation \u2014 and this will need to be factored into your financial plan.\u201d How? There are no details.About as specific as he gets is to say: \u201cInvest in a globally diversified portfolio. Maintain that portfolio for a very long time. Strategically rebalance the portfolio as needed,\u201d and \u201cinclude companies that are using or developing exponential technologies.\u201dThe \u201cwhat\u201d to invest in, how much of your portfolio it should represent, and what\u2019s \u201ca very long time\u201d are left to you. That isn\u2019t much help when you are trying to determine how to invest today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Raises Millions for 2020 Re-election Bid", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump is raising money toward a bid for a second term earlier than any incumbent president in recent history, pulling in tens of millions of dollars in the months after his election and through his inauguration.Reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday showed that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign brought in $7.1 million during the first three months of 2017, on top of over $23 million raised with the Republican Party. By contrast, President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee brought in a total of about $15 million during the first three months of his first term in 2009.A vast majority of Mr. Trump\u2019s donors gave small amounts, and relatively little came in large checks from wealthy Republican benefactors. That suggests that Mr. Trump is relying heavily on the grass-roots donors who provided much of the cash \u2014 aside from his own fortune \u2014 he used for his campaign.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign committee spent $6.3 million from January through March, including $1.2 million on merchandise and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, sales of which helped his fund-raising.As it did during the presidential race, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign also spent significantly on Trump properties. Trump Tower in Manhattan, where the campaign is based, collected $300,000 in rent. At least another $25,000 went to other properties, including Mr. Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas and a golf course he owns in Florida. Such transactions are legal, and required to ensure he pays fair market rate for campaign costs.The campaign disbursed tens of thousands of dollars to a firm owned by Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. The bill was for \u201cadministrative assistant/secretarial\u201d services.Meredith McGehee, the policy chief at the government reform policy group Issue One, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s early fund-raising showed there were few downsides to seeking donations so early in his presidency. Mr. Trump lacks the campaign infrastructure of past presidents and needs to build a foundation of support ahead of an expected fund-raising push by Democrats, she said.\u201cThey know the Democrats are already raising a lot of money by people who may not have liked Hillary or were not engaged, but have become engaged because of their reaction to the president,\u201d Ms. McGehee said.Mr. Trump filed for the 2020 race the day of his inauguration. Filing quickly allowed him to continue to raise money and tap the small donors whose enthusiasm was critical to his campaign, with a heavy dose of email blasts and requests for help against the proverbial Washington establishment.The Trump campaign has been hawking the hats and other collectibles to members of its email list, at campaign events and at Trump Tower, where the iconic red version of his hat was sold out on Friday.\u201cIt\u2019s the same story of a president who has chosen not to disentangle himself from his business interests,\u201d Ms. McGehee said.Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Kushners\u2019 Flagship Building, Mounting Debt and a Foundered Deal", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byThe Fifth Avenue skyscraper was supposed to be the Kushner Companies\u2019 flagship in the heart of Manhattan \u2014 a record-setting $1.8 billion souvenir proclaiming that the New Jersey developers Charles Kushner and his son Jared were playing in the big leagues.The official announcement said the company remained \u201cin active, advanced negotiations\u201d with a number of investors, whom it declined to name.There is no question that the Kushner Companies \u2014 Jared has moved to Washington to serve as an adviser to his father-in-law, President Trump \u2014 needs to reach a deal soon, either to bring in a fresh infusion of cash or a well-heeled partner willing to foot the bill, if it wants to hold on to the building. Whomever it brings on as an investor would also have to buy out Vornado Realty Trust, the family\u2019s partner in the tower.More than a quarter of the office space in the building sits vacant. According to an analysis by Trepp L.L.C., a data and analytics firm that tracks bank lending, 666 Fifth Avenue has not generated enough money to pay its debts for several years, forcing the owners to cover the shortfall \u2014 at least $10 million in 2015. And that gap is growing. The interest-only $1.2 billion mortgage comes due in less than two years.\u201cThis building has had financial issues for years now,\u201d said Joe McBride, a senior associate at Trepp. \u201cHow much longer can they sustain it? Occupancy is at 70 percent, more leases are expiring, and they\u2019re going into their own pocket to pay the debt.\u201dThe speculation surrounding the deal became a distraction that led both companies to abandon the negotiations, according to a spokesman for Kushner Companies.But the spokesman, James Yolles, said Charles Kushner remained optimistic that he would secure fresh investors who would not only pay off the existing debt on the building but also finance the demolition of the current structure and the construction of a 1,400-foot tower designed by Zaha Hadid. Jared Kushner sold his stake in the building to a family trust in January when he moved to Washington.\u201cWe are well on our way to lining up the $2.5 billion in equity needed to get this deal done,\u201d Mr. Yolles said, \u201cand we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll get there.\u201dThe Kushner Companies bought the building in January 2007, closing the deal on Jared Kushner\u2019s birthday and paying the highest price ever for a New York office building. \u201cThis is a great acquisition for our company,\u201d Jared Kushner said at the time.According to the Kushners, they put $500 million into the purchase. They then took out a mortgage and hundreds of millions in additional loans to cover the purchase price and ancillary costs.The building represented a new beginning for a New Jersey real estate family that had specialized in suburban garden apartments. The Kushner Companies moved its headquarters to the 15th floor on Fifth Avenue, from Florham Park, N.J.While the total paid for the building was not that much higher than the previous record \u2014 $1.72 billion for the MetLife Building \u2014 the price for MetLife worked out to about $600 a square foot, while the Kushners paid $1,200 a square foot for 666 Fifth Avenue.Even at the time, income from the building, which was almost completely rented, covered only about two-thirds of the annual debt payments, according to records.Then, as the 2008 financial crisis set in, rents, instead of going up, went down. To pay off some of their debt, the Kushners began selling parts of the building, including its most valuable asset, the retail space on Fifth Avenue, to the Carlyle Group and Crown Acquisitions for $525 million, a remarkable price. The proceeds were used to pay off secondary loans on the building, not the main mortgage.But the bleeding continued. Two years later, with the tower\u2019s reserve funds nearly exhausted and the owner losing as much as $30 million, the mortgage holder appointed a \u201cspecial servicer\u201d to oversee 666 Fifth Avenue. Such a company manages a property loan when the borrower is in danger of falling into default.The Kushner Companies renegotiated the terms of the loan in 2011.At the same time, Vornado, a publicly traded real estate company and one of the city\u2019s largest landlords, bought 49.5 percent of the building\u2019s office space for $80 million and other financial pledges as part of refinancing the property. In 2013, it bought the retail condominium from Crown and Carlyle for $707 million, except for a portion that had been sold to Zara, the Spanish clothing chain.Vornado\u2019s chairman, Steven Roth, declined to comment on the building. His firm has veto power over any deal, according to its loan agreements with the Kushner Companies.The $1.2 billion mortgage on 666 Fifth Avenue has swelled to $1.4 billion with accrued interest, according to financial records filed by Vornado. Revenue, which continues to decline, covers only 66 percent of the building\u2019s debt obligations, according to the latest report by Trepp.At this point, the value of the office space is less than the mortgage, said Jed Reagan, a commercial real estate analyst at Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm based in California. \u201cThere is no equity value\u201d on the office portion of the building, he said.The Kushners have not filled space as it opens up because they plan to demolish the aluminum-clad building. More than two years ago, when the market for superluxury condominiums and high-end retail was hot, they commissioned Ms. Hadid, a star architect who died last year, to design a residential and hotel tower sitting atop a base of high-end shopping to replace it.The demolition and construction is projected to cost $7.5 billion. The Kushners are looking for a partner or partners to invest $3.3 billion, including $500 million from the Kushner family and others, who would own a 20 percent stake, according to Mr. Yolles, the company spokesman. Then they would need to borrow a staggering $4.2 billion.To attract investors, developers typically put together an offering plan. The Kushners\u2019 version is lavishly illustrated with renderings of the building by Ms. Hadid\u2019s firm and rosy financial projections that show the retail and residential spaces commanding spectacular prices that, seven years from now, when the building is completed, would total more than $12 billion.But the booming real estate market in New York, fueled in part by foreign investors, has cooled drastically at the luxury end.Sales have slowed to a trickle at a generation of ultraluxury supertowers along 57th Street and elsewhere, and vacancies have opened up at storefronts along the city\u2019s most lucrative shopping boulevards as rents have outpaced retailers\u2019 ability to pay.A year ago, a developer who owned the nearby Sony Building abandoned his very similar plan to convert that Madison Avenue office tower into a luxury mall, hotel and condominiums and sold it.The Kushners\u2019 spokesman said they were working with other potential investors to raise $2.5 billion. But Charles Kushner must offer a high enough price to also persuade Vornado to sell its stake in the building, buy out the remaining tenants and get Zara to vacate its space until the new tower is completed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Book Pins Corporate Greed on a Lust Bred at Harvard", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byDealBookIf you were to look for one ingredient that binds together the nation\u2019s chief executives, top managers and boards of directors, you\u2019d find a remarkably consistent commonality, now and in generations past: A disproportionate number of them are graduates of Harvard Business School.An M.B.A. from H.B.S., as those in the know refer to it, has long been the ultimate Good Housekeeping stamp of approval on any r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook \u2014 and the list goes on and on. The number of Fortune 500 chief executives who earned their business degrees at Harvard is three times the total from the next most popular business school, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.It is hard to overstate the school\u2019s influence on corporate America.That\u2019s why a new, exhaustive history of the school is causing a stir before it is even out. The book, \u201cThe Golden Passport,\u201d by the veteran business journalist Duff McDonald, is a richly reported indictment of the school as a leading reason that corporate America is disdained by much of the country.\u201cThe Harvard Business School became (and remains) so intoxicated with its own importance that it blithely assumed away one of the most important questions it could ask, which was whether the capitalist system it was uniquely positioned to help improve was designed properly for the long term,\u201d Mr. McDonald writes in the book, to be released in two weeks.His answer? \u201cWith economic inequality at a hundred-year high and meaningful progress on climate change and other social and environmental issues embarrassingly paltry, the answer to that question is obvious. It is not.\u201dCiting a report from the Aspen Institute, Mr. McDonald explains that \u201cwhen students enter business school, they believe that the purpose of a corporation is to produce goods and services for the benefit of society.\u201d\u201cWhen they graduate,\u201d he continues, \u201cthey believe that it is to maximize shareholder value.\u201dMr. McDonald brilliantly tells the story of the school\u2019s creation in 1908, when its mission was to educate the next generation of business managers. Edwin Gay, its first dean, defined business as the \u201cactivity of making things to sell at a profit \u2014 decently.\u201dBut, the author says, somewhere during the mid-1980s, something went very wrong: \u201cThe money got too good.\u201dThe money he refers to is the tsunami of job offers that Harvard students received from Wall Street, and the funding the school raked in from its well-heeled alumni.In fairness, Harvard Business School makes an easy punching bag, given its stature as the top feeder for big business. This is hardly the first time the institution has been criticized.And it is too much to paint all 76,000-plus alumni as being ethically challenged, as Mr. McDonald appears to imply. Indeed, many of the school\u2019s vaunted alumni are among the most talented executives in the country, and many are trying to think about stakeholders holistically.Yet in example after example, Mr. McDonald sets out his thesis that money and influence have distorted both the school\u2019s curriculum and the worldview espoused by its professors, who themselves are on the payroll of corporate America as part-time advisers and consultants.Mr. McDonald describes Mr. Jensen\u2019s arrival as \u201cthe moment of peak paradox for H.B.S.,\u201d contending that Mr. Jensen\u2019s \u201cideologically driven hijacking of the study of finance served as a cynical repudiation of everything that had come before him at the school.\u201dWith the elevation of Mr. Jensen, Mr. McDonald writes, \u201cH.B.S. had nurtured the professional manager from his birth and then helped to kill him.\u201dThe book is filled with anecdotal evidence of Mr. McDonald\u2019s argument. In once instance, he draws from a paper Mr. Jensen co-wrote in which the professor recounted a well-known story about the playwright George Bernard Shaw. As the story goes, Shaw had asked \u201can actress if she would sleep with him for a million dollars,\u201d Mr. McDonald writes. \u201cWhen she agreed, he changed his offer to $10, to which she responded with outrage, asking him what kind of woman he thought she was. His reply: \u2018We\u2019ve already established that. Now we\u2019re just haggling about the price.\u2019\u201dTo Mr. McDonald, Harvard teaches its students that \u201cwe\u2019re all whores.\u201dContinuing his train of logic, he writes: \u201cIf everybody assumes you\u2019re a whore, you might as well grab as much money as possible while you\u2019re still in demand.\u201dMr. McDonald\u2019s book also makes a provocative argument that Harvard Business School, and, by extension, the American business school complex, is responsible for out-of-whack compensation schemes for top management.\u201cWe benefit financially from it as well,\u201d the quotation continues. \u201cClearly, the fees we can charge M.B.A. students are correlated with the salaries they can get when they go get jobs.\u201dIn the end, Mr. McDonald acknowledges that \u201cone shouldn\u2019t expect Harvard Business School to be teaching courses on how to overthrow the capitalist economy.\u201dBut Mr. McDonald does raise enough salient questions that maybe the school should be asking: Should we create a case study about ourselves?A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the city in Massachusetts where Baker Library at the Harvard Business School is located. It is in Boston, on Cambridge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coal Mine Reality for President Trump", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byEditorialLegislation is being considered in Congress to help 22,500 retired union miners who have received notices that their health care benefits will be cut off on Monday unless new funding is approved. A few short-term fixes have been passed by Congress in recent years. But the miners, many with black lung and other diseases from years of labor down below, deserve a long-term solution for a more secure future.Once firmly financed in the heyday of the industry, the health plan has hit the same hard times as Big Coal, with numerous companies going bankrupt and shedding their responsibility to pay into the fund. The industry has receded in the face of cheaper, cleaner natural gas, while there are fewer career miners contributing to the union\u2019s share of the funding.Anxious miners have been buttonholing lawmakers, noting that President Trump, their nonstop champion in his election campaign, has made a show of loosening environmental regulations to help mining companies regain profits. Yet he has been publicly silent on the miners\u2019 health care problem. Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, said he has talked with Mr. Trump privately and has been assured that the president supports a permanent solution for the miners. \u201cTell them I\u2019m doing everything I can,\u201d Mr. Trump was quoted by the senator.Private talk is far short of Mr. Trump\u2019s signature tweet or public commitment. In the current muddle of federal budget negotiations, the miners\u2019 cause could easily get lost, particularly with conservative critics asking why the federal government should bail out a private-sector union. But the miners insist their benefit plan, hard-won seven decades ago in a crippling strike, amounts to a continuing national commitment.Senator Manchin is sponsoring a 10-year solution for the health care shortfall that would cost $1.3 billion and tap in part into funds from an existing mine cleanup program. The separate and far more expensive issue of miners\u2019 pension benefits, which are similarly failing, would be put off until next year.House Republicans have talked of another short-term bailout of less than two years to cover health care. But the Senate\u2019s bipartisan approach is far better as a permanent answer. It gained momentum with the endorsement of the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who had been reluctant in the past but now is heeding pleas for help from several thousand of his own Kentucky retirees. President Trump has a chance to finally push something more than fantasy for the many coal miners who took him at his word last November.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Britain\u2019s Trains Don\u2019t Run on Time: Capitalism", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 If how the railways run is a guide to the state of a nation, then it tells you something that Britain is in the middle of its biggest railway strike since 1994. Not coincidentally, that was the year the national rail network was privatized by the Conservative government of Prime Minister John Major.A labor dispute has been simmering for nearly a year on the routes managed by Southern, a train operator that, as the name suggests, runs crucial commuter services between London and the South Coast. In December, the crisis escalated when around 1,000 train drivers joined in a strike action against Southern\u2019s parent company, Govia Thameslink Railway, whose network also includes the Gatwick Express airport line.The details, of course, are local, and may even seem parochial. The dispute centers on Govia\u2019s plan to remove guards from trains. The unions believe this would threaten not just jobs but also the safety of passengers. The industrial upheaval on a rail artery critical to one of the world\u2019s largest economies tells a story that transcends borders, however: of the perils of introducing market ideology into key public services, a project driven not by the needs of passengers but by uncompromising dogma.How did we get here? Not on a Southern train, obviously: The company has become a byword for overcrowding, delays and understaffing.But more Britons than ever are using the rail network, crow the champions of privatization. That isn\u2019t because of the success of the sell-off, though, but is because of changes in the economy: More and more people are finding that they have to commute greater distances for work, for example. Where the networks themselves have improved, it\u2019s the state \u2014 not any private company \u2014 that has underwritten or financed modernization. Where the train operators have been left to their own devices, choosing whether or not to invest in new rolling stock, the result is clear: On some rush-hour train services into London, a third of passengers are forced to stand.The privatizers claimed that competition would lift standards of service, put the needs of the consumer first, reduce the burden on the taxpayer, rid the system of inefficiencies and drive down prices. On all scores, the privatization of Britain\u2019s railways is an embarrassment. Look no further than the current dispute on Southern to see how dysfunctional the privatized system is.Govia is contracted to run the Southern franchise \u2014 and is paid about \u00a31 billion (or $1.24 billion), a year by the government to do so. In return, revenue from ticket sales goes directly back to the government. Yet if train services are delayed or canceled, it is the government \u2014 or rather, the taxpayer \u2014 that refunds the bitter commuters. The company itself therefore has no incentive to settle with the unions; arguably, it is being paid by the Tory government to keep up the fight. Yet the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, pretends to have no hand in the matter, saying he cannot \u201cwave a wand\u201d to resolve the dispute.Not that public ownership has been banished from Britain\u2019s railways \u2014 but only other European governments are free to buy up Britain\u2019s rail networks. Foreign governments running British railway networks include France, Germany and the Netherlands. The important difference, of course, is that foreign state-owned companies are not accountable to British passengers (as a nationalized company is to British voters).Beyond the \u201ctravel chaos\u201d headlines and lost millions of economic activity, the failure of Britain\u2019s rail privatization opens broader questions that resonate beyond this country. Does it really make sense for the essential services we all depend upon to be for profit? The evidence from this two-decade experiment is a direct challenge to those who believe in the innate superiority of the private sector.What a way to run a railroad.Owen Jones is a columnist for The Guardian and the author of \u201cThe Establishment: And How They Get Away With It.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Recent data showing Chinese imports increasing 20 percent highlight this boom in outlays.In its report, the I.M.F. predicts that the Chinese economy will grow a bit more slowly in 2017 \u2014 6.6 percent compared with 6.7 percent in 2016.Despite the recent growth spurt, many economists say they believe that a pace of close to 7 percent is not sustainable, and they say that recent signs of a credit slowdown are proof that the Chinese economy will lose steam in the coming quarters.The fund also took note of the risks of China relying too much on credit, especially on hard to pin down shadow financing, to fuel growth.\u201cGrowth has remained reliant on domestic credit growth so rapid that it may cause financial stability problems down the road,\u201d Mr. Obstfeld said. \u201cThese problems could, in turn, spill over to other countries.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Two iron pillars ascend, almost comically, from the middle of the floor.The basketball court, in other words, is in no sort of shape for basketball.Yet Sylvie Manac\u2019h \u2014 the new director of the Y.M.C.A. in Paris, where the court is housed \u2014 seemed taken aback when a recent visitor wondered aloud whether Manac\u2019h ever wished she could tear the floor up and install a glistening replacement.\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI want this one.\u201dThe basketball court is an object of immense pride for the Y.M.C.A. in France (where it is known as the U.C.J.G.) and of historical significance for the game. The organization claims it is the oldest one in the world, continuously functional since the building opened in 1893, less than two years after James Naismith invented the game at a Y.M.C.A. in Springfield, Mass.Indeed, the gymnasium \u2014 in a dank basement, under a rickety wooden running track \u2014 feels like a walk-in time capsule or museum exhibit. Yet it functions, too, as a vital space in a facility that serves as a community center of sorts in the city\u2019s Ninth Arrondissement. Manac\u2019h and the organization have thus found themselves navigating a delicate path between preservation and utility.Regardless, the court could use an expensive makeover.\u201cMy dream is to find the money to see it as it was before,\u201d Manac\u2019h said.Naismith hung the baskets 10 feet above the ground simply because that was the height of the running platform overhead \u2014 the same setup still visible in Paris today.\u201cIt was one of America\u2019s great exports,\u201d Zeysing said.The quick and purposeful dissemination of basketball through the Y.M.C.A. system reflected the emergence in the late 19th century of \u201cmuscular Christianity,\u201d a religious movement that linked physical health and manliness to spiritual well-being.The Y.M.C.A. in Paris was the game\u2019s very first landing spot in Europe \u2014 a slice of American life transplanted to France, according to Christelle Bertho, an architect in Paris who has studied the entire facility extensively. Bertho said multiuse buildings, which the Y.M.C.A. helped pioneer in the United States, were unheard-of in France at the time. The new building also featured the first American-style bowling alley and indoor swimming pool in France.James Stokes, a millionaire philanthropist from New York with deep ties to the Y.M.C.A., financed and conceptualized the building project. The organization hired the French architect \u00c9mile B\u00e9nard, who traveled to America to study Y.M.C.A. buildings for guidance, and had all the building materials for the gym shipped from the United States.When the building was completed, an American named Melvin B. Rideout became its first athletic director, bringing basketball with him to Paris and practicing in what was essentially a contemporary replica of the Springfield gym where the game was created.\u201cWe really need American people to become interested in this building,\u201d Bertho said. \u201cIt\u2019s their history. It\u2019s a mixed French and American building, but it\u2019s mostly American, and Americans don\u2019t know about it.\u201dToday the cavernous building, protected since 1994 as a historical landmark, seems to creak with every footstep.

{"Headline": "Villagers Hold Officials Hostage in Vietnam Land Dispute", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byDONG TAM, Vietnam \u2014 Residents of Dong Tam, a village on the outskirts of Vietnam\u2019s capital, have been holding hostages for nearly a week to protest a government attempt to evict villagers from disputed land. The standoff has riveted a nation where farmers\u2019 land is often taken from them for development.Some of the more than three dozen officials and police officers taken hostage last weekend were later released, but others were still being held in Dong Tam on Friday, according to rights activists and state news outlets. Residents had erected barbed-wire barricades to block access to a part of the village where the hostages were said to be held.The episode has developed into one of the more dramatic confrontations in recent years between ordinary Vietnamese and their authoritarian government. The top city official in Hanoi, the capital, was expected to meet with villagers on Friday. State-run news outlets reported that officials had promised to review the underlying reasons for the land dispute, and to refrain from using violence.A blogger near Dong Tam who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said people simply wanted to return to normal life.The blogger was among a group of villagers protesting the land seizure in coordination with the people holding the hostages. He said 19 officials were still being held inside the barricades, a claim that could not be independently verified.Activists in Hanoi said that the dispute began last weekend, when police officers and plainclothes security forces entered Dong Tam, which sits among rice paddies about 25 miles south of Hanoi, to evict the villagers from the land. The villagers resisted and managed to capture 38 of the police officers and security officials in the process, the activists said.After news of the uprising spread online, some activists visited the village, said Doan Trang, a journalist in Hanoi who does not work for the state-controlled news media. But security was later tightened, and several human rights activists from Hanoi were placed under house arrest, she said.Experts and activists said the dispute was a vivid reminder of a quandary that Vietnam has wrestled with for decades: how to allocate land in a Communist country that allows quasi-private ownership rights but still considers all land to be state property.\u201cThings will not stop at Dong Tam,\u201d said Le Dung Vova, a prominent Vietnamese activist and writer. \u201cSimilar incidents will keep happening everywhere, with different levels of intensity, especially as land resources become more scarce.\u201dLand disputes are common on the fringes of Vietnamese urban areas, where land values are often high; villagers are typically compensated at prices well below market rates for agricultural land that is later rezoned for other uses. John Gillespie, a professor at Monash University in Australia who is an expert on land reform in Vietnam, said in an interview that the disputes tended to be more violent when villagers perceived that business interests outweighed public ones.Videos of confrontations between villagers and the riot police in rural Vietnam are widely shared on YouTube and Facebook, which are not blocked in the country. Some villagers are supported by networks of urban activists as they campaign against the officials or the state-affiliated companies behind the evictions.The disputes occasionally turn violent, forcing provincial or even national officials to intervene. In 2012, for example, after a farmer shot at police officers who were trying to evict him from his land in the northern port city of Haiphong, the prime minister at the time, Nguyen Tan Dung, stepped in to say that the eviction had been illegal.In 2013, Vietnam tweaked its land law in ways meant to introduce more transparency into eminent domain cases. A United Nations-financed survey of public administration in Vietnam later found that the percentage of citizens who reported land seizures in Vietnam had declined slightly, to 6.8 percent of respondents in 2016 from over 9 percent in 2013, suggesting that the law may have helped reduce land seizures by local officials.But experts say land disputes continue, in part, because the 2013 revisions do not allow private ownership or set clear definitions of what qualifies as the public interest in eminent domain cases.The Dong Tam conflict is not exceptional, said Andrew Wells-Dang, a senior governance adviser at Oxfam Vietnam who has worked on land policy in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s simply been large and gotten a lot of attention,\u201d he said.Embassy officers from some Western countries met with Hanoi officials this week and asked them to refrain from using violence in Dong Tam, said a Western diplomat in Hanoi who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing official protocol.There was no visible police presence.The blogger in Dong Tam said by telephone on Friday that about 20 journalists were waiting there for the top official of Hanoi, Nguyen Duc Chung, to arrive for expected talks with the villagers.It appeared that violence would be averted for at least another day because of the talks, Ms. Trang said. But the farmers, she said, will almost certainly be punished once the conflict has settled down.\u201cThat\u2019s the police\u2019s tradition,\u201d she said. \u201cNever in history do they concede to the citizens.\u201dChau Doan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Shareholders Tepidly Re-elect Bank\u2019s Directors", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byPONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Despite the turmoil that has engulfed Wells Fargo in the past year, shareholders voted to re-elect all of the bank\u2019s 15 directors during a raucous annual meeting on Tuesday. But some of the board members edged in just barely, signaling that many shareholders want further changes to the bank\u2019s leadership.Vocally displeased investors had hoped to remove some or all of the directors in the aftermath of the company\u2019s sales scandal over fraudulent accounts. That campaign failed: Every incumbent won support from at least 53 percent of the shareholders casting votes.Still, in corporate governance circles, that level of support is remarkably tepid. Stephen W. Sanger, the board\u2019s chairman, said the vote \u201csent the entire board a clear message of dissatisfaction.\u201dAnnual meetings are usually dry and rote affairs, but Wells Fargo\u2019s gathering \u2014 held at a lavish and isolated golf resort \u2014 had the air of a rowdy town-hall meeting. Aggrieved customers and employees used the forum to publicly confront the directors and executives that they blamed for allowing the bank\u2019s aggressive sales culture to turn toxic. Protests halted the proceedings several times.\u201cWe elected you guys to protect us, to be our watchdogs, and you were not,\u201d one shareholder shouted at the board as he was removed from the room.Most of the meeting proceeded more tamely, but emotions ran high throughout.\u201cThere is no doubt that the last seven months have been one of the most difficult periods in our company\u2019s 165-year history,\u201d Timothy J. Sloan, the bank\u2019s chief executive, said at the meeting\u2019s start. \u201cI can assure you that we are facing these problems head-on and that Wells Fargo is emerging a much stronger company.\u201dShareholders strongly backed Mr. Sloan, re-electing him to the board with the support of 99 percent of the votes cast.But the board\u2019s chairman, Mr. Sanger, was re-elected far more narrowly, with 56 percent of the vote. Enrique Hernandez Jr., the head of the board\u2019s risk committee, was elected with just 53 percent of the vote in his favor, the thinnest margin of any director.\u201cA low acceptance vote is a signal to the board that it needs to immediately begin to reconstitute itself,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, a professor of finance at the University of Delaware and an expert on corporate governance. \u201cThat ought to be the appropriate reaction.\u201dHowever, Mr. Sanger said that he viewed the large number of votes cast against some incumbent directors as a rebuke of the full board, not any individual members. No members planned to resign because of the shareholder vote, he said.That stance frustrated Brandon Rees, the deputy director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s investment office, which holds 1.6 million shares of Wells Fargo. Mr. Rees said he voted against all of the company\u2019s incumbent directors.Some giant pension funds \u2014 like Calpers, which manages the retirement funds of California\u2019s public employees and its New York City counterpart \u2014 also cast their votes against most of Wells\u2019s board members, saying they failed in their duties to oversee the company.\u201cFresh blood is needed to ensure that the board has sufficient independence,\u201d Mr. Rees said. \u201cThe narrow vote puts incredible pressure on some directors to reconsider their membership. I hope that by this time next year, we have a new slate.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Torres said that he had exchanged several emails recently with Mr. Sloan, who promised that he would personally ensure that employees\u2019 voices were heard as the bank worked to reform its sales culture. Mr. Torres, who joined Wells Fargo five years ago, said he hoped the bank\u2019s leaders would follow through on that commitment.\u201cI used every available resource to speak up about the unethical things I saw, and for years all of that was ignored,\u201d Mr. Torres said in the interview. \u201cThe board needs to be aware that the employees can be a resource to them, if they listen to us. We know what\u2019s going on in the bank. We live it, every day.\u201dAlthough none of Wells Fargo\u2019s directors were ousted, some turnover is likely. The board has a mandatory retirement age of 72. Six directors will reach that threshold within the next four years, Mr. Sanger said.At 71, Mr. Sanger is one of them, and he indicated that he was likely to leave at the end of his term.\u201cThis could be my last meeting,\u201d he said in an interview afterward. \u201cWe are committed to refreshing the board over time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lump of Rock, an Otter and a Secessionist", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byShetland Islands JournalSANDNESS, Shetland Islands \u2014 With gray clouds building and rain slanting in over the Atlantic, Stuart Hill pointed to a small lump of land inhabited by an otter, a few seals and a variety of seabirds.Yet, while many Shetlanders regard Mr. Hill as an eccentric, a growing number are being drawn to calls for more independence for their remote and scenic isles.Unleashed by Britain\u2019s planned withdrawal from the European Union, known as Brexit, the debate underscores the forces of fragmentation threatening to turn the United Kingdom into a contradiction in terms.In 2014, Shetland voted against independence for Scotland by 63.7 percent to 36.2 percent in a referendum that rejected separation.But last year\u2019s referendum on Brexit, in which a majority of Scots voted to remain, brought closer another plebiscite on Scottish independence, leaving Shetlanders wondering whether they might be better off controlling their own affairs \u2014 and the lucrative energy reserves and fishing stocks in the seas around them.Shaped by their Viking, rather than Celtic, roots, the Shetlands have a unique culture. Small Shetland ponies are a frequent sight in much of its panoramic landscape, and the red and blue houses of parts of its capital, Lerwick, look more Nordic than British.To this day, however, historians struggle to identify a point at which they became, legally, Scottish. Hence, Mr. Hill\u2019s case that the Shetlands belong neither to Scotland nor to Britain.To critics, discussion of independence for a tiny clutch of islands, while far-fetched, underscores the growing risk of the post-Brexit Balkanization of Britain.\u201cWe have a history of having to push water uphill against Edinburgh,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom London, you get benign neglect, but you get patronized from Edinburgh.\u201dInspecting boxes of haddock and cod at Lerwick\u2019s busy wholesale fish market, Gary Smith, skipper of a trawler, agrees.\u201cI would never say to anybody I am Scottish \u2014 never,\u201d he said.Shetland has its specific concerns, like ferry services and the sustainability of rural schools, he said against the backdrop of a harbor where seals regularly bob to the surface.The way people behave is different too, and generally rather nicer, he added. \u201cThey tolerate more; they are not so volatile,\u201d he said. On Shetland, people cannot avoid one another for long, he said, so before starting an argument that might escalate into a bitter personal feud, you think, \u201cWhy make life difficult for yourself?\u201dYet, collectively, Shetlanders are becoming more argumentative. Given the oil beneath the seabed and the seafood in nearby waters, there is seething resentment that public spending has been reduced.\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling in Shetland that everybody is working and we are paying into the pot, and we are getting shortchanged,\u201d Mr. Smith said. He thinks Mr. Hill has a good historical case, but jokes that he is \u201cprobably about 400 years too late with his argument.\u201dThe Shetland Islands Council has a reserve fund, financed by the oil industry, currently worth a hefty $375 million \u2014 more than $16,000 for every inhabitant \u2014 but there are worries that it is being drained by funding cuts from Edinburgh.At the St. Magnus Bay Hotel she runs in scenic Hillswick, Andrea Manson, a councilor and Wir Shetland supporter, argues that, had the islands won independence decades ago, \u201cwe would have been rich on the same sort of scale as Norway, with millions of pounds in the bank for each person; we would be treated with more respect.\u201dThe dining room is decorated with Viking shields, and Ms. Manson, too, insists that Shetlanders \u201cdon\u2019t think of ourselves as Scottish,\u201d adding, with a laugh, that the islands are \u201ctoo windy for kilts.\u201dThe authorities in Edinburgh calculate that \u201cyear on year, they can cut the grant and somehow we will manage to find the money,\u201d she said.\u201cMaybe what they weren\u2019t expecting was for Wir Shetland to say \u2018enough is enough,\u2019\u201d she said, claiming growing support for independence or at least the status of a British overseas territory, like the Falkland Islands.At Lerwick town hall, Mr. Robinson, the council leader, argues that funding cuts flow from Scotland\u2019s local government formula, rather than political decisions, but he thinks the effects are unfair.The grant has been reduced since 2010 by 23 percent, he said, prompting the loss of 600 of 2,900 council staff members.Mr. Robinson says laws made in Edinburgh or Westminster often fail to fit a rural community, and says he thinks that Brexit and Scotland\u2019s independence debate provide a \u201cpolitical opportunity\u201d to bring more powers to Shetland.As to Mr. Hill, Mr. Robinson thinks there \u201cprobably is a doubt as to the constitutional status of Shetland,\u201d but added that Mr. Hill\u2019s \u201cantics over time have grown to irritate people.\u201dSo difficult to reach is Forvik, which Mr. Hill says means \u201cisland of the bay of sheep,\u201d that he visits only about twice a year, though a shelter he built there in 2008 is still standing. A fount of self-taught legal and historical knowledge, Mr. Hill describes himself as Forvik\u2019s acting first minister.With plans to create a Forvik passport and another attempt to test the authority of Shetland\u2019s court \u2014 this time over planning permission \u2014 Mr. Hill says he thinks he can make the Shetland Islands the epicenter of the \u201cbreakup of monolithic states.\u201dMs. Manson thinks that future generations will erect statues to Mr. Hill, though, right now, even he accepts that he divides opinion.\u201cThere are a lot of people who support what I do, because they know that my heart is in Shetland,\u201d he said, before acknowledging, \u201cThere is the other side that think that I\u2019m just a complete nutter, and that I should go away and mind my own business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lessons From 100 Days of President Trump", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byHere are a dozen things we have learned in President Trump\u2019s first 100 days.1. Trump has had the worst beginning of any president since, oh, perhaps William Henry Harrison (who died a month after his inauguration). Trump has had no legislative triumphs, and he has by far the lowest public approval of any new president in polling history. Large majorities say he is not honest, does not keep promises and does not care about ordinary people.2. Trump distinguishes himself in one area: incompetence. The debacle of the travel ban was followed by the collapse of the G.O.P. health care bill, and I doubt we\u2019ll ever see passage of a tax reform package, a health bill or even a major infrastructure spending bill. Trump has made no trips abroad (at this juncture, Barack Obama had visited nine countries), and he has fewer than half as many nominees confirmed for senior positions as Obama did at this point.8. After initially tussling with allies like Australia and Mexico, and apparently refusing to shake Angela Merkel\u2019s hand for a photo, Trump has partially adapted to reality on foreign policy, abandoning his positions on two Chinas, on China\u2019s currency and on the Iran nuclear program. He has replaced an awful national security adviser (Michael Flynn) with a good one (H. R. McMaster) and now has a respectable national security team.12. The Republic stands. Checks and balances have constrained Trump, courts have blocked his travel ban, journalists have provided oversight, and the public has hounded members of Congress. Alarm that the U.S. might slip into a fascist dictatorship has diminished \u2014 but it\u2019s a long three years and nine months still ahead of us.Advertisement"}

It is to consider how the court would have been reshaped by President Barack Obama\u2019s pick for the same seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland.The answer shows just how polarized the Supreme Court has become. The titanic struggle over who would replace Justice Antonin Scalia was nothing if not partisan, and for good reason \u2014 the Supreme Court is just as divided as the rest of the nation.Had Judge Garland replaced Justice Scalia, the court would have immediately shifted to the left. A majority of its members would have been Democratic appointees for the first time in almost 50 years. And, in a shift in recent years, partisan affiliation has become a very strong predictor of voting trends for all its members.All four of the court\u2019s current Republican appointees are more conservative than all four of the Democratic ones, and that familiar dynamic seems very likely to hold when Judge Gorsuch joins the court. But it has not always been thus. As recently as 2009, two Republican appointees to the court, Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter, were members of the court\u2019s liberal wing.In losing the 2016 presidential election, Democrats may have given up the chance to change the balance of power on the Supreme Court for a generation. Judge Gorsuch is 49. If he serves as long as Justice Stevens, the last member of the court to retire, he will still be hearing cases in 2052. He would be 84, as old as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is now.Actuarial realities suggest that President Trump will have additional chances to move the court to the right. The court\u2019s three oldest members are Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, 80, a moderate conservative who holds the decisive vote in many closely divided cases, and the court\u2019s two senior liberals, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, 78, and Justice Ginsburg.Were Mr. Trump to replace any of the three, a court that generally leans right would have a rock-solid conservative majority.Were Mr. Trump to replace all three, the court\u2019s remaining liberals \u2014 Justices Sonia Sotomayor, 62, and Elena Kagan, 56 \u2014 could find themselves writing lonely dissents for years to come.Until the Democrats\u2019 surprise loss on Election Day in November, liberals had been anticipating something entirely different.\u201cThe biggest substantive change would probably have been in the area of campaign finance,\u201d he said. \u201cCitizens United would almost immediately have been on the chopping block with a liberal majority.\u201d That decision allowed corporations and unions to do what individuals had long been able to do: independently spend as much as they liked to support or oppose political candidates.\u201cI can even imagine a court with Garland on it chipping away at the four-decades-old rule that forbids limits on individual campaign expenditures,\u201d Professor Greene said.A range of other liberal policy priorities could also have been preserved, even though Judge Garland is not especially liberal.On the other hand, some said that Mr. Trump delivered on his campaign promise and found a nominee whose views reflected, among other things, his hostility to the administrative state, a position Judge Garland does not share.Judge Gorsuch is very likely to be precisely the sort of conservative Mr. Trump promised his supporters. \u201cThe justices that I\u2019m going to appoint will be pro-life,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the third presidential debate in October. \u201cThey will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment.\u201dLiberal despair over the future of the Supreme Court is compounded by hostility to Mr. Trump. \u201cA president with unprecedented ignorance of, and contempt for, fundamental constitutional values has gotten the opportunity to fill Justice Scalia\u2019s seat with a nominee who is likely to have a 30-year career of moving the court to the right,\u201d Professor Karlan said.Those decisions are probably secure for now, but a newly empowered conservative majority is likely to continue the signature projects of the Roberts court: deregulating campaign finance law, allowing states to limit voting, expanding gun rights and viewing race-conscious decisions by the government with skepticism.But he cautioned in an email that the two judges should not be reduced to stereotypes. \u201cNeither Gorsuch nor Garland has written opinions in most of these areas,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut if you treat them as place holders for \u2018conservative\u2019 or \u2018liberal\u2019 outcomes \u2014 which is too simplistic and unfair to both of them \u2014 these are where those fault lines have been in recent years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Proposes $84 Billion Budget as Possible Federal Cuts Loom", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday proposed an $84.9 billion operating budget for New York City that included new spending to provide legal services to immigrants \u2014 a nod to changing federal policy under President Trump.The mayor took some precautions for the future: The plan for the 2018 fiscal year calls for preserving $1 billion in reserves from previous budgets; efforts to find savings through measures like reducing overtime and using office space more efficiently; and a hiring freeze on some administrative positions (with no estimate of how much a freeze would save).Yet for the most part, the budget largely did not incorporate major shifts anticipating what could be substantial cuts in federal aid in the coming months or years. Mr. de Blasio said that because the Trump administration was erratic and unpredictable, and had so far been frustrated in achieving some of its most prominent goals, there was no point in guessing at the outcome.\u201cA White House plan or strategy doesn\u2019t change our strategy and our approach,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay true to our strategic vision. We\u2019ll deal with whatever comes out of Washington, but we\u2019re not going to wait.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe could be facing very severe cuts; we could be facing very limited cuts. We came to a strategic assumption, and we think it\u2019s the right one, that if you have no idea where something is going, and no one else does, it\u2019s dangerous to start making decisions based on that reality.\u201dMr. de Blasio said that the city re-evaluates its budget every few months and thus can quickly respond if funding cuts materialize.The mayor presented his budget in the Blue Room of City Hall, as City Council members in a chamber upstairs wrapped up a hearing on a package of new bills aimed at bolstering New York\u2019s protections for immigrants, in direct opposition to the Trump administration\u2019s policies.Mr. de Blasio, for his part, included $16 million in his budget proposal to provide legal services to immigrants in detention and to asylum seekers.\u201cI wish we did not have to include this in our budget, but we have to, because of the policies emanating from Washington,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.If adopted by the Council this spring, the budget, for the fiscal year that begins July 1, would be more than $12 billion above the level of spending when Mr. de Blasio took office. The last budget of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s administration called for $72.7 billion in spending.The city would also increase its 10-year capital spending plan to $95.9 billion, a rise of roughly $6 billion. But the bulk of the spending from the capital plan would take place over the next few years, according to the proposal, a pace of spending that surprised some budget watchers and would most likely add to the city\u2019s debt service costs.The city estimated only modest increases in tax revenue, because of lower revenue from income taxes and real estate sales taxes, offset by a rise in property tax receipts.Carol Kellermann, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog group, urged a more cautious approach.\u201cIn an atmosphere of political and economic uncertainty, the executive budget should have exhibited more spending restraint,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cAlmost $1 billion in new agency needs over two years and more than $5 billion in new capital commitments over the next five years have been added since the preliminary budget in January, yet nonproperty tax revenues have been reduced and reserves have not been increased.\u201dMelissa Mark-Viverito, the City Council speaker, and Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, the chairwoman of the council\u2019s finance committee, also called in a joint statement for increased reserves as \u201can important measure under the current national political uncertainty.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Online Upstarts Seek to Disrupt Used-Car Buying", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byWheelsSpeaking of conventional car dealerships, Ms. Hurwitz, 28, said: \u201cI always think they\u2019re going to swindle you. You\u2019re talking to a guy who\u2019s sizing you up. It\u2019s a very overwhelming situation, and you feel like you have to be on top of things and on guard.\u201dA handful of nascent online used-car companies, including Shift, are capitalizing on sentiments like these. Although most online sites merely refer consumers to dealers, these companies are aiming to disrupt the industry by skirting dealer markups and promoting what they see as a better buying and selling experience.As with most of the start-ups, Shift appraises cars and sets a price. For buyers, that means no negotiation. That\u2019s fine for consumers like Ms. Hurwitz, who had already done cost comparisons online.Partly because the prices are set, the process is much quicker, said George Arison, founder and chief executive of Shift, which is based in San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s four hours at the dealership. With us, it\u2019s 45 minutes start to finish.\u201dIn the last three years, online used-car start-ups have grown rapidly, accruing more than $2 billion in funding, according to ABI Research.Still, some say these companies underestimate the complexity of automotive retail and that upending a century-old business model may prove difficult.By 2015, the year after it was founded, Shift had raised nearly $75 million in capital from Goldman Sachs, DFJ and Highland Capital Partners. Beyond that, it would not discuss its financials.Mr. Banks said Internet-based car companies face the costs associated with advertising, product depreciation, repair, detailing, transportation and delivery.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to balance supply and demand with a marketplace business model,\u201d he said.In addition to not offering traditional test drives, Beepi also tried to grow too quickly, Mr. Arison said. \u201cThey quickly pushed to go national,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believed then and still that the car market is a local market. There is no national market.\u201dMost of these fledgling e-commerce companies must contend with local and state licensing and regulations, particularly during expansions. Shift, for example, recently had to discontinue sales in the Washington area until it received dealer licensing, Mr. Arison said.The trend toward online sales isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, especially among the set that came of age with smartphones. More than 55 percent of Shift\u2019s customers are under 35.\u201cThe market is heavily skewed toward the younger-generation shopper,\u201d Mr. Arison said. \u201cMost young people do everything online.\u201dRachel Lutz, who owns the Peacock Room clothing boutique in Detroit, said she would not have known how relatively roomy the new Mini Cooper Clubman was had she shopped exclusively online, since the model didn\u2019t show up in searches. She ended up buying one from a veteran salesman, she said.\u201cMillennials want experiences; they don\u2019t want purchases,\u201d said Ms. Lutz, 37. \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing with the brick-and-mortar experience because it\u2019s been lacking for so long. When you give them service like that, it\u2019s new and exciting for them.\u201dThe industry is big business; more than 38.5 million used cars were sold last year at an average retail price of $19,189, according to an Edmunds report. By contrast, 17.2 million new vehicles are forecast to be sold this year.Although similar predictions were made for last year, used-car prices are still widely expected to soften. \u201cThis is something we\u2019ve not seen in many years, and it\u2019s going to cause some disruption and hurt margins, especially if they have inventory on hand,\u201d said Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis for AutoPacific Inc. \u201cThe next three years will weed out the weak ones.\u201dJonathan Collegio, senior vice president for public affairs of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said that while consumers had benefited from the competitive used-car market, new companies could encounter tough times.\u201cNew entrants are always moving in,\u201d he said, \u201cbut under the assumption that they can better figure out how to crack the nut than the thousands of other entrepreneurs who have been at it for decades.\u201dStill, Mr. Sullivan said it would be folly to discount what would probably be a swelling number of e-commerce car businesses. \u201cThis should be a wake-up call for dealerships that there\u2019s a business model that some consumers prefer,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers don\u2019t want to be told how they\u2019ll buy something. For some, the traditional model works. For others, they\u2019re ready to try something new.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Democrats Should Spend Their Millions", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe outpouring of outrage across the country in response to Donald Trump\u2019s election has created a significant opening for flipping Republican-held House seats. This wave of progressive activism has found its way to the campaign coffers of Jon Ossoff, the leading Democrat in the Georgia congressional special election on Tuesday to fill the vacancy created when Tom Price joined Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet.A combination of Democratic enthusiasm and Republican complacency has created the conditions for change in Georgia and other forthcoming congressional races. In the Kansas special election last week, Republican turnout was down 62 percent from November, while Democratic turnout dipped only 32 percent \u2014 conditions that nearly brought an upset for James Thompson, the Democratic candidate.To seize this opportunity, however, Democrats must fight their addiction to consultant-driven paid ads that seek to persuade supposed swing voters and instead invest significant resources in getting core Democratic supporters to the polls.Mr. Ossoff has raised an astounding $8.3 million since announcing his candidacy in January. If he doesn\u2019t emerge with 50 percent of the vote in the crowded primary tomorrow, he will require smarter and more data-driven spending to win the runoff election in June.The conventional wisdom is that the Sixth Congressional District in Georgia, in the suburbs north of Atlanta, is a conservative district and that the only way to win is by running on a relatively conservative platform.That analysis may hold water in high-turnout presidential elections, but in a special election, it fails to appreciate just how many liberal voters there are and how decisive their numbers could be.True, in November 2016, the Democrat received only 38 percent of the vote in that district, but that 38 percent equals about 125,000 people. In a district that has consistently elected Republicans for decades, the fact that 125,000 people still cast their ballots for the Democrat in 2016 is a powerful statement by people who are proud to be Democrats and not pining to be Republican-lite.With turnout expected to be relatively low, Mr. Ossoff is likely to need only 75,000 votes to win. The challenge for Democrats in Georgia and beyond is to inspire their core voters by running on a strong, unapologetic progressive platform and, especially important, to make major investments in the proven practice of deploying paid canvassers to knock on Democratic doors, get commitments to vote and then make sure those supporters get to the polls.The threshold question facing all Democratic candidates is what is the rationale for how they spend their money? The overwhelming allocation of the $6 million Mr. Ossoff\u2019s campaign has spent has gone to paid ads \u2014 nearly $3 million on media buys and $2 million on online ads.Who is the intended target of these ads? Are those expenditures targeting the 125,000 Democrats to inspire them to turn out again, or are they designed to convince Republican frequent voters that Mr. Ossoff isn\u2019t such a bad guy?In addition to the Democrats who voted in November, there are tens of thousands of African-American, Latino and Asian-American eligible voters in the district, but their participation is usually lower for many reasons. That is a solvable problem for a candidate with many millions of dollars and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that includes an internship with John Lewis, the civil rights legend who represents a nearby district.The cost of turning out an infrequent voter is roughly $30 to $50 per voter. Devoting just $1 million of Mr. Ossoff\u2019s enormous financial haul to such a program would increase minority voter participation by about 25,000 voters, bringing him much closer to the 75,000 vote number he needs.There are also some signs that the Democratic Party is \u201cgetting it.\u201d The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has signaled a shift from previous practice by assigning nine staff members to the Georgia special election to help with turnout instead of simply running television commercials, as it has frequently done in past elections.If Democrats want to do well in 2018, they need to start spending money now on programs to increase voter turnout then. Over the past decade, the party whose voters have been least inspired to participate in the midterms has lost control of the House of Representatives.In 2006, Republicans held the majority in the House, but their voter turnout plummeted, with nearly twice as many Republicans staying home as Democrats, allowing enough seats to change parties to make Nancy Pelosi the speaker.In 2010, the tables were turned: Democratic turnout fell sharply by 26 million people, Republican turnout dipped by just 7 million, and Ms. Pelosi had to surrender the gavel.By spending their money more wisely, Democrats can win the Georgia special election and, in 2018, prevail in enough races to recapture control of the House of Representatives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Brexit, Scotland Lays a Path to Another Independence Vote", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byEDINBURGH \u2014 Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s formidable first minister, knows how to play the long game.Now 46, she served loyally for a decade as deputy to Alex Salmond, both in the Scottish National Party and later in government, before becoming Scotland\u2019s leader after the failure of the independence referendum of September 2014, when Mr. Salmond resigned.Now, after Britain as a whole voted to leave the European Union while Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain, Ms. Sturgeon is patiently laying out a path for another independence referendum, using Prime Minister Theresa May as her foil.\u201cThe U.K. government has decided to remove Scotland not just from the European Union but from the single market as well, and that\u2019s clearly against the will of the majority of people who live here,\u201d she said Friday, as she sent a formal letter to Mrs. May, with the support of the Scottish Parliament, asking for another referendum. Mrs. May has already said the referendum cannot happen before Britain leaves the European Union, two years from now.Their meetings are \u201cbusinesslike\u201d and \u201ccordial,\u201d Ms. Sturgeon said in an interview on Friday in Bute House, Scotland\u2019s No. 10 Downing Street. But hardly warm.Meeting Mrs. May in Glasgow on Monday, \u201cwe were very keen to try to strike a compromise that would have reconciled the fact that the U.K. voted to leave the E.U. and Scotland voted to remain,\u201d Ms. Sturgeon said. \u201cBut there was not a willingness to compromise on her part.\u201dThat was hardly unexpected, Ms. Sturgeon admitted. \u201cIt would have been na\u00efve on my part\u201d not to factor in Mrs. May\u2019s refusal to countenance a referendum before the process of Britain\u2019s departure from Europe, or Brexit, is finished, she said.But Ms. Sturgeon intends to press ahead, promising to tell her Parliament in April of plans to keep up momentum for what she calls \u201can act of democratic self-determination,\u201d noting that Mrs. May cited the same principle to explain Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.\u201cWhen the time is right,\u201d when the Brexit negotiations produce greater clarity about the future, \u201cand we\u2019re able to set out in light of changed circumstances what independence would mean for Scotland, then Scotland gets to take that informed choice before it\u2019s too late,\u201d she said. It will be for those living in Scotland to decide, she insisted, not the Parliament in London.Since Scots voted down independence, 55 percent to 45 percent, the Scottish National Party has grown enormously with many Scots getting politicized by the bitter campaign. With some 25,000 members in September 2014, her party now has more than 125,000, Ms. Sturgeon said.A second referendum would probably put the independence camp in a better position than three years ago, when young people voted heavily to leave, and a British exit from the European Union seemed highly unlikely. But while Scots voted to remain in the European Union last June by 62 percent to 38 percent, that has not translated easily into support for independence, with about a third of those favoring independence also voting for a British exit.\u201cRight now there\u2019s too much uncertainty, not just about Scotland but about Brexit,\u201d said Ian Ramage, who returned to Edinburgh a decade ago after many years living abroad. \u201cBrexit to me is like going back in time, but nobody\u2019s certain about anything just now.\u201dChris Deerin, a Scottish political analyst, said that Ms. Sturgeon \u201cis both stuck and in charge.\u201d She would not want another referendum so soon in any case, he said, and can now blame Mrs. May and Westminster, always a popular tactic here. But for Ms. Sturgeon, it would be important to try to have the vote before the next Scottish parliamentary elections in 2021, when the now-dominant S.N.P. might lose more seats, in the normal cycle of politics.Ms. Sturgeon is essentially using the same \u201ctake back control\u201d argument that leave supporters used in the European Union referendum, only one of the ironies involved, as Mrs. May works to leave one union while maintaining another \u2014 the United Kingdom.The Scottish nationalists are winning the emotional argument, Mr. Deerin said, \u201cbut the biggest hurdle the S.N.P. has to climb now is financial.\u201d A serious discussion of how an independent Scotland would finance itself will be crucial to winning a second referendum, he said.Since 2014, Scotland\u2019s oil and gas revenues have plunged precipitously, from some 9.6 billion pounds in the 2011-2012 fiscal year to just 60 million pounds in 2015-2016. And it may shrink further given the high costs of extraction while the price of oil is low. Scotland\u2019s rate of growth is about a third of Britain\u2019s, at less than 1 percent a year, and its budget deficit is twice that of Britain\u2019s.Ms. Sturgeon acknowledges the problems, saying that she has commissioned Andrew Wilson, an economist and former S.N.P. legislator, to do a study of how Scotland can manage its finances.\u201cWe have to deal with the deficit whether we\u2019re an independent country or not, and the question is whether we have greater ability to deal with it as an independent country, and I believe we do,\u201d she said. But she would like to cut the deficit \u201cin a way compatible with our values as a country, because what we\u2019re finding now is that the deficit is being reduced consistent with the values of a Conservative government in Westminster that is leading to austerity.\u201dMr. Wilson\u2019s study is just another example of how Ms. Sturgeon is proceeding to try to answer the questions raised in the last referendum and win a second one, which will probably determine her own political fate.Similarly, she said clearly that an independent Scotland would want to join the European Union but not use the euro, arguing that Sweden managed to join the bloc while opting out of the single currency. What money Scotland would use remains unclear, a major issue in the last referendum campaign after Britain said that an independent Scotland could not use the pound.Nor would she be drawn on whether an independent Scotland could achieve its aims by joining the economic grouping shared by Norway, which has access to the bloc\u2019s single market in return for budget contributions and freedom of movement and labor of European Union citizens, but is short of membership.Ms. Sturgeon spoke before leaving for a week in New York and California, to promote Scottish business, investment and culture. \u201cThe links between Scotland and America are so deep and multifaceted, but it\u2019s important to work at strengthening them,\u201d she said.And that includes someone\u2019s mother? She laughed at the clear reference to President Trump, who speaks proudly of his Scottish mother.\u201cLook, lots of people are very proud of Scottish connections, so I\u2019m delighted that people want to highlight them,\u201d she said, laughing again. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be stopped at the airport going in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But he eventually became a target of the authorities, partly because his public displays of wealth came even as his company fell behind on salary payments to staff.Often likened to the British entrepreneur Richard Branson, Mr. Mallya, 61, turned what had been a family brewing business into a sprawling conglomerate. He now owns the United Breweries Group, which makes Kingfisher beer and distributes a wide variety of products, including alcohol, chemicals and fertilizer. He also has a stake in India\u2019s only Formula One car racing team, Force India.He was a frequent presence on the party scene, drawing attention in particular for a birthday party a decade ago that featured Lionel Richie as the headline act. Attendees at Mr. Mallya\u2019s 60th birthday party, held at his villa in the coastal Indian state of Goa, included the singer Enrique Iglesias, Bollywood stars and top Indian businessmen.But his outsize ambitions proved to be his downfall.In 2003, Mr. Mallya established an airline, with plans to expand internationally and shift from an all-economy-class model to add a luxurious business class. He made a splash at the Paris Air Show in 2007 with a $7 billion order for 50 Airbus planes.The airline promised meals even on short-haul flights, and curbside valets. Its flight attendants wore the bright red uniforms used by staff members on Mr. Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic.But Kingfisher Airlines struggled in a competitive domestic market. Over time, it was left with a ragtag collection of aging and inefficient planes. By 2012, after persuading lenders to restructure its debt, it ceased operations in the face of high fuel prices and a global slowdown.The airline owed more than $1 billion in loans, as well as other bills, including back pay to former employees. Because Mr. Mallya himself, and the United Breweries Group, had backed some of the loans, creditors chased them for repayment.As the dispute went through the courts, banks tried to seize Mr. Mallya\u2019s assets. Indian authorities raided his homes and offices in Mumbai, Bangalore and Goa in 2015.He left for Britain in March 2016, but India canceled his passport the next month, after a court in Mumbai issued a warrant for his arrest. India sent Britain an official request for Mr. Mallya\u2019s extradition on Feb. 8.Mr. Mallya appeared at a London court and was then released on bail, according to Dinesh K. Patnaik, India\u2019s deputy high commissioner in London. Mr. Mallya is scheduled to appear for another hearing next month.\u201cThe willingness of the U.K. government in bringing him to justice is something we are appreciative of,\u201d Mr. Patnaik said.According to the British Home Office, arrest warrants are issued in response to extradition requests only if such requests are certified by officials and then sent to a court for the warrant to be issued.If the judge in Mr. Mallya\u2019s extradition hearing approves the request for him to be sent back to India, then it is sent to Britain\u2019s home secretary for final approval.Mr. Mallya dismissed the news as \u201cmedia hype,\u201d but he confirmed on Twitter that an extradition hearing began on Tuesday.\u201cI did not flee from India and neither am I an absconder,\u201d he added. \u201cRubbish.\u201dSantosh Kumar Gangwar, an Indian finance minister, told reporters that the country\u2019s authorities were \u201cascertaining the facts\u201d about Mr. Mallya and \u201ctrying to find out how to bring him back to our country and start legal proceedings against him.\u201d\u201cWe will not spare him legally,\u201d Mr. Gangwar said.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Kingfisher Airlines was founded.

{"Headline": "Chinese Investment Scandal Highlights \u2018Shadow Banking\u2019 Risks", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 When Lisa Wang sank her retirement money \u2014 all $730,000 of it \u2014 into a single investment, her fund manager repeatedly said the product was risk free.It wasn\u2019t.On Wednesday, Ms. Wang, 61, joined about a dozen other customers in the lobby of a Beijing branch of the bank China Minsheng, pressing employees for details and demanding their money back, after the Chinese news media reported that more than $400 million of investors\u2019 money had disappeared.\u201cI invested because they told me it\u2019s a product that would guarantee my capital,\u201d Ms. Wang said. \u201cI\u2019m so angry and disappointed.\u201dTypically marketed as low risk, these investments, known as wealth management products, offer tantalizing returns that seem to handily beat the interest rates that banks offer on regular accounts. Lured by the assurances of safety and promises of profit, investors have plowed their savings into the products.But many of the investments have focused on coal, steel and real estate \u2014 areas that are facing overcapacity problems in China. As those areas show signs of trouble, the worry is that many of the investments could fail, creating a major shock to the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second-largest, after the United States\u2019.The products, which are often kept off banks\u2019 balance sheets, are part of a vast, shadowy system of lending that has girded the Chinese economy and kept businesses growing. The Chinese government has stepped in to protect investors, avert ripple effects and ensure social stability.But those bailouts create their own challenges. Investors, assured that the government will come to the rescue, do not worry about the potential risks and continue to pour money into the products. According to the state news media, Chinese investors have put $4.4 trillion into wealth management products, equivalent to about 40 percent of the country\u2019s annual economic output.\u201cIt invites moral hazard,\u201d said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, who specializes in the politics of Chinese banking policies. \u201cWhen you tell people that they will get bailed out, then they will engage in very, very risky behavior and also opportunistic behavior on the part of the banks.\u201dChina Minsheng, the bank at the heart of the latest scandal, had a good pitch.The product, it told investors, would provide a return of 8 percent to 27 percent. To sweeten the deal, the bank offered free golf events and trips to South Africa and other overseas locales.Encouraged by the bank\u2019s strong reputation, investors, including many older people, forked over a minimum of $145,000. \u201cMy fund manager stressed again and again that there is no risk,\u201d said Ms. Wang, the investor.Investors gathered at the bank on Wednesday, pushing for the bank to make good. \u201cWe\u2019re not going home if you don\u2019t return us our money,\u201d one of them shouted.Such protests are a big concern for the government. Chinese investors, who often display a herd mentality, could dump the products once bad news spreads. If investors suddenly demand their money back, it could create a liquidity crunch, putting significant pressure on the economy. To avoid that situation, the government has generally acted quickly to repay investors when problems have surfaced.Along with wealth management products from banks, online lenders are jumping into the game, adding to the risks. Last year, Chinese authorities said an online finance company had bilked investors out of more than $7.6 billion in what they said was a huge Ponzi scheme.The scandal at China Minsheng reflects \u201cthe lack of internal controls\u201d at the bank, said Wei Jiyao, an analyst at PY Standard, a research company based in Chengdu, China, that tracks wealth management products. Mr. Wei predicted that regulators would probably respond by trying to tighten their control over the products.While regulators have pledged to increase oversight of the industry, experts say that many banks have found ways to circumvent the rules.Christopher Balding, an associate professor of finance at Peking University HSBC Business School in Shenzhen, China, said he had not seen any indication that the authorities would seriously rein in wealth management products, even though \u201cintellectually, they want to.\u201dMr. Balding pointed in particular to a Communist Party congress scheduled for the fall, when a big leadership shake-up is expected and when the government prizes social stability above all else.\u201cThey are kind of like a dieter on Jan. 15 who says, \u2018It\u2019s going to be so hard for me to get out of bed and go and exercise,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut are they willing to get out of bed every morning and give up that cookie at lunch?\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court to Weigh if Firms Can Be Sued in Human Rights Cases", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byThe Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether corporations may be sued in American courts for complicity in human rights abuses abroad.The case concerns Arab Bank, which is based in Jordan and has been accused of processing financial transactions through a branch in New York for groups linked to terrorism. The plaintiffs in the case seek to hold the bank liable for attacks in Israel and in the Palestinian territories by Hamas and other groups.The case turns on the meaning of the Alien Tort Statute, a cryptic 1789 law that allows federal district courts to hear \u201cany civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.\u201dThe federal appeals courts are divided over whether corporations may be sued under the law.After hearing arguments on the question in 2012, the Supreme Court asked the parties to brief and argue a broader issue: whether American courts may ever hear disputes under the law for human rights abuses abroad, whether the defendant was a corporation or not.In 2013, the court said that there was a general presumption against the extraterritorial application of American law, ruling against Nigerian plaintiffs who said foreign oil companies had aided in atrocities by Nigerian military and police forces against Ogoni villagers.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, wrote that even minimal contact with the United States would not be sufficient to overcome the presumption. \u201cEven where the claims touch and concern the territory of the United States, they must do so with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application,\u201d he wrote.But the Supreme Court did not answer the question it had initially agreed to consider, whether corporations are categorically excluded from the law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Markets Are Bouncing Back From a Six-Year Slowdown", "Date": "2017-04-17", "News": "Supported byAs Turkey hurtled toward one of the most politically divisive polls in its history, the country\u2019s business leaders reacted in a curious manner.They ramped up production.Ignoring terrorism threats, the yo-yoing of the Turkish currency and a president quick to pick fights with Europe, Turkish manufacturers last month reported their most buoyant month of economic activity in three years.Turkey\u2019s robust performance \u2014 exports last month were up 19 percent on an annual basis \u2014 highlights what has been a string of unusually expansive data showings by emerging markets since the beginning of the year.As the stock market in the United States takes a breather after a torrid run this year, emerging-market stocks and bonds have attracted large inflows from investors. Worries about President Trump\u2019s anti-trade statements are fading, and a weaker dollar has also helped, giving once-downtrodden currencies like the Mexican peso, the Turkish lira and the Brazilian real a lift.Stock and bond market gains in emerging markets can be fleeting, vulnerable to political turmoil and investors with short-term investment horizons. But for now, the mood is bullish.On Monday, investors bid up Turkish stocks, betting that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s referendum victory in Turkey on Sunday, giving the office of the presidency greater executive powers, would further bolster the economy. The Turkish lira, which has borne the brunt of investor fears, had one of its stronger days, gaining 2 percent against the dollar.And China said its economy, buoyed by heavy investment spending, had grown 6.9 percent, a better figure than economists had projected.Other economies considered to be emerging markets \u2014 Mexico, South Korea and Brazil \u2014 are also overcoming deterrents, like volatile currencies, political upheaval and worries of a trade crackdown by the Trump administration, to generate stronger-than-expected economic growth.This nascent boomlet follows a six-year slowdown in these once fast-growing economies.Fears that the Chinese economy would slam on the brakes, a slump in commodity prices and political scandals that hobbled countries like Brazil have taken a toll, spurring a broad exodus of global investment funds from such markets.\u201cDespite what is happening politically in mature economies, we are seeing a real broadening of growth in emerging markets,\u201d said Ulrik Bie, an economist at the Institute of International Finance, a trade group for global banks, which bumped up its growth forecasts in light of recent data. \u201cThese economies are such a large part of the global economy, so this provides a really solid foundation for overall growth.\u201dThe sources for these demand spurts have been varied.In China, import growth in volume terms, a major measure of domestic demand in the economy, was up 20 percent during the first two months of the year.Business confidence in Mexico improved sharply in March. The peso, which plunged sharply after the election of Mr. Trump, has regained all its value. For the year, the peso is up 10 percent against the dollar.And in Brazil, which is struggling to emerge from a devastating recession, the central bank slashed interest rates last week by the largest amount since 2009 in a bid to spur an economy that is revealing small, but persistent, signs of recovery.According to an index of hard and soft economic data points compiled by the Institute of International Finance, growth in emerging economies was up 6.8 percent through the first quarter this year \u2014 the model\u2019s highest reading since 2011.As an early indicator, the growth tracker\u2019s tally is by no means definitive, and it is entirely possible that the final figure for the quarter will be lower. But economists at the institute say the model is a good spotter of economic trends, and it is clearly showing a sharp pickup in global emerging markets in recent months.\u201cWe are seeing a broad uptick in business confidence and P.M.I.s in these countries,\u201d said Mr. Bie, the I.I.F. economist, referring to the purchase managers index, a gauge of private-sector manufacturing activity.The impressive trade numbers coming from China (exports grew 16 percent in March) as well as similarly robust export figures in South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia also point to a sharp recent pickup in global trade.The last few years have been poor for international commerce; fears of a China slowdown have been a major factor.But shipping executives say there has been a remarkable increase in demand for container vessels, which carry most manufactured trade goods around the globe. According to the Harpex Shipping index, which follows container pricing trends, rates have soared 40 percent this year.Economists note that container shipping is the oxygen of global growth, and for the last few years the business has been in the doldrums. Shipping prices plummeted, pushing some firms into bankruptcy and forcing many ships to be scrapped.The turnaround, coming so quickly after a bad 2016, has caught the industry by surprise.\u201cThere is definitely something going on here,\u201d said Nick Bailey, the chief commercial officer at Lomar Shipping, a container-focused shipper owned by the Libra Group. \u201cThe market from mid-last year to today has doubled.\u201dChina has been the single largest purchaser of container ships, Mr. Bailey, who is based in Singapore, said. He noted that many were being used to transport goods from hubs like Shanghai to smaller, regional ports.\u201cThis is being driven by domestic demand in China,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a big part of this growth story.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marine Le Pen Will Name a Former Rival Prime Minister if Elected", "Date": "2017-04-29", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Marine Le Pen, the far-right French presidential candidate, said on Saturday that she would name a former rival and fellow Euroskeptic as her prime minister if elected, in a new effort to broaden her appeal and defeat her centrist opponent, Emmanuel Macron, in the second round of the country\u2019s elections on May 7.Ms. Le Pen said she had reached an agreement with Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a right-wing politician who shares her distrust of the European Union and globalization and who gathered 4.7 percent of the vote, or nearly 1.7 million ballots, in the election\u2019s first round. Ms. Le Pen gathered 21.3 percent.Ms. Le Pen, sitting with Mr. Dupont-Aignan at a news conference in Paris, praised him as a \u201cpatriot\u201d and said that together they would present a \u201ccommon project\u201d to help them \u201cclaim the patriotic and republican victory that our country needs.\u201d\u201cWe must wrest our country from finance, from submission, from the great whirlwind of globalization that will carry us away if we confront it without knowing how to protect ourselves,\u201d she said.Mr. Dupont-Aignan has drawn heavy criticism for his endorsement, especially among politicians on the right who noted his past declarations that his \u201cGaullist\u201d convictions \u2014 meaning his attachment to the political heritage of late president Charles de Gaulle \u2014 were incompatible with an alliance with the National Front.\u201cNicolas Dupont-Aignan is showing his true face, that of betrayal,\u201d the center-right Republican party said in a statement. The Republican candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, did not make it into the second round of the elections, and the party has called on its members to vote against Ms. Le Pen.Ms. Le Pen said the agreement with Mr. Dupont-Aignan had led to \u201cmodifications\u201d in her platform. Mr. Dupont-Aignan mentioned, for instance, a \u201cless systematic\u201d use of import taxes. And in a joint statement on Saturday, the two said that leaving the eurozone was not a \u201cprerequisite to all economic policy,\u201d a softening of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s previous position.Still, the two politicians agree on a vast number of policies, including a hard-line approach to security and an emphasis on the need to increase economic protectionism and to reduce the powers of the European Union, which has become one of the campaign\u2019s major issues. France\u2019s current president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, noted on Saturday that the French election was a \u201cEuropean choice.\u201dMr. Macron, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s centrist opponent, said on Saturday that her alliance with Mr. Dupont-Aignan was the sign of a \u201creal clarification in French political life.\u201d\u201cThere is a reactionary, nationalist and anti-European right that has structured itself and that is now an important political force in the second round of this presidential elections,\u201d Mr. Macron said at a campaign event in Usseau, a small town in central France.Even if Ms. Le Pen were elected and Mr. Dupont-Aignan were nominated to become prime minister, it is unclear that he would stay in the job for long. Although the president nominates the prime minister, that person must reflect the political majority in the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of Parliament, to avoid a government-toppling motion of censure.But few analysts believe the National Front will gain enough seats in legislative elections in June to obtain a majority, meaning Ms. Le Pen, if elected, could be forced to replace Mr. Dupont-Aignan after those elections.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texans Gone Wild", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 IN the wee hours of Nov. 9, I had an overwhelming urge to climb up on my roof here with a megaphone and shout to the rest of the country, \u201cWelcome to Texas, y\u2019all!\u201dRepublicans have controlled all three branches of government in my home state for more than a decade. Many policies now being championed by President Trump and Congressional leaders seem old hat to Texans: defunding public education, going after immigrants, shredding the safety net. But rather than resting their boots on the table, political leaders in Texas have moved farther to the right.Our 140-day every-other-year Texas legislative session began in January. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick \u2014 who controls the Senate and is arguably more powerful than Gov. Greg Abbott \u2014 is leading the far-right charge. Under his sway, the Senate has already passed bills that starve government, crack down on undocumented immigrants and discriminate against transgender people. Despite opposition from law enforcement, business and nonprofit groups like mine, the bills sailed through the Senate and await consideration in the House.One Senate bill threatens local law enforcement officials and department heads with criminal prosecution and police departments with loss of state money if they fail to comply with federal immigration orders. Even before the bill passed the Senate in February, Governor Abbott cut $1.5 million in criminal justice funding to Travis County (which includes Austin) to punish it for its policy of reducing cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. During the same period, immigration raids in Austin terrified immigrant families and led to the arrest of 51 people, most of whom had no previous convictions.There are two silver linings in the thundercloud of extremism billowing over Texas. One is the potential for a revived moderate middle that believes in fact-based public policy. The other is the groundswell of public engagement.As a veteran local lobbyist joked recently, the only thing standing between Texas and the Middle Ages is the House, ably presided over by Speaker Joe Straus, Republican of San Antonio. In contrast to the Senate\u2019s far-right agenda, the House\u2019s common-sense priorities include remodeling our outdated school finance system and advancing mental health reforms. It remains to be seen whether moderates in the House have the votes to stop all the bad bills coming their way from the Senate.Fortunately, many Texans are out in force to help them. Frequent public rallies and marches have drawn record crowds around the state, including the nearly 50,000 people who turned out for the Women\u2019s March in Austin. At a community forum with more than 1,000 people, one group of newly engaged Texans announced detailed plans to push for reforms of the state\u2019s Child Protective Services Division. Both houses have now passed C.P.S. reform legislation.Will the recent surge in civic engagement help elect leaders who are more representative of the state\u2019s diversity in 2018? Two recent court rulings may help. Federal courts in Texas held that the state\u2019s voter ID law and congressional redistricting maps intentionally discriminated against Latino and black voters.It was chilling to watch many legislators, stone faced, ignore their pleas. But even so, while people of all ages and backgrounds waited bleary-eyed in the hallways to share their stories and the values that come with them, I could see the potential for a brighter future for Texas.Ann Beeson is the executive director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "South Africa\u2019s Protesters Have It Right", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byEditorialAnd what did the A.N.C. do? In the immediate aftermath of the purge, some of its senior leaders openly criticized the president\u2019s actions. On Wednesday, however, the party, which has dominated post-apartheid South African politics since 1994, did what it always does: It closed ranks behind Mr. Zuma, chided critics for \u201cpublic dissonance\u201d and vowed that this \u201cwill not happen again.\u201dGwede Mantashe, the A.N.C. secretary general, who initially acknowledged that worthy ministers had been fired without party approval, now accepted that the firing of Mr. Gordhan was made necessary by an \u201cirretrievable breakdown\u201d of the minister\u2019s relationship with the president. That was evidently shorthand for Mr. Gordhan\u2019s courageous resistance to Mr. Zuma\u2019s spending schemes, including a hugely expensive deal with Russia for nuclear power plants.The A.N.C. is scheduled to elect a new leader at its conference in December, and that person is likely to become the next president when Mr. Zuma\u2019s second, and final, term ends in 2019. The president would evidently like his successor to be Nkosozana Dlamini-Zuma, who was once his wife and who represents a mostly rural faction of the A.N.C. dependent on his patronage. Pushing Mr. Gordhan out and stuffing the government with cronies will make that easier.It is clear that Mr. Zuma will continue in his shameless ways as long as he can. The question is whether the A.N.C. is prepared to continue tolerating him as he shrouds South Africa in corruption and destroys the party that once commanded admiration around the world for its moral standing.Mr. Zuma and his cronies will again claim that they are victims of vindictive Western colonialists. But when tens of thousands of their own countrymen march through the streets, many with \u201cSave South Africa\u201d banners, demanding the president\u2019s ouster, A.N.C. leaders cannot pretend to miss the message.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snarled Commutes, Squabbling Agencies and Amtrak\u2019s Penn Station Responsibilities", "Date": "2017-04-09", "News": "Supported byCommuters from the East End of Long Island to the western edge of New Jersey suffered a transportation meltdown and four days of upheaval last week \u2014 all because of the faulty maintenance of a federal railroad they may never ride.Amtrak accepted blame for the minor train derailment that forced cancellations and disrupted tens of thousands of commuters last week. That admission only exacerbated the frustration of the slogging hordes, reminding them just how deeply the New York City area depends on a network of transit agencies that do not always work as a team.The disruption highlighted an entrenched problem in the New York metropolitan area: The task of moving people around the most congested corner of the United States is divided among several autonomous agencies, each with its own priorities \u2014 and interests that often clash.As a result, in a region where the highways, bridges, tunnels, trains and subways are packed, even a minor accident like the one at Penn Station can reverberate far and wide \u2014 in this case, all the way to Washington.Once a jewel of the nation\u2019s transportation network, Penn Station, North America\u2019s busiest rail terminal, is now the overburdened nexus of two of the country\u2019s biggest commuter railroads and its only viable intercity train service. Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road combine to push and pull half a million people through the station\u2019s aging infrastructure every weekday.But when something breaks, it falls to Amtrak, which owns and operates the station, to perform triage, deciding how to spread the pain among the customers of the three railroads. The agencies must then seek any help they can arrange. Last week, New Jersey Transit enlisted PATH trains, operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and New York Waterway ferries, run by a private company, to carry displaced riders across the Hudson River.The diffuse nature of the transportation system occasionally causes sniping among agencies, which was precisely what happened last week. Both the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit publicly vented about Amtrak. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey went further, threatening to withhold payments to Amtrak and calling for a congressional hearing.\u201cThey\u2019re the landlord,\u201d Mr. Christie said of Amtrak. \u201cThey\u2019re the owner of the rails, and they need to make sure they\u2019re safe for our people to travel on them.\u201dPenn Station\u2019s 21 tracks are chock-full during rush hours, so when several are unavailable, dozens of scheduled trains must be canceled. That was why the derailment of a New Jersey Transit train near the Hudson River on Monday morning, which knocked out eight tracks, was still disrupting the routines of riders from Long Island on Friday.As the traffic controller, Amtrak has to coordinate with the commuter railroads, explaining the effects of an episode like Monday\u2019s derailment, said Charles W. Moorman, the chief executive of Amtrak.\u201cWe then have to go through and say, \u2018O.K., here is the new capacity of the station,\u2019 and then try to allocate it so people understand this is what we can get into the station today,\u201d Mr. Moorman said in an interview.He said Amtrak notified other local and state agencies, too. But the derailment also exposed another complication in the region\u2019s transportation system: While New York City relies on the rail system to carry a sizable portion of its work force, it has little say over how that system operates.\u201cThe city has an enormous vested interest,\u201d said Thomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group that has been calling for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River for over 20 years. \u201cEvery property owner, every employee, every resident in New York has an enormous stake in this system working because the city\u2019s economy depends on it.\u201dThe Partnership for New York City, which represents the interests of the city\u2019s biggest private companies, estimates that it costs Manhattan employers $14.5 million for every hour that train commuters from New Jersey and Long Island are delayed, said its president and chief executive, Kathryn S. Wylde. For some companies, such as Guardian Life, whose headquarters are in Lower Manhattan, more than half their employees travel from New Jersey and Long Island.\u201cPenn Station is a symbol of the failure of America to keep up with the escalating demands on urban public transportation, as cities have become much bigger and more important as global economic hubs,\u201d Ms. Wylde said.She said large employers in New York were frustrated by the exclusion of private investment to help improve the city\u2019s transportation infrastructure.\u201cOur competitor cities in Europe, Asia and Australia generally have modern systems and equipment, largely designed, built and managed through public-private partnerships,\u201d Ms. Wylde said. \u201cThe frustration of the business community is not over which governmental units are running the railroad, but the missed opportunity to tap the private sector to create systems that can measure up to 21st-century expectations.\u201dMr. Wright said the patchwork response to the recent disruptions offered a glimpse of what life in the region might be like if one of the 110-year-old rail tunnels under the Hudson had to shut down. And the question is no longer \u201cif,\u201d but \u201cwhen.\u201dAmtrak officials have warned that the damage to those two single-track tubes from Hurricane Sandy will eventually force Amtrak to close off one for repairs. When that happens, the number of commuter trains crossing the river at peak travel times will decline by 75 percent, a potentially crippling blow to the regional economy, they said.The loss of that many trains would drive commuters to try crossing in buses or cars, on ferries or on PATH. Last week, New York Waterway added boats to its routes out of Hoboken and PATH honored New Jersey Transit passes, the costs to be recouped later from the railroad.The Port Authority said the PATH system, which connects to Manhattan from Hoboken, Jersey City and Newark, carried an additional 55,000 riders per day from Monday through Thursday. That surge of more than 20 percent overwhelmed some PATH station entrances and platforms. At Hoboken Terminal, the police blocked off a main entrance to the PATH station.\u201cIt\u2019s just a nightmare,\u201d Mr. Wright said, after a fourth day of protracted commutes from his New Jersey home. \u201cThis is simply a harbinger of what\u2019s going to be coming more and more. It\u2019s still not what fully would happen if cracks start appearing in the Hudson tunnels.\u201dAnd given the fragmented nature of the region\u2019s transportation network, perhaps the only viable solution is Amtrak\u2019s Gateway project, which would include new rail tunnels between New Jersey and Penn Station. Mr. Wright said the corporation created to manage Gateway should have the power to take private property, override zoning rules and maybe even impose taxes on businesses that would benefit from the project.As a model, he cited the Crossrail project in London, a network of rail tunnels being built by a corporation financed by the British government, the City of London, and taxes and fees assessed on businesses and property owners. After more than 25 years of planning, Crossrail is scheduled to start providing new service this year.But until Gateway is completed \u2014 if it ever is completed \u2014 more than 200,000 daily commuters will continue to rely on Penn Station, its 21 tracks and Amtrak\u2019s stewardship.Mr. Moorman said he believed that Amtrak was the right agency to manage the daily crush at the station.\u201cWe\u2019re the appropriate party to make the right judgments to balance out the needs of everyone else,\u201d Mr. Moorman said.He said he planned to convene officials from all of the agencies that use Penn Station and \u201chammer out\u201d their priorities. \u201cI think we all can and will and should work together,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s in all of our best interests to work together.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind the Comparison of Zuma\u2019s South Africa and Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorJOHANNESBURG \u2014 \u201cHeh, you people, you used to laugh at us. Look at you now. You can\u2019t even buy a bottle of Coke!\u201dIt was the early 2000s, during the economic free-fall that had followed Zimbabwe\u2019s Fast Track Land Reform program, which began 20 years after the country had won its political independence from Ian Smith\u2019s settler colonial regime. My parents were visiting Zambia from South Africa and in the town of Livingstone met a woman who, upon discovering that they were Zimbabwean, could not hide her schadenfreude.She recalled the period in the late 1980s when Zambians had flocked to Zimbabwe to buy basic goods with Zambian bank notes that had lost much of their former value, thanks to hyperinflation and economic instability caused by a series of so-called structural adjustment programs. Zimbabweans, she wanted my parents to know, were not so special, after all \u2014 and now Zimbabwe was doomed to the same downward economic trajectory as Zambia and other post-independence states in Southern Africa.It\u2019s an encounter I have often thought about over the years \u2014 even more so now, in the wake of the widespread protests against President Jacob Zuma in South Africa in response to the recent depreciation of the rand and the downgrading of our economy to junk status. These events were incited by the president\u2019s cabinet reshuffle, in which several key ministers lost their positions, including the finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, who was viewed as an obstacle to accessing state coffers.The official rationale for the reshuffle was that the African National Congress-led government now seeks to carry out a \u201cradical economic transformation.\u201d Though there is not much clarity about what exactly this might entail, the president has hinted at large-scale redistribution of land, an issue over which the A.N.C. has prevaricated for years.The type of political system that emerged out of Southern Africa\u2019s settler colonies was a liberal constitutionalism built on transitional power sharing brokered between \u201cmoderates\u201d from the liberation movements and the settler colonial authorities. A key feature of the historic compromise was that settler representatives handed over political control to the black majority in return for their economic interests being secured by a constitution that enshrined property rights.The foreign policy orientation of these liberal democracies reflected their reliance on Western investment and free-enterprise capitalism. The dominant settler states \u2014 Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa \u2014 all followed this model.Their newly inaugurated governments soon faced the question of whether to reform, or conform to, the historic compromises that had brought them into power. Their answer, by default, was to shelve the issue \u2014 and land restitution was sidelined. In the new economic and social order, the black political elites shifted their focus from the ousting of colonialism to development policies that often overlapped with private wealth accumulation and patronage.In this context, Zimbabwe\u2019s land redistribution program was a Rubicon moment. It struck a belated blow against the enduring economic injustices of colonialism. It also signaled a loss of faith in the ability of liberal constitutionalism to address the structural problems of inequality inherited by the post-independence state.In Zimbabwe, the redistribution of land had been delayed by the 1980 peace settlement, which gave the white landowners 10 years of protection from any restitution measures. By the 1990s, the rule of President Robert Mugabe\u2019s ZANU-PF party was threatened on two fronts. On one hand, organized labor and civil groups were challenging the government\u2019s structural adjustment policies that had precipitated an economic downturn. On the other hand, veterans of the independence war were demanding compensation, including pensions and parcels of land.President Mugabe chose to split the opposition by accusing the independent labor movement of plotting with the British government to bring down the government, while at the same time increasing the compensation awarded to war veterans. The labor activists were labeled \u201csellouts\u201d and \u201cimperialist puppets\u201d; the veterans were celebrated as revolutionary heroes.Zimbabwe offers important lessons on how a post-independence black-majority government can manage, or mismanage, the gap between the strictures of liberal constitutions that entrench the property rights of the white minority and the demands of the black majority to right historical injustices and structural inequalities that disproportionately affect them. One of those lessons would be for opposition movements to resist the temptation to exaggerate the individual role of President Mugabe to the detriment of a focus on social and economic justice.More than anything, Zimbabwe teaches us that if the South African people\u2019s legitimate demands for land and wealth redistribution remain unaddressed for too long in the post-apartheid era, it will take only the right political entrepreneurs to cynically capitalize on a hollow rhetoric of \u201cradical\u201d and \u201crevolutionary\u201d demands to consolidate power in the face of widespread dissent. Like the A.N.C., Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ZANU-PF long prevaricated on these historic issues central to the liberation struggles. It was only when Mr. Mugabe was losing political ground and international credibility that his party appeared to rediscover its revolutionary roots.What we are witnessing now in South Africa is not so much a matter of an exceptional, corrupt president as the surfacing of contradictions that were inherent in the negotiated settlement. The longer these stay unresolved, and subject to cynical manipulation, the worse the consequences could be. What will determine whether South Africa can escape the \u201cZimbabwe complex\u201d is its ability to confront the inequity that was the legacy of the political settlement that ended apartheid.Advertisement"}

He wants to make certain he will die in the place that has become his life\u2019s mission.\u201cThis is where my vocation has taken me and this is where I\u2019m prepared to suffer, just as Jesus Christ taught us to suffer for others,\u201d said Mr. Gallego, as he threw wood onto a stove by his rudimentary bedroom, next to the altar, where he sleeps on a plank without a mattress.Mr. Gallego might be ready to confront death, but some residents here worry about what will happen to his extraordinary project without him. Mr. Gallego has never received a building permit or any public financing, but he has managed to erect a striking landmark in this otherwise nondescript town of 23,000 inhabitants on the outskirts of Madrid.His ambitious undertaking is labeled the \u201cCathedral of Faith\u201d on internet maps, even though it has received no official backing from officials of the Catholic Church. Flanked by two cloisters and crowned by an unfinished 125-foot-tall cupola, it attracts tourists on the weekend, helping lift the local economy.\u201cThis man has built something incredible against all odds and turned it into a symbol of our town,\u201d said Victor Morillo, a resident who can see the cupola from the balcony of his apartment. \u201cThe Town Hall should have done a lot more to help and should certainly not allow anything bad to happen to this cathedral after he dies.\u201dMr. Gallego, however, is unmoved by this kind of support, just as he has been unshaken by past criticism of his project and his own personality, sometimes derided as that of an exalted former monk. He is also unfazed that he has never received any public financing, even in a country that is mostly Catholic and whose infrastructure has been heavily subsidized.\u201cI\u2019ve not been building this to get money or fame, just as I\u2019m not here to listen to people decide whether I\u2019m mad or unique,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fully responsible for my work and I\u2019m not looking for the authorities to have any say.\u201dDespite the lack of permits, no one is talking of tearing the church down, but neither is anyone certain of the project\u2019s long-term future.Encarnaci\u00f3n Mart\u00edn \u00c1lvarez, an official in charge of urban planning here, said the city could not finance Mr. Gallego because of budgetary constraints and had made no plan to guarantee the continuation of the project, whatever its growing importance to the town and its identity.Mr. Gallego was born here in 1925, on the day of the town\u2019s patron saint, the Virgin of Sorrows. At 27, he joined a monastery in the northern province of Soria, but was ordered to leave eight years later, after he caught tuberculosis and risked contaminating the other monks.After recovering in a Madrid hospital, Mr. Gallego returned to his hometown, where he decided to turn a family plot of land into a place of worship, without the blessing of the Catholic Church.He said that his project was an act of faith, motivated in part by his desire to make amends for the desecration he witnessed during the Spanish Civil War. During the war, \u201cI saw the Communists destroy all the churches here, with people laughing and dancing in the ruins,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you believe, you can then also rebuild with your own hands a beautiful new place.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Gallego has put up most of the church himself, without any training as an architect or civil engineer, using recycled material ranging from food tins to misshapen bricks and other leftovers from local factories and construction sites.The capitals of some of the church\u2019s concrete pillars are made from secondhand car tires, painted gray to resemble the color of the concrete used for the pillar. Part of the roofing is still missing, but there are already frescoes on the walls.Mr. Gallego has financed his work by selling family farmland, as well as through donations.He has held religious ceremonies on the premises, but the ground has not been consecrated.\u201cMany members of the institutional church view him as a fanatic who shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously, but I consider him an example for humanity,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Teresa Alonso, a retiree from a nearby town, who visits occasionally and has donated money to help Mr. Gallego. \u201cThey say faith can move mountains, but here we see that faith can also build an incredible cathedral.\u201dMr. Gallego has received some informal support from members of the local clergy. \u201cThere have been complaints about him, but we support him in as far as we can,\u201d said Pedro Luis Jim\u00e9nez Langa, a parish priest in town. \u201cIt\u2019s an exceptional work, and he\u2019s a good man.\u201dWith his health growing more fragile, Mr. Gallego has increasingly relied on friends and volunteers to help with construction. A local entrepreneur offered a crane to lift the cupola, while some admirers have donated religious sculptures and decorations, rather than money.But nothing gets added without Mr. Gallego\u2019s approval, particularly if it jars with the arches and other circular designs that he loves, which are loosely based on the Romanesque style.\u201cThat\u2019s really not going to look good anywhere around here,\u201d Mr. Gallego said, as he studied a blue dove made of raffia given as a donation, but which Mr. Gallego left lying on the floor.While some have wondered about Mr. Gallego\u2019s mental health, his supporters dispute there\u2019s anything unhealthy about his obsession.\u201cDo you really think somebody mad could have built something like this?\u201d said Pablo Cantuel Gallego, a nephew, 64, who has been helping his uncle since he was a child. \u201cThe only problem with my uncle is that he belongs to a different century. He thinks and works like nobody could now imagine doing.\u201dIt is notable that Mr. Gallego\u2019s building is on a street named after Antoni Gaud\u00ed, the architect of Barcelona\u2019s world-famous and unfinished basilica, the Sagrada Famil\u00eda.Gaud\u00ed died in 1926, but other architects have taken over and hope to finish his basilica in 2026, for the centenary of his death. Mr. Gallego, on the other hand, has no timetable and not even a single sketch of his cathedral project. But he does have one trusted assistant, \u00c1ngel L\u00f3pez, who said that he would take over the works when Mr. Gallego died.\u201cThe only plan is made in my head, drawn day by day,\u201d Mr. Gallego said, with a grin that revealed several missing teeth. \u201cBut Jesus Christ is the one who makes the real plans and decides what eventually should happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Vows to Unveil Tax-Cut Plan Next Week, Surprising Staff", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump promised on Friday that he would unveil a \u201cmassive\u201d tax cut for Americans next week, vowing a \u201cbig announcement on Wednesday,\u201d but he revealed no details about what is certain to be an enormously complicated effort to overhaul the nation\u2019s tax code.Mr. Trump offered his tax tease in an interview and again during remarks at the Treasury Department on Friday afternoon as he raced to stack up legislative accomplishments before his 100th day in office at the end of next week.His announcement surprised Capitol Hill and left Mr. Trump\u2019s own Treasury officials speechless as he arrived at the Treasury offices to sign directives to roll back Obama-era tax rules and financial regulations. Earlier in the day, when reporters asked Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, how far away a tax overhaul proposal was, he said he could not give an answer. \u201cTax reform is way too complicated,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump told The Associated Press in the interview that his tax reductions would be \u201cbigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever.\u201d But he faces an enormous fight among clashing vested interests as Congress tries to rewrite the tax code.Starting that fight next week is further complicated by Mr. Trump\u2019s hopes to revive the Republican health care plan that collapsed last month. And it would mean trying a tax overhaul as his White House faces the prospect of a government shutdown if lawmakers cannot agree on a funding bill by April 28.The details of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plans remain the subject of intense speculation, with stock markets regularly gyrating when White House officials discuss the subject. Since taking office, the president has suggested that he wants to enact the deepest cuts to individual and corporate tax rates in history.But despite Mr. Trump\u2019s statement on Friday that his tax overhaul \u201creally formally begins on Wednesday,\u201d White House officials quickly cautioned against high expectations that Mr. Trump would provide the legislative text of a detailed tax plan next week.Instead, a senior administration official said the president would release only the \u201cparameters\u201d that Mr. Trump expected a tax plan to follow in the long congressional debate that would surely follow. Another official said the information released next week would be more like a \u201cbroad\u201d outline. Wall Street, which tends to celebrate tax cuts, barely reacted; the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down 0.3 percent Friday.The administration has maintained that middle-income tax cuts, a simplification of personal income taxes, and making business taxes more competitive with other countries are the top priorities. Mr. Trump insisted that his plans were on track and that his strategy to remake the economy would change history.\u201cThis is really the beginning of a whole new way of life that this country hasn\u2019t seen in many, many years,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he sat at the desk of Mr. Mnuchin, near a portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary.He said, \u201cWe\u2019ve lifted one terrible regulation after another at a record clip from the energy sector to the auto sector.\u201dDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s enthusiasm, the directives he signed at the Treasury Department on Friday to review measures put in place by the Obama administration were largely preliminary. As business groups cheered the moves, some skeptics were left questioning whether Mr. Trump was keeping his campaign promises to give working-class Americans a higher priority than Wall Street bankers.\u201cFrom our perspective, it is a direction that is dramatically backwards on financial stability,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform.The presidential order asks Mr. Mnuchin to review the tax regulations imposed by President Barack Obama in 2016. Those include efforts to clamp down on \u201ccorporate inversions\u201d \u2014 in which American companies merge with foreign companies to take advantage of lower tax rates abroad.Viewed alone, undoing the rules would appear to be at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to reduce incentives for companies to move overseas to minimize taxes.Last year Mr. Obama\u2019s Treasury Department, concerned about Pfizer\u2019s $152 billion bid to acquire Allergan, which makes Botox, issued rules to thwart the practice. Among those efforts were regulations to prevent moves like \u201cearnings-stripping,\u201d in which an American subsidiary borrows from a parent company and uses the interest payments on the loans to offset its earnings. It was intended to make the financial relocations less attractive.The uproar over inversions dogged a number of transactions over the last five years including Burger King\u2019s takeover of the Canadian chain Tim Hortons and the drug maker AbbVie\u2019s planned acquisition of an Irish rival, Shire.But the major target of the outrage was the Pfizer-Allergan deal, by far the biggest effort by a company to give up its American citizenship to cut its taxes. Pfizer executives braced themselves for opposition from the Obama administration \u2014 but were surprised by how aggressively the White House fought the deal. Within a few months, Pfizer and Allergan surrendered and ended their agreement.Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant, said reversing these rules would be a gift to Wall Street bankers and lawyers who have complained that they have hampered international deal making.\u201cThey\u2019ll be dancing in the streets and jumping for joy,\u201d Mr. Willens said.Memorandums with the executive order ask Mr. Mnuchin to review the Orderly Liquidation Authority, a tool created by the Dodd-Frank law of 2010 for unwinding financial institutions that are on the verge of collapse. Many banks have hoped that Congress will repeal the system. The administration is examining whether it encourages excessive risk-taking or exposes taxpayers to potential liabilities.The Treasury is also reviewing the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which designates financial institutions as \u201csystemically important,\u201d better known as \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d It requires them to hold more capital in reserve in the event of financial emergencies.Both provisions, which were part of the Dodd-Frank law, are delayed by a 180-day review by the Treasury.Democrats warned that Mr. Trump was putting vulnerable middle-class Americans in danger. \u201cSimply eliminating these regulations and putting nothing in their place leaves a hole in the tax system that sophisticated corporations will continue to take advantage of, to the detriment of the country,\u201d said David Kamin, a New York University law professor who worked on the Obama administration\u2019s National Economic Council.Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, assailed Mr. Trump for trying to undermine rules that were put in place to protect the economy. \u201cAny actions to undermine these protections encourage Wall Street\u2019s risky behavior and leave taxpayers and our economy exposed to another catastrophe,\u201d he said.Mr. Brown said that Mr. Trump appeared to be breaking a campaign promise by making it easier for companies to use inversions. \u201cWe should be working to lower taxes for hardworking families and workers across Ohio, not helping multimillion-dollar corporations cheat the system to avoid paying their fair share,\u201d he said.Mr. Mnuchin insisted that would not be the case and argued the tax overhaul legislation plan that they would propose will address the problem of companies moving overseas.Mr. Trump has shown an affinity for tariffs. He proposed a \u201creciprocal\u201d tax this month that matches the import taxes other countries impose on American goods.It remains unclear if Mr. Trump is on board with the \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax that is central to the plan being promoted by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and House Republicans. The concept would allow Republicans to raise more than $1 trillion of revenue, making it possible for them pass legislation without adding to the deficit.Mr. Trump has been cool to that plan in interviews, and recently his advisers have been making the case that a surging economy, rather than Mr. Ryan\u2019s border adjustment tax, will pay for deep rate cuts.\u201cThe plan will pay for itself with growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said an Institute for International Finance conference on Thursday.Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team had initially set an August deadline to get tax legislation passed, but that target was delayed to the end of the year after Republicans expended time on their failed health plan.After The Associated Press reported on Mr. Trump\u2019s accelerated timeline to put out their tax plan, Treasury officials who were awaiting Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to their office smiled broadly and chuckled nervously as they digested news on their smartphones.But during his visit, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that Mr. Mnuchin and his team were ready to move on a tax overhaul, a mammoth legislative undertaking that has not occurred since 1986. After a brief tour of the building, Mr. Trump praised his Treasury secretary\u2019s financial acumen and said he was sure that Mr. Mnuchin would be among the best to do the job.\u201cI think Hamilton is tough to beat, but maybe you can do that too,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Glenn Thrush contributed reporting from Washington, and Michael J. de la Merced from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France\u2019s Neither-Nor Election", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPARIS \u2014 For the first time in the history of the last three French republics, the two front-runners in the presidential election deny belonging to the right or the left, or even the center, of the political spectrum.Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Front National, widely known as a far-right party, has tried to rid it of its founder \u2014 her own father, Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2014 for being too extreme. Ms. Le Pen, who according to current polls will win the first round of the election on April 23, faults the outgoing Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, for turning his back on the weak and the underprivileged \u2014 in other words, for abandoning the left\u2019s ideals of social solidarity. In his time Mr. Le Pen instead faulted Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, the first Socialist to be elected under the Fifth Republic in 1981, for his vile and \u201charmful\u201d leftism.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s main opponent, Emmanuel Macron \u2014 who is forecast to make it past the first round of voting with her and then win the second \u2014 has tirelessly repeated that even though he has a social bent, he is principally a progressive and a pragmatist, and favors globalization and finance. A young graduate of the prestigious national school of administration known as l\u2019ENA \u2014 as well as a former investment banker and an adviser to Mr. Hollande, who made him economics minister \u2014 Mr. Macron says he doesn\u2019t belong to the traditional political spectrum either. He refuses to be called left-wing, much less socialist, but balks just as much at being labeled right-wing. Campaign posters for his party, En Marche! (Onward!), tout the slogan \u201cFrance must be a chance for all.\u201dSome, like the former education minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, take this rhetoric to signal the center\u2019s return to the political scene, but Mr. Macron rejects this notion as well. He prefers to cast himself as advocating the renewal of the political class \u2014 which also happens to be one of the Front National\u2019s favorite leitmotifs. But unlike Ms. Le Pen, Mr. Macron is a convinced Europeanist. He believes in the euro. He doesn\u2019t consider immigration to be a calamity. He doesn\u2019t think French identity is in danger, that Islamization threatens French culture or that technology can\u2019t be trusted.Instead of embodying the traditional left-right polarity, the two leading candidates of this election embody a polarity between populism and liberalism, broadly understood.Populism shouldn\u2019t be confused with demagoguery, which is a natural tendency in representative democracies, a temptation to seduce voters rather than convince them. Nor is populism about being in touch with the people. Rather, it is the claim to speak in the people\u2019s place, in their name, and convey an undeniable shared truth on their behalf. In particular, populism claims to express the emotion of a people that feels beleaguered, diminished and lost. Its discourse is nostalgic for past power and wedded to a frantic defense of identity.Whereas anti-Semitism in the 1930s stemmed from anxieties about the disintegration of biological identity, Islamophobia in this century is about the fear that cultural identity is disintegrating. And the struggle against Islamization transcends the left-right divide by appearing to target both the putative successors of the Saracens, who for centuries waged war against Christian Europe (a view that resonates with voters on the right), and Islam itself, which seems to call into question modern scientific knowledge, gender equality, democracy and freedom of expression (a view that resonates with voters on the left).These voters forget their own concrete interests, which might be opposed, in favor of the shared feeling that their culture is under siege. When Ms. Le Pen talks about the poor or the outcast, workers, farmers or small businesses, her target audience is a single people battered by globalization, the European Union, the euro, immigration and Islamization.This fear of a cultural catastrophe dates back about a generation: After years of decolonization, the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 provided Old Europe with more searing proof that it had lost its imperial power. But the populism that feeds on this malaise seems to have culminated with the current presidential election.Mr. Macron\u2019s En Marche! is the first political organization of any scale to oppose this fearful vision, but it does so in ways that also bypass the traditional left-right divide. Instead of invoking nostalgia for the past or trying to comfort an anxious people, Mr. Macron tries to present a positive view of the future, along the way restoring to the word \u201clib\u00e9ralisme\u201d its original meaning, with its broad endorsement of individual liberties.In fact, the right was rather liberal in its economics and reactionary on societal questions like morality and sexuality, whereas the left was liberal on societal issues and statist on economic and social matters.Mr. Macron has broken away from this polarity, offering a version of liberalism that applies down the line, from societal matters to economics.Ms. Le Pen, too, has moved away from the dichotomy, but in her case by being a reactionary on societal issues and a statist on economic and social questions.France isn\u2019t unique in this respect. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is another case in point. Though she is a product of the center-right Christian-Democrat tradition, on societal issues like immigration she hews close to Social-Democrat positions typically considered left-wing. A new ideological debate thus seems to be redefining political discourse in France and elsewhere in the West: between populist movements that are culturally and economically protectionist, and liberals who are open to Europe and globalization. Soon enough the left and the right will be all but vestiges of an already bygone 20th century.Rapha\u00ebl Liogier is a professor at Sciences Po Aix-en-Provence and the Coll\u00e8ge International de Philosophie in Paris, and the author of \u201cLa guerre des civilisations n\u2019aura pas lieu.

She was 86.Her death was confirmed by her daughter Karen Leon.For all the boldface names that she encountered at charity events in the metropolitan area and the gossip that they generated for her column, few celebrities could match the literary grist of her own odyssey through war-torn Europe.Masha Bernstein was born in Warsaw on March 21, 1931, the daughter of Mordechai Bernstein and the former Zelda Goldin. Her father was a journalist. Her mother was a seamstress and later taught Spanish.Masha was only 8 when she and her mother fled Warsaw in the winter of 1939-40, before the ghetto walls went up. (Her father, along with many other men, had escaped earlier.)Hoping to join relatives in Belarus, they were captured by the Germans. The next morning most of their fellow prisoners were shot \u2014 but, apparently randomly, Masha and her mother were released to make their way to Russian-occupied Poland.Along the way they were hidden for three days by a Roman Catholic woman, who told them she was reciprocating for having her life saved by a stranger in World War I. Mother and daughter were then spared execution by a Russian soldier only when he learned that young Masha and his sister shared the same first name. (Masha Leon\u2019s was inspired by a Chekhov character.)In Belarus, they were reunited with Masha\u2019s father, an anti-Communist. But he was soon betrayed by a childhood friend and jailed in Vilnius, Lithuania.When Masha and her mother went to visit him before he was exiled to Siberia, the wife of another prisoner confided that she hoped to smuggle a message to her own husband in a bar of soap. Masha\u2019s mother suggested instead that she embroider the message on a handkerchief.\u201cThe letters were a bit shaky, but they were unmistakably O-L-A,\u201d the other prisoner later recalled in a memoir. \u201cWhat made my wife change the \u2018A,\u2019 the first letter of the abbreviated form of her name (Ala), into an \u2018O\u2019?\u201dHis cellmate, Masha\u2019s father, solved the riddle. The three letters could be transliterated in Hebrew as \u201caliyah\u201d (meaning ascent, but more broadly the return of diaspora Jews to the land of Israel). The prisoner\u2019s wife was escaping to Palestine.\u201cIt was the best day I had had in prison \u2014 and the hardest,\u201d the prisoner wrote. \u201cI had learnt that my wife was leaving for Eretz Israel.\u201d\u201cWhen Masha was a girl,\u201d Mr. Lipsky wrote, \u201cshe and her mother caused to be sent one of the most consequential messages in the history of the Jews.\u201dShe learned of her parents\u2019 role only by reading \u201cWhite Nights,\u201d the memoir in which Mr. Begin recalled sharing a cell with a prisoner named Bernstein.To whatever extent Masha Leon was a historical footnote, her own exodus had barely begun.She and her mother were among the thousands of lucky Jews who received transit visas from Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese vice consul in Lithuania, and got the last two seats on a flight to Moscow and made their way east.In 1941, after living for nearly a year in Japan and attending a French convent school, Masha, with her mother, caught the last American-bound ship before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.After arriving in Seattle, they spent the rest of the war in Canada and were supposed to be repatriated to Poland in 1945. But after Masha wrote a 13-page personal plea to Eleanor Roosevelt, the president\u2019s wife, the American consul granted them visas. They moved to Chicago, then New York, where in 1957 they were finally reunited with Masha\u2019s father, who had been freed from the gulag.She graduated from George Washington High School in Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan and later from Queens College with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Jewish and Yiddish studies.She married Joseph Leon, who died in 2008. In addition to her daughter Karen, who accompanied her as a photographer for the newspaper column, Ms. Leon is survived by two other daughters, Laura Leon and Nina Leon Olney; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.Ms. Leon was running an educational publishing company with her husband when she began writing magazine articles on the side, among them reviews and interviews for the English insert in The Forward. (Among the publications for which Ms. Leon, who survived for days during her European escape on only potatoes, wrote was The Idaho Potato Journal.) When Mr. Lipsky started the English edition of The Forward, he hired her full time.\u201cWhy did The Forward have a society column?\u201d Samuel Norich, the publication\u2019s president, wrote in an email. \u201cTwo reasons: because we had a Masha Leon to write it, and because fund-raising events are a key source of financing for the range of cultural and social welfare causes the Jewish community sponsors here and abroad.\u201dMs. Leon, who received the Knight\u2019s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland in 2011, was still writing for Tablet, a Jewish magazine, just before she died.Given her own remarkable life, she would sometimes evoke her past while interviewing people, Mr. Norich said, \u201cand again and again she\u2019d elicit each person\u2019s Rosebud, each person\u2019s earliest or most revealing or consequential memory.\u201d\u201cFor Masha,\u201d he said, \u201cJewish history was also biography, and often enough autobiography.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the reason a Russian soldier spared Ms. Leon from execution. It was because the soldier\u2019s sister shared her given name, not his daughter.An obituary on Monday about Masha Leon, the longtime society columnist for the Jewish newspaper The Forward, misstated the name of another publication that published her work. It is Tablet, not The Tablet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Somali Pirates Attack, Raising Fears That a Menace Is Back", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Are the pirates back?After years of quiet seas, undisturbed voyages and no major attacks, Somali pirates have waylaid four ships in the past month, raising fears that the pirate menace has returned to the Indian Ocean.A Pakistani-owned cargo vessel carrying food was hijacked off the coast of central Somalia, Somali officials said on Tuesday, just days after an Indian cargo ship was commandeered and dragged to an infamous pirate den.In the past, pirates have hit just about anything that floated: yachts, freighters, dhows, sailboats, mammoth oil tankers \u2014 even an American naval ship, by mistake. But the piracy heydays were thought to be over. Until now, the problem seemed to have disappeared.Analysts said a number of factors had driven the resurgence in piracy, including drought, famine, corruption, a surge of smuggled weapons and the influence of the Islamic State.All of the recent attacks, including a hijacked oil tanker last month, are believed to have been carried out by buccaneers from central Somalia or Puntland, a semiautonomous region in northeastern Somalia.\u201cIn many coastal towns, there is no government presence,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do whatever you want. Pirates and criminal gangs now have space.\u201dPirates are as old as the seas. But the modern-day Somali pirate problem started around 2008, when bands of former fishermen began speeding into Somalia\u2019s waters in busted-up skiffs and leaky dinghies, hijacking whatever crossed their paths. Typically, pirates would scamper aboard a ship at night, rush to the pilothouse and commandeer the vessel at gunpoint. The pirates then sailed back to their lairs along the coast and waited for shipping companies to pay a ransom to free the crew.Often the money literally fell from the sky. Several companies in nearby Kenya specialized in shrink-wrapping million-dollar blocks of cash and delivering them by parachute.As the years passed, the shipping companies wised up. They invested heavily in hiring armed guards, who showed no hesitation at blasting the fiberglass skiffs out of the water.At the same time, a coalition of foreign navies beefed up patrols, sometimes burning a million dollars of fuel each day to go back and forth along Somalia\u2019s craggy coastline, which, at 1,880 miles, is the longest on mainland Africa.Aid organizations also joined the cause, coming up with alternatives for the thousands of young men who had become pirates. Fishery projects were started, along with vocational training. The increased risk and new jobs opportunities drew people \u2014 and financing \u2014 away from the buccaneering business.\u201cHigh officials are involved in this,\u201d said Abdirazak Fartaag, a former Somali government official.He said government officials were most likely colluding with the pirates for a cut of the ransom, which was also the case years ago.\u201cI know the mind-set,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the game that exists in our country.\u201dSomali officials said the Indian cargo ship that was seized last week was now being held for ransom in the El Hur area of central Somalia, south of the Puntland border, a well-known pirate locale. The Pakistani-owned boat carrying food was headed toward the Somali coast, though it was not clear exactly where.\u201cHunger is pushing people into crime,\u201d Mr. Mubarak said. \u201cIt\u2019s making a lot of people look for something.\u201dOther analysts said that more illegal foreign fishing vessels were plying the waters off Somalia\u2019s coast, pestering Somali fishermen and possibly turning some toward violence.At the end of the day, analysts said, Somali piracy is a business decision. Rich merchants in central Somalia and Puntland must have decided that after years of being a money-losing operation, there were riches to made again in high-seas piracy.Hussein Mohamed contributed reporting from Mogadishu, Somalia, and Mohamed Ibrahim from Helsinki, Finland.Advertisement"}

Danny (Callum Turner), who reluctantly helps his mother run a proxy bookie\u2019s office for her fellow Polish immigrants in their New York kitchen, is wheedled by his incarcerated brother into running a (probably) illegal errand. His contact, Ellie (Grace Van Patten), desperate to escape from Pittsburgh, has taken on a job as the driver on this errand, at the behest of a very ineffectual low-level criminal played by Mike Birbiglia. Danny and Ellie\u2019s initially abrasive relationship is exacerbated by Danny\u2019s ineptitude. Soon the two wind up in a very leafy Westchester County, N.Y., in search of a briefcase. In this case, the viewer just knows the two have to end up together.\u201cFor this movie, I really wanted a kind of classical Hollywood romance in terms of beats and structure but also to do it in a way that felt modern and genuine,\u201d Mr. Leon said. \u201cCertainly I was thinking of \u2018It Happened One Night,\u2019 and also movies where the characters are thrown together for a compressed amount of time \u2014 \u2018Broadway Danny Rose\u2019 and, even though it\u2019s not a romance, \u2018Midnight Run.\u2019\u201dThe project still presented several risks for Mr. Leon, who was determined to bring his characters to life onscreen without even considering making creative trade-offs to get financing.Ultimately, Mr. Leon wanted to make the film his way or not at all.\u201cI did not want the movie to get made via compromises for a production company,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to make a movie that would work for an audience, obviously. But I didn\u2019t want to get involved with things like pre-guarantees relative to ceding casting decisions, which are things that many companies will ask for. There were a lot of distributors, including Netflix, who looked at \u2018Tramps\u2019 in script form. And eventually the decision on our end was to get producers on board who would enable me to make it in an uncompromised way.\u201dAfter a good impression in Toronto in September, the selling began, at which point Mr. Leon got a call from one of the film\u2019s producers.\u201c\u2018Oh, no one\u2019s told you? Netflix is going to buy the movie,\u2019\u201d Mr. Leon remembered being told. \u201cThey had come to the table very enthusiastic, and very aggressive, and they\u2019re able to move with the kind of freedom that a lot of theatrical distributors, even notable independent ones, no longer have.\u201d\u201cI did not want \u2018Tramps\u2019 to be subject to a \u2018Let\u2019s put it in a random theater for a week to placate the filmmaker\u2019 approach,\u201d he continued. \u201cI want Netflix to do what Netflix does, which is to put a film out there in a way that will help you find its audience.\u201dBecause the Netflix rights are worldwide, Mr. Leon is freed from the task of taking his movie on the road. \u201cI don\u2019t get to worry myself and micromanage in my head what to do in Spain, or France. That\u2019s fun to do, once. But it takes a lot of time away from whatever movie you\u2019re supposed to be making next.\u201dThe Netflix deal also means that the movie gets shut out of consideration for certain awards. Movies that play only on a streaming service, whether they\u2019ve been produced specifically for that service or not, don\u2019t get to the Oscars. And less than two weeks ago, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences enacted a new rule in the documentary category banning film that originated as multipart or limited series \u2014 that would have shut out this year\u2019s winner, \u201cO.J.: Made in America.\u201d (This kills Oscar chances for the recent, highly praised Netflix-produced documentary \u201cFive Came Back,\u201d even though Netflix had taken the step of showing that film in theaters, probably with Oscar hopes in mind.)Tensions will no doubt rise as higher-profile filmmakers seek freedom via the Netflix route. Unless they don\u2019t: Executives like Mr. Rothman might well be delighted to be rid of potentially high-stress auteurs. But for filmmakers like Mr. Leon, the flexibility of the Netflix option is an artistic lifesaver.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "First-Time Home Buyers Who Did It on Their Own", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byBuying an apartment is a daunting task, particularly in a city like New York where even a shoe box can cost an eye-popping sum. Yet somehow, ordinary New Yorkers still manage to buy their own sliver of the city.And while many buyers are helped along by a trust fund or a timely inheritance, others pull it off completely on their own.For Shawn Reddy and Adrien Dacquel, saving for an apartment meant frugal years in their early 20s. While their friends splurged on dinners out and travel \u2014 or simply struggled to pay the rent \u2014 Mr. Reddy and Mr. Dacquel squirreled away more than half of their incomes for five years. They had the good fortune of a $1,600-a-month, rent-stabilized apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn.The couple also took subways instead of cabs, packed lunches for work and skipped vacations. When Mr. Reddy, 29, a fashion designer, got a signing bonus for a job, he saved every penny. \u201cAnywhere we could cut costs we did because we had our eye on a bigger prize,\u201d said Mr. Dacquel, 28, a graphic designer.That bigger prize turned out to be a one-bedroom in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, that they bought for $659,000 in December 2015. But arriving at homeownership was a long and winding path riddled with setbacks, surprises and disappointments. Along the way, they were outbid, rejected by a co-op board and told they could not borrow as much money as they had anticipated.Theirs is a story not uncommon among first-timers, who can find themselves caught off-guard by an unyielding market.\u201cThere is this myth that New York real estate is just absolutely impossible to buy in,\u201d said Danielle Lurie, an agent at Compass who represents many first-time buyers. \u201cUsually there is something for everybody, within their own budget.\u201dFor years, Mr. Dacquel and Mr. Reddy spent Sunday afternoons at open houses, studying the market. \u201cFor me, it was knowing how much rent was going to the wind,\u201d said Mr. Reddy, who tracked the information he gleaned at these open houses in an Excel spreadsheet.But Mr. Dacquel and Mr. Reddy were young, and with boyish faces, they looked even younger. No one took them seriously. \u201cIt didn\u2019t help that I made a beeline for the snacks,\u201d Mr. Dacquel said. The brokers \u201cthought we were going in there for free food. But we were very serious.\u201dEventually, at an open house in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, they met Ali Clarke, a Corcoran agent who did take them seriously. She asked them to list their top five priorities, a common strategy to help buyers focus. \u201cA lot of first-time buyers don\u2019t really have that in their head yet,\u201d she said.For buyers who do not know what items to put on that list, a good place to start is with your current apartment, for both inspiration and lessons on what to avoid.Ultimately, this list of features \u2014 which can include things like an eat-in kitchen, outdoor space or natural light \u2014 can help a buyer keep a level head in a frenzied market. No elevator? No go. In Mr. Novin\u2019s case, he wanted to stay close to home in an apartment with plenty of light. \u201cWhen you see it, you\u2019ll know it,\u201d he said.Before you even start apartment hunting, you need to know what you can afford. For anyone in need of a mortgage, your lender will answer that question in the form of a preapproval letter. Do not confuse preapproval with prequalification, which, for some baffling reason, sounds like the same thing but is far from it.Prequalification is a rough, back-of-the-envelope estimate of what you could afford based on unverified information you provide a lender.To get preapproved, a mortgage broker or lender looks at your pay stubs, tax returns, debt-to-income ratio and credit report. The lender then provides a letter preapproving you for a maximum loan amount and a maximum purchase price. Without this number, trolling StreetEasy is basically playing house.For Mr. Dacquel, preapproval was a rude awakening. A lifetime saver, he did not have credit cards or car loans. So he had no credit score, which meant no bank would lend to him. \u201cI thought we were done,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d screwed it.\u201dFortunately, Mr. Reddy qualified for a mortgage, but a smaller one, meaning the couple could borrow only up to $560,000, not the $720,000 they had anticipated. This priced them out of many Brooklyn two-bedrooms.Some buyers, however, can afford far more house than they want or need. Just because a bank approves you for a $1 million loan does not mean that you should spend that much on housing.\u201cQualifying for a loan and being able to afford a loan are two very different things,\u201d said Zack Tolmie, a mortgage lender for Citibank. \u201cA bank can only decide what you qualify for, but the borrower has to decide what they can afford.\u201dEarly last year, Shari Wyler, 39, who works in advertising, sat down with an Excel spreadsheet and mapped out her expenses. She tallied items like her cellphone bill, gym membership, utilities and incidentals, and looked for places to cut back. At the time, Ms. Wyler was living in a one-bedroom on the Upper East Side that she rented for $1,850 a month. She\u2019d built up some savings over the eight years she lived there.When her father died in late 2015, he left her a small inheritance, making it possible to look at two-bedrooms and in neighborhoods she previously could not afford. She decided it was time to make a move. \u201cI wanted to become an adult,\u201d she said. But for her, being an adult did not mean giving up her pleasures. \u201cI\u2019m a woman, I like to shop,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bit of wanderlust, I like to travel.\u201dShe came up with a maximum purchase price of $700,000, much less than the $900,000 that the bank had preapproved for her. Armed with this information, she began her search.Sometimes, life pushes you to buy. In the summer of 2015, Nikki Switzer, 38, an actress and finance manager at a boutique gym, was looking for an apartment to rent with her boyfriend, Sean Smith, 34. They were living with a roommate in a run-down, $2,000-a-month three-bedroom in Astoria, Queens. Any two-bedroom in the area would cost them more money for less space.Ms. Switzer and Mr. Smith, however, were in a good position to buy in New York. Ms. Switzer had built up a $40,000 nest egg over the past four years. (She did this after paying off $30,000 in student loans and credit card debt, all while earning $35,000 a year.) Mr. Smith, who works in internet security, also had been putting away money for years, after putting himself through college, and had substantial savings.Ms. Switzer and Mr. Smith plugged their wish list \u2014 a two- or three-bedroom, within an hour of Manhattan, for under $600,000 \u2014 into StreetEasy. Their criteria led them to Jackson Heights, Queens, a neighborhood they did not know. They spent weekends visiting the area, and warmed to it.As for Ms. Wyler of the Upper East Side, it was Manhattan or bust. She had no desire to move back to Brooklyn, where she grew up, and where prices had soared. \u201cOn principle, I wasn\u2019t going to pay that kind of money to move back to Brooklyn,\u201d she said.She honed in on the street, eying a co-op on the corner of Broadway. After she passed on two units in the building, a two-bedroom on the sixth floor came on the market in the spring. In July, she bought it for $570,000 and now pays about $3,000 a month in maintenance and mortgage costs.Shopping for an apartment in New York is a lot like dating. Just because you fall in love does not mean the apartment will love you back. And just like first love, the pain of unrequited love can be particularly acute for first-time buyers. Such buyers are often hunting in a sector of the market (the lower end) where apartments are in high demand, and move fast.\u201cFirst-time buyers, for the most part, tend to be buying in the most competitive market,\u201d said Ms. Lurie of Compass. They \u201ctend to be up against the bidding wars and up against the highest and best competition, and they often don\u2019t have all cash.\u201dSellers often favor buyers who can pay cash because the sale will not be contingent on a buyer getting a mortgage, which takes time and does not always work out.Rejection, even by an inanimate object, hurts. \u201cI definitely cried. I definitely hung up the phone and threw it across my office,\u201d Ms. Switzer said of the second apartment she lost in a bidding war. She and Mr. Smith ultimately prevailed, buying a two-bedroom in Jackson Heights last August for $495,000, putting 40 percent down. They now pay only $18 more each month than what they used to pay in rent, internet and utilities. \u201cThis was just the place where we\u2019re supposed to be,\u201d she said.In May 2015, Mr. Reddy and Mr. Dacquel were rejected by a co-op board in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, after the couple won a bidding war. The board did not like that Mr. Dacquel had worked as a freelancer. \u201cWe were shocked, we were furious,\u201d Mr. Reddy said.\u201cAfter that, we learned not to tell anybody anything until we closed,\u201d Mr. Dacquel said.Some love stories, however, do work out.Mr. Novin of the Upper West Side knew he had found his home the moment he walked in the door of a one-bedroom on West 72nd Street and West End Avenue, just blocks from his beloved rent-stabilized apartment. \u201cMy heart skipped a beat,\u201d he said of the corner unit with high ceilings, and windows on two sides. \u201cIt\u2019s just perfect. It\u2019s just absolutely perfect.\u201d He bought it in June for $790,000.And in September 2015, Mr. Dacquel and Mr. Reddy walked into an apartment in a converted shoe factory. They found a large open one-bedroom that needed work but had high ceilings, natural light and a wraparound balcony. \u201cOur eyes lit up,\u201d Mr. Reddy said.After factoring in the $60,000 they would need to spend on renovations, the couple offered the asking price, $659,000, with 23 percent down to qualify for an adjustable-rate mortgage, since their debt-to-income ratio was too high to qualify for a traditional 30-year loan. With no other bids, their offer was accepted.\u201cThey say, when you find a home, it\u2019s like finding a dog \u2014 you know it,\u201d Mr. Dacquel said. \u201cWhen we walked into this apartment, it was a done deal. If we had lost it, I would have been destroyed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the amended law contains a provision that would most likely restrict the independence of universities that offer diplomas from countries where they do not have a campus or offer courses \u2014 a provision that would affect only Central European University.In his weekly interview on state radio on Friday, Mr. Orban said that Central European University\u2019s status, which allowed it to operate in Hungary while issuing American degrees, gave it an unfair advantage over Hungarian counterparts.He called the way the university operated a \u201cfraud,\u201d adding that \u201cin Hungary, one cannot be above the law \u2014 even if you\u2019re a billionaire,\u201d a clear reference to Mr. Soros.The amendment was fast-tracked through Parliament on Tuesday.

And then we\u2019ve got to wrestle with what to do about people who have been here a long time.\u201dOn Sunday, Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, and Reince Priebus, the president\u2019s chief of staff, said they were confident that the Republican-controlled Congress would approve the president\u2019s plan.\u201cNo one foresees or wants a shutdown next week,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d When pressed on whether Mr. Trump would accept a budget that did not include money for the border wall, Mr. Mulvaney said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet.\u201dMr. Priebus, appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be enough for us to move forward through the end of September for us to get going on the wall.\u201dWhen asked whether he believed that the federal government would remain open past this week, Mr. Priebus said, \u201cI believe it will.\u201dLater on Sunday, after those interviews, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that \u201cDemocrats don\u2019t want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS-13 gang members.\u201dIn another message posted a few minutes later, he wrote, \u201cEventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.\u201dThere were recriminations on Sunday from allies of Mr. Trump. When some congressional Republicans balked at supporting health care legislation the president supported, he deployed Mr. Mulvaney to threaten several of them with primary opponents.\u201cI think that those kinds of threats are counterproductive,\u201d Mr. Sanford said. \u201cIt all, I guess, fits in love, war and politics.

{"Headline": "Rebuilding a Broadway Theater With American Voices", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byIn a move that promises to bring a more diverse mix of voices to Broadway, a nonprofit theater company announced on Thursday that it had commissioned work from nine critically acclaimed playwrights, part of its pledge to present living American writers on New York\u2019s most prestigious stages.Ms. Rothman said her theater is supporting new works by the nine playwrights \u2014 seven of them women, three of them African-American, and one of them Asian-American \u2014 with the intention of bringing the shows to Broadway. Six of the works will have initial productions in Los Angeles, at the Center Theater Group, under an unusual collaboration intended to smooth the developmental journey for American playwrights.Broadway has become a difficult landscape for American writers creating new plays, chiefly because of the high cost of producing shows there. The heavy percentage of tourists in the overall audience means that theater owners and producers lean toward razzle-dazzle musicals and classic revivals with a better shot at becoming profitable. Even nonprofit theaters on Broadway \u2014 and six of the 41 houses are now run by nonprofits \u2014 often, although not exclusively, mount large musicals and starry revivals.But Second Stage has a rare opportunity to try something different because the theater it bought \u2014 the Helen Hayes \u2014 has only 585 seats, which is quite small for Broadway, and which can be partly filled with the nonprofit\u2019s subscribers rather than relying heavily on tourists. The $22 million theater renovation, by the architect David Rockwell, is being financed as part of a $64 million fund-raising drive by the theater, which has raised 76 percent of that goal thus far.Broadway productions matter to playwrights not just because of the prestige \u2014 only Broadway shows are eligible for Tony Awards \u2014 but also because work presented there is often staged around the country and the world. Lynn Nottage, who has won two Pulitzer Prizes, for \u201cSweat\u201d and for \u201cRuined,\u201d and is one of the writers commissioned by Second Stage, said the endeavor will open doors to female and minority playwrights, who are underrepresented on Broadway.\u201cOne of the major obstacles that we had to getting to Broadway is economics, and this tears down that barrier for us,\u201d she said. \u201cCommercial producers are more frightened of plays that are topical or political or a little dangerous, and Second Stage is not going to have those same kinds of constrictions.\u201d\u201cOn the one hand, that\u2019s great, but it\u2019s also like, \u2018Oh, why hasn\u2019t there been another Asian-American female on Broadway?\u2019\u201d Ms. Lee said.But the most potentially game-changing aspect of the Second Stage plan is its effort to create a pipeline to Broadway for living American writers. Other nonprofits routinely commission plays by many of the same people, and only sometimes those works transfer to Broadway. The Second Stage initiative is unusual in creating an explicit pathway to Broadway, with a preliminary production elsewhere and then, if all goes well, a transfer to the Helen Hayes.The theater has not only underwritten work from nine well-regarded writers (six of whom have previously worked on Broadway), but it has negotiated partnerships with three other entities to jointly commission and help develop those works before Broadway.Center Theater Group also announced Thursday separate partnerships with the Goodman Theater in Chicago, and the National and Royal Court theaters in London, to commission new works that would have multiple productions.\u201cI will get a wider variety and a greater quality and quantity of good plays for my audience,\u201d said Michael Ritchie, the artistic director of the Los Angeles theater.Second Stage also announced Thursday that it would present a production of \u201cMary Page Marlowe,\u201d by Tracy Letts, in its existing Off Broadway theater next June.The announcement, made from the stage of the Helen Hayes by theater officials and playwrights in hard hats, had a bit of unanticipated drama: During the news conference, a construction worker\u2019s tape measure dropped from the overhead fly space, whizzing by the playwrights in hard hats and crashing to the floor with an alarming thwack. Ms. Vogel, a bit of a wag, shouted up into the air, \u201cAim better!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Organization Drops Plans for Dallas Hotel With \u2018Turkish Trump\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-13", "News": "Supported byThe Trump Organization said on Thursday it had rejected a proposed Dallas hotel project with a real estate firm that had attracted scrutiny for its vast foreign ties to Russia, Kazakhstan and at least two dozen other countries.The firm, Alterra Worldwide, was the only publicly identified potential partner in the Trump Organization\u2019s domestic hotel expansion plans. Alterra\u2019s president, Mukemmel Sarimsakci, who was born in Turkey and calls himself the \u201cTurkish Trump,\u201d planned to buy property in downtown Dallas on which the hotel was to be built.The Trump Organization said that in addition to having questions about the firm\u2019s sprawling foreign ties, it objected to Mr. Sarimsakci\u2019s prematurely publicizing the hotel plans in the news media when there was no final agreement.\u201cWe clearly retreated from this particular deal,\u201d Eric Danziger, the head of the Trump Organization\u2019s hotel division, said on Thursday.Of Mr. Sarimsakci, who did not respond to requests for comment, Mr. Danziger said, \u201cwe wish him well.\u201dThe unraveling of the proposed Alterra deal demonstrates the complexities facing the Trump Organization as it seeks to expand the reach of the family business while its founder occupies the White House. The process of choosing suitable business partners is saddled with political and ethical considerations, including the possibility of foreign entanglements and conflicts of interest.The Times also reported that Mr. Sarimsakci\u2019s brother and business partner, Yusuf Sarimsakci, had helped oversee the development of the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow near the Kremlin, and had worked with an array of companies shrouded in corporate secrecy and based in tax havens like the British Virgin Islands. Yusuf Sarimsakci was not accused of any wrongdoing.Last year, the Trump Organization, now largely run by President Trump\u2019s eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., began pursuing a deal with Alterra and seeking agreements with dozens of other partners across the country for its new Scion hotel brand, a less-expensive alternative to its five-star line.The potential pairing with Alterra became an early test of the Trump Organization\u2019s process for approving deals while Mr. Trump is in the White House.To manage ethical concerns, the company has hired an outside adviser to review potential agreements and has also vowed to forgo new deals abroad to limit possible conflicts of interest.If the company had moved ahead with an Alterra partnership, however, it was poised to essentially import those international connections. The ethics adviser, Bobby Burchfield, raised questions about the potential sources of financing and about Yusuf Sarimsakci\u2019s ties to Russia, according to a person briefed on the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.In response, Mukemmel Sarimsakci said that his brother would not be involved in the hotel project and that the money for it would come primarily from domestic sources. But before those claims could be verified, Trump Organization executives decided not to move ahead with an agreement.The decision came down to a number of factors, according to Mr. Danziger, who said that the company\u2019s other potential deals in the Dallas area were more attractive. He took particular issue with Mr. Sarimsakci\u2019s decision to publicly promote his possible partnership with the Trumps.The other potential Scion deals being considered in the Dallas region, Mr. Danziger said, would \u201cundergo the same rigorous process for approval.\u201dThe potential Alterra partnership was one of many Scion deals in the works for the Trump Organization. The Trumps plan to manage the properties while their partners own and develop them.Mr. Danziger said last month that the Trump Organization had signed at least 30 letters of intent with developers, including Alterra, but that none of the deals had been finalized. He singled out the Dallas market as a particularly good fit for the Scion brand.But he cautioned that up to half the deals might not come to fruition.The company\u2019s experience with Alterra highlights the way that some cities may not be particularly welcoming to the Trumps\u2019 business plans. Before it ever got off the ground, the Scion venture in Dallas was met by protesters and by reluctance on the part of some city officials, including Philip Kingston, a Democratic member of the City Council. Mr. Kingston said he had advised Mr. Sarimsakci, \u201cThe president is a bad brand.\u201dAccording to Mr. Kingston, Mr. Sarimsakci told him and another council member opposed to the Trump Organization\u2019s interest in Dallas that Alterra had split with the Trumps because of local opposition. Mr. Kingston said that Mr. Sarimsakci planned to move ahead with a different hotel operator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Real Estate Boom, Powered by Pot", "Date": "2017-04-01", "News": "Supported byLegalized marijuana has already upset societal norms, created a large legal gray area and generated a lucrative source of tax revenue. Now it is upending the real estate market, too.In the more than two dozen states that have moved to legalize pot, factories, warehouses and self-storage facilities are being repurposed for the cultivation and processing of potent marijuana plants and products. Suburban strip malls and Beaux-Arts buildings have been reimagined as storefronts selling pre-rolled joints and edibles.And because the marijuana business comes with added baggage, landlords and property owners are charging a premium for new tenants working in the cannabis business. In Quincy, Ermont is paying above market rate for the previously dilapidated 36,000-square-foot building.\u201cThe landlord knew he was sitting on a gold mine,\u201d said Zach Harvey, one of Ermont\u2019s financial backers.Wall Street is even cashing in. A few months ago, a real estate investment trust focused on leasing out warehouse space to growers started trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\u201cThis is a new segment of the industrial real estate market that is being created in front of our eyes,\u201d said George M. Stone, a longtime real estate executive now focused on the pot business. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge industry and only getting bigger.\u201dYet there are simmering concerns that a new real estate bubble might be forming. Right now, millions of dollars are being spent to make old warehouses suitable for cannabis cultivation. Warehouses are in vogue for a variety of reasons: They are big enough to hold thousands of plants, can accommodate the needed climate controls, and are private and relatively easy to secure. What is more, because it is still illegal to transport marijuana across state lines, pot must be grown in the state where it is sold.But as the industry matures, many executives believe that tenants and investors spending big money on such projects could soon find themselves underwater. Ultimately, the theory goes, growers are likely to turn to less expensive greenhouses. And if federal regulations about the transportation of marijuana loosen, dispensaries in Boston could soon sell buds grown in California greenhouses.There is also a lingering threat that the federal government, which still classifies marijuana as an illegal substance, could crack down on the burgeoning industry. The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has already expressed his disdain for the legalization movement.But for now, those concerns are being tossed aside for what looks like a can\u2019t-lose opportunity for everyone involved: Building owners can charge above market rates, real estate groups can profit by subleasing to growers, and growers can make enough money to afford the steep rents.So far, the uptick in property prices from the marijuana business is concentrated in some of the states that have legalized medical and recreational use. And in some places, the industry is only getting started because voters made their decision just a few months ago.Maine\u2019s law allowing recreational cannabis use took effect in January. Factories and warehouses near Portland that once produced and stored parts for model homes, steel beams and tires are already filled with budding marijuana plants. \u201cThese are factories that were sitting empty,\u201d said Drew Sigfridson, a local broker with the Boulos Company.In California, a state that approved medical marijuana in 1996 and recreational use in November, greenhouses in Monterey County that once produced roses and tulips now grow marijuana plants with names like Grape Ape and Buddha\u2019s Sister. Chuck Allen, a commercial broker with Keller Williams Realty who works in Monterey, said that in the last few years, more than 20 major transactions worth roughly $100 million have closed, and prices are on the rise.\u201cLast year, you\u2019d have paid about $2.5 million for a 10-acre parcel with greenhouses,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, you\u2019d pay $5 million.\u201dAnd in Quincy, Ermont is paying a premium for its unglamorous space. Ermont took over the building in 2014, though it began selling marijuana to the public only late last year. Before opening its doors, Ermont paid rent on the warehouse for two and a half years.During that time, Ermont gutted the building, spending about $4 million installing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, as well as lighting, gas and insulation. Walls were torn down, and the floor plan was reconfigured to accommodate several large grow rooms, a retail space and a laboratory straight out of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d where in-house scientists distill potent cannabis oils.\u201cIt was a full renovation, including the roof and resurfacing the outside,\u201d said Scottie Gordon, Ermont\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWe knew it was going to be very expensive. This wasn\u2019t just another greenhouse.\u201dThe impact on the local real estate market has been equally big.From 2009 to 2014, 36 percent of new industrial tenants were marijuana businesses, according to the report on the city from CBRE Research, a commercial real estate company. Nearly four million square feet of industrial space was being used for cultivation in 2015, according to the report, about 3 percent of the city\u2019s warehouse space. Warehouse vacancy rates in Denver fell to just 3.7 percent in 2015, down from 7.5 percent in 2010.The industry has taken especially deep root among the low-slung warehouses in north Denver. Buildings used for growing marijuana are easy to spot \u2014 many are distinguished by extra lights and security cameras. But \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to point it out,\u201d said Brian Vicente, a partner at Vicente Sederberg, a Denver law firm that specializes in marijuana issues. \u201cYou can smell it.\u201dRetail spaces are just as hot. By 2015, there were upward of 200 marijuana stores in Denver, occupying high-end storefronts and former gas stations.The spike in demand has been good for landlords, who often charge two to three times market rates for spaces used for cultivation or sales.\u201cIt\u2019s a tax these guys are used to paying because it\u2019s still federally illegal,\u201d Mr. Vicente said.Denver\u2019s boom stands out, and marijuana has become such big business that an abundance of supply is starting to bring down retail prices, which could ultimately bring down real estate prices.But Denver is certainly not alone. The growth has become widespread enough, and with generous enough profits, to attract some of the country\u2019s most prominent real estate investors.The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange last year and is valued at roughly $60 million, down about 10 percent since it began trading. \u201cWe\u2019re really the first cannabis-related I.P.O.,\u201d Mr. Gold said.The largest property in Mr. Gold\u2019s portfolio is a 127,000-square-foot facility \u2014 a space more than twice as large as the White House \u2014 outside New York City. The building can handle both a large-scale growing operation and facilities to refine marijuana buds into edible products, and Mr. Gold is planning to open similar sites around the country.\u201cIt\u2019s a way for us to invest in this industry on a national basis,\u201d he said.Other entrepreneurs are following suit. Mr. Stone was an executive with the Witkoff Group, the real estate investment company that bought the Woolworth Building in 1988. Today he is chief executive of Kalyx Development, a private real estate investment trust focused on the pot business.Kalyx owns nine buildings in four states, including what was once a disk drive manufacturing facility in Eugene, Ore. Mr. Stone said he planned to expand into three or four more states this year, driven largely by demand from investors who want to put money to work.\u201cThere\u2019s capital that is starting to stack up on the sidelines,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for how to participate, and they\u2019re looking for institutional-grade projects.\u201dInnovative Industrial Properties, Kalyx and other similar groups are following the same strategy: buy buildings, retrofit them and lease them to commercial or medical marijuana growers. But it can often cost millions to turn a vacant warehouse into a facility suitable for cannabis cultivation.Rob Lally, who once owned strip malls and shopping centers but is now courting marijuana tenants with Commerce Real Estate, is converting a former tool factory in Leicester, Mass., into a cultivation center. He expects to spend $3 million to $4 million on the project, a sum that will take years to recoup.That big capital outlay is just one of the risks associated with the booming marijuana real estate business. Electricity costs alone can be budget-breaking, as plants need powerful lights to flourish. Some owners also face expensive battles with mold and other related wear and tear, as the warehouses were not conceived as places for a very humid environment.Add to that financial mix the fact that in mature markets like Denver, the retail price of marijuana is coming down as supply outstrips demand.\u201cThe price will come down so low that they\u2019ll have a hard time justifying paying $10,000 a month just for lighting,\u201d Mr. Vicente said. \u201cThat warehouse that you spent $10 million renovating is only going to be valuable for so long.\u201dFinally, there is the elephant in the room: the question about pot\u2019s legal status.While more than half the states have voted to legalize marijuana in some way, it is still illegal at the federal level. As a result, the entire business of legal marijuana \u2014 already worth billions of dollars a year \u2014 is predicated on the assumption that the federal government won\u2019t enforce its own laws.The legal gray area has already left financing projects challenging. Because the federal government considers marijuana illegal, most banks won\u2019t provide mortgages to buildings used by the industry. When Ermont took over its space in Quincy, it had to pay for the cost of the building owner to refinance with a local bank that would assume the risk.Any stricter enforcement of the laws by the federal government could put the real estate investments into immediate trouble. But even a move to legalize marijuana at the federal level would vastly change the economics. It could allow interstate commerce, meaning that marijuana grown relatively cheaply outdoors in California could be shipped to Massachusetts, where growing is far more expensive, potentially putting the East Coast producers out of business.Nevertheless, investors are pressing ahead with ambitious plans to grow ever more marijuana, wherever they can.The opportunity is just too big to ignore.On a chilly Wednesday in Quincy, the line was out the door, stretching into the parking lot of the industrial park. After being open for just two hours, Ermont had already sold $10,000 worth of products. Patients were lining up to buy pungent buds, as well as cannabis-infused olive oil, peanut butter and honey. Soon the dispensary will offer a deodorant that can get you high.Today Ermont uses just about half of its retrofitted warehouse. But demand is so strong, the company expects it will soon take over the rest of the space to grow and process more plants.Inside, skylights and tall arched windows flood the former lobby with sunlight. Gilded Corinthian columns reach up to a domed turquoise ceiling. Where bank tellers once handed out cash, employees now hand over buds of Tangerine Haze and Master Kush.The decision to lease the former bank wasn\u2019t cheap for NETA. The group entered into a lease years ago and paid rent while it sat empty.\u201cThe holding costs there were significant,\u201d said Norton Arbelaez, director of government affairs for NETA. But, Mr. Arbelaez said, \u201cwe wanted to take this industry out of the shadows,\u201d and a flashy retail space was one way to make that happen.So far, it seems to be working. On a busy day, NETA can sell marijuana buds, pre-rolled joints and cannabis-infused chocolates worth as much as $100,000.That is more than enough to keep the lights on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans\u2019 Fiscal Discipline Wilts in Face of Trump\u2019s Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 From an office high above Manhattan, the billionaire Peter G. Peterson has warned for years that the federal government is borrowing too much money. So have other Republican grandees, like former Senator Alan K. Simpson, who made dire predictions about the federal debt in a 2010 report. Republicans in Congress have been eager to sing from the same hymnal so long as a Democrat was in the White House.But when Republicans take charge, their fiscal rectitude sometimes starts to waver. The broad Republican support this week for President Trump\u2019s plan to sharply reduce taxes suggests that those who hang on to austere concerns about debt will now be facing former allies who want to chase economic growth.Some Republicans are rallying around the idea that less taxation is more important than less debt, just as they did during the Republican presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. That shift is a break with the die-hard hawks of the anti-deficit industrial complex, who have long warned of calamitous consequences to the American economy.\u201cThis is about math, not mystery and magic,\u201d said Mr. Simpson, who was a chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s bipartisan commission on the federal debt in 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s madness to think that you can have a tax cut without some reduction in spending or some increase in revenue.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s proposal, while short on details, calls for cutting taxes on corporations and individuals, including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and doubling the size of the standard deduction for individuals. Analysts estimated that it could add as much as $7 trillion over a decade to the federal debt, depending on what Congress eventually packs into a tax bill.That is particularly notable because the debt has already increased sharply over the last decade, growing from 34.8 percent of the nation\u2019s annual economic output at the end of 2006 to 76.5 percent at the end of 2016. Prominent figures like Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and a Democrat, have urged lawmakers to curb that growth.The prospect that the debt might balloon again instead is stirring anxieties within a range of well-financed groups that have long regarded Republicans as their natural allies.\u201cRight now, we are all about trying to figure out how to offset the cost of this framework and coming up with pro-growth tax reform ideas that won\u2019t worsen our really dire fiscal situation,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cIf the president pursues this proposal of seeing through the largest-ever tax cut rather than reform, he will also be the president who oversees the largest expansion of our country\u2019s debt \u2014 and that\u2019s probably not the legacy he\u2019s looking for.\u201dMs. MacGuineas said that her group had already started pulling together specific proposals to make the tax legislation less costly. The White House plan, for example, has thus far only made passing reference to proposals for closing loopholes and broadening the tax base, she said.\u201cIt will be all hands on deck to try to come up with ideas,\u201d Ms. MacGuineas said.Mr. Peterson created the Peterson Foundation in 2008, with an endowment of $1 billion, to raise public awareness of what he saw as an alarming increase in federal borrowing. The federal debt increased sharply during the early years of the Obama administration, largely because of programs that automatically disburse more money during economic downturns. When unemployment increases, so does federal spending on unemployment benefits.Michael A. Peterson, the chief executive of the foundation and the son of its founder, warned lawmakers against forgetting that the nation is already deeply in debt.\u201cReforming taxes in a way that worsens our fiscal condition is counterproductive because adding to our national debt hurts economic growth,\u201d he said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cTax changes that increase the deficit would harm the economy by raising interest costs, reducing wages and crowding out public and private investments in our future.\u201dConservative lawmakers, advised by conservative economists, once regarded government debt as a public health problem. The government is borrowing money that might otherwise be available to private businesses, which is bad for economic growth. The money must be repaid eventually, which requires higher taxes, which is also bad for economic growth. And higher debt leaves less room for government borrowing during a genuine emergency.But Reagan, advised by economists like Milton Friedman, argued that taxation was a more important economic problem, and Republicans began to prioritize tax cuts.This was, at the least, very good politics. President George H. W. Bush was not re-elected in 1992 in part because he did not join the revolution. He continued to advocate fiscal rectitude, famously agreeing to raise taxes because he wanted to reduce the federal debt. His son did not repeat that mistake during his presidency, and passed a tax cut.The nation\u2019s financial situation was markedly different in 2001. The government was running a hefty annual surplus; it was actually on course to pay off its debts completely.Democrats have been quick to accuse Republicans of ideological inconsistency. \u201cThe Republican plan is just steeped in hypocrisy,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said Thursday.\u201cFor the last eight years, all we heard from our Republican colleagues was that Obama was raising the deficit, and we need to cut programs that benefit the poor and middle class,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cAll of a sudden, now, with a Republican president and a proposed tax cut for the wealthy, we\u2019re hearing from the other side of the aisle, \u2018Deficits don\u2019t matter.\u2019\u201dWant to know how the proposed tax plan will affect you? Answer these questions to find out.Others still hold the view that deficits matter. Josh Gordon, the policy director of the Concord Coalition, another group that advocates fiscal discipline, said it was heartening that Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, have expressed a commitment to changes that are \u201crevenue neutral.\u201dRepresentative Peter Roskam, the Illinois Republican who is chairman of the Tax Policy Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee, warned that his party should resist taking the easy route and passing temporary tax cuts in favor of making deeper changes to the tax code.\u201cThe best thing to do is to create a tax policy that\u2019s permanent, and permanent means paid for,\u201d Mr. Roskam told MSNBC on Wednesday. \u201cSo that\u2019s the new fault line that is developing.\u201dBut some Republicans see an important difference between deficits caused by more spending and deficits caused by tax cuts. They insist that tax cuts will encourage economic growth sufficient to compensate for lower rates. The government will get a smaller piece of a larger pie.Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said that he was committed to balancing the federal budget and that tax cuts could help achieve that goal. \u201cI\u2019m a supply-sider. I recognize the dynamic value of the nature of some tax cuts,\u201d Mr. Flake said. \u201cNot all tax cuts are created equally. Corporate tax cuts should be very stimulative.\u201dRepresentative Dave Brat, Republican of Virginia, who spent most of his career as an economics professor, said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come clean with people that this is not optimal, but tax cuts are a way to drive productivity.\u201d The pain of a short-term increase to deficits, he said, was pain worth enduring for the sake of growth.\u201cThe one thing you make an exception for is tax cuts.\u201dMatt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Track Flaws Are Focus of Penn Station Derailment Inquiry, Official Says", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byIt is the question on the minds of many in the New York City area: Why is a relatively minor train derailment still wreaking havoc on my commute?Officials at Amtrak, which owns Penn Station, said they were working to repair damage caused by the derailment but warned that service might not be fully restored until Friday.Minor train derailments are not uncommon, but this one occurred at one of the worst possible spots: a switch point where multiple tracks connect and space for workers making repairs is tight.So far, the investigation into the derailment has focused on the condition of the tracks, rather than on human error or mechanical problems with the train, according to an official in New Jersey who was briefed on the inquiry but who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The infrastructure damage caused by the derailment was extensive, totaling more than $1 million, the official said.On Wednesday, Scot Naparstek, Amtrak\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview that the investigation was continuing and that he did not want to draw conclusions about what had caused the derailment. He apologized again to the thousands of passengers inconvenienced by the accident.\u201cWe are committed to doing everything we can to make the fixes we need to do and make sure we\u2019re maintaining the station correctly,\u201d he said.In a subsequent statement, Charles W. Moorman, Amtrak\u2019s president, said the railroad had asked the Federal Railroad Administration, which is also investigating the derailment, to join in a \u201cthorough review of infrastructure at Penn Station to evaluate current conditions.\u201dThe derailment on Monday was the second in the same area at Penn Station in less than two weeks. Amtrak officials have not identified the cause of the earlier accident either but said the two episodes did not appear to be related.Even a small hiccup can prompt a cascade of delays across the three railroads that use Penn Station: Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road. Such delays force more commuters onto already crowded buses and clogged roadways.On Wednesday, officials at New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road blamed Amtrak for the commuting mess and urged officials there to work quickly to restore normal service.Steven Santoro, New Jersey Transit\u2019s executive director, said at a news conference that Amtrak had to be at fault because his agency\u2019s investigation of the cars involved showed that their safety inspections were up to date. \u201cThe bottom-line message is Amtrak needs to step up to the plate,\u201d he said.What began as a minor train malfunction has stymied hundreds of thousands of commuters on four major transit systems in the Northeast.Transit advocates have long called for a new tunnel under the Hudson River and additional train tracks near Penn Station to provide more reliable service.\u201cThe sad truth is this was all very foreseeable,\u201d said Thomas K. Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association.Beginning in the 1990s, New Jersey Transit undertook major improvements to its rail network to make it easier for commuters to get into Manhattan. A ridership boom followed. Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road have also seen their ridership grow.\u201cThis all relied on the assumption that at the end of the day, capacity under the Hudson River would be increased to handle this growth, and it hasn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Wright said.In the derailment on Monday, three middle cars of a slow-moving train jumped the tracks. Railroad administration officials have expressed concern about the two recent episodes and are working with Amtrak and New Jersey Transit to improve safety and limit future disruptions.Railroad experts said minor derailments were often caused by track flaws.\u201cIn general, many times it\u2019s a track problem,\u201d said James E. Hall, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cIn this case, at a low speed inside the terminal, it\u2019s very difficult to know without a full investigation.\u201dAugustine F. Ubaldi, a railroad engineering expert who is not involved in the inquiry, said several problems related to the tracks could be to blame, including a possible widening of the gap between the two rails that form a track. As rails push apart, each train car passing above may be affected differently, he said.\u201cIt could be the first car got across it, and the next couple of cars didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce that one car goes off the tracks, then the other cars will follow.\u201dAs for why repairs were taking so long, officials said the derailment happened at a delicate interchange near the Hudson River tunnel where trains arriving from New Jersey navigate to their assigned platforms at Penn Station.The derailed train first had to be put back on the tracks and removed from the scene. Workers then had to make repairs to damaged equipment on the tracks while trains passed nearby, Mr. Naparstek said. Energized power lines overhead posed another challenge.\u201cSpace becomes our largest constraint,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just throw more people at it; there\u2019s not enough space to work safely.\u201dThe repairs required the use of a crane to remove and replace a damaged switch, he added. Vacuum trucks cleaned out ballast. Timber ties also had to be replaced.\u201cOur plan is to work around the clock until we have the repairs done,\u201d Mr. Naparstek said. \u201cWe are forecasting at this point that we hope to be back at full capacity at the station by Friday.\u201dNate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Marine Le Pen May Get a Lift From an Unlikely Source: The Far Left", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The far-right leader Marine Le Pen faces an uphill battle in France\u2019s presidential runoff, less than two weeks away. But she saw daylight through a small window on Tuesday, and from an unlikely source: her defeated counterpart on the far left.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s critics say his obstinacy is petulant, wounded pride that can only help Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front. But it also speaks to the passions that Mr. Macron, a seemingly mild-mannered centrist, provokes in large parts of the French electorate, far left and far right, who share a view of the 39-year-old former investment banker as a fire-breathing incarnation of evil market culture.As populism and anger over the impacts of globalization energize much of the electorate, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s stand has added a new element of uncertainty into the final round of voting on May 7.It has also set off a dynamic in the French race much like when Hillary Clinton defeated Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primaries last year \u2014 leaving his supporters, still in the thrall of populism, up for grabs as party allegiances broke down.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s 19.6 percent of the vote Sunday is now a rich booty \u2014 triple the score of the mainstream Socialist Party, whose collapse has elevated Mr. M\u00e9lenchon to be de facto leader of the French left. He even won in big cities like Marseille and Lille.But it is not clear where that vote will now go, not least because far-left populism and far-right populism may have more in common than the seemingly vast gulf between them on the political spectrum would suggest.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, 65, a former Trotskyite, ran a campaign denouncing banks, globalization and the European Union \u2014 just like Ms. Le Pen.Both were competing for working-class voters suspicious of the global financial elite. Mr. Macron had already \u201cruined the lives of thousands of people\u201d with his pro-market policies, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said during the campaign.And like Ms. Le Pen, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon regularly attacked the news media during the campaign. On election night, after his defeat, he tore into what he called \u201cmediacrats\u201d and \u201coligarchs.\u201d They were \u201crejoicing\u201d over \u201ctwo candidates who approve and want to maintain the current institutions\u201d of government, the longtime fan of Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez said.The shared lines of attack gave the candidates at the political extremes their best showings ever, if from opposite ends of the spectrum. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon almost doubled his 2012 result, refused to concede for hours and then attacked both finalists, refusing to distinguish between them.In that, he is alone. Across the board, politicians and other former candidates have urgently counseled their supporters to vote for Mr. Macron to block Ms. Le Pen\u2019s path to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon is having none of it.Instead, his party has announced an internet \u201cconsultation\u201d of his followers, with three choices offered for the May 7 vote: a blank ballot, a vote for Mr. Macron or an abstention. A vote for Ms. Le Pen is not one of the choices, and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s aides insist that is the last thing they want.On Tuesday, a site linked to Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s party bristled with debate, with one poster saying Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen represented \u201cthe failure of the system\u201d and others agonizing over whether to abstain or vote blank.Critics of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon \u2014 who have become numerous in the Socialist Party and Mr. Macron\u2019s camp \u2014 say a blank ballot or abstention can only help Ms. Le Pen.\u201cIt\u2019s his pride. It\u2019s led him to make an extremely serious mistake,\u201d a leading Socialist member of Parliament, Malek Boutih, said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s given them a huge boost,\u201d he said of the National Front.\u201cThis gesture of M\u00e9lenchon, it\u2019s exactly like the political behavior of the whole European far left,\u201d added Mr. Boutih, who is part of the centrist bloc Mr. M\u00e9lenchon despises. \u201cThe radical left has a problem with democratic culture. It\u2019s a new force, but with old Stalinist ideas.\u201dThe National Front is delighted. The party has extended a welcome mat to Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s supporters, pointing out similarities between the candidates.The Front\u2019s founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2014 kicked out of the party by his daughter partly over his racism \u2014 hailed Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s position warmly in an interview on French radio Tuesday.\u201cThis seems very worthy to me, coming from a candidate who made a remarkable breakthrough, and who was \u2014 it must be said \u2014 the best orator,\u201d Mr. Le Pen said.His daughter\u2019s top lieutenant in the far-right party, Florian Philippot, said \u201cmany voters\u201d for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon may now join Ms. Le Pen in the second round, adding that there was a \u201ca kind of coherence, after all\u201d in his refusal to endorse Mr. Macron.\u201cLots of voters in the electorate that chose Fillon, Dupont-Aignan\u201d \u2014 two candidates on the right \u2014 \u201cand even M\u00e9lenchon are open to a number of our themes,\u201d another top National Front official, Nicolas Bay, said in an internal memo quoted by Agence France-Presse on Tuesday.The coming vote would be a contest between \u201cfans of Mrs. Merkel and the unsubjugated,\u201d he wrote \u2014 an apparent reference to Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s movement and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who is criticized on both the far left and the far right as pursuing policies that have impoverished European Union states.One of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s top aides derided the candidate\u2019s critics in a telephone interview Tuesday. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at where the criticism is coming from,\u201d said \u00c9ric Coquerel, a member of the Paris regional council.\u201cIt\u2019s coming from those whose policies have favored the development of the National Front, from the Socialist Party,\u201d said Mr. Coquerel, referring to the quarrel that divided the French left for five years: the governing Socialists\u2019 mild pro-market turn, seen as a betrayal by France\u2019s far left.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to help Marine Le Pen, but we don\u2019t want to endorse Mr. Macron,\u201d he said.\u201cHe\u2019s the candidate of free trade,\u201d Mr. Coquerel said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to assist in the Uberization of society.

{"Headline": "The Birth of \u2018Vietnamization\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byVietnam '67On Oct. 14, 1966, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who had been principally responsible for waging war against the Communists in South Vietnam, threw in the towel. A little over a year before he officially resigned as secretary, he sent a long memorandum to President Lyndon Johnson, artfully admitting that he and his Pentagon had no strategy to end the war on favorable terms for the South Vietnamese.Johnson quickly turned to others for a new approach. A month after McNamara\u2019s memo, the president asked two aides \u2014 Walt Rostow, his national security adviser, and Robert Komer, a National Security Council staff member \u2014 to come up with something more effective than McNamara\u2019s tactics of attrition and bombing. Their recommendation, delivered on Dec. 13, 1966, was to \u201ccomplement our anti-main force campaign and bombing offensive with greatly increased efforts to pacify the countryside and increase the attractive power\u201d of the government of Vietnam. Long before the term became a household word, \u201cVietnamization\u201d was born.To put the plan into effect, Johnson chose three men: Ellsworth Bunker to be ambassador in Saigon; Komer to lead a new counterinsurgency organization; and Gen. Creighton Abrams to build up South Vietnam\u2019s military capacity to defeat invading North Vietnamese regulars.Bunker was to work with the Vietnamese leadership and ensure coordination of all efforts \u2014 civil and military, American and Vietnamese nationalist. Komer and Abrams were to be deputies to Gen. William Westmoreland at his headquarters on the outskirts of Saigon.But it was Bunker whose role Johnson considered most pivotal. It was about more than being America\u2019s top diplomat in South Vietnam. It was about getting America out of the war. \u201cI had gotten him out of the Dominican Republic and accomplished his political objective there,\u201d he told me in an interview. \u201cHe wanted me to do the same in South Vietnam.\u201dIn a private meeting where no notes were taken, Johnson told Bunker that he wanted to begin withdrawing American troops from Vietnam. But before those forces could leave, a better, stronger South Vietnamese army had to take over more responsibility for search and destroy missions to keep Hanoi\u2019s battalions up in the mountains and close to the borders, far away from the civilian population.Simultaneously, Johnson wanted the South Vietnamese to accelerate democratic development, taking into their hands full responsibility for the political destiny of South Vietnam. In short, Johnson wanted the American role in Vietnam diminished at a speed corresponding to the emergence of South Vietnamese self-reliance.Johnson and his new Saigon leadership team organized a meeting in Guam on March 20, 1967, with South Vietnam\u2019s chief administrators, Generals Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky. They presented him with a new constitution for South Vietnam, one calling for checks and balances and decentralization of power to elected local councils in provinces and villages.President Johnson played down the meeting\u2019s importance; he stressed in public that the conference was not devoted to military aspects of the war effort, saying only that \u201cI think we have a difficult, serious, long, drawn-out, agonizing problem that we do not yet have the answer for.\u201d But there was no mistaking the significance of the Guam conference. Johnson used it to establish a new set of metrics by which to measure success in the war effort: Nation building was in, warfighting was out.Two days before the Guam meeting, General Westmoreland had asked for an increase of 85,000 combat troops in order to intensify field operations to \u201cavoid an unreasonable protracted war.\u201d At Guam, Westmoreland defended his request for more troops. Bunker watched Johnson react to Westmoreland\u2019s briefing. The president\u2019s mood and countenance revealed no pleasure in listening to Westmoreland\u2019s grim analysis, which largely confirmed McNamara\u2019s earlier judgment that the Pentagon strategy of high-intensity warfare could not force Hanoi to cease its aggression.Indeed, Johnson had already turned against adding troops. When Westmoreland traveled to Washington a month later to pitch the troop increase again, the president replied: \u201cWhen we add divisions, can\u2019t the enemy add divisions? If so, where does it all end?\u201d Several months later Johnson threw Westmoreland a bone, adding 45,000 combat troops, about half of what he requested.Bunker arrived in Saigon in late April 1967, where he made clear that Washington\u2019s approach had changed. It would no longer to be a \u201chard power\u201d war fought primarily by American combat units in South Vietnam supplemented by American bombing of North Vietnam, with everything else waiting on the outcome of that armed struggle. Instead, he told Thieu on April 28, the \u201dessence of success\u201d would be found in bringing security to all the hamlets and villages across the countryside.Bunker set himself four main tasks: convincing South Vietnam\u2019s leadership of the need to build a legitimate government reflecting the country\u2019s various political forces; executing a pacification program to bring peace and order to rural villages; preparing South Vietnam\u2019s army to take over the burden of direct ground combat with Communist forces; and promoting economic development to improve living conditions and raise funds to finance the struggle against North Vietnam.In other words, Ellsworth\u2019s goal was to shift from the United States to the South Vietnamese the burden of sustaining South Vietnam as a viable independent republic.Sent to be Westmoreland\u2019s deputy for pacification, Komer immediately started building a new organization \u2014 Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development, or Cords \u2014 which brought together American military and civilian advisers to work with South Vietnamese in mobilizing civilians against the National Liberation Front, known to its enemies as the Vietcong.For the moment, things looked headed in the right direction. South Vietnam adopted its new constitution, and elections brought in a bicameral National Assembly and thousands of popularly chosen village and hamlet chiefs. And a relatively clean presidential campaign ended with Thieu as president and Ky as vice president. South Vietnam now had in place a political infrastructure to support villages, grow the economy and provide more manpower for the armed forces.Westmoreland likewise adjusted his military efforts to the new strategy. In a public address at the National Press Club in Washington on Nov. 21, 1967, he announced his plan for ending American combat in South Vietnam. He called this \u201cPhase IV\u201d or \u201cthe final phase,\u201d in which American forces became \u201cprogressively superfluous\u201d to the defense of South Vietnam. \u201cU.S. units can begin to phase down as the Vietnamese Army is modernized and develops its capacity to the fullest.\u201d In an appearance on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d after the speech, Westmoreland predicted that American forces would start to withdraw from South Vietnam in \u201ctwo years or less.\u201dAnd he was right: American forces began their drawdown from combat in August 1969 \u2014 but not before another 21,000 American soldiers died in combat.Stephen B. Young is the global executive director of the Caux Round Table. He worked for the United States Agency for International Development in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.Advertisement"}

Ms. Moran was found unresponsive Saturday afternoon and died in her home in New Salisbury, Ind., the authorities said.An autopsy showed that she most likely died from complications of cancer, the sheriff\u2019s department said in a statement on Monday.Ms. Moran, who started acting at 5, got her first taste of television in a commercial for First Federal Bank. She went on to play minor characters on television and in film in the late 1960s and early \u201970s. At 12, she landed her biggest role: Joanie, the freckle-faced troublemaker and sister of Richie Cunningham, the all-American teenager played by Ron Howard.Over the 11-season run of \u201cHappy Days,\u201d a Garry Marshall creation that would become one of the most popular sitcoms in television history, Joanie was transformed from a young teenager who complained about being sent to her room to a major character on the show. In later seasons, Joanie\u2019s love interest with the aspiring musician Chachi Arcola, played by Scott Baio, became a major story line.In 1982, the two characters were given their own show, \u201cJoanie Loves Chachi,\u201d a widely panned comedy that followed their romantic adventures and musical pursuits in Chicago. While \u201cHappy Days\u201d was a No. 1 hit, the spinoff \u2014 one of several spawned by \u201cHappy Days\u201d \u2014 lasted only 17 episodes.The show\u2019s failure ushered in a swift end to Ms. Moran\u2019s acting career and her opportunities in Hollywood. She was only 22 when the show ended, but despite minor appearances on other shows, she never held another leading role.After the shows were over, Ms. Moran was candid about the downsides of growing up on screen under the Hollywood spotlight. She said that shortly before her 15th birthday, producers on \u201cHappy Days\u201d began to pressure her to watch what she ate and to wear more revealing outfits. \u201cThey suddenly wanted me to lose weight and become this sexy thing,\u201d she said in an interview in 1983.In the mid-1980s, Ms. Moran swore off Hollywood and left Los Angeles for a home in the California mountains. She told The Toronto Star in 1988 that she had suffered from depression after the two television series ended and acting offers dried up.\u201cI wanted time off to reassess my life and career,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to ask myself, \u2018Do I really want to keep doing this, or do I want to sit back and take it easy for five years, 10 years?\u2019 \u201dErin Marie Moran was born on Oct. 18, 1960, in Burbank, Calif., and raised in North Hollywood with five siblings. She was the second-youngest child of Sharon and Edward Moran. Her father was a finance manager. Her mother encouraged her acting career and signed her up with an agent at 5.Before playing Joanie, Ms. Moran played an orphan on \u201cDaktari,\u201d a late-\u201960s drama about a veterinarian protecting wildlife in East Africa, and a daughter on the sitcom \u201cThe Don Rickles Show.\u201d She also appeared in \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cGunsmoke,\u201d \u201cMy Three Sons\u201d and \u201cThe F.B.I,\u201d among other shows.Later in her life, she moved to Indiana with her second husband, Steve Fleischmann.A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.An obituary on Monday about the actress Erin Moran, who played Joanie on the television show \u201cHappy Days,\u201d misstated the number of seasons that series was broadcast.

Trump endorsed on the presidential campaign trail last year, and which his secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, spent decades lobbying for as a philanthropist.State Senator Debbie Lesko, the sponsor of the bill, said the Trump administration\u2019s support for the concept had helped make her legislation more palatable to lawmakers. \u201cFrom the national level down, the winds have changed,\u201d she said. \u201cAll children are different, and they learn in different educational environments. We shouldn\u2019t force them to be in the same educational model we\u2019ve used for the last 150 years.\u201dThe law expands the use of money from the state\u2019s Empowerment Scholarship Accounts program, known as an E.S.A. Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee have similar programs, but they all restrict eligibility to disabled children. That makes the Arizona expansion the broadest to date.Unlike traditional vouchers, in which states pay private schools directly, E.S.A.s allow parents to distribute public dollars for educational expenses.In 2015, Nevada passed an empowerment scholarship bill that would have allowed any former public school student access to use an account, but last year, the State Supreme Court halted the program, saying its financing mechanism would harm public schools. The program is on much firmer legal ground in Arizona, where the state\u2019s top court declared the accounts constitutional in 2014.In legislative negotiations, skeptics of the expansion were able to secure several compromises. Although all public school students will be eligible to apply for an account, enrollment in the program will be limited to about 5,500 new students each year, eligible on a first-come-first-served basis. Total enrollment will be capped at 30,000 students in 2022. All private schools that accept E.S.A.s will be required to test account recipients annually, using a nationally recognized standardized test. But only schools serving over 50 scholarship students will have to report their students\u2019 scores publicly. Unlike public schools, they will not have to report on the performance of subgroups such as racial minorities, low-income students or those learning English.The program has been especially popular with the parents of disabled students. \u201cThe public school options are not working for those families,\u201d regardless of income, said John Schilling, chief operating officer of the American Federation for Children, a national advocacy group that lobbied for the Arizona expansion. Ms. DeVos is the group\u2019s former board chairwoman.An Arizona state senator who opposed the bill, Juan Mendez, a Democrat, said the amount of money in the accounts was too little for many of his low-income Latino constituents to afford a high-quality private education. He worries, he said, that affluent white parents will use the accounts to flee public school systems that are becomingly increasingly Latino each year.\u201cWe are facilitating a new type of white flight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need a moving van anymore to get your kid to another school.\u201dOver a dozen states considered E.S.A. bills this year, but such proposals make for heavy political lifting. Democrats are generally united in opposition, while some Republicans are skeptical because of the impact of the accounts on state budgets. And conservative legislators from rural regions often complain that there are few private schools to choose from in their areas.Nevertheless, advocates for private school choice hope the Arizona victory will lead to national momentum. Mr. Trump, Mr. Schilling noted, is seeking $250 million to finance private school choice at the federal level, through a tax credit.\u201cHaving Congress take a look a this is very, very important,\u201d Mr. Schilling said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bribe Cases, a Jared Kushner Partner and Potential Conflicts", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, a top adviser, had help building a real estate empire from a member of one of Israel\u2019s wealthiest families.Supported byIt was the summer of 2012, and Jared Kushner was headed downtown.His family\u2019s real estate firm, the Kushner Companies, would spend about $190 million over the next few months on dozens of apartment buildings in tony Lower Manhattan neighborhoods including the East Village, the West Village and SoHo.For much of the roughly $50 million in down payments, Mr. Kushner turned to an undisclosed overseas partner. Public records and shell companies shield the investor\u2019s identity. But, it turns out, the money came from a member of Israel\u2019s Steinmetz family, which built a fortune as one of the world\u2019s leading diamond traders.A Kushner Companies spokeswoman and several Steinmetz representatives say Raz Steinmetz, 53, was behind the deals. His uncle, and the family\u2019s most prominent figure, is the billionaire Beny Steinmetz, who is under scrutiny by law enforcement authorities in four countries. In the United States, federal prosecutors are investigating whether representatives of his firm bribed government officials in Guinea to secure a multibillion dollar mining concession. In Israel, Mr. Steinmetz was detained in December and questioned in a bribery and money laundering investigation. In Switzerland and Guinea, prosecutors have conducted similar inquiries.The Steinmetz partnership with Mr. Kushner underscores the mystery behind his family\u2019s multibillion-dollar business and its potential for conflicts with his role as perhaps the second-most powerful man in the White House, behind only his father-in-law, President Trump.Dealings with the Steinmetz family could create complications for Mr. Kushner. The Justice Department, led by Trump appointees, oversees the investigation into Beny Steinmetz. Even as Mr. Kushner\u2019s company maintains extensive business ties to Israel, as a top White House adviser, he has been charged with leading American efforts to broker peace in the Middle East as part of his broad global portfolio.\u201cMr. Kushner continues to work with the Office of the White House Counsel and personal counsel to ensure he recuses from any particular matter involving specific parties in which he has a business relationship with a party to the matter,\u201d said Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman.Representatives for Mr. Kushner and the Steinmetzes put distance between Raz Steinmetz and his uncle, Beny. Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for the Kushner Companies, called Raz \u201ca terrific partner,\u201d and added: \u201cHe is the only Steinmetz that we have done business with.\u201dIn a statement provided by his attorney, Raz Steinmetz said: \u201cNone of my investment entities has invested in any transactions with Beny Steinmetz or any of his interests.\u201d Louis Solomon, an attorney at Greenberg Traurig LLP, who represents one of Beny Steinmetz\u2019s companies, said any business relationships between Raz and Beny were two decades old, and said the two men had not had contact since 2013.The two men, as well as Daniel Steinmetz, who is Beny\u2019s brother and Raz\u2019s father, have controlled their own companies. But some of their financial interests \u2014 ranging from diamonds to real estate \u2014 have been entwined over the years. Records reviewed by The Times show that they have shared offshore investment vehicles, employed the same company director and were once connected to the same Swiss bank accounts.Alan M. Dershowitz, a criminal defense attorney for Beny Steinmetz in the United States, also said his client was not involved in the Kushner properties. He predicted that the businessman would be vindicated overseas and said he believed the federal investigation of Mr. Steinmetz and his companies was no longer active.The Justice Department would not comment on the inquiry. But more information about the bribery investigation may be disclosed by federal prosecutors at a trial that began Monday in New York. Mahmoud Thiam, Guinea\u2019s former minister of mines, is facing corruption charges involving a Chinese company. An affidavit from a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent made public in the case last month said that the minister bribed a fellow government official \u201con behalf of\u201d one of Mr. Steinmetz\u2019s companies in 2009. The F.B.I. is also examining an alleged bribery episode involving a prominent Guinean \u2014 the late president\u2019s wife \u2014 and a Steinmetz company a year earlier.Beny Steinmetz expanded his business interests into steel, gold, nickel, oil and iron ore, and built a global real estate empire, with properties in cities including London, New York and St. Petersburg. Two decades ago, he made a move into Russia, becoming an early investor in newly privatized state enterprises as a co-founder of the hedge fund Hermitage Capital.Mr. Steinmetz rarely grants interviews and often incorporates his multiple companies in tax havens like Guernsey, Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands that offer secrecy. Although he is the public face of his firms, he holds no executive position. Instead, they are typically owned by a Liechtenstein foundation \u2014 similar to a trust in the United States \u2014 that names him and his wife as beneficiaries. Officially, he is an \u201cadviser\u201d to his firms.His legal problems stem from a huge deposit of iron ore in Guinea, in West Africa. In 1997, the Australian mining firm Rio Tinto was awarded exploration rights. But by 2008, the Guinean government was complaining that the project had taken too long, and it awarded half the rights to a Steinmetz firm, BSG Resources. In 2010, BSG sold half of that share, cutting a $2.5 billion deal with the Brazilian mining giant Vale.In 2014, the Guinean government alleged that Mr. Steinmetz\u2019s company had obtained the rights through corrupt practices, paying more than $8 million in cash through a representative to Mamadie Tour\u00e9, then the wife of the dictator Lansana Cont\u00e9. The Department of Justice had already opened an investigation the year before into Mr. Steinmetz\u2019s firms for potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, claiming jurisdiction because some of the alleged payments were transmitted through American banks.This month, lawyers acting on behalf of two of Mr. Steinmetz\u2019s firms sued the billionaire financier George Soros in federal court in New York, asserting that he had directed a smear campaign against the companies. Mr. Soros has funded a portion of the Guinean government\u2019s investigation, as well as work by the nonprofit Global Witness.In 2012, Jared Kushner\u2019s company went on a buying spree, snapping up about 11,000 apartments around the country, roughly doubling its inventory. The firm, founded by his father, Charles, also made its first Steinmetz deal that summer.The younger Mr. Kushner has traveled repeatedly to Israel, where he has gotten funding to fulfill his ambitions. Kushner Companies has taken out at least four loans from Israel\u2019s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim. It joined with Harel, one of Israel\u2019s largest insurance companies, on one deal. Mr. Kushner\u2019s firm was introduced to the Raz Steinmetz team \u201cby a third-party broker in the United States,\u201d said Kenneth Henderson, a New York attorney for Raz Steinmetz.In August of 2012, the Kushner business made a significant move into downtown Manhattan\u2019s residential market, spending about $60 million on eight apartment buildings in the East Village and the West Village. The low-rise buildings are undistinguished but offer steady income streams.The deal was arranged by Gaia Investments Corporation, headquartered outside of Tel Aviv. No Steinmetz names appear in Gaia\u2019s public filings. Instead, the shareholders and officers include some Steinmetz lieutenants. One of them, Shlomo Meichor, was a former vice president for finance at an investment firm once run by Raz and Daniel Steinmetz, and is a director for at least three Gaia Delaware entities created for the Kushner deals, records show. (Gaia is an ancient Greek word for earth goddess.)Gaia\u2019s representatives have told prospective partners that the firm invests money for Daniel as well, according to two people familiar with those conversations. Mr. Henderson, the attorney, said Daniel Steinmetz was not involved in the Kushner investments.The deals came amid an unprecedented flow of overseas cash into American properties, much of it through opaque corporations and limited liability companies that make the funds difficult to trace.Beny Steinmetz\u2019s legal problems began to surface a few weeks after the first investment with the Kushner company. In November 2012, The Financial Times reported on the Guinea bribery investigation, setting off coverage around the world.The Kushner Companies made an even bigger deal with the Raz Steinmetz team a few months later, in January 2013, spending about $130 million on a portfolio of 17 apartment buildings across Lower Manhattan.A few weeks later, a BSG Resources representative named Frederic Cilins \u2014 meeting in a diner at the Jacksonville, Fla., airport \u2014 urged Ms. Tour\u00e9, by then the widow of the Guinean president, to destroy paperwork documenting the alleged bribes. She was cooperating with the F.B.I., though, and wearing a wire. Mr. Cilins pleaded guilty to obstructing a federal criminal investigation and was sentenced to two years in prison.Beny Steinmetz has said he had no knowledge of Mr. Cilins\u2019 activities.In October 2013, a few days after Guinea moved to revoke its iron ore contracts with Mr. Steinmetz\u2019s firms, his company\u2019s representatives wrote their lawyers that he had transferred his diamond company stakes to his brother Daniel\u2019s foundation in Liechtenstein. That disclosure is in the so-called Panama Papers, the trove of documents obtained by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and reviewed by The Times through a collaboration organized by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Corporate and bank records point to interlocking financial relationships among the Steinmetz family members in the past. Raz once managed the family\u2019s real estate investments and participated in the family diamond business. As part of the bribery investigation involving Beny, Swiss prosecutors searched the offices of a company used by Daniel Steinmetz. The three men were once connected to at least two Swiss bank accounts at HSBC, according to bank records obtained by the French newspaper Le Monde and shared by the journalist consortium.Mr. Solomon, the attorney for Beny Steinmetz\u2019s firm, said that there was no current connection to Raz through any Swiss bank account. He said an Israeli investment vehicle that public records show Raz, Daniel and Beny still own jointly is \u201cdormant.\u201dRisa Heller, the Kushner Companies spokeswoman, declined to discuss any due diligence the firm may have performed ahead of the investments.The Kushner Companies appear to have carried out a public scrubbing of its Steinmetz associations. In late 2014, the Gaia name and logo disappeared from the Kushner website\u2019s list of partners, where it had appeared since early 2013.But the Kushners have not stopped making deals with the Steinmetz family. Around the time Gaia was dropped from the website, it invested in yet another Kushner building: a Trump-branded luxury high-rise in Jersey City. The $200 million project, known as Trump Bay Street, is at 65 Bay Street.Jared Kushner\u2019s ethics disclosure filed last month revealed a stake in a company called 65 Bay L.L.C. The entity was originally called GAIA JC LLC.Reporting was contributed by Megan Twohey, William K. Rashbaum, Doris Burke, Kitty Bennett, Andrew Kramer and Sarah Cohen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As U.S. Targets Berlin on Trade, German Manufacturers Lobby Trump", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 When Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, met with President Trump in Washington, she brought three executives with her, all heads of German manufacturing or engineering giants. Their message? Germany is not a threat to the United States.For decades, the United States has been a kind of second home to German carmakers, a place not only to sell vehicles but also to build them. German manufacturers employ thousands at plants across the United States, and produce finished products like cars, as well as parts and machinery, within the country for sale domestically or export abroad.But that the point \u2014 made during a session that included the chief executives of BMW, the carmaker; Siemens, the electronics and engineering company; and Schaeffler, a major supplier of parts for automotive engines, transmissions and chassis \u2014 needed to be made at all underlines growing concern in Berlin over hostility directed at German industry by the Trump administration.Peter Navarro, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump, has accused Germany of being a currency manipulator, even though German politicians and economists are among the staunchest critics of European Central Bank policies that have encouraged a weak euro. And the American president himself wondered aloud to a German newspaper in January why Americans buy lots of Mercedes cars while Germans hardly buy any Chevrolets.The anger from the Trump administration has been a rude shock, threatening the bedrock of Germany\u2019s economy and leaving executives perplexed. Their quandary is one faced by business across Europe: Mr. Trump has questioned the assumptions that have underpinned trans-Atlantic commerce since the end of World War II, without making clear what could come instead.\u201cI think there is a little bit lack of understanding,\u201d Harald Kr\u00fcger, the chief executive of BMW, said in an interview at the Geneva International Motor Show in March, not long after Mr. Trump had attacked the company for building a plant in Mexico. \u201cMaybe there hasn\u2019t been enough data supplied before.\u201dBut delivering a counterargument to the administration\u2019s protectionist rhetoric \u2014 pointing out, for example, that BMW\u2019s largest factory in the world is in a South Carolina county that voted heavily for Mr. Trump \u2014 has proved exceptionally difficult. Mr. Trump\u2019s election disrupted old lines of communication and left BMW and other companies with no idea whom to talk to in Washington.For now, businesses hope that Mr. Trump is not really serious about erecting trade barriers with Europe, which would arguably damage the United States economy as well. They hope that, over time, they can find ways to sway him.If the Trump administration does follow through, however, the consequences will be particularly ominous for Germany.The March 17 visit to Washington, led by Ms. Merkel, provided a measure of how seriously Berlin views the threat.\u201cIt was a good discussion,\u201d Mr. Kr\u00fcger said a few days later at a news conference in Munich. \u201cWe were able to talk about how much German carmakers have invested and how many jobs we have created.\u201dThe session with the president included a round-table meeting where Mr. Kr\u00fcger and the other business leaders, Joe Kaeser of Siemens and Klaus Rosenfeld of Schaeffler, gave a presentation on the country\u2019s vocational education system for young people.The issue of free trade came up, the BMW chief said, but he did not elaborate except to say that it was essential that the carmaker be able to export products from the United States. German companies fear that Trump policies could ignite a trade war and interfere with exports.The subtle message of the presentation was that Germany\u2019s export success was not just the result of a cheap euro.Whether that message got through, however, is unclear.Germany and the United States, traditionally close allies, are still groping to find common ground following President Trump\u2019s election. Those differences were on display at a meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents from the Group of 20 in Baden-Baden, Germany, that began on the same day that Ms. Merkel visited Mr. Trump.But even before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, it was a gloomy period for advocates of trans-Atlantic trade. After more than three years of painstaking negotiations, an ambitious effort to dismantle trade barriers between the European Union and United States stalled amid opposition from, of all places, Germany.The question European business is still wrestling with is how to do so.BMW has long been one of the most sophisticated political operators in the United States. The company, based in Munich, has government relations offices in South Carolina, site of its largest factory in the world; Washington; and Sacramento. California is important to the car company because the state sets emissions standards that are emulated by numerous other states.And BMW is not without political clout. It employs 9,000 people in Spartanburg, S.C., in a county that voted for Mr. Trump by a large margin. At least four times that many work for suppliers. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is a fierce defender of the company\u2019s interests, and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal Republican critics.While it\u2019s true that BMW is building a factory in Mexico, it will be only a third the size of the Spartanburg plant, which exported vehicles worth $10 billion from the United States last year, more than any other carmaker. Many of those BMWs went to China. The company has in fact created the kind of manufacturing jobs that Mr. Trump says he wants.It is not alone. Many German companies have large factories in the United States, including Mercedes in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Volkswagen in Chattanooga, Tenn., where the company recently began making a new S.U.V., the Atlas, which will go on sale in May. Siemens says it has about 60 plants in the United States turning out products like wind turbines and light rail vehicles. It employs 50,000 people in the country.And while the rhetoric in the United States has turned distinctively against foreign trade, American politicians have not shown any aversion to it when it brings jobs to their districts.That includes some people close to the president. For example, as governor of South Carolina, Nikki R. Haley was known as a friend to BMW and lobbied heavily for Volvo Cars to choose the state as a site for a new factory that will have an annual capacity of 100,000 cars. That was despite Volvo\u2019s being owned by Geely Automobile Holdings, which is based in China, a prime target of Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric.Volvo broke ground for the factory in Berkeley County, S.C., in September 2015. Ms. Haley now has a new job. She is Mr. Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Suspense Is Almost Too Much for the French", "Date": "2017-04-21", "News": "Supported byEditorial ObserverPANTIN, France \u2014 \u201cAnyone but Le Pen.\u201d That was the refrain at an open-air market on Wednesday in this banlieue, just northeast of Paris, when I asked people about France\u2019s presidential election on Sunday.Marine Le Pen, the candidate of the far-right National Front, has a good shot at winning first or second place in this first round of voting, which would qualify her for the May 7 runoff. But polls show a tight contest among her and three other candidates, so the people of France wait anxiously to find out who will make it to the final vote.For many in Pantin, a traditional left-wing bastion that is home to many Muslim immigrants, what makes the suspense so excruciating is the tainted lineage of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s party, which her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, helped found. He has called the holocaust a \u201cdetail\u201d of World War II. Though Ms. Le Pen has worked hard to prettify the National Front as a populist, anti-European Union party, there is no avoiding the ugliness of what it stands for. And as her poll numbers have softened in recent days, she has hardened her anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric.The reaction of the two leading candidates could not have been more different. Ms. Le Pen blamed government \u201claxity\u201d and \u201cna\u00efvet\u00e9\u201d toward terrorists, while Emmanuel Macron, an independent centrist, said the terrorist threat \u201cwill be a fact of daily life in the coming years.\u201dIt is impossible to know how the attack will affect the election because so many people remain undecided, and may in the end submit blank ballots \u2014 a popular form of protest in France. Some 30 percent of registered voters may not show up at all \u2014 compared with 20 percent in the first round of voting in 2012 \u2014 making it likely that abstention will be the most popular choice in the early balloting.Close behind Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen are the center-right R\u00e9publicains candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and the far-left populist Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. They are also virtually tied, with Mr. Fillon at 19.5 percent and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon at 18.5. Mr. Fillon, who was the front-runner after an upset in his party\u2019s primary, lost support after it was revealed that he had paid his wife and children around $1 million in public money that they may not have earned. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon had an astonishing last-minute surge after performing well in televised debates, and in a show of how modern, even futuristic, he is, his campaign has used holographic appearances to simultaneously reach supporters in multiple cities.While people interviewed at the market were unanimous in their aversion to Ms. Le Pen, they were split on whom they were for. That could be a sign of how Pantin, the \u201cBrooklyn of Paris,\u201d has changed with the arrival of arty types and young families who can\u2019t afford Paris proper. In addition, some were adamant that if their candidate didn\u2019t make it to the second round, they would not be able to choose another. One man said, \u201cIf Fillon isn\u2019t on the final ballot, my decision is simple: I\u2019m going fishing.\u201dThis important election may be decided simply by turnout. The winner could lead France into a Brexit-style referendum on European Union membership. The country could veer far to the left \u2014 with potentially huge effects on global markets \u2014 or hard right, setting off a Trump-administration-style witch hunt against immigrants, especially Muslims. Of the four leading candidates, all but Mr. Macron are likely to be friendlier to President Vladimir Putin of Russia.Whatever happens, the French will probably remain as politically divided after the election as they are now. Hannah, a 45-year-old woman at the market on Wednesday, said she would vote for Mr. Hamon. \u201cThe election will be a catastrophe,\u201d she said. \u201cFrance is divided in four. Whatever the result, three-quarters of the people will not be happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Cuts Leave Bridge and Rail Projects Hanging", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byWhen President Trump pledged during the campaign to spend $1 trillion to restore America\u2019s crumbling bridges and roads, supporters across the country cheered.Maryland had been just four days away from clinching some $900 million in federal aid in August when a federal judge ruled to temporarily invalidate environmental approvals for the project. But under President Trump\u2019s plan, projects that don\u2019t yet have complete federal funding agreements would be financed \u201cby the localities that use and benefit from these localized projects.\u201dSupporters of the project are devastated.\u201cWe\u2019d been so encouraged by all the talk of investing in infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Guzzetti said. \u201cBut the budget has been discouraging.\u201d\u201cThe president has consistently emphasized that one of his top priorities is modernizing our country\u2019s outdated infrastructure,\u201d she said. \u201cThe proposal will cover more than transportation infrastructure. It will include energy, water and potentially broadband and veterans hospitals, as well.\u201d\u201cInvestors say there is ample capital available, waiting to invest in infrastructure projects,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the problem is not money.\u201dStill, private-public partnerships have not always been winning propositions.That came just eight years after the companies paid $3.8 billion for a 75-year lease for the toll road. Operators of toll roads in Alabama and Virginia and of a tunnel connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, have also faced bankruptcy in recent years.Chicago\u2019s lease of its parking meters to a group led by Morgan Stanley has become a prime example of privatization gone wrong. Chicago\u2019s inspector general found that the city had been paid almost $1 billion less for the lease than it would have received from its parking meters over the course of the deal, and the contract\u2019s fine print prevented the city from building parking lots and other infrastructure that might compete with the outsourced parking meters.\u201cThere were some rosy projections, but things didn\u2019t go well,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cAnd there can be a real diversion between what\u2019s good for private investors and public interest.\u201dMr. LeFrak declined to be interviewed for this article, as did Ms. Chao.Until Mr. Trump\u2019s team can deliver on the specifics, several infrastructure projects remain in limbo \u2014 even ones approved by voters. And local governments may now have to scramble to secure private investors.In Wake County, N.C., voters passed a half-cent sales tax last fall to fund a bus rapid transit plan and commuter rail. But without federal funding, the project is unlikely to move forward. Other projects at risk include Nashville\u2019s $6 billion plan for 200 miles of pedestrian walkway improvements, light rail and bus rapid transit.The Greater New Orleans Expressway Commission had already rejected turning to a public-private partnership for improvements, after estimating that bringing in private investors could cause tolls to jump threefold. Repairs were needed to the 1950s-era causeway, said Carlton Dufrechou, its general manager, partly because the bridges were struggling to handle both an increase in traffic and larger cars.Initially elated when the causeway showed up on Mr. Trump\u2019s list, Mr. Dufrechou is now waiting. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard anything since then,\u201d he said. \u201cSincerely, we just don\u2019t know.\u201dAn article on Thursday about President Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans erroneously included one state among those where operators of toll roads have faced bankruptcy. While operators in Alabama and Virginia have had problems, that is not the case in Michigan because the state has no toll roads.

That training led him to a job at M&M Manufacturing, which makes aerospace parts, and to steady pay increases.\u201cWe\u2019ve moved out of an apartment and into a house,\u201d Moreno told me, explaining how his new job has changed his family\u2019s life. \u201cMy daughter is taking violin lessons, and my other daughter has a math tutor.\u201dMoreno was sitting at a table with his boss, Rocky Payton, the factory\u2019s general manager, and Amy Saum, the human resources manager. All said they had voted for Trump, and all were bewildered that he wanted to cut funds that channel people into good manufacturing jobs.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of wasteful spending, so cut other places,\u201d Moreno said.Yet Democrats gleeful at the prospect of winning penitent voters back should take a deep breath. These voters may be irritated, but I was struck by how loyal they remain to Trump.I talked to many Trump voters about the impact if Trump\u2019s budget cuts go through, and none regretted their votes in November. They all said that they might vote for Trump for re-election.\u201cI don\u2019t think I re-evaluate Trump,\u201d Moreno said, adding that he just wants the president to re-evaluate his budget proposal.Judy Banks, a 70-year-old struggling to get by, said she voted for Trump because \u201che was talking about getting rid of those illegals.\u201d But Banks now finds herself shocked that he also has his sights on funds for the Labor Department\u2019s Senior Community Service Employment Program, which is her lifeline. It pays senior citizens a minimum wage to hold public service jobs.\u201cThis program makes sense,\u201d said Banks, who was placed by the program into a job as a receptionist for a senior nutrition program. Banks said she depends on the job to make ends meet, and for an excuse to get out of the house.\u201cIf I lose this job,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll sit home and die.\u201dYet she said she might still vote for Trump in 2020. And that\u2019s a refrain I heard over and over. Some of the loyalty seemed to be grounded in resentment at Democrats for mocking Trump voters as dumb bigots, some from a belief that budgets are complicated, and some from a sense that it\u2019s too early to abandon their man. They did say that if jobs didn\u2019t reappear, they would turn against him.Elizabeth Hays, 27, said her life changed during her freshman year in high school, when four upperclassmen raped her. Domestic Violence Intervention Services rescued her, she said, by helping her understand that the rape wasn\u2019t her fault.She\u2019s profoundly grateful to the organization \u2014 yet she stands by Trump even as she is dismayed that he wants to slash support for a group that helped her when she needed it most. \u201cWe have to look at what we spend money on,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI will stand behind my president.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Has Coffee Gotten Too Fancy?", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The $1 cup of coffee is divisive, as drinks go.For some, it\u2019s a staple of the American morning: a comforting routine, a good deal. Anything that costs more than $1 is needlessly expensive, a waste of money \u2014 the coffee from a deli, diner or doughnut cart is all you need to start the day. For others, the $1 cup is suspiciously cheap. Maybe it tastes bad, or its production does harm to the land and is unfair to laborers. If you have to pay more, then that is probably a reflection of a drink\u2019s true cost.Locol\u2019s stated mission is to bring wholesome, affordable food to underserved neighborhoods. The coffee delivers. Obtained and roasted according to the same lofty standards found at Intelligentsia Coffee, Stumptown Coffee Roasters or any of the small, innovative companies that have transformed the high end of the industry in the past decade, Locol\u2019s coffee is clean and flavorful.But unlike those shops, where a cup can cost $3 or more, Locol charges just $1 for a 12-ounce coffee, or $1.50 if you want milk and sugar. Rather than offer free condiments and pass on the cost to all customers, those who want milky, sweet coffee pay for their pleasures, while drinkers of black coffee get a break. As for getting it chilled, that\u2019s on the house: Iced coffee costs the same as hot.\u201cThere\u2019s an extreme democratization that I really want to make happen in coffee,\u201d said Tony Konecny, the head of Locol\u2019s coffee operation, who goes by Tonx. Good coffee, he said, should be brought to a broad audience, not just a \u201cself-selecting group\u201d of epicures.\u201cCoffee still thinks that mass appeal is a sign of selling out and inauthenticity, but everybody wears Levi\u2019s,\u201d he said of the culture. \u201cI think contemporary coffee has failed to find the consumers it should be finding.\u201dA few of those consumers were lingering at the Locol in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles on a recent bright day. Some were nursing aguas frescas, others were holding court while R&B played at block-party volume from an array of speakers embedded in the ceiling. One person was sorting through a small tower of paperwork.There is, of course, another fast-food chain that is known for its coffee: McDonald\u2019s. The company has embarked on a project to make all of its coffee sustainable by 2020 by innovating at every level of its supply chain \u2014 investing in its farmers, for instance, as many of the much smaller high-end coffee companies do. (Coffee sold at McDonald\u2019s restaurants in Europe already meets the company\u2019s sustainability standards.)The scale of McDonald\u2019s business is vastly different from Locol\u2019s, but the consumer experience isn\u2019t, not when it comes to coffee: Both offer a cup that is cheap and approachable.The efficiencies of the fast-food model are what allow Mr. Konecny to buy high-quality beans for about three times the price of commodity coffee and still sell it for $1. The coffee comes from Red Fox Coffee Merchants, a boutique importer that supplies some of the country\u2019s most exacting roasters; Mr. Konecny coordinates closely with their buyer, who in turn works with farmers to finance them and determine best practices for growing the beans.The coffee is brewed by Locol\u2019s kitchen staff, and when a new batch is prepared the old batch is cooled and mixed in with cold-brew coffee to be served on ice: There is no waste. Black coffee is easy to scale up; stand-alone coffee shops, with their intricate menus (cortados, almond milk lattes, iced matcha spritzers) can\u2019t compete.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t run a coffee shop selling coffee for a dollar,\u201d Mr. Konecny said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a sustainable business.\u201dJonathan Rubinstein, an owner of Joe, a coffee chain based in New York with 14 locations, agrees that the numbers would not work. Joe\u2019s shops are in some of the most expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan, including Greenwich Village and the Upper East Side. Next month, a Joe will open in the World Trade Center. Mr. Rubinstein pays as much as $25,000 per month in rent \u2014 he estimates that the average is $15,000 per month \u2014 along with labor, materials, utilities, insurance and the many other expenses that are the cost of doing business.\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is interesting, and what fun to try to do it out of a window \u2014 if you sold nothing else,\u201d he said of Mr. Konecny. \u201cBut what a volume you would have to do.\u201dStill, Mr. Rubinstein says that Mr. Konecny makes a good point. \u201cKudos to him for trying something so out of the box,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes you think about all the restaurants that are doing exactly what he\u2019s doing, and literally are charging five times what he\u2019s charging.\u201dMr. Konecny\u2019s ambitions for Yes Plz go beyond selling a high-quality cup of coffee at that magic price point, though he knows that it sends a powerful message. What he wants to do is shift the very nature of coffee culture. He has no patience for what he calls the \u201cculinary burlesque\u201d of pour-over bars, with their solemn baristas and potted succulents. \u201cIt\u2019s dress-up,\u201d he said.Those settings and presentations, he said, send the wrong message: that good coffee must also be expensive and fetishized.\u201cWe have become overly focused on this ingredient preciousness, single-origin puritanism,\u201d he said. As a result, he added, coffee just keeps getting \u201cfancier and fancier.\u201dIn a sense, Mr. Konecny is facing off with his own history. A respected veteran of \u201cspecialty\u201d coffee, the industry term for the high-end market, he worked for Victrola Coffee Roasters in Seattle starting in 2002, when the company was a hive of innovation. He was then hired by Intelligentsia Coffee to help direct its expansion to Los Angeles, and later started his own roaster, Tonx, which he sold to Blue Bottle Coffee in 2014.\u201cA lot of my colleagues don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing here,\u201d he said.The mistake, in his view, was for independent coffee shops to define themselves in opposition to Starbucks and other chains, and to create \u2014 inadvertently \u2014 a culture of nerdy superiority.\u201cYou throw at all your customers that coffee is this delicate, special thing that has to be done exactly right on exactly this equipment,\u201d he said.But does the $1 price go too far? \u201cMy worry is that this will reinforce the idea that specialty coffee is inherently overpriced, when it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d said Charles Babinski, a co-owner of G&B Coffee and Go Get Em Tiger, in Los Angeles. \u201cThe best coffees in the world cost nothing when you compare it to the best beers or a fancy glass of wine, and the margins that businesses take on coffee are smaller than you\u2019re going to find in a bar.\u201d\u201cThe difference between O.K. coffee \u2014 what we all drink with friends at diners and those times when we just need coffee \u2014 and exceptional coffee takes a lot of work,\u201d said Mr. Barr. He also pointed out that pushing any product to its highest end required more investment. You pay a premium for that extra grade of quality.Verve, which is based in Santa Cruz, Calif., also has locations in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo, each one airy, laid back and elegant, in California style. The setting is a part of Verve\u2019s equation: It signal that the coffee is premium, and also gives customers a nice place to sit.Mr. Konecny is following a different formula. If Verve and other high-end shops identify with the world of gastronomy, Locol looks to street culture. \u201cThere\u2019s something about street wear in particular, where a kid from around here and a billionaire getting off a private jet are both wearing the same thing,\u201d he said. His vision is for Yes Plz to be the shaded part on a Venn diagram where the tastes of wildly different demographics converge.That\u2019s why there is no gastro-sermonizing at Locol, no talk of farms or varieties. The coffee on the menu is either hot or cold, and served with a cheerful lack of ceremony.Still, the information is there for those who want it: A dedicated Twitter feed will relay details of that week\u2019s coffees. \u201cPeople who want to go down the rabbit hole can, but it\u2019s not what we put on the bag,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to buy into a set of conceits about how to buy or understand coffee to enjoy it.\u201dThe way Mr. Konecny sees it, good, inexpensive coffee can and should be everywhere, and not just at Locol: \u201cWhat we know about coffee sourcing, coffee roasting, coffee brewing, coffee service \u2014 there\u2019s really no reason why you couldn\u2019t make the coffee at every bodega taste good.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Republicans Making Tax Reform So Hard?", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsIn the aftermath of the health care blowup, President Trump and the Republicans need a legislative victory. Tax reform probably should have gone first, but now is the time to move it forward with urgency.Unfortunately, the White House seems all over the map on the subject. One day there is a trial balloon for a value-added tax. The next, the idea of a carbon tax or a reciprocal tax. And now we are hearing the curve ball of a payroll tax cut. Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has thrown cold water on the idea of any tax bill meeting the August deadline.One sure lesson from the health care setback is the old admonition \u201cKeep it simple, stupid.\u201d The Republicans tried to fix the trillion-dollar health insurance market instead of keeping the focus on repealing Obamacare.They have a chance to make amends with a new tax bill and still hit the August deadline. We advised President Trump during his election campaign and we believe the Republican Party\u2019s lesson for tax reform is this: Don\u2019t try to rewrite the entire tax code in one bill.Instead, the primary goal of Mr. Trump\u2019s first tax bill should be to fix the federal corporate and small-business tax system, which has made America increasingly uncompetitive in global markets and has reduced jobs and wages here at home. The White House and the Treasury already have a tax plan that we were involved with last year. The three most important planks of that plan are:First, cut the federal corporate and small-business highest tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, which is now one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.Second, allow businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of their capital purchases. Full expensing of new factories, equipment and machinery will jump-start business investment, which since 2000 has grown at only one-third the rate recorded from 1950 to 2000.Third, impose a low tax on the repatriation of foreign profits brought back to the United States. This could attract more than $2 trillion to these shores, raising billions for the Treasury while creating new jobs and adding to the United States\u2019 gross domestic product.To help win over Democratic votes in the House and Senate, we would also suggest another component: What many workers across the country want most from President Trump is infrastructure funding. As part of this bill, we should create a fund dedicated to rebuilding America\u2019s roads, highways, airports and pipelines, and modernizing the electric grid and broadband access \u2014 financed through the tax money raised from repatriation of foreign profits.As much as possible, this bill should include private financing for projects like toll roads and energy drilling. We also favor \u201cuser pays\u201d financing, such as toll roads, and we would oppose any Fannie Mae-type financing structure for projects that would put taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of billions in potential losses.For this strategy to work, Republicans need to take several steps. First, President Trump and Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, should stop insisting on \u201crevenue neutrality.\u201d In the short term, the bill will add to the deficit. But President Trump\u2019s tax bill, like those of Presidents Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy, should be a tax cut, and it should be sold to the American people as such.We should emphasize that business tax relief is not a sellout to corporations but a boon for middle-class workers. A study by the Tax Foundation and Kevin A. Hassett, then at the American Enterprise Institute and now the chairman of President Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, found that middle-class wages rise when business taxes fall.The additional increase in real wages could be nearly 10 percent over the next decade, which would reverse 15 years of income stagnation for the working class in America. And, if we are right that tax cuts will spur the economy, then the faster economic growth as a result of the bill will bring down the deficit.Next, Republicans should abandon the so-called border-adjustable tax. A border tax is a poison pill for the tax plan: It divides the very business groups that the party needs to rally behind tax reform. Retailers like Walmart will never go along. A carbon tax would be even worse. The best way to bring jobs back to America is to simply lower tax rates now while rolling back anti-jobs regulations, such as rules that inhibit American energy production.As for fixing the maddeningly complex individual income tax system \u2014 lowering tax rates and ending needless deductions \u2014 we are all for it, but that should wait until 2018. Jobs and the economy are the top priority to voters.Republicans need to act with some degree of urgency. The financial markets and American businesses are starting to get jittery over the prospect that a tax cut won\u2019t get done this year. A failure here would be negative for the economy and the stock market and could stall out the \u201cTrump bounce\u201d we have seen since the president\u2019s election.Mr. Trump should demand that Congress send him a jobs bill this summer that he can sign into law on Aug. 13, 2017. That is the day President Reagan signed his historic tax cut in 1981 at his beloved Ranch del Cielo in Santa Barbara, Calif.That tax cut and President Kennedy\u2019s before it unleashed two of the longest periods of prosperity in American history, and that is a result Donald Trump should want to replicate.Steve Forbes, Larry Kudlow, Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore, co-founders of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, advised the Trump presidential campaign on economic policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s a Good Time to Trade Your Student Debt for Home Debt", "Date": "2017-04-28", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserFannie Mae, which buys home loans originated by lenders that meet its standards, said Tuesday that it was easing the path for student loan borrowers \u2014 and those who may have co-signed such loans \u2014 in three ways, said Jonathan Lawless, vice president for customer solutions at Fannie Mae.Mr. Lawless declined to provide specific numbers for refinancings under the SoFi test, but said there was strong interest among other lenders in offering the option.The broadened refinance program should help not just students who borrowed money for themselves, he said, but also parents who borrowed on behalf of their children or who co-signed for a loan. Private student loans \u2014 those made not by the government, but by banks or other lenders \u2014 typically require co-signers. In all, about 8.5 million people could potentially benefit from the expanded program, he said.Second, borrowers applying for a mortgage may now exclude debt being paid by others \u2014 say, credit cards or student loans being paid off by a parent or an employer \u2014 from their applications. That helps give them a better debt-to-income ratio \u2014 an important criterion in a loan application \u2014 and one that makes it more likely they will qualify for a mortgage.Finally, another change helps student borrowers who are on flexible payment programs, which tie monthly loan payments to a borrower\u2019s income. Previously, Fannie Mae required lenders to factor in higher monthly loan payments, rather than the borrower\u2019s lower, flexible payments, when calculating an applicant\u2019s debt-to-income ratio, which made it harder to qualify for a mortgage.Now, Mr. Lawless said, lenders may use the lower payment, which should help more borrowers qualify for home loans. (The rationale for the change, he said, is that if a borrower\u2019s flexible payments were to increase, it would be because his or her income had increased.) More than five million student loan borrowers are on flexible payment programs.Such \u201cnuances,\u201d he said, have been \u201cpushing people out of the box who should be in the box.\u201d Over all, Mr. Lawless said, people with student loans are a \u201cmuch safer cohort\u201d because they have made an investment in their education.Here are some questions and answers:Are there any risks with trading student loan debt for mortgage debt?Student loans are unsecured, while a mortgage is secured by a home. If all goes well with a refinancing, consumers wind up paying less, said Persis Yu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. But, she said in an email, if borrowers run into financial trouble, \u201cin the worst-case scenario, consumers may lose their homes.\u201dFederal student loans come with consumer protections, like flexible repayment options and the ability to request a deferment if the borrower encounters financial trouble. When the loans are refinanced into a new mortgage, those protections go away.Private student loans, however, typically lack those protections.What are current interest rates on student loans?The current rate for federal undergraduate loans is 3.76 percent; the rate for federal Plus loans, for parents of undergraduates or for graduate students, is 6.31 percent. (Rates are set each spring and take effect July 1, so those rates may change for the next academic year.)Borrowers with older loans, however, may have much higher rates, so those borrowers may see more benefit from refinancing. And private student loans typically carry higher rates \u2014 sometimes, in double digits.Mortgage rates have been fluctuating, but are still historically low. This week, the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was just above 4 percent, compared with 3.97 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac\u2019s weekly report. A year ago, the average was 3.66 percent.When do the new Fannie Mae rules take effect?The changes are effective immediately.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stop Treating Liberia\u2019s President Like a Hero. She\u2019s a Human.", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorShe lost most of her family to the disease. She was also infected, but she recovered to return to the clinical front lines to care for hundreds of other patients. Earlier this year in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, she died from complications of childbirth.Her death draws new attention to the governing structure in Liberia. The scope of the dysfunction that Ebola revealed is beyond what can be chalked up simply to being a weak state in West Africa. In 2014, Nigeria logged about 18,500 face-to-face visits to stop its few Ebola cases cold. Neighboring Sierra Leone, which had a higher number of initial infections than Liberia, ultimately experienced fewer Ebola deaths.But Liberian health systems under Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first woman to be elected president of an African nation, were overwhelmed by the outbreak. Just 50 doctors at that time served Liberia\u2019s 4.3 million people. Sluggish education and quarantine efforts failed because of widespread mistrust of the government, and particularly Ms. Johnson Sirleaf.Elected president in 2005, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf has become a sainted figure in development circles: pioneering politician, canny economic strategist, rightful recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize. Her story is often yoked to that of Liberia\u2019s \u201cmarket women\u201d and other female civil society leaders in Liberia like Mary Broh, Grace Kpaan and Leymah Gbowee, who rose to influence with less fanfare. Female political participation proved vital to Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s victorious coalition in 2005.In retrospect, tethering Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s story to feminist energy feels superficial. What use is women\u2019s empowerment when neglected health systems can so easily snuff out women\u2019s lives?Ms. Karwah died 11 years after Ms. Johnson Sirleaf vowed to make reducing Liberia\u2019s high maternal mortality rate one of her top priorities. Her death resulted in part from continued ignorance about and stigmatization of Ebola survivors, despite Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s loud proclamations of a renaissance in health care preparedness. Her passing speaks to the execution gap that has defined Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s tenure in office, and the complicity of international elites in ignoring it.The Ebola crisis is often presented as an epilogue to a broadly successful and inspiring feminist political career. However, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s early history as a crusader for reform has been tarnished by a decade of rule in which her judgment and integrity have been repeatedly called into question. Official corruption continues to be a constant source of local headlines and outrage. It doesn\u2019t help that her stepson runs the Liberian National Security Agency, another son is chairman of the Central Bank and yet a third ran the national oil corporation.According to the nonprofit group Global Witness, which works for stricter money-laundering rules, one son, along with the chairman of Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s Unity Party, are on a long list of Liberian officials linked to a bribery scandal run on behalf of a British mining company. While laws exist to fight corruption in Liberia, enforcement in fact is so irregular as to be seen as political. Ms. Gbowee, the Liberian activist who shared the Nobel with Ms. Johnson Sirleaf, resigned from a government post to protest what she saw as the president\u2019s tolerance for self-dealing and graft.Progress in a post-conflict state may be graded on a curve. But the West\u2019s adulation of Ms. Johnson Sirleaf seems to persist without any consideration as to whether she upholds liberal democratic values. Likewise, the gap between Liberians\u2019 perception of Ms. Johnson Sirleaf and her international reputation is rarely given a fair hearing.Indeed, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s global stature has risen based not on credibility with her people but on endorsements from international institutions like Harvard, Citibank and the World Bank and figures like George Soros, Bono and Warren Buffett. Which is why, in 2014, as Ebola deaths began to accumulate, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s initial focus was on ensuring the epidemic not be described as a humanitarian crisis so as not to spook foreign investors.At the same time, jaded Liberians ignored Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s calls to action, seeing them as an opportunistic way to get money from international donors. As aid groups like Doctors Without Borders coordinated the local and global responses, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf made a belated plea to President Barack Obama for the American military intervention that helped bring the Liberian epidemic to heel.Few African leaders have a Rolodex like Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s. But her reliance on foreign support and tolerance for corruption has stunted local capacity and jeopardized health outcomes in Liberia. Today, it\u2019s estimated that more than 50 percent of Liberian health services are provided by nongovernmental organizations rather than by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. Despite millions of dollars in annual donor budget support, up to 35 percent of health care is financed out of pocket from Liberia\u2019s population.In the year before the Ebola crisis, more than 20,000 government health care workers went on strike, saying they had gone unpaid for months at a time, and the strikes have recurred regularly since then. More recently, several workers at John F. Kennedy Medical Center, the largest referral hospital in Liberia, were indicted on a charge of stealing more than $100,000 allocated for hospital services. And although the country has made progress since its civil war, Liberia still lags the world in keeping women like Ms. Karwah alive in childbirth.Still, last September, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health honored Ms. Johnson Sirleaf, alongside Bono, as a public health \u201cvisionary.\u201dFor citizens from France to South Korea to the United States stunned by ethical and functional lapses in their political establishment, one instinct is to take to the streets to pressure those in power. Another is to wait for an election and vote for new leadership, which Liberians will have the chance to do in October.The real antidote, however, may be to call out the elites, domestic and international, who lower the bar for leadership out of politeness, expedience or indifference.Dayo Olopade is the author of \u201cThe Bright Continent: Breaking Rules and Making Change in Modern Africa.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Uncertainties and a sense that mainstream parties have failed to offer solutions to the country\u2019s economic anemia have left the National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, better positioned than at any other time in its 45-year history._____Ms. Le Pen sought to sanitize the image of the National Front and distance the party from the uglier associations of Europe\u2019s far right. The efforts seemed to have paid off, but the news that two of her associates had longtime links to Nazi sympathizers and the party\u2019s campaign finance scandals raised new doubts._____The issue of French identity and heritage is at the heart of the presidential campaign.

Mandating such credentials, they say, only makes child care even less affordable and reduces the supply and diversity of people able to do the job.One of the challenges in assessing the policies is that there has never been a large high-quality study, like a controlled trial that randomly placed children in a classroom with a college-educated teacher or not \u2014 and that also controlled for other variables that influence quality.Many studies have looked at whether teacher education is correlated with quality programs, and they have mostly found that it is.Still, it\u2019s impossible to disentangle whether the teachers\u2019 degrees caused the quality to improve or, more likely, whether it was a combination of factors, including compensation, class size, teacher-student ratios, classroom atmosphere, curriculum, leadership and continuing education. The studies have also not answered whether a teacher\u2019s major makes a difference, or if a four-year degree is more helpful than a two-year one.\u201cCompensation policy has to go along with this,\u201d Mr. Barnett said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, then really there isn\u2019t any reason to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He has also been far more web savvy than his rivals, running what may be France\u2019s first viral campaign.When French voters go to the polls on Sunday for the first round of elections, they will do so after a campaign that has moved beyond rallies and other traditional events and migrated online for the first time. With some polls showing as many as 30 percent of the voters still undecided, every vote will count \u2014 and so will every \u201clike.\u201dFar-right websites, an ecosystem often referred to as the Fachosph\u00e8re, have long given oxygen to Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front, which was the first French party to create a website. And the left has traditionally had intense ideological debates in the mainstream news media.In this campaign, however, in which the left is split among several candidates, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, a former Trotskyite and longtime Socialist senator before breaking ranks, has more YouTube followers than any rival and a league of active online supporters eager to jump on critics.That\u2019s especially true on the left, where voters are deciding among Mr. M\u00e9lenchon; Mr. Macron, a 39-year-old centrist, former banker and finance minister under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a Socialist; and Beno\u00eet Hamon, a Socialist who comes from the party\u2019s leftist wing and whose flagging campaign represents that party\u2019s implosion.Enter the video game. The idea for Fiscal Kombat came from Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s grass-roots supporters, who created an online community, Le Discord Insoumis, or \u201cDefiant Discord\u201d \u2014 using the Discord gaming software \u2014 to debate ideas and find new ways to push his program. That program includes taking France out of NATO, renegotiating its treaties with the European Union, eliminating nuclear power, raising taxes and capping wages.In the final weeks of the campaign, those supporters have been out in force. When the satirical cartoonist Joann Sfar took to his own Facebook page, which has 33,000 followers, to criticize Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, he was attacked by M\u00e9lenchon supporters.\u201cThat creates a dynamic in the country that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople are really keyed up and comment a lot.\u201dOsons Causer and Usul are no fans of Mr. Hamon, the socialist, but they seem to have particular antipathy toward Mr. Macron, whom they see as the establishment candidate, a dynamic not unlike how supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders viewed his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.\u201cIt\u2019s our moment,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Lambert, one of three founders of Osons Causer, who are 28 to 30 years old and attended Paris\u2019s Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV, as did Mr. Macron.

{"Headline": "Plan to Cut Funding for Biomedical Research Hits Opposition in Congress", "Date": "2017-04-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A proposal by President Trump to cut federal spending for biomedical research by 18 percent \u2014 just months after Congress approved bipartisan legislation to increase such spending \u2014 has run into a buzz saw on Capitol Hill, with Republicans and Democrats calling it misguided.\u201cI\u2019m extremely concerned about the potential impact of the 18 percent cut,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for the National Institutes of Health. \u201cThis committee and certainly me, personally, will be very hesitant\u201d to go along with the proposal, he added.Mr. Cole said he took \u201cconsiderable pride\u201d in the fact that Congress doubled the health institutes\u2019 budget from 1998 to 2003 and increased it again in the 21st Century Cures Act, a biomedical research bill approved last year with broad bipartisan support.Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said the proposed cuts could have \u201ccatastrophic results\u201d for patients and researchers.Mr. Trump is asking Congress to provide $25.9 billion for the National Institutes of Health for the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1. That represents a cut of $5.8 billion, or 18 percent, from the agency\u2019s current spending level of $31.7 billion. A week after making that proposal, Mr. Trump told Congress that he wanted to cut spending at the N.I.H. by $1.2 billion in the current fiscal year, mostly by reducing research grants.While the agency does some research in its own laboratories, it distributes most of its funds to scientists around the country who are investigating cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, AIDS and other illnesses, as well as basic science that has no known link to a particular disease.\u201cOnly in Washington do you literally judge the success of something by how much money you throw at the problem, not actually whether it\u2019s solving the problem or coming up with anything,\u201d said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, said the government could achieve huge savings next year without harming lifesaving research by paring back payments to universities for overhead \u2014 the \u201cindirect costs\u201d of research financed by the health institutes.These include the cost of utilities, internet service, data storage, the construction and upkeep of laboratories, disposal of hazardous waste and compliance with federal rules protecting human subjects of clinical research.\u201cAbout 30 percent of the grant money that goes out is used for indirect expenses, which, as you know, means that that money goes for something other than the research that\u2019s being done,\u201d Mr. Price said.But researchers said the remark showed a fundamental misunderstanding of the way biomedical research is conducted.\u201cIndirect costs are very real costs,\u201d said Dr. Landon S. King, the executive vice dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cThere is not another source to pay for them. The kinds of cuts that are being suggested would almost certainly harm our ability to conduct this research.\u201dThe health institutes distributed more than $23.5 billion last year to outside researchers, of which nearly $6.6 billion, or 27.9 percent, was for indirect costs.Johns Hopkins, one of the largest recipients of N.I.H. funds, is getting $600 million from the agency this year, of which $96 million is for indirect costs, Dr. King said. The medical school is receiving $450 million of the total, including $70 million for indirect costs.Because the grants go to every state, a small, well-connected army of researchers is mobilizing to beat back Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal.The president\u2019s budget also proposes \u201ca major reorganization\u201d of the institutes to focus on \u201cthe highest-priority research and training activities.\u201d The White House said Mr. Trump wanted \u201cconsolidations and structural changes\u201d at the agency, which now has 27 institutes and centers, each with its own broadly defined mission.Most of the institutes were established or authorized by Congress. More than a dozen buildings on the agency\u2019s 310-acre campus in Bethesda, Md., are named for lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats alike, who pumped tens of billions of dollars into the agency and championed its work.Kelvin K. Droegemeier, the vice president for research at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, said the government and universities had a shared interest in research and historically shared the costs.\u201cIndirect cost payments are not funny money or a slush fund,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are reimbursements for money that universities have already spent. On paper, it looks as if you could save a lot of money by cutting federal reimbursements. In fact, you would just be shifting more of the costs to universities, which cannot afford it. State revenues are very problematic these days, and raising tuition is not at all palatable.\u201dArthur Bienenstock, an emeritus professor at Stanford and an expert on science policy, said the proposal made him worry about the future of research.\u201cThe net impact would be a significant decline in biomedical research, and its centralization in a small number of universities,\u201d he said. \u201cResearch would shift away from public universities and less well-endowed private universities, toward well-endowed private universities like Harvard and Stanford.\u201dRepresentative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, said that private nonprofit groups paid a much smaller share of the indirect costs for research they supported.\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting that the private sector doesn\u2019t hold these indirect costs to be so valuable as to pay them,\u201d Mr. Harris said, \u201cbut when the taxpayer dollar\u2019s involved, somehow we do.\u201dThe Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said in September that federal agencies needed to improve their internal controls \u201cto help protect N.I.H. funds against fraud, waste and abuse\u201d in the computation of indirect costs. The auditors did not cite any improper payments, but the health institutes agreed to tighten their procedures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do Tax Cuts Really Spur Growth? It Depends on the Details.", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byIf your tax rate were lowered tomorrow, how would it affect your work habits?Maybe you would work harder \u2014 put in longer hours, take on special projects, do everything you can to get that next promotion. After all, lower taxes would mean you get to keep more of each dollar you earn.Or maybe you would work less. After all, if you are happy with your current standard of living, lower taxes would mean that you could maintain it while putting in fewer hours at the office. Who needs that promotion when you\u2019re able to keep more of the money you already make?Or possibly you would work exactly the same amount, because life is too short to sit around making every decision based on what is in the tax code.That little mental exercise \u2014 and the fact that reasonable people may choose any of the options \u2014 helps explain why the Trump administration\u2019s plans to induce stronger economic growth by cutting taxes won\u2019t necessarily work.At the core of decades of Republican economic policy is a simple idea: Cutting taxes will unleash investments and lead to higher incomes, more jobs and more rapid growth. And there are historical episodes that would seem to support that idea, most notably when Ronald Reagan cut taxes in the early 1980s, and the economy boomed in the years that followed.But there\u2019s considerably less evidence that this cause-and-effect applies at all times and at all places. George W. Bush\u2019s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were followed by years of disappointing growth. Bill Clinton\u2019s tax increases in 1993 were followed by a boom that surpassed the Reagan-era expansion.In a large body of academic research on this question, it seems that the exact time period and country examined and how tax changes are measured matters a lot \u2014 as does what the government does with the revenue.For example, the economists Robert J. Barro and Charles J. Redlick looked at the relationship, studying the United States from 1912 to 2006, and found that cutting the average marginal tax rate on Americans by 1 percentage point raised the next year\u2019s per-person economic output by about 0.5 percent.But research across time periods and countries shows more ambiguous results.\u201cThe basic finding in the literature is that it\u2019s very hard to detect a robust impact from changing taxes to growth,\u201d said Andrew Samwick, a Dartmouth economist who co-wrote a review of the evidence. \u201cIf you look across countries, unless they\u2019re actually out there confiscating assets through their tax system, you don\u2019t find a strong relationship.\u201dIn other words, there are countries with high or rising taxes that have strong growth, and countries with low or falling rates that don\u2019t.Part of that has to do with the many factors that go into economic growth that have nothing to do with taxes, including demographic change and technological advances (or lack thereof), which makes trying to isolate the impact of tax changes tricky. But it also ties to the importance of understanding how tax cuts may fuel growth \u2014 and the limits of those channels.If the government lowers income taxes on individuals, it changes the incentives for them to work and spend \u2014 going back to the conundrum of how a tax cut may affect your working behavior.If individual income tax rates are lowered and it leads people, in the aggregate, to work more hours or strive harder for a promotion, secure in the knowledge they will keep a bigger chunk of higher earnings, then it could increase the productive potential of the economy \u2014 and more people working more hours with higher productivity means higher economic growth.If the reverse effect prevails \u2014 people needing to work less to support themselves thanks to lower taxes \u2014 a tax cut could even cause lower growth, in theory.But the possible effects on peoples\u2019 work habits are just one of the ways tax policy ripples through the economy.Although many conservative arguments around the pro-growth effects of income tax tend to focus on the marginal rate \u2014 how much people must pay on each incremental dollar of income they receive \u2014 there are also situations where cutting other rates to leave more money in peoples\u2019 pockets matters.When the economy is in recession, both conservative and liberal economists have argued that tax rebates (like one supported by George W. Bush in 2001) or reductions in the payroll tax (which were a part of Barack Obama\u2019s stimulus efforts in 2009) can help support demand in the economy and promote short-term growth.But the more you game out the various ways taxes can affect the economy, the more obvious it becomes why the economic impact of tax cuts is so uncertain and subject to debate.For one thing, taxes exist for a purpose \u2014 funding the government \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t help much to look at one side of the government\u2019s ledger, taxes, without also looking at the other, spending.That is to say, in assessing the economic impact of taxes, it helps to know what the tax money is going toward. If taxes are raised to pay for programs that increase the productive capacity of the country \u2014 programs that make workers more efficient, or infrastructure projects that have long-lasting benefits \u2014 the net effect on growth is more likely to be positive than if the projects that tax increases pay for are wasteful.And even if tax cuts are funded by bigger budget deficits instead of spending cuts, taxpayers are still footing the bill in one way or another. Higher public debt amounts to a burden that taxpayers will face over time as they pay back interest and principal on that debt, and arguably higher debt levels could crowd out private sector investment by pushing interest rates higher.Indeed, you could argue that the liberals\u2019 and conservatives\u2019 differences on taxes is less a technocratic debate over optimal taxation but a proxy war for a bigger philosophical argument on the role of government.\u201cA lot of the debate about taxes is really a debate about spending,\u201d said Leonard E. Burman, who studies tax policy at the Urban Institute. \u201cWhat is the role of government, and what is the value of government spending? Those tend to be the real underlying question.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say that different taxes are likely to have different implications for growth. While economists are divided on whether the corporate income tax is ultimately borne more by shareholders or by workers, it\u2019s fairly straightforward math that a lower tax rate on businesses lowers the threshold at which companies can justify capital investments, which over time should lead to greater investment.Conversely, consumption taxes, like the sales taxes charged by many states or value-added taxes charged in many countries around the world, seem to cause less of a drag on growth than taxes on income and investment. After all, they don\u2019t tax work or investment, the roots of economic growth.And even most die-hard liberals would agree that taxes can be damaging to the economy if they are overly complex to comply with, erratically enforced, or set at levels so high that the incentive to evade them is high. The dispute, of course, is what would count as too complex or too high.\u201cTax increases associated with productive investments can help growth, and deficit-financed tax cuts can harm growth,\u201d said Chye-Ching Huang, who studies taxes at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cSome people claim there\u2019s a broad consensus that tax cuts are good or bad, but there isn\u2019t one, because the question is too big. The answer to a question that imprecise is always going to be, \u2018It depends.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

More than 100 factories and shops were inundated. Water climbed knee-high in 20 minutes, wiping out inventory for dozens of businesses.Next door in Guangzhou, an ancient, mammoth port city of 13 million, helicopters and a fleet of 80 boats had to be sent to rescue trapped residents. Tens of thousands lost their homes, and 53 square miles of nearby farmland were ruined. The cost of repairs topped $100 million.Chen Rongbo, who lived in the city, saw the flood coming. He tried to scramble to safety on the second floor of his house, carrying his 6-year-old granddaughter. He slipped. The flood swept both of them away.A generation ago, this was mostly farmland. Three vital rivers leading to the South China Sea, along with a spider\u2019s web of crisscrossing tributaries, made the low-lying delta a fertile plain, famous for rice. Guangzhou, formerly Canton, had more than a million people, but by the 1980s, China set out to transform the whole region, capitalizing on its proximity to water, the energy of its people, and the money and port infrastructure of neighboring Hong Kong.HUADUZENGCHENGGUANGDONGPROVINCELUOGANGBAIYUNTIANHEGuangzhouHUANGPUHAIZHULIWANDongguanFoshanPANYUNANSHAHUADUGUANGDONGPROVINCEZENGCHENGBAIYUNLUOGANGGuangzhouTIANHEHUANGPUHAIZHULIWANDongguanFoshanPANYUNANSHAHUADUGUANGDONGPROVINCELUOGANGBAIYUNTIANHEGuangzhouHUANGPUHAIZHULIWANFoshanPANYU1990199219941996199820002002200420082010201220142016Rushing to catch up after decades of stagnation, China built a gargantuan collection of cities the size of nations with barely a pause to consider their toll on the environment, much less the future impact of global warming. Today, the region is a goliath of industry with a population exceeding 42 million.While it is difficult to attribute any single storm or heat wave to climate change, researchers say there is abundant evidence that the effects of climate change can already be seen \u2014 in higher water levels, increasing temperatures and ever-more severe storms.And climate change not only poses a menace to those who live and work here, or to the immense concentration of wealth and investment. It is also a threat to a world that has grown dependent on everything produced in the area\u2019s factories.The rising South China Sea and the overstressed Pearl River network lie just a meter or so below much of this new multitrillion-dollar development \u2014 and they are poised to drown decades of progress, scrambling global supply chains and raising prices on a world of goods like smartphones, T-shirts, biopharmaceuticals and even the tiny springs inside your ballpoint pens.China is now the world leader in domestic investment in renewable energy, and over the past decade the central authorities in Beijing have made environmental performance a higher priority for civil servants. But stronger mandates haven\u2019t yet overcome the pace of expansion, a decentralized fiscal system, lax enforcement and a culture that frequently pits growth against green. The country continues to consume as much coal as the rest of the world combined, and to increase its steel capacity.Here in Guangdong Province, all the new cars, the concrete and the belching factories spike temperatures, endangering sick and elderly people, creating urban heat islands and incubating pandemics like dengue fever, an outbreak of which slammed Guangzhou in 2014, afflicting 47,000 people.In the meantime, the costs of inaction rise like the tides and temperatures.One afternoon, I met Cai Yanfeng at a Starbucks in Shenzhen. The Starbucks occupies a ground-floor corner in a factory complex where her parents used to work, now converted into high-end rental lofts and art galleries. Fashionable young Chinese sipped Frappuccinos and stared at smartphones.Shenzhen was still a sleepy fishing village of some 35,000 during the late 1970s when the Chinese authorities declared it a Special Economic Zone, bringing in huge investments and waves of migrants from the countryside who have helped make what today is a metropolis of 11 million. Ms. Cai arrived during the early 1980s as a toddler with her parents. Now trained as an urban designer, she has seen the city\u2019s evolution and, at 36, is a relative old-timer.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.She was recalling her childhood, when she would cross the street up the block from where the Starbucks is now to play in the mangrove swamps hugging the bay. Ms. Cai gestured out the window, as if pointing at something, although the world she was conjuring up had long ago vanished. Today, the street she used to cross is the size of an American Interstate. Where the mangroves started, not far from the Starbucks, a hospital campus flanks a shopping mall. The mangroves were ripped out and bulldozed, replaced by landfill, and smothered by acres of concrete, asphalt, office towers, high-rise apartments and industrial development.\u201cIt started with amusement parks along the beach,\u201d Ms. Cai remembered. \u201cThen the city built another big road near the sea, with the area filled in between with residential blocks. Things sped up after that.\u201dThe destruction of the wetlands where Ms. Cai once played is now one of the region\u2019s biggest climate challenges. Mangroves provide a natural buffer from the sea, shielding the coastline, reducing the impact of waves and rising water, filtering out salt that can infiltrate freshwater reserves, absorbing exceptional quantities of carbon and lowering ambient temperatures. But about 70 percent of the mangrove forests in Shenzhen are gone. And their disappearance is accelerating: 2,100 acres paved over between 1979 and 1985; 6,700 more acres during the next decade; thousands and thousands more since.Recently, Chinese officials announced plans to add yet another 21 square miles of landfill along Shenzhen\u2019s coast. The problem isn\u2019t just the destruction of mangroves. Landfill is notoriously vulnerable to rising waters. When Hurricane Sandy socked Lower Manhattan in 2012, it swamped streets built on landfill, peaking where the island\u2019s long-obscured natural shore had once been. In the end, nature always finds its level. Along the Huishen Highway in Shenzhen, rising seawater recently eroded a stretch of landfill three football fields long, leaving a shambles of asphalt and concrete. When a typhoon pounded the delta in 2008, a third of the sea wall in Zhuhai crumbled, letting water reach the city.By contrast, Zhuhai\u2019s nature preserve, where the mangroves had not been cut down, absorbed the brunt of the water and survived.In Shenzhen, I came across Xiyong Beach, which local fishermen say has been shrinking, gradually swallowed up by rising waters that experts here link to climate change. Chen Tegu, a professor in Guangzhou with the State Oceanic Administration, has been taking measurements since the mid-1980s, watching coastline disappear. Mr. Chen ticked off statistics about temperatures, storms and drought, predicting that the South China Sea could rise almost as much as a foot and a half by the end of this century.That increase, exacerbated by the sinking of the land, will mean more salt water infiltrating the delta, which, combined with drought, threatens drinking water. A drought several years ago caused water shortages for millions of delta residents, and five major saltwater incursions from the South China Sea have hit the region in the past 20 years alone. These incursions corrupt not only the water that people drink but also the water used by factories, corroding equipment and raising production costs, with ripple effects all along the distribution network. Local agricultural yields have been hurt as well. China has been building water treatment plants, but the pace hasn\u2019t kept up with the threat.I asked Ms. Cai whether she thought people in Shenzhen worried much about climate change. \u201cSome NGOs talk about it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut people here still focus on the economic side of things, on jobs and G.D.P. They care about whether we are a first-tier city yet. Are we beating Guangzhou?\u201dLiang Bo, who works for the Shenzhen Mangrove Wetlands and Conservation Foundation, agrees. I walked with her through a waterfront park that\u2019s more or less where Ms. Cai once played in the mangroves. Along the shore, garbage washed up on the rocks from the murky, gray water in the bay.\u201cIt\u2019s worse at low tide,\u201d Ms. Liang said. \u201cYou really see how filthy it has become.\u201d Because of all the landfill and new development, she said, water no longer flows in and out of the bay as it once did. So garbage gets trapped, stagnation gets worse, fish are killed off. That scenario is repeated throughout the delta, where small rivers and tributaries have been filled in and paved over to make way for new highways, office parks and housing developments, adding to the strains on an already inadequate system of drains and sewers.\u201cThe sea, the wetlands and mangroves used to be part of people\u2019s lives here,\u201d Ms. Liang pointed out. \u201cBut most of the people who live here now weren\u2019t around when the mangroves were still here. They see this park, which makes us more vulnerable to rising seas and typhoons, as they do all the tall buildings and highways. They equate it with progress.\u201d\u201cAir pollution is a direct challenge to people, it\u2019s right in their face,\u201d said Ma Jun, founder and director of the citizen-led Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s about the food they put on their table for their children. So they\u2019ve made noise, and things have changed in terms of air pollution policy by the Chinese authorities. On the other hand, climate change is happening at a different speed. Sea level rise is not something you easily notice.\u201dThis is the challenge everywhere. Storms, like hot days, happen all the time \u2014 and they have always happened. So people don\u2019t automatically chalk them up to climate change. Climate change is like the tortoise. Development is the hare. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t unique to China,\u201d Mr. Ma said. \u201cThere is no obvious, short-term solution to climate change problems, no clear strategy everybody agrees is what needs to happen to offset climate change. And there\u2019s no certainty about how to pay for what needs to be done. So there\u2019s reluctance to address the issue. What\u2019s the business model?\u201dThat\u2019s a trillion-dollar question, according to the World Bank, which projected the potential cost of damage to coastal cities worldwide from rising seas to be somewhere near that figure. It estimates that China is already losing 1.4 percent of its annual G.D.P. to climate change. Last spring, residents in Guangzhou woke again to flooded streets after a furious downpour swept across the delta and drowned entire neighborhoods of the city. Local news media, once more, said that there had been nothing like it in years. And as usual, Chinese social media sites buzzed with posts of people trapped in flooded cars. One man, named Pang, became an overnight celebrity for catching a fish with his umbrella, then going home and making soup with the head and tail. \u201cIt was fresh and tender,\u201d he told The Guangzhou Daily.Rains brutalized many other cities throughout southern China last year: More than 160 people were killed by drowning and landslides, dozens went missing, 73,000 homes collapsed and more than a million acres of farmland were destroyed. The death tolls from floods across China have actually been trending downward, thanks to improved emergency relief efforts. But the damage is increasingly felt in urban areas, where overdevelopment continues to outpace the country\u2019s appetite for climate change adaptation and natural disaster preparedness.That\u2019s partly because canals and waterways that once helped to drain cities like Guangzhou naturally have been filled in and paved over with concrete and asphalt. Especially in older, underserved areas, the infrastructure replacing the canals is shoddy. While Guangdong now claims more billionaires than any other province in the country, it is also home to millions of low-wage workers and migrants from the countryside who have settled in cheaper, poorly maintained neighborhoods, the crumbling legacy of humongous Socialist-era housing developments.Zhou Jianyun, an architect and professor who moved to Guangzhou as a student in the early 1980s, took me one day to see some of the older parts of the city most prone to flooding. We toured the area around what used to be the ancient city gates. Streets once lined with handsome covered pedestrian arcades from the 1930s have been widened into boulevards to make more room for cars. Farther west, older neighborhoods spill toward the Pearl River. In many ways, these neighborhoods, like Guangzhou\u2019s ancient villages \u2014 crowded, labyrinthine vestiges of old Canton now dwarfed by giant new shopping malls and housing complexes \u2014 are the liveliest parts of the city. But they are also more and more frequently underwater because they are near the river, inadequately protected and ill served by the outdated sewage system.To the east, an immense, modern district called Tianhe has risen from next to nothing in 30-odd years, its offices and apartment blocks now overshadowed by the super-tall skyscrapers of Guangzhou\u2019s Zhujiang New Town, with its opera house by Zaha Hadid and its signature Canton Tower. The picture-postcard image of New Town can bring to mind American downtowns from the late 20th century \u2014 cities like Atlanta or Phoenix, only glossier and on a vast scale. Advertised as more environmentally conscious than older parts of the city, with better flood protections, New Town is still a sprawling development conceived for cars and glass towers, with a carbon-heavy diet dependent on highways and air-conditioning.\u201cThe cities we now have are partly based on what we saw in American movies \u2014 on the dream of big malls, airports, highways and tall buildings,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cI belong to the generation that witnessed the biggest change. We had been almost like North Korea, closed off. Suddenly we could see American movies.\u201d\u201cThis became our idea of progress,\u201d he added. \u201cOnly we wanted to do everything bigger, because we thought that is what it meant to be modern. The actual needs of the real city are ignored.\u201d\u201cIn many ways, we are still living a dream,\u201d he said.Clearly, the region\u2019s future depends on whether, and how fast, Chinese officials redefine that concept of progress.\u201cChina\u2019s feelings about modernization keep changing,\u201d said Zhou Ming, an urban planner in Shenzhen who expressed some optimism for the future. We met one afternoon in the glittery hotel lobby at the top of KK100, a 1,400-foot skyscraper with a panoramic view that takes in Hong Kong.\u201cBefore the opening to the outside world, people didn\u2019t have food to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they focused on jobs and basic needs. Now wages are going up for workers, people are concerned about air pollution and they are starting to value traditional culture again, meaning neighborhoods that are human-scale and not just a bunch of skyscrapers. That\u2019s on top of pressure from international businesses whose employees care about environmental and climate issues and can decide whether they want to do business here.\u201dNot incidentally, some factories have been leaving Guangdong. Rising wages and threats of stiffer pollution standards have prompted less scrupulous manufacturers to move their businesses to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia, where regulations are weaker. In turn, those countries are repeating mistakes, related to climate change preparedness, that China is paying for now.But this exodus, seeking short-term profits, has also created an opportunity for China. Planners and environmentalists here talk about a chance to rebrand Guangdong Province as a global leader in green, cutting-edge industrial technology and urbanism \u2014 to go beyond token green skyscrapers and really get ahead of climate change. To make China the leading green global superpower.Prosperity will ultimately belong to cities and nations around the world that find ways to capitalize on strategies of resilience against the inevitable impact of climate change. Those cities will retool themselves for new technologies and global businesses whose employees, reflecting a growing worldwide generational shift, want to walk, ride bikes and take mass transit.China has demonstrated that it can be nimble and ingenious. Since 1997, Guangzhou has opened an entire new metro system with scores of stations, covering hundreds of miles; Shenzhen has done the same in only a dozen years. New York has barely managed to construct four subway stations in half a century.But little of this infrastructure in China was conceived in anticipation of extreme conditions and climate change. Rising waters repeatedly reduced train traffic in the delta to a crawl last year, halting ferry service on the Pearl River and turning several of the new subway stations into swimming holes.\u201cWhat climate change says is that if you want to maintain the city as a good place to live and work for everyone, business as usual won\u2019t do,\u201d said Robert J. Nicholls, a professor of coastal engineering at the University of Southampton in England. He helped write the World Bank report that warned of the fiscal impact of climate change on the Pearl River Delta. \u201cDisasters will become more likely. And the last thing the Chinese want is a Katrina event,\u201d he added, referring to the hurricane that devastated New Orleans in 2005.Flooding is not an insurmountable hurdle, he noted. The Chinese can build smarter cities \u2014 healthier, safer, more equitable and humane ones, with restored waterways and waterfronts, flood-proof buildings, wide-reaching air-pollution controls, earlier warning systems, levees that double as parks, retention ponds that provide recreation, neighborhoods less dependent on cars.\u201cThe challenge for the Chinese, as it is for so many others,\u201d he said, \u201cis taking the long view.\u201dWhich shouldn\u2019t really be so hard, considering the recent past. The government estimated regional losses from last summer\u2019s floods alone at $10 billion. For all of 2016, rainfall in China was 16 percent above average.That was the highest level in recorded history.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing and Guangdong Province.Map by Jeremy White.

{"Headline": "As China\u2019s Investors Rush In, Hong Kong Shares Take a Wild Ride", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Meitu had been a snoozer of a stock since listing in Hong Kong in December. Then investors from mainland China had a chance to buy in.Almost immediately, shares of Meitu, a Chinese smartphone app maker, jumped 80 percent in a week \u2014 then lost the gains nearly as fast. It briefly ranked as one of the most actively traded stocks in Hong Kong, overtaking blue-chip names like HSBC.What changed? Meitu became available to investors in mainland China in early March under a program linking stock markets there with Hong Kong.\u201cIt is obvious that the boom was driven by money from China,\u201d said one of those investors, Tan Xin, 35, a banker from Shanghai. Mr. Tan said he had invested in Meitu but cashed out early, selling before the stock peaked.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it would be such a high rise,\u201d he said.China has disrupted the prices of global assets as varied as real estate in Manhattan and copper in London. The latest example is Hong Kong\u2019s stock market, where new programs are allowing Chinese mom-and-pop retail investors to place bets outside mainland China.Some experts say those investors have played a role in some wild rides. In fact, those experts say, the presence of more mainland Chinese investors has made the Hong Kong market more volatile, adding to pressures that prompted the city\u2019s market officials in recent weeks to publicly defend its stability.Referring to some new investors from the mainland, he said, \u201cThe tourists don\u2019t know better.\u201dChina is slowly and fitfully lowering its financial barriers with the rest of the world, as Beijing tries to balance its desire for stability with its ambitions to have a much greater say in the global conversation about money. Hong Kong\u2019s experience shows that the process could involve spikes, drops and stumbles along the way, as vast sums of money \u2014 much of it controlled by people new to global finance \u2014 come to world markets.Because Hong Kong, a former British colony, operates outside China\u2019s limits on cross-border money flows and has long been a capital of global finance, the programs offered many Chinese investors their first chance to invest in global stock markets.Money can flow the other way, too. But the stock market crash in China two years ago and worries that its currency could fall in value have turned many overseas investors away from mainland stocks. Rather, the programs are drawing Chinese investors like Alex Nie, who says the mainland\u2019s stock market lacks bargains.Shanghai and Shenzhen shares \u201care overvalued,\u201d said Mr. Nie, 37, an employee in the advertising industry in Beijing who has been buying Hong Kong stocks for the last two years and who says he is a long-term investor. \u201cMany are not worth their prices,\u201d he said of mainland valuations.Many other Chinese stock investors bring a shorter-term mind-set. While private pension funds and mutual funds often steer stock markets in places like the United States, markets in China are more often swayed by amateur investors and well-heeled individuals willing to take big risks.What China has brought to the Hong Kong stock market is \u201cvery much a herd mentality,\u201d said Andrew Clarke, the head of trading in Hong Kong at the Mirabaud Group.\u201cIt\u2019s total speculation,\u201d Mr. Clarke said. \u201cPeople seize on these names, but it is not a form of investing.\u201d Instead, he added, \u201cStock Connect becomes the new Shanghai-Shenzhen casino.\u201d\u201cHong Kong Stock Connect has increased the volatility level of both Shanghai and Hong Kong markets,\u201d he said.Hong Kong has other attributes that encouraged China\u2019s hair-trigger traders. Compared with tightly controlled mainland markets, where stocks are permitted to rise or fall by a maximum of 10 percent a day, Hong Kong has fewer limits, and only on the biggest stocks, meaning hundreds more can double or fall to zero in minutes.All those factors can work against Chinese investors as well.Mainland investors were the biggest supporters of the stock the day it crashed, with buy trades from Shanghai through the Connect program accounting for more than a quarter of all turnover in the Hong Kong-listed stock before it was suspended from trading at midday. The identity of the investor or investors could not be determined.With Meitu, the Chinese app maker, the reasons for the sudden moves were less clear.The commission declined to comment. Gary Ngan, the chief financial officer of Meitu, said the company had not received notice of an investigation into the trading or been approached by regulators.Meitu, which had 520 million active monthly users as of January, allows people to create idealized versions of themselves for sharing on social media. With a swipe, users of the app can whiten their face, taper their jaw, widen their eyes or make themselves thinner. It is hugely popular in China, where the company claims half of all photos circulated on social media were created with the app.Mr. Ngan said the company had chosen to list in Hong Kong because it was the only place that provided broad access to a base of shareholders from foreign countries and, via the Stock Connect program, from mainland China.\u201cIn Hong Kong, everyone, both in China and overseas, can buy the stock and become our shareholder,\u201d he said.Still, the whipsaw trading has prompted some concern at Meitu.\u201cWe would have preferred our stock not to be that volatile,\u201d Mr. Ngan said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not something that we can control.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now, the Ball Is in John Roberts\u2019s Court", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported byEditorialOver the past two months, as the nation has watched a new president drop one depth charge after another \u2014 banning Muslim refugees; ordering the demolition of broadly accepted rules protecting air, water and American consumers; flouting conflict-of-interest and other ethical standards honored by his predecessors in office \u2014 Americans have looked to the courts, the one aspirationally nonpartisan branch of government left to them, to stop him.Yet of late their faith in the judiciary, including the Supreme Court, the system\u2019s ultimate arbiter, has been flagging. In 2000 before Bush v. Gore, a Gallup poll said that 62 percent of Americans thought the Supreme Court was doing a good job. By September 2016, after the court had divided along partisan lines on politically fraught decisions like Citizens United, the controversial and misguided campaign-finance ruling, and the Hobby Lobby case on mandated birth control coverage, its approval rating dropped to 45 percent. Add in Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s palling around with Dick Cheney and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s public trashing of President Trump during the campaign, and the court has come to be seen as increasingly and more openly partisan.It behooves him now to restate that commitment; everywhere else in government, toxic factionalism is the order of the day. On Thursday, in the Senate, neither party distinguished itself. In a cry of rage against the Republicans\u2019 nihilistic refusal in 2016 to grant even a hearing to Barack Obama\u2019s last nominee to the court, Democrats filibustered to block Neil Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s nominee to that stolen Supreme Court seat. They accomplished nothing. The Republicans immediately voted to change the chamber\u2019s rules, killing the filibuster in order to grant Judge Gorsuch an up-or-down vote. That removed the filibuster as a hurdle to all future Supreme Court nominees and, in the process, destroyed what had been a unique feature of the Senate that guaranteed broad-based support for appointees to the highest court in the land.This failure of vision from Senate leaders of both parties has now led the nation to a place where the fate of all Supreme Court nominees depends entirely on which party has a majority in the Senate. Provided their party controls that majority, presidents no longer will feel much need to select a moderate, impartial jurist \u2014 indeed, the politics of their base will push them, as it did Mr. Trump, in the opposite direction. If this situation stands \u2014 and there\u2019s no expectation it won\u2019t \u2014 it could shake the court system and the integrity of American jurisprudence to its core.It certainly does that, and something else as well: It dramatically raises the stakes for Chief Justice Roberts, and his early praise for justices \u201cwilling to put the good of the court above their own ideological agendas.\u201d Since he uttered those words, he has led his majority to 5-4 decisions that serve narrow conservative interests. If he continues along that factional path, the responsibility for corrosion of the rule of law will be his.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why \u2018Sorry\u2019 Is Still the Hardest Word", "Date": "2017-04-12", "News": "Supported by\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Two simple words, not so simply said.On Wednesday, the public representatives of two embattled American institutions \u2014 United Airlines and the White House \u2014 found themselves on national television grappling with a delicate and increasingly common ritual of the corporate and political worlds: the public apology.The fine art of repentance is a skill taught in business schools and promoted by high-priced consultants. But all kinds of offenders in public life still seem to struggle with the execution. Corporations like BP and Wells Fargo have faced criticism for dawdling responses to cascading crises, while politicians from Bill Clinton to Anthony Weiner have had difficulty admitting to peccadilloes.The key to contrition, according to public-relations experts, is projecting sincerity, humanity, and a plain-spoken demeanor \u2014 the better to convince a cynical public. And in this age of whipsawing social media, you had better do it fast.\u201cThe head of United should never have been allowed to take three swings at correcting and apologizing for an incident that was on more social media than Kim and Kanye\u2019s wedding,\u201d said Mortimer Matz, a New York consultant who has guided decades\u2019 worth of clients through crises small and large.United issued several halting statements about the plane episode, which first emerged Monday morning, before Mr. Munoz made his abject appearance on Wednesday on ABC. Mr. Matz said the airline had missed its moment.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a fast thinker in the digital age,\u201d said Mr. Matz, who will be 93 in July.This week, Mr. Spicer was quick to recognize the damage done by his ill-considered remarks, which prompted immediate denunciations on Twitter as well as calls for his resignation. He appeared on CNN within hours of his gaffe, while Mr. Munoz waited two days.Still, Mr. Spicer\u2019s apology came only after his office tried to clarify his remarks with several statements that, while remorseful, did not clearly admit error.\u201cThat shame and embarrassment was pretty palpable for me,\u201d he told the correspondent Rebecca Jarvis, emotion in his voice. \u201cThis can never \u2014 will never \u2014 happen again on a United Airlines flight. That\u2019s my premise and that\u2019s my promise.\u201d Later on Wednesday, United said it would refund the fares of all passengers on the affected flight.Both Mr. Munoz, who was named \u201ccommunicator of the year\u201d by PR Week magazine last month, and Mr. Spicer took pains to personalize their apologies. It\u2019s a technique that, conscious or not, is recommended by crisis experts.\u201cThat\u2019s on me, I have to fix that,\u201d Mr. Munoz said when asked about the airline policies that led to the violent ejection. Mr. Spicer described his blunder as \u201cmine to own, mine to apologize for, mine to ask forgiveness for.\u201d\u201cPeople want someone to throw the book at,\u201d said Katie Sprehe, a senior director at the communications firm APCO Worldwide.Ms. Sprehe, who studies reputation maintenance, said United had erred by not moving swiftly to mirror its customers\u2019 outrage.\u201cYou need to speak your stakeholders\u2019 language, and coming out with P.R. mumbo jumbo, like \u2018re-accommodate,\u2019 is the wrong thing to do,\u201d she said.Stu Loeser, an adviser to executives in the technology and finance industries, said that a high-profile apology must be considered in context.\u201cOscar Munoz answers to more than 85,000 employees who want to know that if they were the ones caught in a viral video maelstrom, he\u2019d back them up,\u201d said Mr. Loeser, who was press secretary to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York. \u201cSean Spicer ultimately answers to one person and one person only\u201d \u2014 Mr. Trump \u2014 \u201csomeone who sees backing down or apologizing as not only a weakness, but a character flaw.\u201d\u201cIn both cases,\u201d Mr. Loeser added, \u201cwhat might appear to be an irrational series of statements that got you into trouble makes more sense, when you think about who they\u2019re actually answering to.\u201dMr. Munoz ended his interview by saying he had no plans to resign. \u201cI was hired to make United better, and I\u2019ve been doing that, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll continue to do,\u201d he said. Mr. Spicer, asked by Ms. Van Susteren if he enjoyed being press secretary, said he loved it.\u201cI truly do believe it\u2019s an honor to have this job,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a privilege. And if you don\u2019t believe it, then you shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201dWhether the apologies outlive the gaffes remains to be seen. Ken Sunshine, who founded the public-relations firm Sunshine Sachs, said he was skeptical. \u201cMy rule?\u201d he said. \u201cYou get one shot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Aides\u2019 Disclosures Reveal Surge in Lucrative Political Work", "Date": "2017-04-02", "News": "Supported byMuch of the new business has come through \u201csuper PACs\u201d and political nonprofit groups whose fund-raising has soared since the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision in 2010. While such groups were once a modest sideline to campaign and lobbying work, the new campaign spending rules have allowed wealthy donors and their entourages to displace campaign managers and party leaders as the leading political power center.More such business has come from private foundations and ideologically oriented media companies linked to donors like the Mercers, who have invested in websites, documentaries and other endeavors to battle traditional news organizations. They have also formed political advisory operations to steer their giving and promote their influence.The figures reveal the extent to which private political work has bolstered the financial fortunes of Trump aides, who have made millions of dollars from Republican and other conservative causes in recent years, according to an analysis of the disclosure forms by The New York Times after they were transformed into a computerized database by the Center for Public Integrity.For the Trump aides, one potential drawback is that they will now take government salaries, which for many will amount to a cut in pay as they refrain from outside work to avoid conflicts. When their time in the administration ends, however, they could find even more riches waiting for them.The arrangement has been especially lucrative for insiders and key operatives with links to the biggest donors, and those closest to Mr. Trump, despite his campaigning on an anti-establishment message and his disparagement of business as usual in Washington.The White House did not respond to a request for comment from the aides included in this article.The list of income sources for those in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House reads like an encyclopedia of conservative wealth and influence. Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have earned money from right-leaning media organizations like Breitbart and Fox News, or from a firm set up by Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, to manage his speaking and television appearances. Several aides received payments from organizations backed by major conservative benefactors such as the Kochs or the Mercers. Others were paid for work on Republican campaigns, including Mr. Trump\u2019s or that of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a onetime rival.Among the clients that paid her at least $5,000 were the Tea Party Patriots, a group founded in 2009 to oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s health care and spending initiatives, and the Judicial Crisis Network, a nonprofit group that has spent millions of dollars, raised from wealthy donors, in an effort to reshape the federal court system.She advised nearly a dozen candidates on their campaigns, including Mr. Trump and Mike Pence, now the vice president. Ms. Conway also earned money from speaking appearances at conservative think tanks like the Alabama Policy Institute and the John Locke Foundation.Like many of her colleagues, Ms. Conway also profited from at least two Mercer endeavors: A super PAC called Keep the Promise, and Cambridge Analytica, which claims to provide \u201cpsychographic\u201d profiles that can predict the political leanings of each American adult.The Mercers are major investors in Breitbart News, and the filings provide a kind of map to the family\u2019s sprawling influence in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House.Those who have worked with the father-daughter donor powerhouse have described their charity as having a political bent: to fix what they see as the mistakes of the Obama presidency. That has meant providing funding to institutions, nonprofit organizations and businesses that promote small government, lower taxes and undoing the welfare state.With his own links to Breitbart and the Government Accountability Institute, as well as other ventures, Mr. Bannon has especially close ties to the Mercers. He reported a financial stake worth $1 million to $5 million in Cambridge Analytica, a stake he is now seeking to sell.Citizens United, a conservative group that was the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case of the same name, and is run by the political operative David Bossie, received $3.5 million from the Mercer Family Foundation between 2012 and 2014, according to the most recent public records. Mr. Bannon, Ms. Conway and Mr. McGahn all disclosed receiving pay from the group or its affiliates \u2014 in the case of Mr. Bannon, totaling $100,000.The disclosures also, for the first time, provide some visibility into how much Mr. Trump has been paying some of his most loyal employees, who have now moved with him to the White House.\u201cThis is an industry, a Washington industry, that is embedded into the political system, and the consultant class is making a fortune regardless of what views or candidates they represent,\u201d Mr. Wertheimer said. \u201cAnd it is a major factor in the cost of campaigns, and it is a group of people who are probably the biggest opponents of campaign finance reform in the system.\u201dReporting was contributed by Alexandra Stevenson, Nicholas Confessore, Jeremy Bowers and Sarah Cohen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Men Bet She Would Fail; Now She Runs a $26 Billion Fund", "Date": "2017-04-08", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe floor was definitely not a place for people who were cute, prim and proper,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said in a recent interview.Those who bet against her lost.Ms. Fitzpatrick began her career at O\u2019Connor & Associates, the Chicago firm that was later acquired by UBS as the Swiss bank\u2019s internal hedge fund. She rose to lead the firm and become one of Wall Street\u2019s most powerful women. Now, largely unknown outside the industry, Ms. Fitzpatrick faces her biggest and most public challenge yet: working for George Soros, the estimable octogenarian investor and philanthropist.Last Monday, she started as chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management, which manages around $26 billion of Mr. Soros\u2019s personal and family wealth. In taking the job, she follows in the footsteps of finance legends including Keith Anderson, a co-founder of BlackRock, and Stanley Druckenmiller, the billionaire investor. Even Steven Mnuchin, the new Treasury secretary, was once brought in to open a lending business.Mr. Soros himself is perhaps the finance world\u2019s most famous investor. In 1992, he made a $1 billion bet against the British pound. The trade came to be known as one that \u201cbroke the Bank of England\u201d when Mr. Soros\u2019s heavy selling of the country\u2019s currency helped prompt the government to devalue the pound.But since Mr. Druckenmiller left the firm in 2000, Soros Fund Management has churned through eight chief investment officers. It\u2019s a remarkable turnover for the top of any company, even among hedge funds, which are known for a cutthroat culture. It\u2019s even less typical in the sleepy world of family offices, where employees manage the assets of a single clan, which is how the Soros funds are now structured after years of accepting outside investor money.And Soros is not just another family office designed to maximize wealth. There is a direct link between the money that is made at Soros and its founder\u2019s philanthropic endeavors. Mr. Soros, now 86, is an outspoken supporter of Democrats including Hillary Clinton, and travels the world seeking to promote democracy. The $1 billion that Mr. Soros made betting against the British pound, for example, helped to support scientists in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union.Though Ms. Fitzpatrick is registered as a Republican, she appears unfazed that her investing acumen will in turn support Mr. Soros\u2019s activism. \u201cIf we do a good job in terms of generating returns, the impact the money created can have is tremendous, and that\u2019s really motivating,\u201d she said.Yet Ms. Fitzpatrick, 47, takes over at Soros at a moment of global uncertainty. Impending elections in France and Germany threaten to upset the status quo across Europe. The United States is only beginning to absorb the implications of Donald J. Trump\u2019s young presidency. Markets around the world are holding steady but seem liable to drop on any given day.Ms. Fitzpatrick is bullish. She believes stocks in the United States, having hit record highs, can rise higher still. But she attributes this optimism to what she says are fundamentally healthy companies, not investor giddiness over the Trump presidency. \u201cIn reality, if we had Hillary Clinton as our president, I think we\u2019d be here or higher,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said.At the height of the financial crisis of a decade or so ago, Ms. Fitzpatrick faced the biggest decision of her career. She had risen to become chief investment officer at O\u2019Connor, then a unit of UBS, and now had to steer the firm through a period of market upheavals that would leave some of the biggest names on Wall Street bankrupt.In the summer of 2008, Ms. Fitzpatrick received a call from Richard S. Fuld, then the chief executive of Lehman Brothers. Mr. Fuld acknowledged that Lehman\u2019s stock was tumbling, but he told Ms. Fitzpatrick it would recover and asked her not to pull the billions of dollars that O\u2019Connor had with the bank\u2019s prime brokerage, a division that lends stock and cash to hedge-fund clients for trading, in exchange for housing some of the funds\u2019 capital.Ms. Fitzpatrick had a quandary. If she maintained her balance and Lehman managed to survive, she would keep a relationship with a critical Wall Street partner. But if she kept her balance and Lehman went bankrupt, she would lose billions of dollars for UBS O\u2019Connor\u2019s clients.\u201cShe did something no one else did,\u201d recalled Michael Meyer, a former UBS O\u2019Connor employee who was there at the time. \u201cShe quickly assessed the situation with him and said: \u2018Dick, your stock is trading at $22. If the stock goes to $15, I\u2019m taking half out, and if the stock reaches $10, I\u2019m taking it all out,\u2019\u201d Mr. Meyer recalled.Ultimately, of course, Lehman failed, triggering some of the worst convulsions of the financial crisis and costing many investors billions. Ms. Fitzpatrick was able to avoid the worst of it, and saved the firm from getting trapped in years of bankruptcy proceedings. Other hedge funds that didn\u2019t pull their money were stuck in losing market positions, unable to use their money to make new trades.Though the episode left her shaken, it was the kind of quick thinking she had prepared for.Born and raised in Irvington, N.Y., Ms. Fitzpatrick was the middle child among five siblings who grew up in a cul-de-sac on a street bustling with young families. She spent much of her childhood competing with taller, stronger brothers and sisters who excelled at sports like basketball. By her own description, Ms. Fitzpatrick was \u201cshort and scrawny.\u201d Her father, she said, still jokes that she is the \u201crunt of the litter.\u201dEventually she found her stride. She turned to running, something she continues to do today, usually at 5 a.m. (She still holds the record for the 3,000 meter run at her high school.)A neighbor, Marty Atlas, nurtured her early interest in the markets, showing a teenage Ms. Fitzpatrick how stock tables worked. Even as a girl, her investing prowess was evident. \u201cI remember her playing Monopoly with all these other kids, and she ended up with all the hotels,\u201d Mr. Atlas said.Ms. Fitzpatrick quickly zeroed in on her goal for after college: Wall Street. \u201cIt was the one place where you could succeed beyond your wildest dreams,\u201d she recalled. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School with a bachelor of science degree in 1992, Ms. Fitzpatrick landed a job with O\u2019Connor & Associates as part of a junior group of American Stock Exchange clerks.She moved on to trade options for O\u2019Connor at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. There, groups of traders gathered in pits to buy and sell major trading contracts, yelling out their orders while gesticulating madly. Ms. Fitzpatrick, once again an outsider on a testosterone-heavy trading floor, mastered the jargon and the hand signals.It was in Chicago that Ms. Fitzpatrick learned just how cruel markets could be. In December 1994, an economic crisis was looming in Mexico that resulted in a swift and drastic devaluation of the Mexican peso. Ms. Fitzpatrick was covering a pit where so-called locals \u2014 traders who made bets with their own money \u2014 were exposed on the wrong side when the American Depository Receipts of Mexican companies moved suddenly. They lost everything.\u201cBasically overnight, these guys who I would stand next to from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day lost their homes, lost their marriages, just everything in a flash,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said. \u201cIt really left an indelible mark on me.\u201dIn the course of her career, Ms. Fitzpatrick has tangled with regulators. While chief investment officer of O\u2019Connor, Ms. Fitzpatrick oversaw the firm\u2019s $5.3 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over charges that from 2009 to 2011 it had bought stocks in companies\u2019 public offerings while also taking the opposite position, short-selling those same stocks. The bank denied wrongdoing. More than 23 firms were slapped with similar charges.\u201cDawn would see possible risks, multiple layers, beyond anyone else in the room,\u201d said Ross Margolies, the founder of Stelliam Investment Management, which Ms. Fitzpatrick and O\u2019Connor seeded in 2007. \u201cIt was almost like she was playing a game of three-dimensional chess.\u201dAs the first female chief investment officer at Soros, Ms. Fitzpatrick becomes a woman with few peers; most everyone managing such a large pot of money on Wall Street is a man.Ms. Fitzpatrick said that, on the whole, she has not felt discriminated against because of her gender in the workplace. At UBS, Ms. Fitzpatrick kept a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes under her desk but often walked around the office barefoot, a display of her confidence.\u201cClearly, there are single moments in time when I would have rather been a 6-foot-3 blond-haired ex-football-playing guy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut those tended to be offset by the times when I thought it was an advantage to be a woman.\u201dMs. Fitzpatrick says women have innately useful qualities when it comes to money management. \u201cOne of the things I believe women have more of is humility in their investments,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll cut losers quicker, in a more effective way, than generally men will.\u201d Indeed, some studies suggest that women are more successful risk managers than men.Yet Ms. Fitzpatrick has also caught herself masking her femininity to keep up with her male colleagues. Days after giving birth to her second child, she was on a flight to London for a meeting wearing several layers of Spanx, the tightfitting undergarments meant to conceal extra pounds.\u201cFrom my perspective, perceptions matter, and it was important for me that I was there,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to think I was anything but focused.\u201dSuch hard-driving ambition can be a distraction, too. A few years later, in the summer of 2008, Ms. Fitzpatrick was so consumed by her work that she didn\u2019t realize she was pregnant for several months. The financial crisis was beginning to unfold, and the markets were swinging violently. She was often sick to her stomach, and was also getting heavier, but she figured her discomfort was a result of her stress. Plenty of her peers were having visceral reactions to the crisis.\u201cThe fall comes, and I\u2019m nauseous, and I\u2019m gaining weight, and it doesn\u2019t even cross my mind that I could be pregnant,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said.Today, Ms. Fitzpatrick maintains the long hours and relentless travel schedule common among financial executives. It keeps her away from her three children and her husband more than she would like.But she lives in Irvington, the town where she grew up, and her two sisters and her parents still live nearby. They help with the children. She admits, however, that her relentless drive is \u201cnot necessarily a virtue for everyone.\u201dIt was a prestigious job, but one that removed her from the day-to-day trading and market strategizing that associates say she loves most.Now, \u201cshe will basically be able to sit down with those managers whom they\u2019ve allocated money to, and really be able to speak the language,\u201d said Rich Cunningham, a managing director at Barclays Investment Bank.Among the new challenges she will face is all that turnover at Soros.Ted Burdick, the previous chief investment officer there, stepped down after just eight months on the job, though he remains with the firm. Others who have held Ms. Fitzpatrick\u2019s role have been caught up in the internal politics of the firm, and at times clashed with Mr. Soros himself.Ms. Fitzpatrick may be at less risk because, unlike some previous chief investment officers, she will be reporting to the family office\u2019s board of directors, rather than just Mr. Soros, who is the chairman of the board.And yet Mr. Soros, one of history\u2019s best traders, still can\u2019t help but sometimes want to manage his own money.Last year, as Britain prepared to vote on whether to exit the European Union, Mr. Soros stepped back into his day-to-day engagement, placing wagers that would be affected by the June referendum. The \u201cBrexit\u201d outcome, a surprise to many, triggered significant market swings, and Mr. Soros benefited from a position that predicted shares of Deutsche Bank would fall, among other trades.Later in the year, however, Mr. Soros lost around $1 billion wagering that Mr. Trump would lose the presidential election.Yes, investors were bullish, thanks to the belief that Mr. Trump would dismantle regulations and reduce taxes. But, he said, Mr. Trump would fail to achieve those policy goals. \u201cI don\u2019t think the markets are going to do very well,\u201d Mr. Soros said.Ms. Fitzpatrick, however, says that although she is more bullish on the stock market than her boss, they are not out of sync on the big picture. \u201cAs an investor,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to continuously evolve and learn.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Law Firm Expels Female Partner Who Filed Discrimination Suit", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byThe partners, polled by telephone, voted overwhelmingly to remove Kerrie L. Campbell from the partnership. No formal total was kept, but about 70 partners voted, and she was the sole vote against expulsion, Chadbourne said in a statement.On Monday, a federal district judge in Manhattan rebuffed her effort to block the vote, which her lawyers argued was retaliation for her lawsuit, which seeks $100 million and claims that the firm paid female partners less than their male counterparts and denied them advancement opportunities. Two other female partners have joined the lawsuit since it was filed in August in Federal District Court in Manhattan.Ms. Campbell, who has been on leave recovering from surgery, appeared Wednesday, on the first day of the Chadbourne partners\u2019 meeting, to argue against her expulsion. The partners delayed the vote for a day but later agreed with firm leaders to jettison her from their ranks. The firm, which is based in New York, cut off her salary at the beginning of April.Chadbourne said Ms. Campbell\u2019s expulsion was unrelated to the suit she brought against the firm, suggesting it had to do with her performance as a partner.The expulsion is likely to be one of Chadbourne\u2019s final actions as a stand-alone firm. It is about to be absorbed into a larger firm, Norton Rose Fulbright, a legal powerhouse with about 1,000 lawyers in the United States. After the merger, which will occur in the next two months, the new firm will be among New York City\u2019s 25 largest, with practice areas including energy, infrastructure, banking and corporate finance.Such a public ouster of a firm member is highly unusual. Bruce MacEwen, a law firm consultant, said he could not think of another such instance but noted that a partner bringing such a lawsuit typically quits.\u201cIt would not be unusual for any firm to eject a partner for actions considered adverse to the partnership,\u201d Mr. MacEwen said.In \u201calmost any merger, the acquired firm cleans up its partnership ranks,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s almost universal.\u201dChadbourne, in a statement, said the vote occurred \u201cafter numerous efforts to resolve this matter without resorting to such a measure.\u201dThe statement also said: \u201cHowever the action may be mischaracterized by her, Ms. Campbell\u2019s decision to sue the firm and her more recent medical condition were not a basis for today\u2019s outcome and were expressly not considered by the partners in reaching their decision. The bases existed long before her suit.\u201dEarly this month when it set the vote, Chadbourne said, also in a statement, that it was \u201cthe inevitable result of the choices Ms. Campbell has made\u201d and that it was her \u201cchoice to pursue baseless claims in the cynical pursuit of a big and undeserved payday.\u201dThe firm\u2019s ire appears to stem, at least in part, from the disclosure in legal papers of the specifics of how it pays partners. Such information is normally confidential because law firm partnerships are private entities.Ms. Campbell, who has said she is her family\u2019s sole breadwinner, declined to comment after the vote, but her lawyer, David W. Sanford, said the vote was based \u201con false and misleading information provided by Chadbourne\u2019s management committee.\u201d He said he expected the lawsuit to eventually be decided by a jury.Ms. Campbell, in a summation released Wednesday of the arguments she made to remain a partner, said that before filing her lawsuit, she had made efforts internally to have the firm focus on \u201cgender inequality in pay, power and promotions.\u201dShe noted that two other female Chadbourne partners \u2014 Mary T. Yelenick, who retired in December as the chairwoman of the firm\u2019s product liability practice, and Jaroslawa Z. Johnson \u2014 had joined the lawsuit. Ms. Campbell said other female partners at Chadbourne, including Lori Hoberman, the former chairwoman of the firm\u2019s venture capital practice, and Melanie Willems, formerly a partner in its disputes practice, had raised similar concerns about the firm\u2019s gender practices. Both women have left the firm and are not part of the lawsuit.Ms. Campbell, who joined Chadbourne in January 2014 after working at the law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, said her complaints of unequal pay went unheeded. In February 2016, she said, Chadbourne\u2019s management committee informed her that her practice no longer fit the firm\u2019s \u201cstrategic direction\u201d and that she should leave. She said that since then, she had continued to bring in around $1 million in client fees in legal matters involving defamation law, regulatory compliance and enforcement.Chadbourne disputes that and has maintained that her overall claims have no merit and that partners\u2019 individual compensation is based on a variety of factors.The issue will soon be in the hands of the newly merged firm, Norton Rose Fulbright, which did not respond to a request for comment. Chadbourne, in its statement on Thursday, said \u201cthe firm now looks forward to moving on as it prepares to enter a new chapter in its future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Zeal for China Dims, Global Companies Complain More Boldly", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 When Amazon announced its entry into the Chinese cloud computing market last year, Chinese state media celebrated it as \u201ca strong signal\u201d that \u201cthere is tremendous room for foreign firms to expand in the Chinese market as long as they comply with local regulations.\u201dToday, cloud computing is the latest area of contention between China and increasingly frustrated global companies.In late March, a group of more than 50 American lawmakers sent a letter to the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, taking direct aim at China\u2019s restrictions on cloud computing. They wrote that current and draft regulations would force the transfer of valuable intellectual property to Chinese companies and effectively bar foreign cloud service providers \u201cfrom operating or competing fairly in China.\u201d\u201cAs we see it,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, \u201cthese restrictions are fundamentally protectionist and anticompetitive.\u201d Many of the lawmakers hail from states where two major cloud computing players, Amazon and Microsoft, have operations.Big global companies, which have long worked to keep from rocking the boat in China, are showing a bit more tolerance for making waves. The business groups that represent them have become more critical of China\u2019s industrial policies and ambitions. Businesses are increasingly complaining to friendly lawmakers, and those lawmakers have become more vocal on their behalf.Profiles in courage are still hard to find, as businesses fear Chinese retaliation if they complain directly or too loudly. For example, among the companies that would benefit most from any shift in China\u2019s cloud computing regulations, Microsoft, through a spokesman, declined to comment, and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.The shift is also a gradual one, taking place in the years since the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, as the promise of a more open China faded. Still, people in business circles in China say the sense of disappointment in China\u2019s business prospects is growing.\u201cThe enthusiasm is gone,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. \u201cForeign businesses here used to be very excited about China and quite enthusiastic. Now, it\u2019s kind of a grind and a battle.\u201dChina remains a lucrative market for foreign-branded cars, iPhones, high-value engineering equipment and other costly items. Still, the growing frustration has muddled the corporate response to President Trump\u2019s tough anti-China rhetoric.\u201cThere are companies, which in prior years have been strong supporters in Washington of the U.S.-China relationship, who are much quieter, and even waiting to see if a tougher approach might get more results with China,\u201d said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council.\u201cIf the United States gives concessions in the trade area so that we don\u2019t push as hard on leveling the playing field in all these different areas,\u201d Mr. Zarit said at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday, \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame.\u201dIn public, businesses work hard to strike a sunny note. Last November, Jay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for global corporate affairs and former White House spokesman, made no mention of his company\u2019s challenges there when speaking at China\u2019s World Internet Conference, according to a Chinese-language transcript of his remarks in state media.That reticence has bred frustration among some United States officials. In 2015, President Barack Obama told the Business Roundtable, a business group, regarding its complaints about China, \u201cDon\u2019t tell us on the side, \u2018We\u2019ve got this problem, you need to look into it, but then \u2014 but leave our names out of it.\u2019\u201dStill, executives say complaining can have an impact. Earlier that same year, Mr. Obama publicly criticized proposed Chinese rules that would require technology companies to turn over encryption keys to Chinese authorities. His administration had also expressed concern about Chinese draft regulations that would require China\u2019s financial sector buy only from \u201csecure and controllable\u201d suppliers, which trade groups said effectively meant Chinese companies. In both cases China relented, temporarily scrapping the banking laws and tempering the language in the antiterrorism law.Some intermediaries between business and China are pushing the government to do even more.\u201cCountries need to be persuaded. Words don\u2019t do it,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former United States ambassador to China, adding that the United States needs to use \u201cproperly targeted\u201d leverage.\u201cI don\u2019t think the United States has done much of that,\u201d Mr. Baucus said. \u201cWe need to have a more strategic economic approach to China.\u201dHe said Mr. Obama had raised the issue of American companies\u2019 unequal access to the Chinese market repeatedly with Beijing, but these appeals were \u201cinsufficient.\u201dOf all the sectors that China has set its sights on, tech has come under the most pressure. Services like Facebook and Twitter have long been blocked. Last November, China passed a cybersecurity law that would impose security checks on companies in industries like finance and communications and mandatory in-country data storage. In 2015, the American chip maker Qualcomm said it would pay $975 million for violating China\u2019s antimonopoly law. In 2016, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. In the same year, China said it would demand answers to new questions about Microsoft\u2019s business practices in the country.In cloud computing, China mandates that foreign companies work with a local partner, and the foreign companies are subject to equity restrictions that prevent them from owning a controlling stake in the cloud company. New draft regulations would make it even more difficult for them to get licenses for operation, block them from using their brands and logos to market their services and require them to \u201cterminate the transmission of\u201d and report any information posted or transmitted by users that \u201cviolates relevant Chinese laws and regulations.\u201dIn China, the cloud computing market is estimated to be worth $20 billion by 2020, up from $1.5 billion in 2013, according to the consulting group Bain. Both Amazon and Microsoft operate in China through partnerships with local companies. In contrast, Aliyun, the cloud services unit of the Chinese web giant Alibaba, has its own data centers in the United States.For decades, Western companies have stood with China even during rocky moments in the Sino-American relationship. When Congress threatened to revoke China\u2019s most-favored-nation trading status in the 1990s because of concerns over human rights, the American Chamber of Commerce in China, or AmCham, headed to Washington to defend Beijing.More recently, the complaints from Western companies have gotten louder, as China\u2019s economic growth slows and unease grows about Beijing\u2019s failure to deliver on its promise to open markets for foreign companies as well as its Made in China 2025 plan to push for greater self-sufficiency in several industries. AmCham\u2019s 2016 survey of its members showed that 81 percent of its companies felt less welcome in China than before, up from 77 percent in 2015. The survey also showed that 31 percent of its members said the investment environment was deteriorating \u2014 the most pessimistic response AmCham has received since it started asking the question in 2011.\u201cChina\u2019s heavy emphasis on building global champions through industrial policies is spiking new levels of concern about China\u2019s commitment to a mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d said Jeremie Waterman, senior director for the Greater China region for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Mr. Zarit, of AmCham, said a \u201cmixed bag\u201d of companies were unhappy about the investment climate in China, adding that \u201cthey are afraid if anything is done, it will upset the apple cart.\u201dMr. Zarit, who led a delegation of eight former AmCham chairmen to meet with the Trump administration officials in Washington in February, said there was a new realization in Washington \u201cthat this asymmetrical commercial relationship needs to be addressed in some way.\u201dMr. McGregor, who was on the trip, said they met Peter Navarro, a strident China critic in charge of trade and industrial policy, and Matthew Pottinger, Mr. Trump\u2019s top Asia policy maker. There, the delegation pushed the concept of reciprocity, meaning that if American companies are bound by restrictions in China, their Chinese counterparts should be subject to the same limits in the United States.Mr. McGregor said the idea got \u201cquite a bit of traction.\u201d He added, \u201cOur attitude is China should be treated as an equal, and an equal needs reciprocity.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

De ce fait, les candidats dits de gauche, voire d\u2019extr\u00eame gauche, semblaient \u00e9trangement sur la m\u00eame longueur d\u2019onde que Mme Le Pen quand ils invectivaient banquiers et multinationales.Face \u00e0 elle, Emmanuel Macron, autre favori au premier tour de l\u2019\u00e9lection et donn\u00e9 comme gagnant du deuxi\u00e8me, r\u00e9p\u00e9tait inlassablement que tout en \u00e9tant social il \u00e9tait principalement progressiste et pragmatique, et ouvert \u00e0 la globalisation et \u00e0 la finance. Le jeune \u00e9narque \u2014 ancien banquier d\u2019affaires et conseiller de M. Hollande, qui en a fait son ministre de l\u2019\u00e9conomie \u2014 ne se reconna\u00eet pas non plus dans l\u2019\u00e9chiquier politique classique. Il refuse d\u2019\u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de gauche, encore moins de socialiste, mais il n\u2019est pas davantage de droite. Les affiches de son jeune parti, En Marche! pr\u00f4ne le slogan \u00ab La France doit \u00eatre une chance pour tous \u00bb.Au lieu de la polarit\u00e9 classique droite-gauche, les deux candidats favoris \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle incarnent une polarit\u00e9 entre populisme et lib\u00e9ralisme, au sens large.Il ne faut pas confondre populisme avec d\u00e9magogie, la pente naturelle des d\u00e9mocraties repr\u00e9sentatives qui consiste \u00e0 s\u00e9duire les \u00e9lecteurs plus qu\u2019\u00e0 les convaincre. Le populisme n\u2019est pas non plus le fait d\u2019\u00eatre proche du peuple. C\u2019est le fait de parler \u00e0 sa place et de pr\u00e9tendre \u00eatre porteur d\u2019un sens commun incritiquable. En particulier, il s\u2019agit d\u2019exprimer l\u2019\u00e9motion d\u2019un peuple qui se sent diminu\u00e9, encercl\u00e9 et perdu. Le discours populiste est nostalgique d\u2019une puissance pass\u00e9e et riv\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense \u00e9perdue de l\u2019identit\u00e9.Alors que l\u2019antis\u00e9mitisme des ann\u00e9es 1930 s\u2019appuyait sur l\u2019angoisse de la d\u00e9sint\u00e9gration de l\u2019identit\u00e9 biologique, l\u2019islamophobie de notre si\u00e8cle s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019angoisse de la d\u00e9sint\u00e9gration de l\u2019identit\u00e9 culturelle. Et la lutte contre l\u2019infiltration islamique d\u00e9passe le clivage droite-gauche en visant \u00e0 la fois les successeurs putatifs des Sarazins ennemis de l\u2019Europe chr\u00e9tienne (ce qui mobilise les \u00e9lecteurs dits de droite) et une religion musulmane qui remettrait en cause les acquis de la modernit\u00e9, l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 homme-femme et la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression (ce qui mobilise les \u00e9lecteurs dits de gauche).Ces \u00e9lecteurs en oublient leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats concrets, parfois antagonistes, \u00e0 la faveur du sentiment commun d\u2019encerclement culturel. Lorsque Mme Le Pen parle des pauvres, des exclus, des ouvriers, des agriculteurs ou des commer\u00e7ants, elle vise un seul peuple meurtri par la globalisation, l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, l\u2019euro, l\u2019immigration et l\u2019islamisation.L\u2019inqui\u00e9tude du naufrage culturel date d\u2019environ une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration : apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9colonisation, c\u2019est l\u2019intervention am\u00e9ricaine en Irak de 2003 qui a cruellement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 la \u00ab vieille Europe \u00bb la perte de sa puissance imp\u00e9riale. Le populisme nourri par ce malaise semble simplement avoir atteint son point culminant \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de cette \u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle.Le mouvement En Marche! de M. Macron repr\u00e9sente la premi\u00e8re organisation de grande envergure \u00e0 s\u2019opposer \u00e0 cette mouvance \u2014 mais selon des modalit\u00e9s sortant elles aussi du clivage droite-gauche traditionnel. A la nostalgie du pass\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019angoisse du peuple meurtri, M. Macron substitue une vision positive de l\u2019avenir, r\u00e9habilitant au passage le sens originel du lib\u00e9ralisme, comme doctrine promouvant les libert\u00e9s individuelles.Au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1980 on avait pris l\u2019habitude de dire, \u00e0 partir de la devise de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise \u00ab Libert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9 \u00bb, que la priorit\u00e9 de la droite \u00e9tait la libert\u00e9 et la priorit\u00e9 de la gauche, l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9.

Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 Le Pen, la la\u00efcit\u00e9, par exemple, est d\u00e9fensive, privil\u00e9giant la culture fran\u00e7aise contre la religion de l\u2019\u00e9tranger.

Issue de la d\u00e9mocratie chr\u00e9tienne dite de droite, elle poursuit, notamment en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration, une politique qui soci\u00e9talement est proche des positions de type social-d\u00e9mocrate couramment associ\u00e9es \u00e0 la gauche.Une nouvelle opposition id\u00e9ologique semble donc \u00eatre en train de red\u00e9finir le discours politique en France, et ailleurs en Occident: le protectionnisme \u00e9conomique et identitaire des populistes, face \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture \u00e0 l\u2019Europe et la globalisation des lib\u00e9raux.

{"Headline": "New York City Will Offer Free Preschool for All 3-Year-Olds", "Date": "2017-04-24", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio announced on Monday that New York City would offer free, full-day preschool to all 3-year-olds within four years, saying that he was building on the success of the city\u2019s prekindergarten program for 4-year-olds and that it was time to go further.New York would be one of few cities in the country to offer free preschool to every 3-year-old, including Washington. But New York\u2019s program would dwarf that city\u2019s effort, which enrolls only 5,700 3-year-olds. In New York, officials expect to serve 62,000 children a year.Implementing the universal prekindergarten program for 4-year-olds was the centerpiece of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign for mayor four years ago and is considered to be one of the biggest accomplishments of his first term. So it is not surprising that, with his re-election effort starting, he is seeking to amplify the achievement.In the often-divided world of education, the long-term benefit of early childhood education, particularly for low-income children, is one of the few things most experts agree on. Politicians on both the left and the right embrace the idea of expanding access to preschool, a rarity among educational initiatives. A number of states, including Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma and West Virginia, offer universal prekindergarten for 4-year-olds.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s new plan, which he called 3-K for All, comes with many challenges, not least that the mayor said the city would need $700 million from the state and the federal government to be able to reach all children.\u201cI assure you it will take very hard work,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on Monday at a public school in the Bronx. He said it would be \u201charder than pre-K.\u201dBut, he went on, \u201cwe also have the example of pre-K to fuel this effort, to prove what can be done on a big scale and to prove what an impact it makes.\u201dThe rollout of the prekindergarten program has gone relatively smoothly, although some parents have complained that there are not enough seats available in certain neighborhoods, like the Upper East Side of Manhattan.Experts have generally said the program is of good quality, considering that the initiative is still new. The city regularly evaluates its preschool providers using a nationally recognized scale for early childhood programs. The average scores from the city\u2019s first two years were significantly below the average for classrooms in New Jersey\u2019s Abbott Preschool Program, a highly regarded preschool effort. But they were similar to those of Abbott classrooms in that program\u2019s early years.While close to 70,000 children are enrolled in the city\u2019s program for 4-year-olds, there are currently just 11,000 publicly financed seats for 3-year-olds in early childhood centers, and they are available only to families earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $49,200 for a family of four.In contrast to the program for 4-year-olds, which tripled the number of prekindergarten seats in two years, the new plan would be rolled out over four years. The program would start in two of the city\u2019s lowest-income school districts, District 7 in the Bronx and District 23 in Brooklyn, and offer a seat to every 3-year-old in those districts by the fall of 2018. The city would expand the program to an additional six districts, still to be chosen, by the fall of 2020 and to all districts by 2021.The mayor said that the city was putting $36 million in next year\u2019s budget to finance the program and that it planned to spend $177 million annually on the program at full scale, on top of the $200 million it currently spends on seats for 3-year-olds from low-income families. But the program will cost much more than that \u2014 more than $1 billion \u2014 and Mr. de Blasio said he expected the state and federal governments to step up to help.\u201cWe will build a coalition to put together whatever state and federal resources we need to bring this to full fruition,\u201d the mayor said.Whether those resources will be forthcoming is unclear. Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, has said little about early childhood education, and it was not a focus of hers as a philanthropist.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s effort to create a universal prekindergarten program for 4-year-olds led to one of his first conflicts with Mr. Cuomo. At the time, the city\u2019s Education Department offered only 20,000 full-day prekindergarten seats. During his first election campaign, Mr. de Blasio proposed expanding the program to reach all children with a tax on high earners. Mr. Cuomo resisted that proposal and in the end financed it out of the state\u2019s budget, without a tax, allowing him to claim some of the credit.Finding enough teachers for new programs will also be a challenge. The city said it expected that roughly half of the seats would be in public schools, and roughly half in community-based centers and religious schools, and that an additional 4,500 teachers would eventually need to be hired. As the city has expanded its programs for 4-year-olds, community-based centers, which pay less than the public schools, have sometimes had trouble attracting teachers.Many middle-class parents already enroll their 3-year-olds in private preschools. Asked why New York City should pay for them, Mr. de Blasio said he thought making the program universal promoted \u201cfairness and equality\u201d and also made it easier to achieve politically.\u201cI think it obviously creates maximum energy to get something like this done and supported here in the city and the state and federal level if it\u2019s something that everyone benefits from,\u201d he said.An article on Tuesday about New York City\u2019s plan to offer free, full-day preschool to all 3-year-olds within four years erroneously attributed a distinction to the city\u2019s plan. If the plan is enacted, New York would become one of a few cities to have such a program; it would not be only the second city to have one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Man in Charge of Fixing Fannie and Freddie Knows Them All Too Well", "Date": "2017-04-07", "News": "Supported byFair GameYou may not know much about Craig S. Phillips, special counselor to Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary. Because Mr. Phillips was not a political appointee, he did not face congressional scrutiny before he began directing our nation\u2019s housing policy, one of his main tasks.Getting to know Mr. Phillips and his background is a worthwhile exercise, especially because he\u2019s determining the Trump administration\u2019s path forward on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants that remain in conservatorship.Mr. Phillips certainly knows a thing or two about Fannie and Freddie. As the leader of Morgan Stanley\u2019s mortgage desk during the peak mortgage-mania years of 2004 and 2005, he ran the operation that bundled loans and sold them to the two government-sponsored enterprises. When those loans blew up and the government sued Morgan Stanley, Mr. Phillips was a named defendant in the initial case \u2014 a case that resulted in the firm paying a $1.25 billion settlement.But first things first.Much more germane is the work he\u2019s done on Wall Street, much of it in the mortgage arena.Perhaps most salient on Mr. Phillips\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 are his years at Morgan Stanley, where he led the firm\u2019s mortgage securities unit. He started in the company\u2019s fixed income division in 1994 and rose to global head of securities products. He was also the chief executive of Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc., signing mortgage securitization documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.As head of securities products, Mr. Phillips directed the unit of Morgan Stanley that packaged and sold billions of dollars of home loan bundles to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other investors. Some of these securitizations blew up in the financial crisis, generating billions of dollars in losses to the investors who bought them.Although he left the firm in May 2006, when the mortgage securitization machinery was starting to sputter, he is identified in lawsuits filed by investors who bought the toxic Morgan Stanley loan bundles. Two of those investors were Fannie and Freddie, the companies he is now charged with fixing.In 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the overseer of Fannie and Freddie, sued Morgan Stanley on their behalf, naming Mr. Phillips as a defendant. The F.H.F.A. contended that Morgan Stanley had misled Fannie and Freddie about the quality of the loans it had pooled and sold to them. (A subsequent version of the lawsuit dropped Mr. Phillips from the defendants\u2019 list but still cited him and his role at Morgan Stanley.)Another financial crisis lawsuit filed against Morgan Stanley describes Mr. Phillips\u2019s role at the firm, detailing his close association with New Century Financial, one of the wildest of the Wild West subprime lenders. Until New Century collapsed in a heap in early 2007, Morgan Stanley was its biggest financier and enabler.Morgan Stanley helped feed that obsession by purchasing New Century\u2019s loans. But it also provided the lender with the crucial money it needed to operate \u2014 known as warehouse funding. By August 2004, the Wall Street firm was offering a line of $3 billion to New Century, up from $400 million three years earlier, court documents show.Both firms were enriched by the relationship. New Century generated \u201cthe most revenue for the warehouse lending group from 2004 through 2007\u201d at Morgan Stanley, a lawsuit stated.\u201cThey certainly are extremely open to our advice and involvement in all elements of their operation,\u201d Mr. Phillips wrote of New Century in a November 2004 email to the head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s trading desk.Mr. Phillips spent two years at a firm he created to conduct real estate lending in India. But in August 2008, just as the mortgage tsunami was about to hit, he joined BlackRock Solutions.His stint there may complicate his current work on the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because at that time, his BlackRock unit was acting as a consultant to F.H.F.A., analyzing Fannie and Freddie\u2019s loss and capital projections. The companies were taken into conservatorship by the government over Labor Day weekend in 2008.It is unclear what the BlackRock analyses showed. But it must be interesting reading given the great efforts the government has made to keep the documents from seeing the light of day in a lawsuit brought by shareholders of Fannie and Freddie.I wanted to talk with Mr. Phillips about his long career on Wall Street, but a Treasury spokeswoman said he was not willing to chat. Given that he is the government\u2019s point man on how to handle Fannie and Freddie, I had hoped to ask him where he stands on the topic.We do know that he has been conducting meetings on the issue with people including officials from the Mortgage Bankers Association and think tanks, as well as low- and middle-income housing advocates who want to ensure that Fannie and Freddie remain available as a source of mortgage funding.Mr. Phillips has also met with Jim Parrott, a former Obama administration housing official who is a fellow at the Urban Institute and owner of Falling Creek Advisors. Mr. Parrott was involved in the former president\u2019s decision to begin taking all of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s profits in 2012.Mr. Phillips also traveled to Capitol Hill recently for a sit-down with Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican. In the past, Mr. Corker has put forward legislation on Fannie and Freddie that would have benefited too-big-to-fail banks. Mr. Corker\u2019s spokesman did not return a call seeking comment.Michael Calhoun, the president of the Center for Responsible Lending, said he was uncomfortable with the plans Mr. Parrott and Mr. Corker had been pushing.That\u2019s for sure.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Lesson in Moscow About Trump-Style \u2018Alternative Truth\u2019", "Date": "2017-04-16", "News": "Supported byMediatorMOSCOW \u2014 I wanted to better understand President Trump\u2019s America, a place where truth is being ripped from its moorings as he brands those tasked with lashing it back into place \u2014 journalists \u2014 as dishonest enemies of the people.So I went to Russia.It was like a visit to the land of Alternative Truth Yet to Come. But it also gave me a glimpse into how our new national look is playing in the global information war, where competing narratives are clashing along a sliding scale of fact and fiction.I had picked a ghoulishly perfect week to swing through President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Moscow, where spring was struggling to break out over the low-slung, slate-gray cityscape.Mr. Trump had just ordered a Tomahawk strike against Syria\u2019s Shayrat air base, from which, the United States said, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria had launched the chemical weapons attack that killed more than 80 and sickened hundreds.As soon as I turned on a television here I wondered if I had arrived through an alt-right wormhole.Here in Russia, it was the dominant theme throughout the overwhelmingly state-controlled mainstream media.One of Mr. Kiselyov\u2019s correspondents on the scene mocked \u201cWestern propagandists\u201d for believing the Trump line, saying munitions at the air base had \u201cas much to do with chemical weapons as the test tube in the hands of Colin Powell had to do with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\u201dAs the pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia put it, \u201cApparently it was for good reason Donald Trump called unverified information in the mass media one of the main problems in the U.S.\u201dIt was the best evidence I\u2019ve seen of the folly of Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-press approach. You can\u2019t spend more than a year attacking the credibility of the \u201cdishonest media\u201d and then expect to use its journalism as support for your position during an international crisis \u2014 at least not with any success.While Mr. Trump and his supporters may think that undermining the news media serves their larger interests, in this great information war it serves Mr. Putin\u2019s interests more. It means playing on his turf, where he excels.Integral to Mr. Putin\u2019s governing style has been a pliant press that makes his government the main arbiter of truth.While talking to the beaten but unbowed members of the real journalism community here, I heard eerie hints of Trumpian proclamations in their war stories.That same day, I met with one of the former RBC editors, Roman Badanin. We chatted at his new place of employment, TV Rain, in the Flacon warehouse complex here, populated by young people with beards, tattoos, piercings and colored hair. (Brooklyn hipster imperialism knows no bounds.)TV Rain has its own hard-luck tale. It was Russia\u2019s only independent television station. Carried mainly on cable, it regularly covered anti-Putin protests and aired voices excluded from the rest of television.When I asked Mr. Badanin what would be different if Russia had full press freedoms, he looked at me wearily and said: \u201cEverything. Sorry for that common answer, but everything.\u201dDespite steep challenges, people like Mr. Badanin are still battling on. Their journalistic spirit couldn\u2019t be killed, even after some of their friends and colleagues had been.With the gallows humor of a seasoned journalist, Mr. Muratov was in a jovial mood and told me that he was getting a great kick out of state media\u2019s hard turn against Mr. Trump.Initially, Mr. Muratov said of the president, \u201che was treated as warmly as McDonald\u2019s; he entered every home like he was our national Santa Claus.\u201d Mr. Muratov had no doubt the sentiment toward Mr. Trump would reverse again, perhaps soon. (To borrow from \u201c1984\u201d: \u201cOceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.\u201d)Novaya Gazeta had the toughest coverage on the chemical weapons attack that I saw here, challenging the government narrative with reporting from the ground indicating the chemical weapons were dropped from the air. (The anti-Assad forces do not have airplanes.)There\u2019s a lot of speculation in Russian media circles about why the Kremlin allows Novaya Gazeta to continue to operate.That, and a loyal subscriber base of more than 240,000, help insulate it from outside pressure, if not the violence.The very day of my visit, Mr. Muratov received a threat against his entire staff from religious leaders in Chechnya, angry over articles about anti-gay violence in the region.The Novaya Gazeta offices are scattered with reminders to take such threats seriously, like the case that holds the dusty desktop computer of Anna Politkovskaya. She was shot dead in her apartment building in 2006 after exposing human rights abuses in Chechnya and writing unflinchingly about Mr. Putin.I wondered aloud whether it scared any of Mr. Muratov\u2019s reporters away from certain stories. He turned serious, looked straight at me and said, \u201cI really wish it could.\u201dMr. Muratov follows the American news media closely. I asked him what he thought about the American press corps\u2019 quandary when it comes to covering a president, like Mr. Trump, who trades in falsehoods and demonizes journalists.He seemed put off by the question; the answer, to him, was so obvious.\u201cInformation from the Kremlin or from the White House, it\u2019s not for us verified information,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t place our trust just on their word.\u201dIt\u2019s a lesson American reporters should have learned long before Mr. Trump came along, especially after Iraq.Journalists in Russia like Mr. Muratov haven\u2019t lost sight of that lesson because they can\u2019t afford to. Neither can we.Alexandra Odynova contributed research.Advertisement"}

Half of the new contributions came from out-of-state donors, and more than $43,000 came from first-time donors.\u201cThis is a trivial cost, a very minor investment. I\u2019d call it covering your bases,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, a vice president of Common Cause, a nonpartisan citizens lobbying organization. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to kiss the ring of someone who may soon be in a politically influential post. You show up in their state, show them you\u2019re a friend. And then you sit back and wait and see if they rise to power.\u201dThe F.T.C. reviews mergers and protects consumers from deceptive advertising and fraud. The agency is led by a commission whose five members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Only two of those positions are filled. Mr. Trump named Maureen Ohlhausen the acting chairwoman in January.Mr. Reyes\u2019s surge in campaign contributions this year includes money from payday lenders, title companies, lawyers and others who have business before the agency or are regulated by it. Alan Crooks, a spokesman for Mr. Reyes, said much of the money came from an annual ski fund-raiser, the invitations for which were sent out last year, well before Mr. Reyes was mentioned for the F.T.C. job.\u201cIt\u2019s been good for his profile, but we haven\u2019t seen that it has been a boon to donations,\u201d Mr. Crooks said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen more scrutiny, which he\u2019s going to pass because he\u2019s a good man.\u201dMr. Crooks said new donors were drawn to Mr. Reyes\u2019s work in office, and to his electoral victory when he carried nearly two-thirds of the vote. Many other donors who have had matters before the F.T.C. gave to Mr. Reyes even before he was named a candidate for chairman. Those include the wine and beer wholesale associations and the drug makers Pfizer and Mallinckrodt. As Utah\u2019s attorney general, Mr. Reyes has broad jurisdiction on consumer protection issues.Mr. Reyes took office in 2013 to complete the term of John Swallow, who resigned amid a federal corruption investigation. Mr. Reyes said last summer that Mr. Trump was an imperfect candidate but said he endorsed him nonetheless, largely to ensure a conservative Supreme Court pick.Mr. Reyes is interested in the F.T.C. job, Mr. Crooks said. Under Utah law, if Mr. Reyes does not serve out his term, he can use his donations to make donations to other campaigns, political action committees or charities.Advertisement"}

She will not be eligible for parole again until April 2019.The decision not to release Ms. Clark, 67, from prison was something of a blow for Mr. Cuomo, who took the politically risky decision to commute her sentence, making her eligible for parole, saying that she had made \u201cexceptional strides in self-development.\u201dSpeaking at the funeral of the former Daily News columnist Jimmy Breslin in March, he went further.\u201cIt was a hard political decision,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cI could hear Jimmy\u2019s voice saying, \u2018She made a mistake \u2014 we all do. She learned, she paid the price, she spent her life in a cage, and she is now different. Jesus would pardon her. Who the hell made you better than Jesus?\u2019\u201dOn Friday evening, aides to Mr. Cuomo said that while he was impressed with her rehabilitation, he could have chosen to commute her sentence in such a way that she would immediately have been released. Instead, he chose to simply make her eligible for parole.\u201cJudith Clark deserved the opportunity to make her case for parole based on her extensive prison programming, her perfect disciplinary record while incarcerated, and impressive self-development over the past 35 years,\u201d said Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the governor. \u201cThe commutation afforded her that opportunity and we respect the parole board\u2019s decision.\u201dThe three members of the board voted unanimously against parole; only one of them was a Cuomo appointee.In announcing the decision, the board said its members \u201crespect and understand the governor\u2019s lawful decision to exercise his unique discretion in your case.\u201dIt stressed, however, that it was an independent body and that its decision was based on \u201csubstantial additional information that was created and submitted pursuant to our unique process.\u201dWhile parole board hearings are not public and transcripts are not yet available, a summary explaining their decision was released late Friday.It focused on the unique nature of her case and the message her release would send to law enforcement. \u201cWe do find that your release at this time is incompatible with the welfare of society as expressed by relevant officials and thousands of its members,\u201d the board wrote. \u201cYou are still a symbol of a terroristic crime.\u201dMs. Clark\u2019s case became something of a Rorschach test for how people view punishment for a crime, and it sparked a debate about rehabilitation.Law enforcement groups have steadfastly opposed Ms. Clark\u2019s release, and last month, Republican state senators gave the parole board a petition, which they said contained 10,000 signatures, urging that she be kept in prison.Some relatives of those killed also opposed her parole, expressing deep disappointment with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s decision.A groundswell of support for Ms. Clark began even before her sentence was commuted.Last year, 13 former presidents of the New York City Bar Association signed a letter seeking clemency; so have prison officials who have worked with Ms. Clark during her incarceration, most of which she has spent at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women in Westchester County.Ms. Clark has said it was not until she was locked away that she came to know herself.Her radicalization had started young.She was just 14 when she began to delve deeply into politics, gravitating to the Weather Underground and an even more radical offshoot, the May 19th Communist Organization. The group attached itself to a revolutionary black organization, and together they hoped to plant the seeds for a guerrilla uprising. But the revolution would need to be financed.So the group hatched a plan to steal $1.6 million from a Brink\u2019s armored car.She said that as a new mother, she was nervous about the plot, but she agreed to be the getaway driver, fully aware of what she was doing. As she sat in a car in a parking lot of a mall in Nanuet, her associates approached the Brink\u2019s van. Gunfire erupted. One guard was killed; another was left in a pool of blood.Her associates grabbed the cash, hopped in a van and fled. Ms. Clark followed in the car she was driving. At a nearby parking lot, six gunmen abandoned the van and piled into the back of a U-Haul.Someone threw the cash into the back of Ms. Clark\u2019s car, and the caravan set off. The police, however, had set up a roadblock at a nearby entrance to the New York State Thruway.The U-Haul was flagged and pulled over by the police. Ms. Clark heard gunfire; then two of her associates jumped into the car. She sped away, but it was not long before the police caught up, and soon she was in custody.The gang had killed three people: the Brink\u2019s security guard, Peter Paige; and two Nyack police officers, Sgt. Edward O\u2019Grady and Officer Waverly Brown.At the time of her trial, Ms. Clark was still inflamed by her beliefs, and she represented herself. She expressed no remorse, telling the jury that revolutionary violence was a \u201cliberating force.\u201dHer behavior helps explain her long sentence.Ms. Clark\u2019s daughter, Harriet, said she understood the seriousness of the crime but believed the decision by the board was an injustice. \u201cMy mother did not kill anyone, and it\u2019s hard for me to understand who is served by making her die in prison, which is what decisions like this eventually amount to,\u201d she said.But others, especially those who were personally affected, felt differently.A former Nyack detective, Arthur Keenan, who offered over an hour of testimony to the parole board arguing against her release, said he was informed shortly after 5 p.m. Friday that Ms. Clark had been denied parole.\u201cI am very pleased with their decision,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo commuted the sentence of Judith Clark. It was late last year, not this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Proposes Slashing Tax Rates, Significantly Aiding Wealthy", "Date": "2017-04-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday proposed sharp reductions in individual and business income tax rates and a radical reordering of the tax code that would significantly benefit the wealthy, but he offered no explanation of how the plan would be financed as he rushed to show progress before the 100-day mark of his presidency.But they offered none of the standard accouterments of such rollouts, such as detailed charts showing the cost of each provision, phase-in periods, the impacts of the proposals on people and testimonials on the program\u2019s potential benefits.\u201cWe have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do something really big,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cPresident Trump has made tax reform a priority, and we have a Republican Congress that wants to get it done.\u201dThe proposal envisions slashing the tax rate paid by businesses large and small to 15 percent. The number of individual income tax brackets would shrink from seven to three \u2014 10, 25 and 35 percent \u2014 easing the tax burden on most Americans, including the president, although aides did not offer the income ranges for each bracket.Individual tax rates currently have a ceiling of 39.6 percent and a floor of 10 percent. Most Americans pay taxes somewhere between the two.Mr. Trump wants to double the standard deduction for individuals, essentially eliminating taxes on around $24,000 of a couple\u2019s earnings. That proposal was met with alarm by home builders and real estate agents, who fear it would disincentivize the purchase of homes. The proposal would scrap most itemized deductions, such as those for state and local tax payments, a valuable break for taxpayers in Democratic states like California and New York.But the president would leave in place popular breaks for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and retirement savings.A point-by-point look at how much it will increase the federal deficit.In a brief session with reporters, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin said they had been toiling for weeks on the proposal, much of which closely resembles the plan Mr. Trump championed as a presidential candidate. They argued that it would spur robust economic growth that would \u2014 along with the elimination of deductions \u2014 cover the potentially multitrillion-dollar proposal entirely, a prospect that even many Republicans privately concede is virtually impossible.\u201cThis will pay for itself with growth and with reduction of different deductions and closing loopholes,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, repeating his optimistic estimate that the plan would spur the economy to grow at a rate of 3 percent annually. \u201cThe economic plan under Trump will grow the economy and will create massive amounts of revenues, trillions of dollars in additional revenues.\u201dDemocrats rejected what they described as magical thinking behind the plan and condemned it as a giveaway to the rich masquerading as a tax overhaul.\u201cThis is an unprincipled tax plan that will result in cuts for the 1 percent, conflicts for the president, crippling debt for America and crumbs for the working people,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said in a statement. \u201cInstead of providing a real tax reform plan as promised, this administration is offering cakes to the fortunate few.\u201dBernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, a forecasting firm, was unsparing.\u201cThe effort to introduce more fiscal stimulus into the economy is genuinely underway,\u201d he wrote to clients. \u201cBut the bare bones plan we saw unveiled today is already conceptually flawed and unlikely to go far in Congress. The final product will bear no resemblance to the principal points highlighted in today\u2019s meager release. Certainly, the first step in this process was unimpressive.\u201dMr. Cohn said the plan was \u201cthe most significant tax reform legislation since 1986\u201d \u2014 the last time a comprehensive tax overhaul was enacted \u2014 as well as \u201cone of the biggest tax cuts in American history,\u201d in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s grandiose portrayal.As expected, the White House did not include in its plan the border adjustment tax on imports that was a centerpiece of a plan developed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin said the White House could not support that proposal \u201cin its current form,\u201d setting up an intraparty struggle over the elements of a tax plan and how to offset the deep reductions envisioned.But Republican leaders who are eager for large tax cuts did not allow their internal divisions over elements of the package to obscure their overall support for Mr. Trump\u2019s effort.Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brady issued a joint statement with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, saying the principles outlined Wednesday would \u201cserve as critical guideposts\u201d as Congress and the administration worked together on a tax overhaul.Mr. Trump also signaled support for revisions to the tax code that would help families with child-care costs, although his document provided no details. He called for ending the 3.8 percent tax on investment income that was imposed by the Affordable Care Act, restoring the capital gains rate to 20 percent.Democrats are ready to battle Mr. Trump over the tax cuts, which they are determined to tie to his refusal to release his tax returns.\u201cTrump\u2019s latest proposal is another gift to corporations and billionaires like himself,\u201d said Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic Party chairman. \u201cTrump must release his tax returns, as millions of Americans are demanding, before Congress can consider any Trump tax plan. We must know how much Trump would personally financially benefit from his own proposal.\u201dQuestioned about that repeatedly on Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin said that Mr. Trump, the first president in four decades not to disclose at least a portion of his tax returns, had \u201cno intention\u201d of releasing them now.\u201cI can\u2019t comment on the president\u2019s tax situation since I don\u2019t have access to that, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said when asked how large of a tax cut the president would receive under his own plan.The plan contrasts starkly with the one championed by House Republicans, who proposed paying for their tax cuts in part with the new tax on imports, an effort to ensure that the measure would not swell the deficit.The White House plan does call for \u201ca territorial system to level the playing field for American companies,\u201d akin to a component of House Republicans\u2019 plan that would allow United States corporations to pay taxes only on their domestic profits.\u201cI worry that the Trump proposal would shift a tremendous amount of income abroad,\u201d said Alan B. Krueger, who was a chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to square that with incentivizing investment in the U.S.\u201dRepublicans have long called for permanent, comprehensive changes to the tax code, but lately they have shown increasing openness to tax cuts with an expiration date. If they embark on a plan to pass legislation that adds to the deficit and cannot be filibustered by Democrats, Senate budget rules dictate that the tax cuts would expire after a decade.\u201cIf we have them for 10 years, that\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Democrats were particularly critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s idea of allowing firms known as pass-through entities \u2014 including hedge funds, real estate concerns like Mr. Trump\u2019s and large partnerships \u2014 that currently pay taxes at individual rates, which top off at 39.6 percent, to be eligible for the 15 percent corporate rate.Critics worry that lawyers, doctors, consultants and other individuals in partnerships could structure much of their personal income as business income, effectively reducing their tax rate from 39.6 percent to 15 percent.Mr. Mnuchin said the administration would not allow that to happen.\u201cWe will make sure that there are rules in place so that wealthy people can\u2019t create pass-throughs and use that as a mechanism to avoid paying the tax rate that they should be on the personal side,\u201d he said.The explanation did not seem to mollify Democrats.\u201cWe don\u2019t need a tax plan that allows the very rich to use pass-throughs to reduce their rates to 15 percent while average Americans are paying much more,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not tax reform. That\u2019s just a tax giveaway to the very, very wealthy that will explode the deficit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Inaugural Drew Big Dollars From Donors With Vested Interests", "Date": "2017-04-19", "News": "Supported byThe casino magnate and philanthropist Sheldon G. Adelson wants some big things from the Trump administration: banning the online poker sites that compete with his luxury casinos, for example, and moving the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.And while President Trump was not Mr. Adelson\u2019s first choice during the Republican primary season last year, he has been generous since: The billionaire donated $5 million to the committee organizing Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration festivities \u2014 the largest single contribution given to any president\u2019s inaugural committee.The stream of money is a striking contrast to the way Mr. Trump funded his campaign, chiefly with small donations and his own fortune. While some big checks for the inauguration came from longtime Trump friends and associates, much of the money came from the industries that have traditionally excelled at wielding Washington influence: telecommunications, tobacco and pharmaceutical giants, which have bankrolled presidential inaugurations for Republicans and Democrats alike. And a generous amount came from people who had been hostile to his candidacy.If the crowds at Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing-in celebrations were relatively small, the checks paying for all the nonofficial festivities were not: Freed of many of the voluntary restrictions adopted by Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors, 48 people or corporations gave $1 million or more, according to the disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission. Besides Mr. Adelson, they included a trust controlled by the coal industry billionaire Joseph W. Craft III; the parent company of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; and Robert Mercer, the billionaire investor and close ally of Stephen K. Bannon, a White House adviser.The donor rolls also included a host of blue-chip American companies, like Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Intel, Google and Bank of America, which contribute significant sums regardless of the incoming president\u2019s political party.\u201cDuring the campaign, he attacked over and over again precisely these kinds of huge contributions,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, the president of the watchdog group Democracy 21 and a longtime advocate of tighter campaign finance rules. \u201cHe also said he knew from personal experience that you can buy influence with politicians by making these kinds of contributions. That didn\u2019t seem to bother him in raising ridiculous amounts of money to pay for the inauguration.\u201dBoeing, the country\u2019s biggest exporter, made a million-dollar contribution in January. This month, Boeing won a major victory when Mr. Trump abandoned his campaign pledge to eliminate the Export-Import Bank, which has provided billions in loan guarantees to help Boeing\u2019s overseas customers finance plane purchases.Central to the money-raising effort was Thomas Barrack Jr., a private equity investor who is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest and oldest friends. It was Mr. Barrack who hosted one of Mr. Trump\u2019s first major fund-raisers at his home in Santa Monica, Calif., last May, and who spoke in Cleveland the night Mr. Trump accepted the Republican nomination. As inaugural chairman, Mr. Barrack was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s chief liaisons to those business executives who had kept him at arm\u2019s length.Contributions to the festivities were not intended to accrue favor with the new president, Mr. Barrack said in a text message, but were made \u201cin support of the coming together of our country and its people to commemorate the cornerstone of our American democratic process.\u201dBut the democratic process moves along more quickly for some than for others. While Mr. Trump promised during the campaign to give Medicare and Medicaid the power to negotiate prices they pay for prescription drugs, two of the biggest drugmakers, Pfizer and Amgen, gave a combined $1.5 million in December.Amgen\u2019s chief executive was among the industry executives who attended a February meeting with Mr. Trump. After entering the meeting promising to do something \u201cto get prices down,\u201d Mr. Trump exited with a more industry-friendly line, saying he would oppose \u201cprice-fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare.\u201d (A White House spokesman later said Mr. Trump remained in favor of negotiating prices.)Few industries have stood to gain as much under Mr. Trump as private prison operators, and they gave generously to his inauguration. Two of the largest such companies, the Corrections Corporation of America, now known as CoreCivic, and the GEO Group, each contributed $250,000.For many Washington interests and for large donors \u2014 particularly those who had not anticipated a Trump victory or had no relationship with his insurgent campaign, or had actively opposed him \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural was an easy way to make inroads with the president-elect.The Ansary family, prominent Iranian-Americans in Dallas who are longtime allies of the Bushes, gave $2 million to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Paul Singer, the billionaire Republican investor who opposed Mr. Trump and once predicted that his policies were \u201cclose to a guarantee of a global depression,\u201d donated $1 million on Dec. 6.The two have mended fences recently. In February, Mr. Singer visited Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, and Mr. Trump declared afterward that \u201cnow he\u2019s a very strong ally and I appreciate that.\u201dMr. Zuberi is now making inroads in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle. After making the donation, he earned a coveted spot at the Chairman\u2019s Global Dinner, a pre-inauguration, black-tie gathering intended to introduce the incoming president to the foreign diplomatic corps. A photo from the event shows Mr. Zuberi in conversation with Mr. Trump and other guests.Mr. Zuberi did not return a phone call seeking comment.Because inaugural committees face few of the regulations that limit campaign fund-raising, each administration sets its own restrictions.George W. Bush, for example, capped gifts at $100,000 for his first inaugural and at $250,000 for his second. Mr. Obama accepted gifts up to only $50,000 in 2009, while banning all gifts from lobbyists and corporations altogether. He loosened those restrictions in 2013, accepting corporate gifts up to $1 million and individual gifts up to $250,000.Just what other perks and souvenirs their donations helped pay for will probably remain a mystery. While donations must be reported, the Federal Election Commission does not require inaugural committees to account for what they spend or how much is left in their coffers when the revelers head home.Mr. Trump\u2019s committee said it was still identifying charities toward which it would direct leftover money.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

They are also expected to talk, more broadly, about efforts by Mr. Orban\u2019s government to curb the authority of the European Union in areas like immigration and the economy.Vera Jourova, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for justice, said on Monday that, while the law seemed neutral on its face, it was clearly aimed at one university \u2014 a criticism that Mr. Kaye echoed on Tuesday.\u201cThe law must be general, but this is a rather legalistic approach,\u201d Ms. Jourova told reporters, warning that Hungary had also moved \u201cto decrease the power and the influence of civil society\u201d and to inhibit \u201cpolitical pluralism,\u201d or the free expression of multiple and competing positions.Ms. Jourova offered her support to groups resisting the law. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see that the people there are courageous, open, vocal and visible,\u201d she said, a reference to the protests.\u201cI myself do not believe that any administrative steps or infringements or other measures taken by the European Commission in relation or against some member state will help a lot,\u201d Ms. Jourova said, acknowledging that governments in some member states often ignore legal steps taken by Europe for as long as possible.To a large extent, it \u201cmust be the people\u201d who push back against illiberalism, she said.Michael Ignatieff, Central European University\u2019s president and rector, and a scholar of human rights, said in a statement on Monday: \u201cAs I have said before, we are willing to sit down with the Hungarian government to find a solution to enable C.E.U. to stay in Budapest and operate as we have done for 25 years. However, academic freedom is not negotiable. It is a principle that must form the basis of any future agreement.\u201dMr. Orban\u2019s government seems unmoved by the criticism. His allies are not hiding their contempt for Mr. Soros.\u201cGeorge Soros\u2019s thinking on migration is sharply opposed to that of the Hungarian government,\u201d Lajos Kosa, head of Fidesz\u2019s bloc in Parliament, said Tuesday on a morning television show. \u201cWe are saying, \u2018Let\u2019s stop migration,\u2019 and Soros is saying, \u2018Let in as many as possible.\u2019 And he will do everything \u2014 including money and energy \u2014 to destabilize and weaken those governments who oppose his thinking.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

The list-price tuition at these college does indeed run so high, but just a small slice of the population pays the list price. Typically, only families earning at least $200,000 a year fail to qualify for financial aid. For families with middle-class incomes, highly selective colleges are much, much less expensive.The widespread misimpression about the cost of college causes real damage. It leads many middle-class and lower-income families to believe, incorrectly, that college is unaffordable. When they respond by discouraging their child from attending or finishing college, they hurt the child\u2019s long-term economic prospects.The calculator is a joint effort of 15 colleges, including Dartmouth, Pomona, Columbia, Williams, Wellesley, Rice and Colorado College. You use it anonymously, and you answer about six quick questions about your finances, such as your annual income and home ownership status. With just a minute or two of work, you can get an estimate of how much college will really cost.As an example, I entered data for what would be a pretty normal American family: a homeowner with $75,000 in income and some savings. I selected Rice as the college. The calculator estimated that this family would have to spend $18,500 a year while receiving a $42,900 scholarship.Advertisement"}

Backs Jacob Zuma, Papering Over Divisions in South Africa", "Date": "2017-04-05", "News": "Supported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The African National Congress in South Africa closed ranks on Wednesday behind President Jacob Zuma, who has faced growing criticism and calls for his resignation after firing a widely respected finance minister last week.The A.N.C., Mr. Zuma\u2019s party, also chastised three of its senior leaders who, in a break from party tradition, openly criticized the president\u2019s actions last week.\u201cThat public dissonance was a mistake that will not happen again,\u201d the party\u2019s secretary general, Gwede Mantashe, said at a news conference after a meeting of the party\u2019s leaders.The firing instead deepened divisions in the party and caused a backlash among voters.Top party leaders condemned the firing, which was part of a broader cabinet reshuffle, saying that Mr. Zuma had not consulted them. The deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called the decision \u201cunacceptable.\u201dBut on Wednesday, the A.N.C. said it accepted Mr. Zuma\u2019s reason for firing Mr. Gordhan, which Mr. Mantashe said was \u201cthe irretrievable breakdown of the relationship between the president and a member of his cabinet.\u201dMr. Zuma and Mr. Gordhan, members of two rival A.N.C. factions, have been engaged in a long dispute about control of party and state coffers.Seen as a bulwark against the misuse of public funds, Mr. Gordhan was respected for his oversight of state enterprises. His dismissal \u2014 and replacement by a Zuma loyalist \u2014 led the ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s to downgrade South Africa\u2019s government debt to junk status.The show of unity on Wednesday failed to close the widening fissures in South Africa\u2019s governing party.Mr. Zuma\u2019s staunchest supporters held rallies and attacked his internal critics. Nomvula Mokonyane, the minister of water and sanitation, denounced S.&P. for the downgrade.\u201cThe West can\u2019t dictate to us,\u201d Ms. Mokonyane told a gathering of A.N.C. youths, adding, \u201cThese junk ratings have nothing to do with financial ratings \u2014 it\u2019s political ratings.\u201dOn the other side, some of the party\u2019s veterans called for Mr. Zuma\u2019s resignation, as did its two closest traditional allies, the South African Communist Party and Cosatu, a powerful trade union federation.Mr. Zuma\u2019s second and final term as president ends in 2019, but his party is scheduled to elect a new leader at the conference in December.Two of the leading contenders are Mr. Ramaphosa, who belongs to the mostly urban wing of the party, and Nkosozana Dlamini-Zuma, a former chairwoman of the African Union who was once married to Mr. Zuma and who represents a mostly rural faction dependent on the patronage politics practiced by the president.\u201cWhat we had until the cabinet reshuffle was a stalemate,\u201d said Steven Friedman, a political scientist at the University of Johannesburg. \u201cNeither faction had a clear sense of who was winning or who was losing. Each side respected the other side\u2019s territory. One side accepted that the finance minister would have to stay, and the other side accepted that the president would have to stay.\u201d\u201cNow, of course, the stalemate is over,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. \u201cZuma and his faction have chosen to break the stalemate.\u201dWhether or not Mr. Zuma\u2019s faction prevails in December, the president will leave behind a greatly diminished A.N.C.Ever the survivor, Mr. Zuma has remained in office despite a series of scandals that would have felled a lesser tactician.

But the party rebuffed efforts to impeach him.\u201cHis conduct has caused serious damage to the A.N.C.,\u201d said Aubrey Matshiqi, a political analyst. \u201cHis self-interest has always come before the interests of the A.N.C. and the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pentagon Inquiry Seeks to Learn if Flynn Hid Foreign Payment", "Date": "2017-04-27", "News": "Supported byBut a year later, he was paid $45,000 by a Kremlin-backed news organization to give a speech in Moscow, an arrangement lawmakers say he failed to disclose the next month when he submitted paperwork to renew his security clearance.The April 11 letter from the inspector general did not specify what payment from a foreign government was at issue. But Mr. Flynn is known to have been paid more than $45,000 by RT, the Kremlin-financed news network, to give a speech in Moscow in December 2015.More than two months after Mr. Flynn was fired as national security adviser, his links to Moscow continue to bedevil the Trump administration, which itself has been dogged by reports of ties between Russian officials and the president\u2019s associates. The Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the F.B.I. are investigating allegations that Mr. Trump\u2019s associates colluded with Russia before and after last year\u2019s presidential election.It is not clear whether Mr. Flynn is cooperating with any of the investigations. But last month, he offered to sit down with congressional investigators in exchange for immunity, a deal that lawmakers say was declined, at least for now.The White House has so far declined requests from both congressional Republicans and Democrats to provide the House Oversight Committee with internal documents related to Mr. Flynn.White House officials argued that they did not have all the documents, and that those they did have were too sensitive and were irrelevant to congressional investigators.\u201cI honestly don\u2019t understand why the White House is covering up for Michael Flynn,\u201d Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House panel, said at a news conference on Thursday.Mr. Cummings released both the Pentagon inspector general\u2019s letter to the committee and the October 2014 letter from the Pentagon instructing Mr. Flynn to seek approval before taking any payments from a foreign government.Democrats decided to release the documents on Thursday without approval from Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, according to a House aide. Mr. Cummings also chastised Mr. Chaffetz for his decision not to demand that Mr. Flynn appear before the committee for questioning, a move the chairman said was unnecessary because of a parallel investigation by the House Intelligence Committee.Mr. Chaffetz announced late Wednesday that he would be away from Washington for a few weeks, recovering from a medical emergency.The lawyer, Robert Kelner, said on Thursday that a partly redacted section of the April 7 letter confirmed that Mr. Flynn had given the D.I.A. information about his speech in Moscow. That section of the letter refers briefly to information Mr. Flynn provided to Pentagon officials on a thumb drive, but does not appear to challenge the agency\u2019s findings that Mr. Flynn did not report receiving money from the Russian government.According to the Defense Department letter cautioning Mr. Flynn to seek permission before accepting payments from foreign governments, the penalty for failing to do so is the suspension of one\u2019s military retirement pay.The penalty for \u201cknowingly falsifying or concealing\u201d information on the form Mr. Flynn filled out to renew his security clearance, apparently without disclosing his speaking fee from RT, is fines and up to five years in prison.The latest development fueled questions about how thoroughly the Trump administration had vetted Mr. Flynn before he was named national security adviser. Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, sought on Thursday to deflect blame to the Obama administration, claiming that officials had full knowledge of Mr. Flynn\u2019s trip to Moscow when his security clearance was issued. That directly contradicted the D.I.A., which said it had no record of Mr. Flynn\u2019s reporting details of his compensation there.Mr. Flynn\u2019s most recent clearance was issued last year, when President Barack Obama was still in office. But security clearances are issued by the Defense Department, not the White House, and are not subject to direct political oversight.After being forced out of the Trump administration, Mr. Flynn belatedly filed paperwork as a foreign agent for his work lobbying on behalf of Turkey\u2019s interests in the United States.

Well before the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, African-American artists and musicians traveled to France to broaden their artistic vision or to escape the daily oppression of American racism.Not widely known, however, is that the traffic went both ways, with French tourists visiting Harlem because of their fascination with jazz, gospel and black culture, even through the rough years of the 1970s and 1980s, when fear of crime kept away many Americans. During that era, my French came in handy more than once, giving directions to bewildered visitors.French-speaking Africans have settled and opened businesses on and around West 116th Street since the 1980s, with Petit Senegal lending the bustling thoroughfare a distinctly international air with passers-by in flowing boubous, shops selling phone cards for cheap calls to Africa, and Franco-African restaurants and vegetable stands offering tropical products like hot peppers, plantain and palm oil. But since the 1990s, a small French expat community, attracted by the romanticism of Harlem, its strong sense of community and colorful history, as well as by comparatively lower real estate prices, has sprung up, and, inevitably, so have French restaurants.Several restaurants are clustered around West 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard (still called Lenox Avenue by hard-core Harlemites), and still the beating heart of Harlem, with one outlier on a corner of St. Nicholas Avenue that once hosted an unmemorable Chinese restaurant. As a Haitian-born immigrant who lived in Paris, Africa and for decades on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side before returning to Paris five years ago, I find the knowledge that I can eat a decent French meal on my trips back to New York \u2014 without traveling downtown \u2014 as comforting as a blanquette de veau on a crisp Paris evening.The presence of at least four traditional French restaurants in Harlem suggests in many ways how much Harlem has evolved, this neighborhood that has absorbed successive waves of immigrants, including the 17th-century Dutch farmers who named it after Haarlem back home. Then there were the Irish and Italians of the mid-19th century, and at the start of the 20th century, Jewish entrepreneurs and entertainers and African-Americans fleeing the segregated South. Now affluent millennials, including many whites, priced out of other parts of the city, have arrived.For most of the 1950s and 1960s, the most visible Gallic presence in Harlem was Frenchy, the flamboyant Haitian-born Camillo Casimir, whose Casdulan Hairdressers on 125th Street was Harlem\u2019s largest beauty parlor. Frenchy traveled often to Paris to keep up with the latest styles and coifed the hair of Harlem V.I.P.\u2019s, including Diahann Carroll and Mrs. Louis Armstrong.Each of the four restaurants profiled here offers its own particular ambience.Mr. Warin (pronounced Vah-RHIN), born in Bordeaux, first moved to Australia, where he learned English, before finding his way to New York. He got a job as a waiter, studied to become a sommelier and worked for Alain Ducasse and Fran\u00e7ois Payard before launching his own place.Mr. Warin, 44, has lived in Harlem since 2000 and had long dreamed of opening a French restaurant there. \u201cI have a passion for food and wine and Harlem,\u201d he said. But some investors remained wary of financing restaurants in the neighborhood until Mr. Samuelsson\u2019s Red Rooster opened a decade ago, he said. Gaetan Rousseau, a film producer and former neighbor in Harlem who had frequently heard his pitch, finally agreed to invest. Barawine is a Franglais word play on the French bar \u00e0 vin.Open since August 2013 for dinner daily and brunch on weekends, Barawine attracts a stylish and diverse crowd of young and old, black and white, neighborhood characters, tourists looking for a good meal and suburbanites who want to experience the \u201cnew Harlem.\u201d \u201cWe have a lot of French people on the weekend,\u201d Mr. Warin said, attributing the surge of European tourists in the last five years to an article in the French newspaper Le Figaro about black churches offering gospel music.The ambience at Barawine is cool and upscale, with a D.J. spinning rap, hip-hop and soul at Sunday brunch, and live jazz on Sunday nights and Tuesdays. A multiracial Francophone staff offers friendly and efficient service. Barawine features a standard French menu, including mussels, a charcuterie plate and hand-cut beef tartare. The food is tasty, well presented and reminds me of the bistronomique restaurants in the gentrifying neighborhoods of the 10th and 11th Arrondissements in Paris. The list is international, with 25 wines available by the glass at $9 to $15, and 200 wines available by the bottle. At dinner, first courses range from $10 to $16; main dishes, $17 to $36.Mr. Guizonne (pronounced Gee-ZONE) said many customers \u2014 unaware of France\u2019s increasingly diverse population \u2014 are surprised to see a black Frenchman as the owner. Explaining his origins can be difficult since, he said, most customers have never heard of Guadeloupe. \u201cI tell them it\u2019s near St. Martin,\u201d he said, referring to the popular Caribbean vacation destination.Mr. Guizonne said he benefits from the drawing power of the media-consuming Red Rooster just next door. \u201cI like to say people party at Red Rooster, but they come to my place to eat.\u201dHis menu features many French classics, including, on a recent visit, an onion soup, a steak-frites and a cassoulet on a par with what I order in a standard neighborhood restaurant in my Paris neighborhood. At dinner, first courses are $8 to $16; main courses, $20 to $28. The atmosphere is vaguely colonial and a little faded, with exposed bricks, overhead fans, palms and a row of antique mirrors along one wall. Mr. Guizonne has plans for an upgrade of the d\u00e9cor, and has opened an upstairs lounge with jazz and R&B music for dancing on weekends. He\u2019s also considering a new name. In good weather, his outdoor seating area is lively and ideal for checking out the boldface names going in and out of the Red Rooster.Ch\u00e9ri is a couple of steps down from the sidewalk on the ground floor of a brownstone, and the atmosphere is both casual and refined.\u201cI wanted people to feel they are in my living room,\u201d said Alain Eoche, 57, an energetic man who lives on two floors above the restaurant. He is a believer in the Chinese practice of feng shui and has organized and decorated the space himself. There\u2019s a grand piano, a bar along the left side of the room, a bookcase and a fireplace.The jewel of the location is the garden in the back, a covered space that can be opened to the sky in good weather. Ch\u00e9ri frequently features live music \u2014 a pianist most evenings, with a singer on occasion. The walls serve as a gallery for a rotating roster of French and Caribbean artists whom Mr. Eoche admires.Born in Nantes, on the Atlantic coast of France, Mr. Eoche (pronounced AY-osh)owned a restaurant in the chic Marais district of Paris for 20 years before moving to New York in 2013. He opened Ch\u00e9ri in March 2014. The menu includes a merguez lamb burger, and something hard to find in France, a veggie burger. First courses are $9 to $21; main dishes, $19 to $27. Mr. Eoche does much of the cooking himself, including the daily special, and the food benefits from his personal attention \u2014 it is authentic and flavorful.Like the other three restaurateurs, he fell in love with Harlem\u2019s neighborliness. \u201cYou\u2019re in New York, but not really,\u201d he said. \u201cThe village ambience makes immigrants feel more at ease.\u201dThe background is exposed brick, and the d\u00e9cor smacks more of accumulation than foresight \u2014 a gumball machine, an antique clock and assorted paintings. The bar, on the ground level of what used to be a Chinese restaurant, is lighted by tall windows during the day and is warm and cozy in the evening. It is the center of social interaction at Maison Harlem, with drinkers elbow to elbow on busy weekend nights and the overflow and those waiting for tables lined up along the narrow counter on the opposite wall.The large dining room is several steps up at the back of the bar, giving diners the sensation of stepping onto a stage. You have a choice of picking a table or a leather booth to monitor the bar scene or seats farther back for more privacy.Maison Harlem is nestled at the foot of the hill that leads to the City College campus and its hodgepodge of granite and white terra-cotta neo-Gothic buildings and stark modern structures. It draws a busy lunch crowd during the week, college faculty, students and employees of businesses around West 125th Street.The owner, Samuel Thiam, 45, is a native of Paris who grew up in the southern French city of Montpellier. An aunt and uncle ran a restaurant in the Paris suburbs. Mr. Thiam (pronounced TEA-am) came to New York as a dancer and actor, but a motorcycle accident ended that career. He got work as a floor director for television news shows. The hours were long, he recalled, and the job didn\u2019t fulfill him.The menu and the ambience echo his biracial origins \u2014 his mother was from Normandy and his father from the Ivory Coast. \u201cI wanted to have French food with an African panache,\u201d Mr. Thiam said. The background music leans toward Afrobeat and the Nigerian music legend Fela Kuti, but you might hear French chansons at lunch and brunch. There are North African dishes, including a merguez sausage sandwich at lunch. First courses at dinner are $9 to $20; main courses, $14 to $32. He recently introduced a bar menu that offers sliders and oysters at a buck a piece.Mr. Thiam has been struck by how both old and new Harlemites are remarkably knowledgeable about French cuisine. \u201cI\u2019ve had so many people chatting with me about escargots, foie gras and p\u00e2t\u00e9s, it always surprises me,\u201d he said.An article last Sunday about French influences in Harlem misidentified the birthplace of Fab-rice Warin, owner of Barawine Harlem. He was born in Bordeaux, not in Alsace.Joel Dreyfuss, a journalist based in Paris, is writing a book about his family\u2019s 300-year relationship with Haiti.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018A Different Los Angeles\u2019: The City Moves to Alter Its Sprawling Image", "Date": "2017-04-11", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetLos Angeles conjures a particular image in the popular imagination: sprawling and spacious, dotted with single-family homes and riddled with traffic. But Angelenos have signaled that they are ready for a change, most recently by voting down a measure that would have slowed new construction for two years.Mr. Weinstein said that kind of development was out of character for the neighborhood. He and other supporters of Measure S have contended that new luxury developments can contribute to rising rents.The Measure S campaign pitted slow-growth factions, who called the city\u2019s planning process corrupt, against a coalition of public officials, developers, labor groups and others who conceded that while reform was necessary, so was growth.Now that the pro-growth group has prevailed, the question is: How does the city move forward? Can it overhaul the planning process, allow innovation and still please the disparate stakeholders within its 503 square miles?Measure S, which was defeated last month, was the third in a trio of transformative local ballot measures. In November, Angelenos approved a $1.2 billion bond to build affordable housing, along with a half-cent sales tax increase to pay for mass transit.\u201cThat\u2019s L.A.\u2019s biggest and most exciting challenge: How do you harness the momentum, the investment and even the disruption in a way that still addresses social needs?\u201d Mr. Garcetti said.Mr. Hawthorne has put forth the notion of a \u201cThird L.A.,\u201d a redefined vision of the city. The \u201cFirst L.A.\u201d was marked by the arrival of water in the 1880s and the city\u2019s first population and real estate booms; it was a city of great civic ambition, public architecture and great experimental multifamily housing.But it is the \u201cSecond L.A.\u201d that is most enduring: the post-World War Two modernist mecca, a patchwork of single-family homes crossed by freeways and defined by the car. It is the city of Julius Shulman\u2019s iconic photos of glass Case Study Houses overlooking suburban sprawl, and David Hockney\u2019s paintings of backyard swimming pools.\u201cThe dream or ambition embodied by the Second L.A. begins to break down into the \u201980s and \u201990s,\u201d Mr. Hawthorne said.It is those neighborhoods that are now the focal point of the emerging Third L.A.Koreatown is well served by mass transit: Three metro stops along Wilshire Boulevard link it to downtown Los Angeles.\u201cIt\u2019s denser and people are choosing to live there because they want to give up some square footage in exchange for more,\u201d Mr. Hawthorne said. That\u2019s more time, access to transit and a pedestrian culture.\u201cIn a place like South L.A., which investors have systematically avoided, the red lines are just now falling away,\u201d Mr. Harris-Dawson said. \u201cInvestors are enthusiastic, bullish, excited about mass transit coming through South L.A., about the opportunities along the main corridor, and excited about the untapped potential.\u201dHad it passed, the Measure S two-year building moratorium threatened to shut down new opportunity for South Los Angeles and neighborhoods like it. But in simply running the campaign, \u201cS\u201d proponents may have expanded that opportunity, by effectively starting the conversation about how to make Los Angeles\u2019 planning process more transparent and effective.The mayor signed an executive directive on March 9 establishing a planning task force, banning closed-door communications between planning commissioners and developers, and setting up programs at City Hall to guide development around transit and affordability.Mr. Garcetti said he planned to eliminate regulations that stymie innovation, \u201cwhether it\u2019s the size of units, or the connectivity of transportation modes.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re writing the rules as we go,\u201d the mayor said, acknowledging \u201cthat can be very disruptive to people.\u201d But, he added, \u201cWe need to get with it.\u201dAll of this signals a move toward building that Third L.A.\u201cI see a series of many urban centers along the transportation corridors,\u201d said Nelson Rising, chief executive of Rising Realty Partners, which has worked extensively in downtown Los Angeles.\u201cAnything near a transit stop will become viable and attractive,\u201d Mr. Rising said. He pointed to specific hubs of density along the purple line, which currently links downtown to Koreatown and is set to extend all the way to Westwood. He also pointed to the Expo Line, which runs parallel to Interstate 10 and connected downtown to Santa Monica in May 2016.The city planning department has laid the groundwork for these changes. Last year it enacted a mobility plan to diversify transportation modes by 2035, and created a new industrial live-work zone in response to demand from commercial and residential sectors for that kind of multiuse development.Mr. Hawthorne speculated that the Third L.A. might be a city in which pockets of the First and Second L.A. peek through.Mayor Garcetti is thinking hard about the look of the city.\u201cPeople entrust and elect leaders to take some risks and to be big and bold about the projects we do,\u201d he said.He said he hoped to turn an eye to the streetscape, to engage Angelenos at street level in a way the city never had to when the car was king.It is why he has pursued large projects like a stretch of the Los Angeles River planned by the local \u201cstarchitect\u201d Frank Gehry, the visually stunning Broad Museum and a forthcoming $1 billion museum by the filmmaker George Lucas. It is also why he is considering bringing in a chief design officer.Mr. Garcetti said he envisions \u201ca guru who can marshal the forces of the city and look at every bus stop, curb, utility box, every facade, every subway portal: These are moments to inspire and connect.\u201d He added, \u201cWe should seize that moment.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the institution where Christopher Hawthorne teaches. It is Occidental College, not Occidental University.An article on the Square Feet page on April 12 about efforts in Los Angeles to contain sprawl referred incorrectly to the planned extension of the city\u2019s purple transit line. It will go as far as the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, not to the city of Santa Monica.Advertisement"}

That would be Terje Rod-Larsen and Mona Juul, the (very real) Norwegian husband and wife who in the early 1990s initiated the series of secret peace talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization that led to the Oslo Accords, a fleeting moment of bright hope in an enduringly dark realm of conflict.Terje (embodied here by Jefferson Mays) was then director of the Fafo Institute for Applied Social Sciences; Mona (Jennifer Ehle), an official in the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. Their approach in bringing together two seemingly irreconcilable sides was rooted in the theory of gradualism (as opposed to the more traditional model of totalism), which is far less academic and more emotional, and common-sensical, than it sounds.In the opening scene, at a dinner party at the couple\u2019s apartment in which gossip is the stuff of history books, Terje describes meeting the Israeli statesman Yitzhak Rabin, who at first comes across as a sputtering clown. \u201cSix months later, Rabin is prime minister, and I am a fool,\u201d says Terje. \u201cWhy? Because I saw one side of this man and assumed this meant I knew all of him.\u201d Overcoming such assumptions gives \u201cOslo\u201d its shape and substance.Michael Yeargan\u2019s set is stark, a paradigm of luxuriously austere Scandinavian chic. Personalities are what furnish the rooms of \u201cOslo,\u201d much of which takes place in a chateau 30 miles south of its title city. Furniture is summoned \u2014 and in many cases, directly pushed \u2014 into place by Terje and Mona, whose roles in the political and dramatic schemes of things are established at the very beginning.Terje is the theorist, and a pontificator with a peacock streak; Mona is the expediter and interpreter \u2014 not just for the diverse participants in the peace talks, but for the audience as well. In both capacities, she exudes a quiet but commanding serenity that defuses tensions and restores perspective.It is she who orients us in place and time, which shift (and even double back) frequently; her sustaining clarity within a labyrinthine narrative mirrors that of Mr. Rogers. Everyone falls a bit in love with Mona. And with Ms. Ehle, a two-time Tony winner, doing some of her most subtle and refined work ever, this seems inevitable.The actors who embody the participants in a two-steps-forward, one-step-back process that mostly (and improbably) occurred over a concentrated nine months are all first-rate. Each is giving a finely detailed performance \u2014 and in some cases, several performances \u2014 that feels both true to and larger than life. That includes everyone from T. Ryder Smith as the Norwegian foreign minister Johan Jorgen Holst to Henny Russell as the adored cook at the chateau, whose waffles become a sword of peace.But there are at least four people onstage, in addition to Terje and Mona, to whom you come to feel as close as if you had been talking to them one on one. Among the Israeli characters, they are Yair Hirschfeld (Daniel Oreskes, who later shows up as the foreign minister Shimon Peres), a jokey, anxious professor of economics from Haifa, and Uri Savir (an explosively animated Michael Aronov), a Foreign Ministry director who seems to see himself as a cross between Mick Jagger and James Bond.On the Palestinian side, there\u2019s Hassan Asfour (Dariush Kashani), a blustery delegate who wittily finds a Communist aper\u00e7u for every occasion. As the P.L.O. finance minister Ahmed Qurie, Anthony Azizi delicately charts a progression from chill impenetrability into warm accessibility that mirrors the great arc of the play.\u201cBetween our peoples lies a vast ocean,\u201d he says near the beginning of the talks. And Mr. Sher \u2014 aided by an ace team that includes Donald Holder (lighting) and 59 Productions (projections) \u2014 makes inspired use of the considerable breadth of the Beaumont Stage to convey the distance that must be crossed. So as we watch the unlikely friendship that develops between Mr. Azizi\u2019s and Mr. Aronov\u2019s characters, we are pulled, as it were, from a long shot into a close-up, a proximity that feels both hopeful and heartbreaking.At the play\u2019s end, we are told that this cross-cultural friendship survived. The peace engendered by the Oslo Accords did not. Yet at a moment when virulent divisions of race and religion plague not only the Middle East but also countries around the world, including ours, this resonant drama echoes E. M. Forster\u2019s dictum, \u201cOnly connect,\u201d and wonders why \u2014 oh, why \u2014 that can\u2019t be possible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Muni Market Turns Toward Washington", "Date": "2017-04-14", "News": "Supported byWith $3.8 trillion in bonds from more than 50,000 issuers, the municipal market is remarkably large and diverse. But right now, the vast muni universe is focused on one city, Washington.Numerous proposals of the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress could rattle the market if enacted.President Trump\u2019s call for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending could swell the nation\u2019s municipal bond supply, for example, while the possibility of lower corporate tax rates could reduce the appetites of banks and insurers, which now own about 30 percent of muni bonds.What\u2019s more, if personal income tax rates went down (another possibility in Washington these days), demand for muni bonds could drop because the tax-sheltering features of the bonds could be less enticing. Even more troubling for the market, the tax exemption of interest income \u2014 the very foundation of municipal bonds \u2014 is always part of discussions about changing the tax code.The muni bond market initially reacted negatively to these possibilities. The iShares National Muni Bond ETF fell 4.2 percent from the presidential election until Dec. 2. That was a rough stretch for all kinds of bonds, as interest rates climbed and the Federal Reserve indicated it was on the cusp of more aggressive rate increases, though the muni slide was more pronounced. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, which tracks the high-grade taxable market, lost only 2.75 percent in the same period.But the market may have overreacted, said John V. Miller, co-head of fixed income at Nuveen Asset Management. \u201cThere is a perception that every one of the policies being discussed will be passed and passed in short order and all will be deeply harmful to municipal bond investors,\u201d he said. The reality is different. \u201cI expect there will be a delay, and even if some of the proposals get through, they aren\u2019t all unequivocally negative,\u201d Mr. Miller said.Indeed, after the initial shock wore off, the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond index gained 3.2 percent from its December low through the end of the first quarter, while an index of taxable bonds rose 1.3 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s not 100 percent clear it is going to be a rocky year,\u201d said Cormac Cullen, co-manager of Fidelity Municipal Income Fund.Professional municipal bond investors are generally sanguine that while policy changes may cause some near-term volatility, they are not an existential threat. Depending on how negotiations in Washington play out, there could even be some good news for munis.The $1 trillion for infrastructure the president proposed may not roil muni bonds too greatly because the outlay would probably be spread out over a decade, making it more digestible for the $3.8 trillion market. Moreover, all or a portion of the money may be earmarked for funding private-public partnerships, which could resemble something along the lines of the taxable Build America Bonds that were issued as part of the 2009 stimulus. In that case, the supply of traditional tax-exempt munis would not swell. \u201cYou can\u2019t presume all the spending would be for projects financed with tax-exempt money,\u201d Mr. Miller said.Nor is a reduction in the corporate tax rate all bad news. Peter Hayes, head of the municipal bond group at BlackRock, believes that a new rate would not be low enough to cause insurers and banks to high-tail it out of municipal bonds. \u201cWhat we could see is that they let their municipal portfolios mature and, over time, shift money into other assets,\u201d he said. Yet, Mr. Hayes said, \u201cThere\u2019s also the possibility that the ability of corporations to deduct corporate bond interest goes away.\u201d That would lead to less issuance of corporate bonds \u2014 and that could increase demand for muni bonds.A reduction in personal income tax rates is also not expected to be a seismic event. One possibility is that the top rate would fall from 39.6 percent to 33 percent. That\u2019s a lot less than the fall from 50 percent to 28 percent under the Reagan tax cuts, which the municipal market survived. Moreover, it is not as if any state with a high income tax rate is talking about cuts. And right now, a 10-year high-grade municipal bond has the same 2.5 percent yield as a taxable 10-year Treasury note. That works out to a 3.73 percent taxable equivalent yield for someone in a 33-percent federal income tax bracketAs for eliminating the exemption for interest income, changing it would affect thousands of municipalities that rely on muni bonds to finance their public works. For that reason alone, it is widely seen as unlikely to happen.What has a much higher probability of affecting muni bonds this year is rising interest rates, though even here, the damage may not be great. While a sharp rate spike would cause bond prices to suffer bigger losses, Christopher Ryon, municipal bond manager at Thornburg Investment Management, noted that \u201cwe are not in a situation where rates are going to take off.\u201d (Bond prices and bond yields move in opposite directions. Total return is the sum of the yield and the price change.) With expectations for rates that are higher but not too high, \u201cyou will be getting more income, which is why you own municipals,\u201d Mr. Ryon said.And that rate rise is making municipal bonds a better value. \u201cBefore the election, you were not getting paid to take risk,\u201d Mr. Ryon said, citing the fact that the inflation-adjusted yield for a 10-year municipal bond was below zero. Today it is back at 0.65 percent. That is still below the longer-term norm of two percentage points, but it is moving in the right direction.Nonetheless, rising rates merit some attention. Gary Schatsky, a financial adviser based in New York City, is sticking with short-term municipal bonds maturing in three years or less. The yields are small (around 1 percent before factoring in the tax break), but you aren\u2019t exposed to much price movement as rates rise, or if policy changes materialize.Another way to eke out more yield is to look for portfolios that emphasize bonds rated A (often called single-A) over AA and AAA bonds. A single-A bond is still considered high quality, just a little less than AA and AAA. The 3 percent yield for a 10-year A-rated bond is about a half a percentage point more than the yield for AAA bonds.Funds and ETFs that track a municipal index hold less than 20 percent in single-A bonds. Actively managed high-quality funds including Fidelity Municipal Income and T. Rowe Price Summit Municipal Income now invest more than 30 percent in single-A issues.\u201cSingle-A bonds offer good risk-reward,\u201d said Kevin Ramundo, co-manager of Fidelity Municipal Income. That\u2019s a balancing act that will be ever more valuable this year as policy makers bear down.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s genius.\u201d\u201cHe was eating his cake,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Xi, \u201cand he was silent.\u201dMr. Trump said Mr. Xi had asked his interpreter to repeat what he had said about the airstrike, and then said that he approved of the move.\u201cAnybody that was so brutal and uses gases to do that to young children and babies, it\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Mr. Trump said, describing Mr. Xi\u2019s reaction. \u201cHe was O.K. with it.\u201d\u201cYou never know, do you?\u201d he said. \u201cWe are sending an armada \u2014 very powerful, and we have submarines \u2014 very powerful, far more powerful than the aircraft carrier,\u201d he added, apparently referring to American submarines carrying ballistic nuclear missiles.\u201cHe is doing the wrong thing,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.\u201cWhen you look at Susan Rice and what\u2019s going on, and so many people are coming up to me and apologizing now,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey say, \u2018You know, you were right when you said that.\u2019 Perhaps I didn\u2019t know how right I was, because nobody knew the extent of it.\u201dMr. Trump has said Ms. Rice\u2019s actions may have been unlawful, an assertion his allies in the news media have frequently made but for which the president has provided no evidence. Current and former intelligence officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have said they do not believe Ms. Rice\u2019s actions were unusual or illegal.In the interview, Mr. Trump also said James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director who is leading an investigation into his campaign\u2019s potential ties with Russia, had helped Hillary Clinton, his 2016 Democratic presidential rival, avoid prosecution for her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.\u201cWhen Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton \u2014 he saved her life,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cDirector Comey was very, very good to Hillary Clinton. If he weren\u2019t, she would be right now going to trial.\u201dHe said he had kept Mr. Comey in his job \u201cbecause I want to give everybody a good, fair chance.\u201dOn domestic policy, Mr. Trump said he was making a second attempt to push through a broad health care overhaul before he turns to a sweeping tax rewrite, leaving the fate of both initiatives uncertain.\u201cIt\u2019s been very much misreported that we failed with health care,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t failed with health care; we\u2019re negotiating, and we continue to negotiate.\u201dThe president argued that the elimination of nearly $1 trillion in health care-related taxes as part of the health measure should be used to finance a package of individual and corporate tax cuts.\u201cWe have to do health care first to pick up additional money, so that we get great tax reform,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He declined to weigh in on the inclusion of a 20-percent import tax known as a \u201cborder adjustment tax\u201d in the plan, which is backed by many House Republicans. But Mr. Trump said the idea of some sort of tax at the border appealed to him as a way of creating a system that is fair to the United States.\u201cLet\u2019s call it an import tax, let\u2019s call it a reciprocal tax,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u201cI need 60 percent for that, and if I put that in, the Democrats are actually going to love the infrastructure plan,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Advertisement"}

While we devour much of what is made, huge quantities of perfectly good grain are tossed.Mr. Stuart\u2019s New York team has set the date for the second brew, which will be much larger to accommodate an order from Whole Foods. This summer it should be available there, and at bars and restaurants in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens.It took months to find a contract brewer willing to put untested ingredients into its tanks. Madi Holtzman, one of two women leading the American effort, said she spoke with every microbrewery in New York State. After dozens of emails and phone calls, Chelsea Craft Brewing, which moved to the Bronx two years ago from Manhattan, signed on to make the first batch on March 21.Mark Szmaida, the head brewer at Chelsea, was all shades of skeptical before the big day. \u201cMy brewer friends said, \u2018You\u2019re crazy,\u2019\u201d he said. The problem was that bread has gluten, and gluten turns gummy. Mr. Szmaida worried that the bread would become an unforgiving mass, and the metal rakes inside his tanks would get stuck.But the brewery\u2019s owner, Pat Greene, was game. \u201cIn 25 years, I\u2019ve never had a beer I couldn\u2019t get through,\u201d he said, referring to the steps of the brewing process.On the day of the first brew, the team showed up at 7:30 a.m. Two hundred and fifty pounds of sliced sandwich bread was torn by hand into three-inch pieces \u2014 any smaller and they might clump together. (Though the Toast brewers used to toast the bread, they have stopped in order to consume less energy.)Then the brewers layered ingredients in what they called a lasagna approach. The bread was mixed with rice hulls to help prevent the bread from sticking, and alternated in the tank with malt. When the barley hit the mash, the air took on the warm, fragrant smell of a bakery. Later, several rounds of hops were added.It\u2019s this final step that gives the American ale its more pronounced hop flavor and aroma, which are complemented by smooth caramel notes. (In England, Toast has added a Craft Lager and a Session I.P.A.)\u201cThe idea isn\u2019t just to solve food waste itself, but to use food waste as the most blatant illustration of the fact that the global food system is built on a fundamental paradox \u2014 that we need to double food production by 2050 to feed the nine billion,\u201d Mr. Stuart said.\u201cIt\u2019s a really creative solution to a pretty insurmountable problem,\u201d Mr. Barber said of the beer, which he paired with his cured waste-fed pig.Eventually, Mr. Stuart hopes to see nonprofit organizations and bakeries around the world paired up to create their own regional versions of the beer. \u201cThis idea generates revenue,\u201d Mr. Stuart said. \u201cIt\u2019s cool and upbeat, and we can have a party to solve the problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Move of U.S. Warships Shows Trump Has Few Options on North Korea", "Date": "2017-04-10", "News": "Supported byChina\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, did not make any public commitment to tighten the pressure on North Korea during his meeting in Palm Beach, Fla., last week with President Trump. Even privately, officials said, he was circumspect. And an attack on North Korea carries far greater risk than the missile strike that Mr. Trump ordered last week to punish President Bashar al-Assad of Syria for his deadly chemical weapons attack.That leaves the White House in a bind on a security issue that Mr. Trump has described as the most pressing of his presidency. Mr. Trump warned before the meeting with Mr. Xi that the United States would act alone against North Korea if China did not join his pressure campaign.A senior administration official expressed hope that the productive tone of the meeting would eventually lead to further Chinese actions. But Mr. Trump\u2019s missile strike, which came while he and Mr. Xi were having dinner, could play both ways: Administration officials said it would convince the Chinese leader of Mr. Trump\u2019s resolve, while some experts said it would reinforce fears in Beijing that he is erratic and unpredictable.Flexing America\u2019s military muscle alone is not likely to deter North Korea\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong-un, from testing nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles. Former President Barack Obama ordered the aircraft carrier George Washington into the Yellow Sea twice to intimidate Mr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, without persuading him to change his behavior.\u201cThis is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, who advised Mr. Obama on China. \u201cThey\u2019ve signaled a new approach, but they\u2019re discovering that the new approaches are not particularly attractive.\u201dThe White House is likely to pursue so-called secondary sanctions, which target Chinese firms and banks that help North Korea earn foreign currency and finance its weapons programs. The question is whether the Chinese government will cooperate with the effort, and if it does not, whether Mr. Trump will impose the sanctions unilaterally, even at the risk of rupturing the relationship between Washington and Beijing.On Sunday, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said Mr. Xi agreed with Mr. Trump that \u201cthe situation has intensified and has reached a certain level of threat that action has to be taken.\u201d There is also evidence of a tougher line toward North Korea among the Chinese elite, Mr. Bader said, though it has not yet filtered into the government\u2019s policy.China has taken modest steps to increase the pressure. It agreed with South Korea on Monday to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea if it carries out nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile tests, a senior South Korean diplomat said. The announcement seemed intended to dissuade North Korea from conducting a test to mark a national holiday this week.On Monday, Wu Dawei, the top Chinese envoy for international efforts to end North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, met with his South Korean counterpart, Kim Hong-kyun, in Seoul, the South\u2019s capital, to discuss what to do about the North\u2019s advancing nuclear and missile programs.Mr. Kim said he and Mr. Wu did not discuss a possible American military strike against North Korea.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides warned that they were not ruling out \u201cmilitary options.\u201d Over the weekend, Mr. Tillerson said the American strike against Syria was a signal to other countries that \u201ca response is likely to be undertaken\u201d if they pose a danger.Analysts and officials in South Korea fear that a pre-emptive military attack against North Korea \u2014 even one limited to taking out nuclear and missile bases \u2014 could set off a catastrophic retaliation and a full-scale war. Seoul lies within range of North Korean artillery and rockets amassed along the border.Military planners in the Pentagon share those fears. \u201cWhile the military is very focused on maintaining a strong deterrence posture on the peninsula, it is acutely aware of the dangers of escalation,\u201d said Derek H. Chollet, a former assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs.The risk of escalation in Syria was lower, Mr. Chollet said, because Mr. Assad is weaker than Mr. Kim and there was less concern about Syria\u2019s stockpile of weapons of mass destruction falling into the wrong hands.\u201cA nuclear-armed North Korea is a different story,\u201d he said.In South Korea, the prospect of a pre-emptive strike has long been dismissed as unrealistic. But \u201cunder President Trump, we are afraid that that may not necessarily be so anymore,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the Sejong Institute, a think tank in South Korea.Some American analysts argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictability could give him leverage with the Chinese. Michael J. Green, an Asia adviser to President George W, Bush, recalled negotiating with China and North Korea when Mr. Bush began his invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Chinese noticeably shifted their tone, he said, and put more pressure on the North Koreans.\u201cEverybody prices in North Korean unpredictability,\u201d said Victor D. Cha, who also worked on Asia during the Bush administration. \u201cMost of the other players price in U.S. predictability and reliability. The only time I\u2019ve ever seen the Chinese worried is when they\u2019re not sure what the U.S. is going to do.\u201dAmerican allies in the region offered general support for deterrence, but not necessarily pre-emptive action. In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he supported the \u201cresolve\u201d of the United States in stopping Syria from using chemical weapons. But he did not directly comment on the move of the aircraft carrier to the region.To South Koreans, Mr. Trump\u2019s order to launch a barrage of missiles on Syria demonstrated his willingness to use military means against an adversary deemed particularly egregious. And the order to the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to return to waters near the Korean Peninsula appeared unusual because it conducted exercises in the area last month.Moon Sang-gyun, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, said the strike group was moving back to deter North Korean provocations in coming weeks. North Korea observes major anniversaries this month, including the April 15 birthday of its founder, Kim Il-sung, grandfather of Kim Jong-un, raising fears that it might carry out celebratory weapons tests.On Tuesday, North Korea lashed out at the United States over the deployment of the aircraft carrier. The state-run Korean Central News Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying: \u201cWe will hold the U.S. wholly accountable for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its outrageous actions.\u201dMark Landler reported from Washington, and Choe Sang-hun from Seoul.

{"Headline": "India\u2019s Ban on Foreign Money for Health Group Hits Gates Foundation", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byNEW DELHI \u2014 The Indian government has blocked one of the country\u2019s largest nonprofit public health organizations from accepting money from foreign donors, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.The cancellation of the health organization\u2019s license to accept international financing is the latest move in an aggressive government crackdown on nongovernmental organizations that receive money from outside India.More than 11,000 nongovernmental groups have lost their licenses to accept foreign financing since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office in 2014. Many are small organizations, but the government has taken action against some whose activities it has deemed against the national interest.The public health organization, the Public Health Foundation of India, is a public-private partnership that was started by the government in 2006. It receives considerable income from both the government and Gates Foundation.The organization was notified by letter last week that the government had canceled its license to accept international donations, Rajiv Chhibber, a spokesman for the group, said on Thursday.\u201cThe letter says that we have utilized funds from tobacco and H.I.V. projects for lobbying amongst media and parliamentarians,\u201d Mr. Chhibber said. The Gates Foundation provides most of the financing for the tobacco and H.I.V. programs, he said, and both operate in partnership with the Indian government.A right-wing group known as Swadeshi Jagran Manch has accused the Gates Foundation of having a conflict of interest in its efforts to expand immunization in India. The group claims the foundation is connected to pharmaceutical companies, said Ashwani Mahajan, a senior member of the organization, which is putting together research detailing its assertion to present to the government and to request government action against the Gates Foundation.Kuldeep Singh Dhatwalia, a spokesman for the Ministry of Home Affairs, confirmed the cancellation of the public health organization\u2019s license to receive foreign financing. He declined to specify the grounds for the cancellation, aside from what he called \u201cirregularities\u201d in some of its programs.The Gates Foundation said in a statement that it \u201cfunds a variety of partners to undertake charitable objectives and requires these partners to comply with all applicable laws.\u201dResponding to the criticism that it had a conflict of interest in its public health work in India, the foundation said that \u201censuring the adequate production and affordability of vital and safe vaccines for the world\u2019s poorest populations is of the utmost importance.\u201dTo bring less-expensive vaccines to people in India, the Gates Foundation said, it has been working \u201cto support increased Indian local capabilities in vaccine development.\u201dUnder an Indian law that governs nongovernmental organizations that accept foreign money, that money must not be used to lobby the government.Mr. Chhibber, the public health foundation\u2019s media relations director, said that a large part of the organization\u2019s tobacco program involved research on tobacco\u2019s health effects. He said the foundation worked with the government on this program.He also said the organization was not involved in any lobbying of the government.Among the other organizations that have been blocked from accepting international financing is Compassion International, a Christian charity based in the United States that provided meals and tuition subsidies to needy children in India.The Public Health Foundation of India has long been a giant in the public health sphere here. When then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh created the organization in 2006, he used seed money from the ministry of health.The majority of its money comes from foreign sources, Mr. Chhibber said. The foundation received more than $30 million in grants from various sources in the fiscal year ending March 2016, according to financial documents on its website.The programs cited by the government in its letter are run in coordination with the government, Mr. Chhibber said. After receiving the letter, the foundation sent an explanation of its programs to Indian officials.Mr. Chhibber said the organization hoped India would reconsider its decision. \u201cWe\u2019re still in conversations with the government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also given them supporting documents to show that whatever was done was done on the behest of the ministry or to carry forward the tobacco policy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Penn Station, Rail Mishap Spurs Large and Lasting Headache", "Date": "2017-04-04", "News": "Supported byIt was a relatively minor mishap \u2014 several cars on a slow-moving New Jersey Transit train jumped the tracks on Monday morning at Pennsylvania Station in New York.But by the next day, it had cascaded into a transportation crisis, snarling travel up and down the East Coast, upending the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, and vividly illustrating the fragile state of infrastructure in the nation\u2019s busiest transit corridor.The derailment happened at a notorious choke point inside North America\u2019s busiest train station \u2014 a crowded and gloomy labyrinth that was never meant to handle a daily flow of 600,000 passengers and 1,300 trains. When something goes wrong on the tracks, it can cripple the three railroads that rely on the station.And this time the disruptions are likely to linger as officials warned on Tuesday that it could take several days to make repairs and restore full service after the derailment knocked out eight of the station\u2019s 21 tracks.It was the second accident at Penn Station in the same area in less than two weeks. Aside from triggering commuting chaos, the incidents have prompted concerns about the safety of the aging tracks. The widespread upheaval also provided a harrowing glimpse into a future that all agree would be marred by constant delays unless more tracks are added at the station and a new tunnel is built under the Hudson River.\u201cThey\u2019re operating at absolutely maximum capacity to serve the ever-increasing ridership that wants to get into New York City,\u201d said Martin E. Robins, a former deputy executive director at New Jersey Transit. \u201cAnd you have an old infrastructure that was originally built more than 100 years ago.\u201dOn Tuesday, there were major delays on New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road \u2014 two of the busiest commuter railroads in the country, which along with Amtrak share space at Penn Station. Amtrak had to run fewer trains between New York and Washington, one of the country\u2019s major rail corridors.Riders fumed as they squeezed onto crowded trains and buses stalled in clogged traffic leading to New York.Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey became an extraordinary scene of gridlock as passengers leaving New Jersey Transit trains struggled to make their way to PATH trains, buses and ferries bound for Manhattan. There were so many people that the police barricaded stairs leading to PATH trains to control the crowds.Jenna Iandiorio\u2019s commute took nearly three hours after her New Jersey Transit train was diverted to Hoboken.She described the scene: \u201cJust a lot of very frustrated faces of people who deal with this far too often.\u201d\u201cThere is never a week where it\u2019s smooth sailing to work,\u201d Ms. Iandiorio added. \u201cThere are always issues.\u201dThe new station would have provided relief when problems arose at Penn Station, said Mr. Robins, who worked on that project. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuing disappointment,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery month, it comes back to haunt us in one way or another that the project was not built.\u201dOfficials want to build a new tunnel as part of the $23 billion Gateway project and to eventually build new tracks to expand Penn Station. Before that happens, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has promised to renovate the cramped Penn Station and to create a new train hall across the street on Eighth Avenue.John D. Porcari, the interim executive director of the Gateway Program Development Corporation, a nonprofit overseeing the new tunnel, told reporters on Tuesday that the project would improve reliability at Penn Station and reduce the kinds of inconveniences commuters are enduring this week.\u201cThis is a project of national significance, not just local significance,\u201d he said, \u201cand it simply cannot move forward without a federal commitment.\u201dMr. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that will be unveiled later this year \u2014 an initiative he promoted on Tuesday during meetings with business leaders and the construction industry. It is unclear whether the Gateway project might be included or whether the president plans to prioritize investments in public transit.The derailment on Monday happened about 9 a.m. as a New Jersey Transit train pulled into Track 9 at Penn Station. A derailment on March 24 took place when an Amtrak train left Track 6.Scot Naparstek, Amtrak\u2019s chief operating officer, said three cars in the middle of a New Jersey Transit train derailed on Monday, and workers had to place them back on the rails on Tuesday morning so they could remove the train. The accident damaged switch equipment on the tracks, leaving eight tracks unavailable for regular service.Mr. Naparstek said he could not give a time frame for when the tracks would be reopened.\u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience we caused anyone,\u201d he said. Amtrak owns Penn Station.Officials at New Jersey Transit said the delays, cancellations and crowds were likely to continue through Thursday\u2019s commute.The Federal Railroad Administration is investigating both accidents and has not identified the causes, said Marc Willis, a spokesman for the agency. Federal officials were talking to Amtrak and New Jersey Transit about how to ensure safety and reduce the likelihood of future disruptions, he said.What began as a minor train malfunction has stymied hundreds of thousands of commuters on four major transit systems in the Northeast.\u201cF.R.A. is concerned that two derailments in the last two weeks at New York\u2019s Penn Station have caused minor passenger injuries and severe service disruptions on the Northeast Corridor,\u201d Mr. Willis said in a statement.Matthew Kraft, 30, a financial analyst who works in Manhattan, said he went to Hoboken Terminal on Tuesday morning to avoid Penn Station and found it overrun with commuters.\u201cI had never seen that before, where the crowd is literally pouring out of the station,\u201d he said.Mr. Kraft said Tuesday\u2019s two-hour commute was probably one of roughly a dozen times in the last year where he has had a delay of more than an hour.\u201cEvery single time it happens, the wound doesn\u2019t heal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a building of frustration, like, \u2018Please someone, anyone, please do something to make this work.\u2019\u201dOn Tuesday, Lara K. Mahal, a chemistry professor at New York University, said that her morning commute from South Orange, N.J., took two hours and that she was almost late for class. She was delayed again heading home in the afternoon.\u201cIs every train in and out of this city broken today?\u201d Ms. Mahal said as she rode a diverted PATH train in Manhattan in an effort to reach Hoboken.Most of all, Ms. Mahal said she had concerns about safety, noting the recent accidents at Hoboken Terminal and Penn Station.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t exactly give you a safe feeling getting on the train,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a commuter affected by the delays.

{"Headline": "Derek Jeter and Jeb Bush Are Said to Move Closer to Purchase of Marlins", "Date": "2017-04-25", "News": "Supported byDerek Jeter has always said that his long-term ambition was to own a major league team. Now, less than three years into his retirement, he appears to be closing in on his chance.While the group still must demonstrate it has the necessary financing and must win approval from the owners, Major League Baseball is enthusiastic about the prospect of adding Jeter, the popular and polished former Yankees captain, to its ownership ranks.Bloomberg first reported that the Jeter-Bush group was within reach of buying the team. The Miami Herald reported that the sale price would be $1.3 billion. There are said to be multiple members of the ownership group, but Bush, who failed in his bid to win the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, would apparently be the control person.If that turns out to the be case, he will follow a path forged by his brother George W. Bush, who was managing general partner of the Texas Rangers from 1989 to 1994 before embarking on a political career that eventually led to the White House.Jeter\u2019s precise role with the Marlins is not yet known, but he seems likely to want to be more than a figurehead. Jeter, who lives in Tampa, Fla., has been relatively active, both professionally and personally, since retiring after the 2014 season. He started a website for athletes and a publishing imprint, and he married the supermodel Hannah Davis. The couple are expecting their first child, a daughter, this year.Jeter earned more than $265 million in salary over his 20-year career, spent entirely with the Yankees, with whom he won five World Series and lost two, including one to the Marlins in 2003. He is a revered Yankee, and it might be jarring to see him working with another club.\u201cI\u2019m sure it would be,\u201d said Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, a former teammate. \u201cBut baseball organizations don\u2019t come up for sale on an annual basis. It\u2019s one of those things, if it\u2019s something that he wants to be involved in, you can\u2019t sit around and wait for the Yankees to come up for sale.\u201dAnother former teammate, C. C. Sabathia, said he would never want to own a team because he would not want the blame when things went awry. But he said Jeter had long been eager for that kind of challenge \u2014 and if the sale goes through, Jeter would technically be a boss of another former Yankees captain, Don Mattingly, now the Marlins\u2019 manager.\u201cHe\u2019s always talked about it,\u201d Mattingly told The Sun-Sentinel this month, referring to Jeter\u2019s ownership aspirations. \u201cI asked him if he wanted to coach and he\u2019s like, \u2018Never.\u2019 I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be good. Jeets pretty much seems to be good at everything he tries to do.\u201dWhile some former superstars in other sports have been involved in team ownerships \u2014 examples include Mario Lemieux, Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jordan \u2014 there is little precedent in baseball. The Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 ownership includes Magic Johnson, the former N.B.A. star and current president for basketball operations for the Los Angeles Lakers.When the Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan was president of the Texas Rangers, he joined the ownership group that bought the team at a bankruptcy auction in 2010. Ryan was chief executive of the Rangers when they twice reached the World Series, and he retired from the team in 2013.The Athletics franchise has also had former players among its ownership. Connie Mack, who played for 11 seasons in the late 1800s, later became the longtime manager and owner of the Philadelphia A\u2019s. The former outfielder Billy Beane, who has gained fame as the head of the Oakland A\u2019s baseball operations department, is a minority owner of the team.The Marlins have been owned since 2002 by Jeffrey Loria, a New York art dealer with a fondness for former Yankees. Loria succeeded in getting a new ballpark built for the franchise in 2012, but the Marlins have been plagued by low attendance and distrust of the ownership by the team\u2019s fans.While sometimes giving out lavish contracts \u2014 including a record 13-year, $325 million deal to the slugger Giancarlo Stanton \u2014 Loria has also, at various times, reversed course and slashed payroll with little warning. The Marlins have not reached the postseason since their 2003 championship, and their current playoff drought is the longest in the National League.Even so, Loria stands to turn an enormous profit if the sale to the Jeter-Bush group goes through. He bought the Marlins for $158 million after Major League Baseball had purchased his previous team, the Montreal Expos, for $120 million and lent him the rest to complete the deal for the Marlins.Forbes recently valued the Marlins at $940 million, but the reported $1.3 billion price for this deal would be the second-highest ever paid for a baseball franchise, behind only the sale of the Dodgers for $2 billion in 2012.According to a sports lawyer familiar with the Marlins\u2019 situation, two of the attractive elements in purchasing the team would be the financial potential in arranging a new broadcast deal and a stadium naming-rights agreement. Jeter and Bush\u2019s status as in-state owners should enhance the team\u2019s brand, the lawyer said.Ken Belson and Billy Witz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cincinnati Sues Seller of Foreclosed Homes, Claiming Predatory Behavior", "Date": "2017-04-20", "News": "Supported byIn recent years, private investment firms sold foreclosed homes on high-interest installment contracts to poor Cincinnati residents who could not get traditional bank mortgages.Now, the city is cracking down, calling those who offer such deals \u201cpredatory\u201d actors targeting the \u201cunsuspecting and vulnerable.\u201dIn a sweeping lawsuit, Cincinnati took aim at one of the nation\u2019s largest sellers of foreclosed homes, Harbour Portfolio Advisors, saying that the firm owes more than $360,000 in unpaid fines, fees and violation notices. The firm failed to properly maintain dozens of homes, the city claims, leading in one case to a child\u2019s testing positive for lead poisoning.The lawsuit against Harbour, which is based in Dallas, is the first of several that Cincinnati plans to file against out-of-state firms that acquired rundown homes in the wake of the housing crisis and then resold them at inflated prices without making repairs.\u201cWe are planning more litigation,\u201d said Jessica Powell, chief counsel in the Cincinnati Law Department. Her department has set its sights on firms with \u201ceven more egregious business practices,\u201d she added, without naming specific companies.In the wake of the 2008 housing crisis, opportunistic investors swooped in with hopes of profiting on tens of thousands of blighted homes across the country.Investment firms like Harbour scooped up the run-down, foreclosed homes at bargain prices, selling them to families who could not get conventional mortgages but were desperate to own homes.Harbour sold its homes through an arrangement similar to an installment payment plan, with a high-interest, long-term loan called a contract for deed, or land contract. But what begins as a dream of homeownership for many residents can end quickly when a payment is missed and the buyer is swiftly evicted.Cincinnati is seeking to prevent Harbour from selling additional homes to investors until the firm remedies all the outstanding building code violations at the properties it is selling.Harbour, city lawyers said, has been selling \u201csubstandard\u201d homes to buyers in Cincinnati who often default on the contracts because they cannot pay for the repairs or keep up with the monthly payments.Since the publication of the Times articles and other news reports, federal and state investigators have begun to scrutinize Harbour and other big players in the business. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau began investigating Harbour last spring, and in February, a federal judge ordered Harbour to comply with a bureau subpoena seeking documents. And seven United States senators wrote to the consumer bureau last year to express their concern over firms like Harbour.Cincinnati\u2019s focus on contract for deeds follows articles in The New York Times that revealed how this new market has become a money trap for many poor families.The lawsuit claims Harbour \u201cintentionally fails to disclose known defects about the properties, including building code order and other violations.\u201d Even after being warned by Cincinnati and charged with violations, Harbour went forward with sales of the properties that had incurred violations. The city documents a long list of fruitless attempts it made to get Harbour, which is led by Charles A. Vose III, to make repairs to homes and pay fines.According to the lawsuit, Harbour\u2019s contracts are \u201cpredatory and unconscionable\u201d in part because the firm sells homes for up to five times the price it paid for them and holds the title to the residence until the final payment is made \u2014 which rarely happens.When the contracts for deed fall through, Harbour \u201cchurns the property through the process anew,\u201d often to a new prospective homeowner.A child who had lived in a house at 3814 St. Lawrence Avenue, which Harbour had bought from Fannie Mae for $7,600, tested positive for lead poisoning soon after the firm sold the home on a contract for deed for $40,700.In its investigation, The Times found that Harbour had bought around 7,000 single-family homes in bulk sales from Fannie, the large government-controlled mortgage finance firm. Harbour often paid $10,000 or less for these homes. Buyers said they were surprised to find homes that lacked working plumbing, furnaces and electrical systems.Harbour was not alone in buying cheap homes in need of major repairs and selling them through contracts for deed. Another national player, Vision Property Management, which is based in Columbia, S.C., and also operates in Cincinnati, has sold homes in rent-to-own deals that require tenants to make property repairs.Contracts for deed have a checkered history. In the 1950s and 1960s, high-interest seller-financed deals were blamed for further impoverishing black residents living in some Chicago neighborhoods.Not all contract sales are contentious, and some nonprofit organizations have recently tried using the arrangement as a vehicle to help get homeless families into homes.By the late 1990s, seller-financed home deals had largely disappeared. But such arrangements have had a revival in the wake of the financial crisis of a decade ago.Keeping tabs on the number of homes sold through contracts for deed or rent-to-own deals is difficult because the transactions are not always recorded.Paula Boggs Muething, the Cincinnati city solicitor, whose office is overseeing the Harbour lawsuit, said other Ohio city attorneys had also expressed concern. She said she hoped the litigation would prompt legislators to pass new laws.For investment firms, the business model can be profitable. Dan Immergluck, a professor of city and regional planning at the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s College of Design, estimated in an unpublished research paper that a firm like Harbour could generate an annual return of at least 28 percent based on the way it prices homes.Harbour, which raised more than $60 million to buy homes, last year began to sell off, to other investment firms, hundreds of houses with contracts for deed in place. Mr. Vose, whose grandfather was a banking executive in Oklahoma, appears to be moving into other areas of finance.Investment trusts controlled by Mr. Vose and Harbour\u2019s chief financial officer recently emerged in a bankruptcy filing as potential buyers of some of the stock in a bank holding company called Allcorp, which has a controlling interest in a small Arkansas community bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jefferson vs. the Filibuster", "Date": "2017-04-06", "News": "Supported byPassing a regular law wasn\u2019t one of the exceptions. Nor was confirming a Supreme Court justice. Over time, however, the Senate changed its rules to give the minority party the power to block action so long as it had 34 votes. (The Senate changed the threshold to the current 41 votes in 1974.)So when you hear people \u2014 on both the left and right \u2014 decry the likely weakening of the filibuster this week, keep in mind that it has not been a permanent part of American democracy. For much of our history, majority rule was the norm, and supermajority rule was a rare exception.For now, the filibuster seems likely to remain in place for most issues, the newest exception apparently being confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee. And if it did disappear immediately, Republicans would benefit greatly, since they control the White House, the House and 52 Senate seats. Without the filibuster, President Trump could sign a lot of far-reaching legislation on the climate, the budget, Wall Street regulation and many other subjects.Over the long term, though, the filibuster has been a better friend to Republicans than Democrats, as Waldman notes. Republicans have used it much more, and the filibuster has often frustrated progressive goals, including immigration reform, gun control, the minimum wage, civil rights, campaign finance rules and the \u201cpublic option\u201d for health insurance.Democrats would be crazy to get rid of the filibuster anytime soon, especially after Republicans used it so effectively against the Obama administration. For their part, Republicans \u2014 who have the power to get rid of it whenever they want \u2014 will no doubt be tempted to do so again in the coming months. But Republicans also have deep reasons to keep the filibuster intact, as Waldman explains.A programming note: I\u2019ll be away next week, and a rotating cast of Opinion editors will be writing the newsletter.

If any state knows the value of publicly financed art, it may be South Dakota: One of its biggest tourist attractions, Mount Rushmore, is, among other things, a colossal federally funded sculpture.All told, Ms. Young said, the Matthews Opera House received around $30,000 through state arts grants last year. The money made up a sizable chunk of the roughly $350,000 annual budget for the theater, which is about 50 miles northwest of Rapid City.\u201cI\u2019ve got to be honest with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I can find $30,000\u201d without the endowment.A few days in western South Dakota showed how a fragile arts scene has thrived recently with the aid of state and federal arts and humanities grants.

The orchestra\u2019s concert of Grieg\u2019s \u201cSymphonic Dances\u201d and Rachmaninoff\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 2 was to be aired by South Dakota Public Broadcasting, an important way to reach audiences in a state with a spread-out population.It is the kind of local event \u2014 along with rodeos, high school sports and work by area artists \u2014 that might not be broadcast if the system loses federal support, which makes up more than a fifth of its budget.\u201cThe thing about it is, they call it an elitist thing,\u201d Mr. Knowles said of the orchestra, which is more than 80 years old. \u201cAnd you know, around here, it\u2019s not. If it were to go away, you\u2019d have to drive almost six hours to Sioux Falls, seven or eight hours to Denver, 12 to Minneapolis.

Now, at a moment of political upheaval around the globe, that isolation has become a selling point.For all sorts of reasons, New Zealand suddenly makes sense. The cost of living is less than in San Francisco. Commuting is less wearying. And American politics, \u201cBrexit\u201d and the Islamic State are on the other side of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things where the stars are aligned,\u201d said David Jones, general manager at the Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency.New arrivals describe New Zealand as more idealistic and less frustrating than other places.\u201cIn the U.S., I feel extremely disconnected,\u201d said Alanna Irving, 33, who came here from San Francisco to start two companies. \u201cThings happen all the time that I don\u2019t agree with or understand or think are really good for most people, and I just don\u2019t see any way that I can change that.\u201dThis is the second time New Zealand has tried to use Silicon Valley to jump-start its fledgling tech economy. The current effort is in some ways an outgrowth of the first, featuring the same players.The first time, there were big promises that were never fulfilled. It was a typical Silicon Valley story, in other words, which makes it a bit of a cautionary tale even as everyone assumes that this time will be different.The story began more than a decade ago when a billionaire entrepreneur came here to visit and, like so many others, fell in love with the majestic mountains and sweeping vistas. New Zealand is where Peter Jackson filmed \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d a beloved text for many techies. It is the real Middle-earth, a fantasy come to life.Fantasies are rarely free. People applying for citizenship here are required to have spent 70 percent of the previous five years living in the country, and to commit to living in it afterward. Even humanitarian exceptions are rare.Peter Thiel, the contrarian investor who made his fortune with PayPal and Facebook, made an irresistible financial proposal to New Zealand in early 2011. He would bring the local economy \u2014 whose biggest exports were concentrated milk and the meat from sheep and goats \u2014 into the high-tech era. Mr. Thiel would serve as the country\u2019s roving tech ambassador, opening doors around the world that are closed to mere government officials.Even before applying, he set up Valar Ventures, an investment fund named after the gods in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d Valar put about $3 million into Xero, an online accounting software firm, and was part of a $4 million infusion of cash into Pacific Fibre, which proposed a trans-Pacific undersea cable.And that, Mr. Thiel signaled, would be just the beginning.\u201cI intend to devote a significant amount of my time and resources to the people and businesses of New Zealand,\u201d he wrote in his citizenship application. He donated about $750,000 to earthquake relief after the city of Christchurch was struck in February 2011.\u201cWe were so blown away that Peter Thiel was interested,\u201d said Rod Drury, the chief executive of Xero. \u201cHim getting a passport wasn\u2019t a big deal at the time. No one really thought about it.\u201dWhen the secret was revealed, it created a small uproar.\u201cSomeone being able to invest and get citizenship goes against that important New Zealand value of equality,\u201d Mr. Drury explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why it has played so much in the media here.\u201dMr. Drury is the biggest name in New Zealand\u2019s tech scene, a local version of Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg. He recommended Mr. Thiel for citizenship, and Xero was held up as a model of what, with the investor\u2019s help, all the new start-ups could become.The New Zealand government was so enthusiastic about Mr. Thiel\u2019s investing prowess that it became a partner with him in early 2012, putting about $7 million into a Valar fund. The fund did well, primarily because of its big position in Xero.Valar is now based in New York, where it has been investing in European and Brazilian companies. Mr. Thiel declined to comment.\u201cIt\u2019s sad for New Zealand that Thiel and Valar didn\u2019t follow on with more investments,\u201d Lance Wiggs, a local investor, said. \u201cWe are starved for cash.\u201dXero, which has 1,400 employees and customers in 180 countries, took a different path. Its goal is to turn accountants into \u201cgrowth consultants,\u201d becoming a platform that soars above national borders.\u201cGay marriage, cultural tolerance, refugees, active strategies to address diversity \u2014 more than ever our leadership here is important,\u201d Mr. Drury wrote in an email to his staff immediately after the election. He proposed setting a moral example by bringing \u201csome refugee groups into our Wellington office.\u201dA postelection arrival at Xero from the United States is Nick Piesco, 40, who was writing code for a start-up in Austin, Tex. \u201cI\u2019d say the timing is coincidental but fortuitous,\u201d the programmer said of his move 7,437 miles west. Already he and his wife, Reneau Skinner, 39, are talking about becoming citizens.\u201cOne of the things that attracted me to Xero was the culture \u2014 how they make people feel welcome,\u201d Mr. Piesco said.That means those barred from the United States under the new administration\u2019s policies, or who think they might be, are ripe for recruitment, Mr. Drury said.\u201cEspecially in the U.S. technology industry, where something like 50 percent of the billion-dollar companies have been built by immigrants, it\u2019s nuts that you make it difficult for engineers to come in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy for us not to exploit that.\u201dThe LookSee Wellington initiative to bring in 100 software engineers was initially focused on Americans. Then word began to spread. By the time the contest was finally cut off on March 30, India had overtaken the United States in applications.\u201cWe\u2019re in a global talent war,\u201d said Chris Whelan, chief executive of the Economic Development Agency in Wellington.Mr. Drury is already looking to make LookSee an annual affair.

The condition of the only two usable tennis courts here for Cuba\u2019s national team of six women and 12 men had fallen into disrepair after years of neglect.But four months ago, in the kind of bridge that looser restrictions on trade between the United States and Cuba aspires to, an American nonprofit group swooped in and rehabilitated the Cuban National Tennis Center, believed to be the only full-fledged courts on the island not part of a hotel or resort.Now there are 10 courts, and the optimism of Cuba\u2019s tennis players are likely to develop and expand as well.\u201cWe have new hope here,\u201d Yusleydis Smith D\u00edaz, 20, who is considered the top women\u2019s player in Cuba, said as she finished a practice this week. \u201cBut tennis here is very difficult.\u201dCuba all but shut down golf after the 1959 revolution brought to power Fidel Castro, who seized courses and denounced the game.Although tennis, another sport of elite clubs, did not endure that level of derision, money for it dried up in favor of the government\u2019s priorities: baseball, boxing, volleyball and other sports Cuba went on to excel at on the international stage.\u201cTennis lacked the recreational history of sports like baseball,\u201d said Robert Huish, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who researches Cuban sports and social programs. \u201cThere were baseball teams of machine shop, loading dock and sugar plantation workers spread across the country.\u201cTennis\u2019s elite affiliation,\u201d he added, \u201cwould have challenged a lot of the values of the Cuban revolution. The regime wanted to get rid of any hint of colonial history, and I could see tennis being a victim of that.\u201dPresident Ra\u00fal Castro, however, who assumed full power in 2008, has been seen as less doctrinaire. And with the restoration of diplomatic relations with the United States in 2015 and President Barack Obama visiting the island in 2016, both countries have explored opportunities to reconnect across a variety of endeavors, including sports.While other efforts, including allowing Cuban baseball players to enter the Major League Baseball draft directly, remain mired in on-again, off-again talks, the revival of tennis accelerated over the course of a year of negotiations.\u201cIt was a start-and-stop process of threading the needle until the bill of lading was signed,\u201d said Jake Agna, director of Kids on the Ball, the American nonprofit group that refurbished the courts.The organization emphasized the humanitarian aspect of overhauling the courts and propping up the sport, although \u201cI do believe the less restrictive embargo opened the way for us,\u201d Agna said, adding, \u201cThere was never a conversation about politics or politicians.\u201dKids on the Ball agreed to do the work on the courts and provide tennis gear, a whole shipping container\u2019s worth, at an estimated cost of $750,000.\u201cThe courts are a dream made reality,\u201d said Alexander Ferrales Gonzalez, president of the Cuban tennis federation, a division of the ministry of sports. \u201cWe can make a stage for tennis.\u201dFerrales said he saw the courts as a springboard for the small elite training program and a catalyst to increasing tennis participation across Cuba. The federation estimates there are 2,000 players across Cuba with competitive aspirations.Still, the ministry, known as Inder, controls decisions on resources, funding and athletic travel.\u201cIt\u2019s complex, but things are always complicated,\u201d Ferrales said.\u201cOur top athletes have the skill and potential to eventually compete on the world tours,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we must increase the quantity of tournaments they can participate in.\u201dOne of his plans is to pursue sponsorship for his national team program. Puma and Adidas have long sponsored other Cuban sports like boxing, baseball and track and field. Tennis has never been sponsored.\u201cAlso, exchanging players is very important to me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe exchange already with the Dominican Republic, Panama and El Salvador. But I want to exchange with the U.S.\u201dSuch aspirations, though, may rise and fall on the nations developing closer ties. The Trump administration has vowed to take a harder line on Cuba, but so far has left in place much of the Obama administration\u2019s revised regulations.\u201cI know our players will get into the top 100 in the world,\u201d Ferrales said. \u201cAnd in that moment, the athlete will recognize the help of everyone that made it possible. And all we\u2019ll need is one to succeed; others will follow.\u201dStill, it has been challenging for players to get a foothold in international tournaments.Yoryana Delgado Herrera, the No. 2 women\u2019s player, voiced frustration.\u201cWe don\u2019t get to play more than two tournaments a year, so we can\u2019t get points to play other tournaments,\u201d she said.The next competition for her and Smith will be the Federations Cup in Panama in June.She gestured toward her rackets; one of her strings was broken.\u201cSometimes there\u2019s a lot of string, sometimes there\u2019s none and we have to wait,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no tennis in Cuba outside of here.\u201dCuba has had a few successful players on the world stage. The most notable was Mario Tabares, who played in the early 1990s and reached a career-high ranking of No. 131.\u201cTabares and my brother Reynaldo Garrido are the best two players Cuba\u2019s ever had,\u201d Orlando Garrido said as he perused the walls of his Havana home, which is an expansive homage to Cuban tennis.\u201cWe went to 58 countries as tennis players,\u201d said Orlando Garrido, who played alongside his brother but stopped before him to start a career as an ornithologist.Since the Garridos, more than 150 Cuban players have competed in bottom-tier Futures tournaments across Latin America. But financing remained elusive, and many players defected or pursued jobs as teaching professionals.\u201cOur history is so rich, but tennis never really flourished among our people,\u201d Orlando Garrido said.Ferrales and the players said they believed that would change.Standing on the new courts, flanked by the skeletal and decaying facilities where Cuba\u2019s Olympic hopefuls train, Smith sounded optimistic.\u201cThere are many Cuban tennis players before us, and we can grow that legacy,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
