{"Headline": "The Giant, Under Attack", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "One of America\u2019s biggest rehab companies built an empire. But after a patient named Gary Benefield died, its enemies \u2014 investors and business rivals alike \u2014 struck hard.On the last day of his life, Gary Benefield expressed hope for the future. He was finally about to \u201cget right,\u201d he said.A Harley-riding tough guy and retired utility worker, Mr. Benefield had let addiction get the better of him. He was downing a dozen Budweisers a day and smoking nonstop, despite needing an oxygen tank to breathe. But that July day in 2010, he was headed to A Better Tomorrow, a California treatment center promising 24-hour care while he got sober.Mr. Benefield was about to join the millions of Americans who have placed their fate in the hands of the nation\u2019s sprawling, haphazardly regulated addiction-treatment industry. It is a wildly profitable business, thanks in large part to addicts like Gary.He kissed his wife, Kelly, goodbye at the tiny airport in Show Low, Ariz., a town named for the lucky turn of a playing card more than a century earlier. \u201cHe told me he loved me,\u201d she said later. That evening, he checked in at the treatment center.Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018The next morning, as dawn broke over A Better Tomorrow\u2019s postage-stamp lawn and stucco walls, two new voice mail messages awaited an employee there.One came from Kelly Benefield, asking: Could someone help her bring Gary a cake that day? It was his 53rd birthday.The other came from a manager: Gary Benefield was dead.America is convulsed by an addiction crisis \u2014 painkillers, heroin, alcoholism, meth \u2014 and its victims die with tragic regularity. But Mr. Benefield\u2019s case is extraordinary.His death in July 2010 kicked off a six-year battle that very nearly brought down one of the biggest addiction-treatment companies in the country, an epic clash between an addiction-treatment multimillionaire and a college kid and budding financial wizard.On one side was Michael Cartwright, a former addict pursuing his dream of building a nationwide empire of trustworthy drug-treatment clinics \u2014 a kind of Mayo Clinic for addiction. His Nashville, Tenn., company owned the clinic where Mr. Benefield had died.On the other was Chris Drose, who, uninspired by his class work at Furman University, became fascinated with short selling \u2014 a risky investment strategy of trying to make money by betting that a company\u2019s stock will fall.In Mr. Cartwright\u2019s company, the college junior saw a very big \u201cshort.\u201d And he attacked.Addiction treatment is one of the most lucrative health care industries to emerge in a generation, a massive business fed by a national addiction crisis that, by most measures, is out of control. Drug overdoses kill more Americans than car accidents, but only a fraction of the country\u2019s 23 million addicts go into rehab, creating an untapped market \u2014 and an enormous business opportunity.Yet the industry focused on curing addiction has its shortcomings. One of the most significant: There is little consensus on the most effective ways to treat patients.Should patients travel far from home, as Mr. Benefield did, to isolate them from temptation? Or should they stay close to their support networks of family and friends? Should they be treated with medications that reduce the appetite for opioids? Or should they be coached to conquer their illness through willpower?The field is also covered by a patchwork of regulations that haven\u2019t kept pace with its growth. That has created room for opportunistic small operators to spring up, some with questionable track records.The industry started taking off when President George W. Bush in 2008 signed a law requiring insurers to pay for rehab. The 2010 Affordable Care Act expanded coverage further. Suddenly just about anyone with insurance could get help.Today, private insurance covers treatment for millions of working and middle-class Americans. Annual spending by private insurers on opiate addiction alone rose more than 1,000 percent in the five-year period ending in 2015, to roughly $721 million, according to Fair Health, an independent nonprofit that keeps a database of private insurance claims.Mr. Cartwright\u2019s company, American Addiction Centers, operates treatment centers in eight states around the country. That was how Mr. Benefield ended up in a treatment facility in California: Eager to get sober, he and his wife searched online from their home in Arizona for a clinic, found A Better Tomorrow \u2014 which eventually became part of Mr. Cartwright\u2019s business \u2014 and then called up to book a spot.This account of Mr. Benefield\u2019s final days, and the battle over American Addiction Centers, draws on interviews with executives, front-line employees, addicts, police and investors, as well as thousands of court documents.On October 3, 2014 \u2014 four years after Mr. Benefield\u2019s death \u2014 Michael Cartwright and his business partner, Jerrod Menz, rang the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange to announce the first of day trading in their company\u2019s shares. Mr. Cartwright, standing next to his teenage daughter, clapped. Mr. Menz gave the thumbs up.At the close of trading that day, shares in American Addiction Centers held by the two men \u2014 the two largest shareholders \u2014 were worth a combined $202 million.It was a crowning achievement for both men, but particularly for Mr. Cartwright, who had started his career running a rehab center for mentally ill addicts in inner city Nashville.In 2012, Mr. Cartwright started buying up smaller providers, including one that had been started by Mr. Menz, his longtime friend, in Southern California, and assembling them into a national chain.Mr. Cartwright himself had abused drugs as a younger man, \u201canything I could get my hands on,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Cartwright also spent time in a psychiatric hospital after a breakdown, an experience that helped to shape his belief that anyone can overcome addiction as long as they have the right mind-set.He credited his grandmother\u2019s tough love with helping him turn his life around. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t about to let me wallow in my own poop,\u201d he wrote in his book, \u201cBelievable Hope.\u201dAddiction should be overcome by willpower and hard work in therapy, Mr. Cartwright said. Other treatment providers put more emphasis on medicines to help addicts \u2014 particularly opiate addicts \u2014 function in the long term.The treatment world is split by methodology and motivation \u2014 inpatient and outpatient, religious and secular, nonprofit and moneymaking. Such a Balkanized industry seemed ripe for consolidation by a businessman like Mr. Cartwright.With aggressive internet marketing and a central call center, Mr. Cartwright pulled in patients from around the country. Patients stay for weeks at a time in a treatment house, undergoing therapy paid for by private insurance.\u201cIf you can create a great brand, which I think Michael can,\u201d said Lucius Burch III, an early investor in American Addiction Centers and a former chairman of a Nashville company that runs private prisons, \u201cyou have an opportunity to build a huge company.\u201dBut there were people who believed they saw big vulnerabilities in that emerging brand, including a college student in South Carolina.With bushy eyebrows and a boyish face, Mr. Drose comes from a family of skeptics and crusaders. His grandfather helped plot the assassination of Rafael Trujillo, a dictator in his native Dominican Republic, in the 1960s.He remembered the day, in late 2014, that he discovered the investment idea that would launch his career. He was 19, sitting on a purple armchair in his dorm room at Furman, where he liked to spend his spare time scanning financial filings in search of stocks to \u201cshort,\u201d or bet against.\u201cIt\u2019s like a big Easter egg hunt,\u201d Mr. Drose said recently. \u201cExcept, for something bad.\u201dThat day, one company stood out to him \u2014 American Addiction Centers. In just a few months in existence as a publicly traded stock, its shares had risen a blistering 60 percent.Any time a stock rises that quickly, short sellers like Mr. Drose sense an opportunity. But there was something else that piqued his interest.A business that profited from people\u2019s desperation seemed like \u201can industry that might have something weird going on,\u201d Mr. Drose said.But weird wouldn\u2019t begin to describe the world he was about to enter.Culling through American Addiction Centers\u2019 public filings, he noticed that a health insurer had sued one of the company\u2019s subsidiaries, claiming that it had conducted unnecessary drug tests on patients\u2019 urine. Posing as a prospective patient, Mr. Drose called the company and asked how often it conducted drug tests, and came to believe that American Addiction Centers was testing much more frequently than other providers.He wrote an article about his findings on a website called Seeking Alpha, which short sellers frequent for investment tips. The company\u2019s stock promptly dropped 10 percent.That was a big win for anyone short-selling the stock. Short sellers borrow shares in a company, then sell them hoping that the price falls. Their goal is to buy back the shares later, at a cheaper price, and return them to the lender. The price decline is their profit.In Nashville, Mr. Cartwright watched his stock fall, and was stunned. \u201cWe found no substantiation for any one of his claims,\u201d he said in an interview, referring to Mr. Drose\u2019s article.Battle lines were being drawn and Mr. Drose\u2019s work was attracting attention elsewhere. Kingsford Capital, a hedge fund based outside of San Francisco, hired him as a consultant and told him to keep digging into the treatment business.And another interested party had noticed Mr. Drose\u2019s work, too: a man named Charles Hill, who ran a treatment center in Temecula, Calif., the town where Mr. Benefield had died.Mr. Hill told Mr. Drose that he knew a great deal about American Addiction Centers. He congratulated him on his article about the urine testing, and suggested he start searching for lawsuits brought by families of patients who had died in California. \u201cYou\u2019ve been looking in the wrong place,\u201d he told Mr. Drose.Following Mr. Hill\u2019s advice, Mr. Drose flew to California in the spring of 2015. He may have been working for a major hedge fund, but he was so young \u2014 still only 20 \u2014 that he had to pay extra to rent a car.The two men met at Mr. Hill\u2019s rehab center in Temecula, a maze of cul-de-sacs and shopping plazas book-ended by the velvet green Santa Rosa mountains and the snowcapped peaks of the San Bernardino range.Mr. Hill thought the college kid was an investigative reporter. So he was thrilled to have someone to listen to his concerns about the treatment business.\u201cI didn\u2019t even know what short selling was,\u201d Mr. Hill recalled.Standing five feet seven inches in scuffed leather boots and faded jeans, Mr. Hill is a former painkiller addict and a natural storyteller. The story that perhaps best defines his life involved a football injury back in the 1990s. It shaped his personal philosophy of drug treatment, one that puts its trust in modern medications \u2014 and is at odds with people like Mr. Cartwright, who want patients to ultimately lead a truly drug-free life.Mr. Hill was injured at the age of 42, too old to be playing tackle football. But eager to relive his high school glory days, Mr. Hill \u2014 his nickname is Rocky \u2014 had joined some friends to start a full-contact football league, The Over the Hill Pigskin Shootout. They used old pads donated by the Los Angeles Rams.One fateful tackle, though, ended the fun. He tore the rotator cuff in each of his shoulders. His doctor prescribed a powerful painkiller, Norco.And Mr. Hill \u2014 who was already in the addiction treatment business \u2014 became an opiate addict himself.When he tried to stop taking the Norco, his life unraveled. He couldn\u2019t sleep. He subsisted on Ensure, the nutrition drink, because eating made him vomit. He considered suicide.A doctor specializing in pain management told Mr. Hill that the opiates had permanently altered his brain. Therapy and group meetings couldn\u2019t fix that.The doctor prescribed Mr. Hill a different drug, buprenorphine, which satisfies the craving for opiates but does not result in a high. Minutes after the first dose dissolved under Mr. Hill\u2019s tongue, the world righted itself.\u201cBefore, it felt like someone had put a vacuum in me and sucked out all the joy,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cAnd then, it was like someone had suddenly reversed it.\u201dMr. Hill\u2019s successful treatment with buprenorphine was for him a revelation. Today, he sends the opiate addicts he treats to a local doctor for a prescription for the same drug he still takes every morning.For many addicts, that prescription is all they need to get on with their lives, Mr. Hill said. Mr. Cartwright, by contrast, believes that ultimately \u201cabstinence has to be the goal,\u201d he said in an interview.That is only the start of their differences.Mr. Cartwright\u2019s company specializes in enrolling addicts in intensive inpatient programs, often far from their families \u2014 where they stay full-time in a sober living center with other recovering addicts.Mr. Hill prefers an outpatient approach that is close to the patient\u2019s support network. During the day, addicts come to Mr. Hill\u2019s two-story building, where they meet with therapists. At night, they go home.Mr. Hill believes the inpatient model is motivated more by greed than doing good. Inpatient providers can bill insurers up to $10,000 for 28 days of services; Mr. Hill charges $1,400 a month for his outpatient treatments.There is great debate about which treatment approaches work best, and even how to measure their efficacy.\u201cA lot of organizations say they have the cure, but they have no incentive to try to prove it through the data,\u201d said Robert Poznanovich, executive director of Business Development at Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, one of the best-known addiction-treatment providers in the United States.Hazelden offers a mix of outpatient and inpatient treatment. Modern addiction treatment grew directly from Hazelden and its secluded farm in Minnesota. In 1949, a group of businessmen and a Catholic priest pioneered the idea of bringing alcoholics to a rural location, where the men (they were all men back then) could focus on the 12-step principles without the distractions and temptations of everyday life.The approach became known as the Minnesota Model and was copied by other nonprofits for decades. Then, the new insurance laws in 2008 and 2010 transformed what had largely been a government-funded and charitable-minded field into an enticing for-profit business. In just a few years, that gave rise to a $35 billion industry of inpatient programs such as the one offered by American Addiction Centers.Mr. Hill\u2019s concerns about American Addiction Centers were not just about the debate between inpatient vs. outpatient philosophies of treatment. He told Mr. Drose about patients who had died in rehab homes around Temecula and nearby Murrieta that Mr. Cartwright later acquired.The deaths, Mr. Hill contended, showed how the company was unequipped to deal with medically fragile addicts. Yet, Mr. Hill claimed that for years the company kept taking those patients, assuring them that they would receive adequate care.As far back as 2008, Mr. Hill had told the California agency that oversees drug-treatment programs that he believed some patients at Mr. Menz\u2019s facilities (ones that later became part of American Addiction Centers) were in danger. When some of the dead patients\u2019 families later filed lawsuits against those companies, he followed every twist and turn of the cases.He had also spent a good part of 2011 and 2012 working with Hardy Gold, a prosecutor in the state attorney general\u2019s office who was interested in Mr. Benefield\u2019s death. The two began trading emails discussing aspects of the investigation \u2014 emails that would later cause headaches for the prosecutor. At one point, Mr. Gold visited Mr. Hill\u2019s office to get a tutorial on the addiction-treatment industry.During that time, American Addiction Centers sued Mr. Hill for defamation, saying he had made false statements about its patient care. A judge dismissed the suit.Mr. Hill kept up his attacks on American Addiction Centers. And in Mr. Drose, he believed that he had found a new way to take on the company.Mr. Drose spent hours talking to Mr. Hill that day in Temecula. When he returned home, his backpack was stuffed with lawsuits, depositions and autopsy reports. \u201cDamn,\u201d Mr. Drose said he thought at the time. \u201cI left there thinking I had stumbled across a gold mine.\u201dMr. Drose returned to Kingsford\u2019s offices in Atlanta, took over a glass-enclosed conference room, and made piles of documents related to each death.None of the deaths had been disclosed to investors when the stock of American Addiction Centers began trading publicly.The dead included Shaun Reyna, an alcoholic, who killed himself with a shaving razor in one of the company\u2019s treatment houses. Mr. Reyna\u2019s widow said in a 2014 lawsuit that the staff had ignored signs that her husband was suffering withdrawal symptoms that required urgent medical care. The case is expected to go to trial early in 2018.There was also Gregory Thomas, who hanged himself from a bridge one block from the company\u2019s main office in Temecula in November 2010. He had been brought to the office by a company employee, but never went through with the treatment.Mr. Thomas\u2019s body hung from a bridge for several days before anyone noticed. A judge ruled that the company wasn\u2019t liable because Mr. Thomas had not been admitted.But the circumstances of Mr. Benefield\u2019s death, as detailed in a lawsuit his wife brought in 2011, stood out.The treatment house that he ended up traveling to, A Better Tomorrow, was founded by Mr. Menz, Mr. Cartwright\u2019s partner in American Addiction Centers. It would become a core part of the publicly traded company.When Mr. Benefield called A Better Tomorrow in late July 2010, he was about to help the company solve a problem: a patient shortage.There were too many empty beds, Mr. Menz had told his staff members at a monthly meeting, and they needed to fill them. The employees \u2014 who referred to signing up new patients as \u201cclosing a sale\u201d \u2014 understood the risk of failure.\u201cIf you\u2019re not closing,\u201d Jody Brueske, the former sales representative who enrolled Mr. Benefield would later testify in a separate case involving his death, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be the next one walking out the door.\u201dFrom their kitchen in Springersville, Ariz., the Benefields did not know any of that. All they knew was that A Better Tomorrow had come up in an internet search. A former snowboarder, Mr. Benefield was so excited he even packed his gym clothes, thrilled at the prospect of getting healthy again, according to court records. Ms. Benefield declined to be interviewed; her statements primarily come from court documents.From his first phone call to his death, Mr. Benefield\u2019s relationship with A Better Tomorrow lasted a mere two days. Compressed into those 48 hours is a case study in how financial pressures and business motivations can collide with the needs and expectations of the fragile patients who represent the industry\u2019s bread and butter.Just days after the staff meeting led by Mr. Menz, Ms. Brueske took the call from Mr. Benefield and his wife, Kelly. His case was pretty typical \u2014 an out-of-control drinking problem that was hurting someone\u2019s marriage. But one thing set it apart: Mr. Benefield had chronic lung disease that forced him to use an oxygen tank.Ms. Brueske had never dealt with a patient who used oxygen. But she felt that she couldn\u2019t turn anyone away, because much of her pay came from commissions, she later testified.According to a court transcript, a lawyer grilled Ms. Brueske on that point, asking her: \u201cDid you feel personally pressured to get more clients in because of that sales meeting?\u201dMs. Brueske responded, \u201cYes.\u201dUltimately, Ms. Brueske assured the Benefields that A Better Tomorrow could provide the oxygen he needed.In an interview, Mr. Cartwright disputed the sales rep\u2019s testimony. He said that her perception of the pressures to fill beds \u201cdid not match reality.\u201d He said the company would never promise to provide oxygen to a patient, because it would require a prescription. \u201cIf she promised that, she was out there on an island,\u201d he said.But from the moment Mr. Benefield stepped off the plane in California, there were signs the company wasn\u2019t equipped to handle his care.A Better Tomorrow sent a driver to pick him up at the San Diego airport. When that driver, a recovering meth addict with no medical training, got to the airport, he found that Mr. Benefield was having trouble breathing. His oxygen tank was empty.The driver\u2019s supervisor instructed him to give Mr. Benefield a sedative called Serax, even though Mr. Benefield had not been prescribed that drug. According to a transcript of court testimony, the Serax pills were leftovers from previous patients that were simply kept in the car in case the driver needed to administer a sedative on the spot.Mr. Menz, in an interview, said it had never been company policy to dispense drugs without a prescription, nor did the company keep leftover medicine.The driver and other employees also testified that staff members were discouraged from taking patients to a hospital emergency room \u2014 even when they appeared to be in distress \u2014 because A Better Tomorrow might risk losing a paying customer. The feeling was, \u201cthey are taking our clients,\u201d the driver said of the hospital.The treatment house where Mr. Benefield was taken was not a medical facility but a five-bedroom home with a two-car garage and a hot tub in the back. And the employees there did not know what to make of Mr. Benefield\u2019s behavior \u2014 they were familiar with addiction symptoms, not respiratory ailments.The afternoon of Mr. Benefield\u2019s arrival, as he grew more distressed, the house\u2019s employees called their managers at home for guidance. One supervisor they phoned \u2014 a licensed massage therapist and marriage counselor, not a doctor \u2014 told them to administer more sedatives.Mr. Benefield\u2019s oxygen tank remained unfilled.That night, the employees found that Mr. Benefield had slid out of bed and was sitting on the floor. They hoisted him back into bed. When they went to check on him again in the morning, he was dead.As part of the testimony by Ms. Brueske, the sales rep who worked with the Benefields, she described her boss\u2019s advice after she learned of the death of her client. \u201cYou need to get thicker skin,\u201d she recalled her saying. \u201cPeople die in rehab all of the time.\u201dMr. Drose said that he wasn\u2019t sure what to think after he reviewed the testimony and other documents. \u201cI\u2019ve seen companies screw over shareholders,\u201d Mr. Drose said. \u201cThis company seemed like it was hurting people.\u201dBut despite piles of documents detailing tragic deaths, it wasn\u2019t clear to him that he had enough useful material to move the stock price down, which remained his ultimate goal. After all, addiction patients die with tragic regularity.Mr. Drose\u2019s boss at Kingsford Capital, the hedge fund where he was working, also wasn\u2019t sure what all the material added up to.\u201cThis seems like a lot of stuff,\u201d Mr. Drose said his boss had told him as he stood among his piles of documents in the summer of 2015. \u201cBut what is really in here?\u201dA spokesman for Kingsford said the \u201cfirm does not comment on its investments.\u201dBit by bit, Mr. Drose struggled to piece together the meaning of the deaths at American Addiction Centers.He determined \u2014 after filtering through the reams of legal filings and other documents he had collected \u2014 that the prosecutor, Mr. Gold, had taken an interest in Mr. Benefield\u2019s case. After speaking with a former police detective about what the possible charges against the company could be, he came up with a startling theory: The company could face a murder charge.It was a wild idea. No other public company in California history had been charged with murder.In California, second-degree murder involves someone acting with \u201cimplied\u201d malice that reflects an \u201cabandoned or malignant heart.\u201d While that might sound like a legal concept straight out of Edgar Allan Poe, the theory was that the employees who gave Mr. Benefield sedatives, instead of taking him to the hospital, may have acted with implied malice.Mr. Drose liked the sound of that. \u201cSecond-degree murder is what will destroy this company,\u201d Mr. Drose wrote in an email to Mr. Hill. \u201cI am sure of it.\u201dOn and off in the years since Mr. Benefield\u2019s death, a cast of characters \u2014 the empire builder Mr. Cartwright, the budding short-seller Mr. Drose, the crosstown rival Mr. Hill \u2014 had made A Better Tomorrow and American Addiction Centers a focus of their lives. Some hoped to build it up. Others dreamed of tearing it down.Mr. Cartwright and Mr. Drose, in particular, saw fortunes to be made.But in Mr. Benefield\u2019s death, would a company \u2014 and by extension, an industry \u2014 be held to account? Would future patients benefit from the lessons learned from his death?On July 21, 2015, a prosecutor charged a subsidiary of American Addiction Centers and four employees with second-degree murder in the Benefield case.The company\u2019s stock price fell 53 percent, erasing more than half its value in just one day.Mr. Cartwright, vacationing in Italy, didn\u2019t know what hit him. He called his board of directors to ask for help figuring out what to do.One board member, the Nashville investor Mr. Burch, recently recalled his advice to Mr. Cartwright. \u201cYou can\u2019t run away from it,\u201d Mr. Burch told him. \u201cThere is not much you can do if someone calls you a son of a bitch, other than deny it and prove you are not. You get all the bullets you can, and fire at the enemy as quickly as you can.\u201dThat\u2019s exactly what Mr. Cartwright did.First his company lawyers argued, among other things, that the official coroner\u2019s report said Mr. Benefield had died of natural causes, but the prosecutor had relied on paid testimony from a different coroner to make a case for homicide. The lawyers got the murder charge reduced to abuse.That was a big win. But Mr. Cartwright was just getting started.\u201cHow do you bring a murder charge on a five-year-old, natural-cause death?\u201d Mr. Cartwright said recently. \u201cIt makes no sense.\u201dLooking for answers, two private investigators were sent to interview Mr. Drose in Atlanta. Only then did Mr. Cartwright discover how all his enemies fit together.Mr. Drose said that he had guessed that a murder charge might be coming \u2014 well before the actual charge was made public.This gave Mr. Cartwright powerful new ammunition in his court battle: He didn\u2019t believe Mr. Drose had merely guessed. He suspected someone had leaked confidential grand jury information to an investor in a position to make a financial killing.\u201cI think the charge was brought to make money,\u201d Mr. Cartwright said in the interview earlier this year. \u201cCan I prove it? No.\u201dPresented with that argument, the judge said that Mr. Gold, the prosecutor, appeared to have a conflict because of his relationship with Mr. Hill, but that it was not enough to unfairly influence the case. But by then, it was June 2016, almost six years since Mr. Benefield\u2019s death. Two key witnesses had died and the case was running out of steam. Ultimately, American Addiction Centers agreed to pay a $200,000 fine and allow a monitor to oversee its operations in California.In a statement, a spokeswoman for the California attorney general\u2019s office emphasized that \u201cthe judge concluded that any connection between Mr. Gold and Mr. Hill did not create a likelihood of unfairness to the defendants in the case.\u201dThe unprecedented murder case against a company, which would have sent a message to American Addiction Centers \u2014 and, by extension a desperately needed but poorly understood industry \u2014 had fizzled out.Today, Mr. Cartwright is still angry that his company had to fight off what he considers an unfair attack. The stock price is hovering around a quarter of its peak value, diminishing his personal wealth.But American Addiction Centers is growing again. In September, it bought a treatment company with a 114-bed hospital in Massachusetts. As part of the deal, it also acquired several toll-free numbers to generate referrals, including 1-800-ALCOHOL.And he points out that while the care at American Addiction Centers has evolved since Mr. Benefield\u2019s death, the resulting court fight did not prompt him to alter his treatment practices. \u201cWhy would I change policies and procedure because of someone dying of a heart attack at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d he said.His persistent critic, Mr. Hill, worries about what he considers the industry\u2019s sorry state and the quality of addiction treatment. \u201cIt is going to take turning the field upside down,\u201d he said. But he has also moved on, buying a place in Mexico where he enjoys swimming with dolphins. One day he hopes to retire there.Christopher Drose\u2019s work earned him a spot on Forbes magazine\u2019s \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list of up-and-coming young investors. Today he works for a new hedge fund in New York doing what he loves: digging up dirt on companies, and betting against them.\u201cSome part of me likes to see people who are not telling the truth come face to face with it,\u201d Mr. Drose said. \u201cI\u2019ve found a way to express that with stocks.\u201dAmerican Addiction Centers has estimated that short sellers walked away with $250 million because of Mr. Benefield\u2019s death and the murder charge against the company. Mr. Drose called that number overstated but declined to say how much money he made.In 2015, Kingsford Capital sent out a holiday letter detailing its investment successes, which mentioned the murder charge involving American Addiction Centers. In the letter, the firm summed up its strategy that year as finding \u201cgifts from garbage.\u201d\u201cOne man\u2019s trash,\u201d Kingsford Capital wrote, \u201cis our treasure.\u201dToday in America, overdoses claim more lives than guns. Yet as the addiction crisis deepens, patients and their families are still struggling to sort out the most effective forms of treatment offered by the sprawling industry.Mr. Benefield, a bear of a man with a big drinking problem, had pursued his hope of getting well. His wife, Kelly, was left to settle a civil wrongful-death lawsuit against the company that they had hoped would help him.On Facebook, years after he died, Ms. Benefield wrote, \u201cI miss him so much.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of years since Gary Benefield\u2019s death. Mr. Benefield died seven years ago, not 11.Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cost of Devaluing Women", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionMy first job out of college in the late 1980s was at Salomon Brothers, a trading house of cigar-smoking, expletive-spewing strivers. One day, I leaned over a colleague\u2019s desk to work on a spreadsheet, and heard loud laughter from behind me; one of the guys was pretending to perform a sex act on me. Almost every day, I found a Xerox copy of male genitalia on my desk.In the 1990s, I changed firms and was now a midlevel professional. The harassment shifted: Instead I had to rebuff a client, a chief executive, who asked me to join him \u2014 \u201cJust you, no need to bring the rest of the team\u201d \u2014 in his hotel room at 11 p.m. to go over some numbers. One company rescinded a job offer upon learning I had a baby at home.I changed firms again and moved another rung up the corporate ladder, and it felt a little less fraught to deal with the inevitable. I was able to say no to the senior government official who said, \u201cHow about we go up to my hotel room?\u201d before obscenely wagging his tongue at me in front of my colleagues. I could knock the portfolio manager\u2019s hands off my leg without too much fear of retribution.These are stories I have not often revisited. Maybe I\u2019ve shared them over drinks with female friends or with younger women in the industry, to let them know what it used to be like. But in the dizzying past few weeks, as this crucial moment of reckoning on sexual harassment continues, it\u2019s clear that the harassment I was subjected to is not in the past. Worse, I know that being a white woman afforded me a privilege in dealing with these issues that unfortunately not everyone has.What we are only beginning to recognize is that demeaning and devaluing women is an insidious, expensive problem. It\u2019s not just the eye-popping settlements in some cases, like the $32 million paid by Bill O\u2019Reilly to settle a harassment claim. Nor is it just the high salaries network stars have been making while allegedly assaulting subordinates, like the $20 million, or more, for Matt Lauer. It only starts there.The bigger cost derives from how women\u2019s ideas are discounted and their talent ignored. I have seen it up close in the two worlds I know best: Wall Street, where I was chief executive of Smith Barney and of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, and in Silicon Valley, where I\u2019ve raised money to run my start-up, Ellevest. These places are perhaps the purest microcosms of capitalism, and their lessons are instructive for all of us.Both Wall Street and venture capital are industries whose product is money: Wall Street directs trillions of dollars to the sectors or businesses that it believes will deliver the highest returns. Likewise, Silicon Valley invests hundreds of billions of dollars in start-ups that it believes will deliver the best returns. Both pick economic winners and losers.Homogeneity has led Wall Street firms to travel in packs, going after the same opportunities at the same time: junk bonds in the 1980s, tech stocks in the late 1990s and subprime lending in the run-up to the crash 10 years ago. In particular, when the subprime bet proved wrong, the big banks went essentially bankrupt and were bailed out by the United States government because officials worried that the economic cost of their failure would have been catastrophic.Thus one can draw a line from the gender discrimination on Wall Street through to the lack of women \u2014 and lack of diversity of thought \u2014 in the industry to increased risk and to the financial crisis.One might argue that start-ups run by men just happen to deliver the highest possible returns. The mythology around the industry bolsters this, with venture capitalists boasting of investing in Facebook practically out of the dorm room.Venture capital and Wall Street are both funded by \u201cother people\u2019s money.\u201d Pension funds, endowments, mutual funds and individual investors provide the fuel that enables this sexist, exclusionary behavior. The irony is that so many of these endowments and foundations exist to make the world a fairer place, not to exclude vast segments of the population. Yet because their money is tied up in industries where women\u2019s perspectives, and diversity of viewpoints, aren\u2019t valued on the whole, their causes \u2014 and their bottom lines \u2014 lose out.This moment of ferreting out sexual harassers is a step forward. It also reveals how much work we have to do on the biases that allowed such behavior to flourish.This summer, I was in Silicon Valley, pitching for a round of funding for my company. I was the only woman in a room of 18 venture capitalists. A few of the men were engaged, a few were typing on their iPhones, and the lead investor was alternating between peppering me with questions and leaning back in his chair with his arms folded. He challenged my knowledge on digital acquisition, on acquisition costs.Fair enough, even if he was being a little prickly. Finally, I noted that our business was planning to hire a few financial advisers. He proceeded to give me chapter and verse on how financial advisers are hard to manage and instructed me on the economics of the financial advisory business.I was astonished, because I have managed more financial advisers in my career than probably anyone in the country. And though it\u2019s been years since I have been sexually harassed the way I was at Salomon, I realized in that moment how deep our gender views run, how men are still seen as leaders and women as more junior.This man naturally assumed that he knew more about it than I did. It was his ingrained view of women \u2014 a view that\u2019s costing all of us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steven Cohen Plans a New Hedge Fund. Investors Are Wary.", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySteven A. Cohen, the billionaire investor whose career was nearly derailed by a government crackdown on insider trading, is days away from once again being able to manage other people\u2019s money.Whether investors will hand over their money is another question.Mr. Cohen was a singular figure on Wall Street. His estimated $13 billion net worth, love of big homes and lavish spending on modern art, combined with his firm\u2019s envelope-pushing tactics, all shaped a public image of a highflying hedge fund manager.But his highly anticipated comeback is looking underwhelming so far.The firm that is marketing his hedge-fund-in-waiting has received $2 billion to $4 billion in commitments from investors, said three people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. That is a far cry from the $11 billion Mr. Cohen ran at his family office the past two years.And according to several industry consultants, some pension funds and institutional investors are wary about putting their money with Mr. Cohen, who remains tainted by the insider-trading scandal that engulfed him and his former hedge fund.There is also anxiety, these consultants say, that Mr. Cohen\u2019s new firm plans to charge higher-than-average fees and will not let some investors withdraw their money for at least three years. Others wonder if the trader\u2019s best days are behind him.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise and high fees,\u201d said Richard C. Wilson, founder of Family Office Club, a professional association for family offices, which manage money for wealthy individuals. \u201cIf they haven\u2019t invested with him before, I don\u2019t think a lot of them will be clamoring to go in.\u201dWhen Mr. Wilson held a conference for about 300 investors in Miami in December, he said, Mr. Cohen and his new fund were barely discussed.Powerful Wall Street institutions are taking a cautious approach, too.JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, which will handle trades for the new firm, have not yet committed to offering their wealthy customers a chance to invest with Mr. Cohen\u2019s new fund, according to two people familiar with each bank. Banks that serve as prime brokers to a hedge fund often give their best customers a chance to invest in that fund.A number of past investors in SAC, including the private equity firm the Blackstone Group, declined to comment about whether they would give money to Mr. Cohen\u2019s new firm.Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Mr. Cohen, declined to comment.During his two-year ban from the securities industry, Mr. Cohen hardly vanished.He converted SAC into an $11 billion family office called Point72 Asset Management, which managed and traded much of his personal fortune. In many ways, Point72 resembled SAC, employing more than 1,000 people and using the same Stamford, Conn., offices.Under the terms of his 2016 settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Cohen will need to hire an independent consultant for Stamford Harbor once it begins accepting money from outside investors and if Mr. Cohen works there in a supervisory capacity. The consultant will have to stay in place for at least two years.The settlement with the S.E.C. also required Mr. Cohen to keep an independent consultant at Point72 during the period he was banned. The consultant, Michael Considine, a lawyer with Seward & Kissel, did not respond to requests for comment. It\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Considine will work with Stamford Harbor.The timing of Mr. Cohen\u2019s hedge fund reboot is inauspicious; many longtime managers have closed their hedge funds to run family offices instead.Jesse Schraft, who advises three family offices on alternative investments, said his main concern with investing in new hedge funds was paying high fees at a time when performances across the industry have been uneven at best. He is also wary of investing with managers who focus on stocks at a time when stock market indexes keep hitting record highs.For many people, Mr. Cohen\u2019s performance will be evaluated against the high bars set by two of his former SAC associates who have outpaced many of their competitors.Gabriel Plotkin\u2019s Melvin Capital hedge fund is up just over 41 percent this year. Mr. Plotkin was one of the top portfolio managers at SAC before he left to open his own fund in 2014. Mr. Plotkin invests mainly in consumer stocks, and Mr. Cohen invested $200 million of his own money with his former trader.Suvretta Capital Management, led by Aaron Cowen, another ex-SAC trader, is up 26 percent for the year.Kate Kelly contributed to this article.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tax Plan Crowns a Big Winner: Trump\u2019s Industry", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe real estate industry ended up with an even more generous depreciation timetable, allowing owners to shelter more income.And in a break from previous practice, rental and mortgage-interest income qualifies for a lower tax rate, the kind of special treatment traditionally reserved for long-term capital gains and certain qualified dividends.Real estate investment trusts, known as REITs, have extra cause for celebration. They are companies that make money by owning, financing and operating real estate. Both the Trump Organization and Kushner Companies, the family real estate firm partly owned by Mr. Kushner, have important deals with such trusts.A REIT functions like a mutual fund, but instead of assembling a portfolio of stocks, it allows people to invest in a bundle of real estate assets, both buildings and mortgages. More important is the way they are taxed. They pay no separate business tax and instead are required to pass along virtually all of their taxable income to shareholders, who pay the tax when they file individual returns.That\u2019s a big savings, and a big advantage. Those receiving mortgage-interest income outside a REIT would have to pay taxes based on ordinary rates.Kushner Companies has teamed up with another New York-based REIT, SL Green Realty Corporation, in several deals. They are collaborating on a development in Brooklyn, and SL Green lent Mr. Kushner\u2019s firm $85 million in 2016 to refinance its slice of the former headquarters of The New York Times in Manhattan.A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said the firm had not done any lobbying on the tax bill.Kurt Koegl, a partner at the national accounting firm Marcum, noted that a lower corporate tax rate would enable other kinds of companies to better compete with REITs.But REITs are favored in other ways. Individuals who borrow money to invest in a REIT will be able to deduct the interest they pay on the loan at the top individual rate. When it comes to paying taxes on the interest income they earn from that REIT investment, however, the new, lower pass-through rate would apply.\u201cThat\u2019s a great deal, and it\u2019s going to create giant new tax shelters,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The tax code generally tries to prohibit this kind of tax rate arbitrage, he added.The REIT advantage is one example of a broader issue: different tax treatment for similar activities.Writers of the congressional bills promised that their overhaul would simplify the tax code, but the intricacies of the changes create countless opportunities for gamesmanship.\u201cSuddenly, there are a dozen different tax rates that apply to different businesses, in different industries, and to different investments,\u201d said Adam Looney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury Department official. That means opportunities to come out ahead by making deals between these different groups or structuring businesses to take advantage of various provisions.That could lead to a flurry of restructuring and asset shifting that has no purpose other than lowering the tax rate. One business might borrow money to invest in another, or buy equipment and treat it as an expense and then lease it to another company.Ideally, the tax code is meant to encourage businesses to make sound economic decisions, and forgo activities whose sole purpose is to avoid taxes. But the proliferation of different business rates rewards loophole hunting and earnings shifting.\u201cThe speed with which they\u2019re doing this creates a level of ambiguity that will keep tax lawyers and tax professionals busy for 20 years,\u201d said Scott D. Michel, a tax lawyer with Caplin & Drysdale.For some industries, such accounting acrobatics may not be necessary. A Senate provision that is being marketed as an aid to small craft breweries would save money even for the largest beer, wine and liquor producers, whether they are in the United States or abroad.Foreign cruise lines that operate in the United States got a last-minute reprieve from a new tax that was in an earlier version of the Senate bill.Whistle-blowers and their attorneys are happy about a provision specifying that they can collect rewards based on criminal fines.Car dealers escaped the cap on interest deductions that apply to most other businesses. Private equity firms were not able to sidestep that cap, but they held on to most of the carried-interest benefit that allows private equity managers, hedge fund managers and real estate investors to pay a lower rate on much of their income. Firms will have to hold an asset for three years instead of one, but the average hold time is already more than five years.The energy industry also did well. Coal and natural gas would potentially benefit from provisions that undercut their renewable-energy competitors. In a reversal of more than four decades of national policy, the Senate bill would open a pristine 1.5-million-acre expanse of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration.House and Senate Republicans are still wrangling over the final version, and every comma is subject to change. But to some tax experts, an unlevel playing field that gives certain types of business and structures advantages over others is a bigger concern than a tax break for real estate or any other industry.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to look at the deals that are explicitly in the bill \u2014 like the special treatment of auto-dealer financing or whistle-blowers \u2014 and call out \u2018loophole,\u2019\u201d Mr. Looney of Brookings said. \u201cBut the big problems are the things that aren\u2019t specifically noted in the bill, but will arise because of tax planning.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Took Office. Stocks Rose. Investors Are Still Worried.", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersSome of President Trump\u2019s least controversial tweets involve him boasting about the stock market. It has certainly done well since he was elected a year ago, with the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 30 percent in that time.Few would have predicted a year ago that the market would do so well. Investors who had the fortitude to stay in have benefited mightily by the increase. But the wary ones put their money in more secure assets.Michael Sonnenfeldt, a New Yorker who made his fortune in real estate, is the chairman of Tiger 21, an investment club for very wealthy people. When I talked to him last year, he revealed the uncertainty investors were facing.\u201cThe combination of potential interest rate shocks and a China implosion and the geopolitical situations with Russia, China, Iran, the Middle East, ISIS, and the difficult political situation in the U.S. with the most challenging, strangest presidential election we\u2019ve had in our lifetime \u2014 it all adds up to many generic concerns,\u201d he said at the time.So how did the market rocket past expectations, and how should investors plan for 2018?Mr. Trump is not unique among presidents for taking credit for a strong stock market and the broader economy. Most do it, if they can \u2014 just as surely as they try to skirt responsibility when there is a slump.But the last 12 months of great returns lack the euphoria a person might expect after an increase in the Dow of nearly 30 percent.Advisers say that is because many individual investors remain afraid that the eight-year bull market is going to collapse, while others struggle to separate Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh political language from the strong fundamentals of American companies.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a year of record-low volatility, strong returns and strong macroeconomic indicators,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Sullivan, chief investment officer for international wealth management at Credit Suisse. \u201cBut politically \u2014 we\u2019re in a political recession. People have difficulty squaring the two.\u201dThe firm\u2019s global wealth report, released in November, showed that the world had grown wealthier in the last 12 months and not just at the top of the economic pyramid.\u201cThe markets are focused very much on the business cycle, which is picking up,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cThat\u2019s been a positive surprise, given how badly many people would have said the economy would have fared.\u201dIn other words, the stock market is rising not because of Mr. Trump but in spite of him.\u201cOur view continues to be that politicians are not as important to investing as they would like investors to believe,\u201d said Richard Bernstein, chief executive and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors, an investment advisory firm. \u201cThat\u2019s always been our working model.\u201dMr. Bernstein said corporate fundamentals remained strong. \u201cCorporate profits remain healthy, liquidity remains abundant, and investors generally remain scared of stocks,\u201d he said.If presidential tweeting has not been driving the stock market, what should individual investors look for in equities? Analysts said investors should start by separating the political noise from the signals companies were sending out.For one, any corporate tax cut is not necessarily a short-term gain for the stock market. Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer with Eaton Vance, said a tax cut could actually result in a short-term drop in stock prices. And the companies that have been driving the stock market\u2019s growth, like health care and technology firms, will not benefit as much from a tax cut as smaller domestic companies that had not been able to take advantage of the loopholes and deductions under the current tax system.Other analysts argue that the prospect of tax cuts ceased being a factor in this rally a few months into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, when he and the Republican Congress failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201cCorporate tax cuts are not priced into the market, because there is still skepticism toward the legislative process,\u201d said John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial.For 2018, analysts are predicting that the stock market will continue to do well but with greater swings.\u201cI always love corporate profits,\u201d Mr. Lynch said. \u201cWe can all get really geeky with these valuation measurements, but if you think about it, we have record profits growing slightly above historical rates. The Fed is tightening policy, and we\u2019re still growing. That\u2019s a pretty good recipe for equity investors.\u201dAnthony Roth, chief investment officer of Wilmington Trust, said one difference in his strategy was a plan to use more active managers who pick stocks and to cut passively managed index funds. He said Wilmington Trust\u2019s research showed that active managers were outperforming the market as a whole.Or put another way: The skill that an active manager has is valuable in an environment when tweets about politics and people rattle less sophisticated investors.Today, Mr. Sonnenfeldt said, he and the 580 members of Tiger 21, who have an average net worth of about $100 million, have nearly three-quarters of their money in private equity, real estate and publicly traded stocks.Over the last year, he said, the group\u2019s concern has not been with the political environment but with interest rates and wondering how long they will stay as low at they are. The group remains bullish on the advantages that American businesses have, like lower energy and transportation costs, over competitors in other countries.So what could end the stock market\u2019s run?CTBC Bank USA put that question to affluent investors in California, New Jersey and New York, all blue states that would be affected by a loss of deductions for state and property taxes. The poll found that they remained confident about the economic and investment landscape, but that they feared a political threat like a conflict with North Korea or a large terrorist attack in the United States.\u201cThe only thing we worry about is this geopolitical risk,\u201d said Noor Menai, president and chief executive of CTBC Bank USA. \u201cNothing gets amplified. Markets take it in stride.\u201dYet Mr. Menai said seasoned financial services professionals and institutional investors had a distinct advantage over individual investors.\u201cWe\u2019ve been through three crises over the past 25 years, and each time the market has reconstructed itself,\u201d he said. \u201cOver time, the insiders such as me have come to understand what the hype is versus what can happen.\u201dBut individual investors do not have that knowledge. They still get scared about investing in a rising stock market because they fear it\u2019s going to collapse. When that happens, said Judith Ward, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price, she asks clients to focus on what they can control.For example, if they are near retirement and cannot weather a 20 or 30 percent drop in their assets, she said, they should invest more conservatively.\u201cThere is anxiety and uncertainty about the political climate, but my sense is people are looking at their personal situation and asking how is all of this going to impact them,\u201d she said. And that, she said, can be summed up in one question: \u201cHow long can this bull market last?\u201dI\u2019ll bet you won\u2019t find that answer in a tweet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Central Bank, Lagging Behind Counterparts, Faces Eventful 2018", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A lot is happening in the world of central banks.It could be a watershed. The central bank\u2019s own economists substantially raised their estimates for eurozone growth, portending an end to the crisis measures that have been in place in the 19-nation common currency area since 2008. That would usher in a new era, with monetary policy returning to normal and the central bank beginning to gently push up interest rates.Mr. Draghi\u2019s news conference on Thursday revolved around how soon the stimulus measures might end. While he said there has been \u201ca significant improvement in the growth outlook,\u201d he steadfastly avoided any statements that would change investor expectations. Still, Mr. Draghi offered a few clues about the central bank\u2019s evolving views.Here are some of the key takeaways.The Governing Council did not change its stance on Thursday, repeating that it can step up the stimulus measures at any time if the eurozone economy starts to flag. That\u2019s a sign that interest rate increases are still far in the future.But some members of the Governing Council have been suggesting that the bank should move more quickly. Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the bank\u2019s executive board, said last month that he hoped the need for central bank bond buying would have run its course by September.Mr. Draghi declined to make any similar statements Thursday. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any change in the language or intentions,\u201d he said.The eurozone economy is humming. In new estimates published Thursday, the European Central Bank\u2019s economists said economic growth would accelerate to 2.3 percent in 2018. That compares to their estimate in September of 1.8 percent.At the same time, the central bank economists predict that inflation \u2014 the figure that influences central bank policy the most \u2014 will remain well below the official target of 2 percent through 2020. That is yet another sign the bank is in no hurry to begin raising interest rates.Mr. Draghi betrayed some concern Thursday about what will happen when the central bank is no longer flooding the eurozone with cash. He acknowledged that very low interest rates can lead to asset bubbles.\u201cThe ground is fertile for these risks,\u201d he said. But he added that evidence of overexuberant prices for real estate or other assets seem to be limited to a few local areas which are not a threat to the eurozone as a whole. \u201cWe are not seeing systemically important financial stability risks,\u201d he said.The European Central Bank exercises strong influence over interest rates in the eurozone but it is also at the mercy of financial markets, which react to a host of forces \u2014 not the least of which is what the Fed is doing.In effect, the European Central Bank is moving at a speed different from that of its two most important counterparts, even though their economies are closely intertwined. Currency exchange rates, for example, react strongly to central bank policy and have far-reaching economic consequences, determining how much people must pay for imported goods and also how cheaply companies can sell their products abroad.In fact, the euro spiked briefly as Mr. Draghi spoke Thursday but then retreated.Mr. Draghi said, in essence, that each central bank has to do its own thing depending on where its economy is. He said he hasn\u2019t detected any sign that the Fed\u2019s rate increases are hurting Europe. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any effect.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Much Food Do We Waste? Probably More Than You Think", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat\u2019s important for at least two reasons. The less the world wastes, the easier it will be to meet the food needs of the global population in coming years. Second, cutting back on waste could go a long way to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.How do we manage to waste so much?Food waste is a glaring measure of inequality. In poor countries, most of the food waste is on the farm or on its way to market. In South Asia, for instance, half of all the cauliflower that\u2019s grown is lost because there\u2019s not enough refrigeration, according to Rosa Rolle, an expert on food waste and loss at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Tomatoes get squished if they are packed into big sacks. In Southeast Asia, lettuce spoils on the way from farms to city supermarkets. Very little food in poor countries is thrown out by consumers. It\u2019s too precious.\u201cAs you get higher and higher income, you get more and more profligacy in food waste,\u201d Paul A. Behrens, an assistant professor of energy and environmental sciences at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\u201cIn the developed world, food is more abundant but it costs much less,\u201d Ms. Rolle said. \u201cIn a sense people don\u2019t value food for what it represents.\u201d\u201cFood waste \u2014 it\u2019s kind of the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Jason Clay, a senior vice president in charge of food policy at the World Wildlife Fund, a Washington-based advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s the most obvious place to start.\u201dMs. Rolle of the Food and Agriculture Organization said some of the most basic fixes are at the bottom end of the supply chain: Metal grain silos have helped against fungus ruining grain stocks in countries in Africa. In India, the F.A.O. is encouraging farmers to collect tomatoes in plastic crates instead of big sacks; they squish and rot less.Higher up the food chain, supermarkets are trying to make a dent by changing the way best-before labels are used \u2014 making them specific to various food categories to discourage consumers from throwing out food that is safe to eat \u2014 or trying to sell misshapen fruits and vegetables rather than discarding them.Some countries are trying to regulate food waste. France requires retailers to donate food that is at risk of being thrown out but is still safe to eat. European Union lawmakers are pushing for binding targets to curb food waste by 50 percent by 2030, echoing a United Nations development goal; negotiations have been underway since June. Some countries pushing back on the idea of continentwide targets.What if we just ate less?That would make a difference, but not as much as one might think. Dr. Behrens of Leiden University addressed the issue in a recent study: An earlier version of this article misidentified the group that Jason Clay works for. His is a senior vice president at the World Wildlife Fund, not the World Wildlife Foundation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s HNA Keeps Striking Foreign Deals as Banks Wince and Investors Flee", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 With some investors in its bonds running for the exits and foreign banks increasingly skeptical about its prospects, HNA Group tried this week to reassure markets that it has access to the money it needs.At the same time, HNA, a vast but troubled Chinese conglomerate, is continuing the drive that helped cause its difficulties in the first place: completing billions of dollars in foreign deals.The competing efforts by a company that has symbolized China\u2019s growing wealth and global ambitions are a problem for the country\u2019s leaders. They want to end wasteful overseas spending by debt-laden Chinese companies, which in the case of HNA and some others have drawn growing regulatory scrutiny in the United States and Europe.China has yet to let one of its big conglomerates fail, and HNA is unlikely to be an exception. But it is testing how effectively China can curb such behavior, and how the country may deal with some companies that have gone too far.HNA said late Wednesday that it had talked to eight Chinese banks, including powerful and politically connected lenders like China Development Bank and China Construction Bank, about extending the conglomerate\u2019s credit lines next year. HNA said several of the banks planned to increase the amount of money it could borrow if needed.HNA made the disclosure as its problems continued to mount.The company\u2019s publicly traded bonds have fallen in recent days as worries grew among global investors about the challenges it faces. The bonds\u2019 declining value makes it more expensive for HNA to borrow, which analysts say the company must do to meet its obligations. It owes at least $21 billion to bondholders overseas and $16 billion in so-called syndicated loans from banks, according to data from the data provider Dealogic.\u201cThe situation is a lot worse now,\u201d said Chung Yuh Ang, a senior fixed-income analyst at iFast Corporation, an online investment platform. \u201cHNA is only able to pay its old debts by taking new ones.\u201dAfter a buying spree that began two years ago, HNA now has operations in countries from Germany to Australia, and in cities like Hong Kong, London and New York. People around the world take money from a financial institution it partially owns, fly on its planes and sleep in its hotels.In many instances, HNA has paid dearly for its acquisitions.\u201cHNA has bought things at clearly high prices,\u201d said Gordon Orr, the former Asia chairman at global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. \u201cThe auctions they won haven\u2019t been by a dollar but by miles.\u201dAt a news media event in Beijing on Nov. 28, HNA\u2019s chief executive, Adam Tan, discussed the possibility that the company would sell some assets, like those related to real estate, which do not fall under the most strategically important investments recently outlined by President Xi Jinping.\u201cWe will not invest in anything the government does not support,\u201d Mr. Tan said at the event, which was hosted by Caijing Magazine.HNA is nonetheless pressing to complete its pending deals, even as regulators from Washington to Brussels to Switzerland grow increasingly skeptical.A lawsuit filed last week in a New York state court by Ness Technologies, a company that HNA tried to acquire, accused the Chinese company of dooming the deal by not trying hard enough to address questions from officials at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a group that scrutinizes foreign purchases of domestic companies. HNA\u2019s ownership structure attracted a number of questions from committee officials, the suit says, but the company\u2019s answers undermined its credibility.In a statement, HNA said it \u201cbelieves this lawsuit is baseless and without merit, and we will vigorously defend against it.\u201dGuang Yang, the chief executive of HNA Capital, the subsidiary that has agreed to buy SkyBridge, said the firm was \u201ccommitted to closing the transaction with SkyBridge as soon as possible.\u201dIn Germany, HNA\u2019s proposed acquisition of shares in Deutsche Bank, a major global lender, has drawn questions. The European Central Bank is considering opening an inquiry into whether HNA is a qualified owner of its 10 percent stake in Deutsche Bank, according to a person with knowledge of the procedure who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The central bank has the authority to examine an investor if it appears that the investor could exert significant influence over management.Germany\u2019s financial markets watchdog, BaFin, is also examining whether HNA fulfilled its reporting requirements as it increased its stake in the bank, according to someone with direct knowledge of the matter. Deutsche Bank, the European Central Bank and BaFin declined to comment.A Swiss regulator has gone a step further than its counterparts in Germany and the United States.Last month, the Swiss Takeover Board cited HNA for providing false information about its complicated share structure when it acquired Gategroup Holding, a Swiss airline catering and logistics company.Although the Swiss takeover board has no enforcement powers, it asked Ernst & Young to conduct a further inquiry, which could lead to litigation in the future.\u201cWe cooperated fully with the Swiss Takeover Board\u2019s inquiry,\u201d HNA said in a statement, adding that it would \u201crespect its authority in this matter.\u201dJack Ewing in Frankfurt contributed reporting.

By his own reckoning, Wall Street\u2019s rally since his election is proof of the economic potency of his presidency.But is Mr. Trump really delivering what investors expected? To answer that question, we assembled a set of Trump Policy Indexes.

The Bulls were, on average, not far ahead of the Bears \u2014 perhaps investors had unrealistic ideas of how easy it would be for Mr. Trump to push his agenda and how effective he would be at doing it.But in the final days of November, with Mr. Trump and Republicans on the verge of a tax cut bill, the index rallied \u2014 not to the optimistic levels seen early in Mr. Trump\u2019s term, but back above its pre-election level.In our policy graphs, which measure whether markets expect Mr. Trump to follow up on his campaign talking points, important events are noted, like the Senate's rejection of health care repeal. Sometimes these move markets, but at least as often they do not \u2014 many political events are well anticipated by investors and their effects factored in well ahead of any politician\u2019s announcement or bill\u2019s passage.To be clear, these indexes do not measure whether what Mr. Trump is doing is good or bad for the economy as a whole, but rather his effect on corporate profits.All charts are drawn at the same scale.Trump speech to joint session of CongressFEB. 28Comey firedMAY 9Comey testimonyJUNE 7Manafort indictmentOCT. 30Stocks that went upwith Trump\u2019s election+10%DEC. 1:+3%0\u20133%Stocks that went downwith Trump\u2019s election\u201310%THAN STOCKS OVERALLNov. 8,2016Jan.2017Feb.Mar.AprilMayJuneJulyAug.Sept.Oct.Nov.Dec.1The market expects Mr. Trump, whose saber rattling on trade continues, to help firms in import-exposed industries, presumably by disrupting free-trade agreements.The America First Index has often moved in the opposite direction from other components of the Trump Bulls index.

{"Headline": "When Forecasters Get It Wrong: Always", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo borrow from Yogi Berra, it is tough to make predictions, especially about the future. But 2017 was particularly difficult. On many of the biggest forecasts \u2014 global growth, inflation, the trajectory of the big powers \u2014 the experts got the year wrong.They thought the global economy would continue to struggle, inflation would stage a comeback, right-wing nationalism would prevent economic revival in Europe and laggards like Japan, Russia and Brazil would remain weak. They expected the United States to be the one relatively bright spot and that Donald Trump\u2019s promises of tax cuts and protectionism would drive the mighty dollar higher.Instead, President Trump had little impact on the economy, and the dollar fell against every major currency. While American stocks did well, foreign markets did better, because the rest of the world grew faster than expected, and inflation remained quiet. Given up for dead, even Japan bounced back. The nationalist right underachieved, and recovery spread to Europe and beyond. Three-quarters of the globe saw an acceleration in economic growth for the first time in a decade.The forecasting misses of 2017 reflect mistakes humans have been making since we started thinking about the future. Every forecaster knows that economies rise and fall constantly, oscillating around a long-term trend line. Yet forecasts typically extrapolate current trends on a straight line, so the vision of tomorrow closely resembles today, often implausibly so. A year ago forecasters thought 2017 would look like 2016; instead the world economy had its best year since the financial crisis of 2008.The weakness of straight-line forecasts explains why the consensus of leading economists has consistently missed big turns. They have not predicted a single United States recession since the Federal Reserve began keeping such records a half-century ago, and missed many revivals, including the unusually broad global expansion of 2017.Few dare predict big shifts, so they tinker at the margins. And once an economy gets labeled \u201cmiraculous\u201d or \u201chopeless,\u201d the stereotype sticks. Japan had gone cold for so long few experts could imagine it warming up in 2017, but it did. After long slumps, \u201cOld Man Europe,\u201d Russia and Brazil also recovered much faster than expected. In part, these economies were just rebounding toward their long-term average or, as economists say, \u201creverting to the mean.\u201dEconomic stereotypes are reinforced by political biases, like Europe\u2019s ingrained fear of extreme nationalism. In early 2017, forecasters took rising poll numbers for nationalists, extrapolated them into the future and imagined formerly fringe right-wingers gaining influence and setting off a eurozone crisis. Instead, the center held, and sheer relief helped propel the surprise economic recovery.Forecasters are prone to focus on a single story line, particularly one as compelling as angry populism. The consensus view figured Mr. Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans would increase growth in the United States, while his protectionist threats would undercut the rest of the world. Most forecasters share the establishment disdain for Mr. Trump, yet few paused to consider whether a leader they see as inept and divisive could deliver all this as fast as he promised.He didn\u2019t, and the widely hyped \u201cTrump Bump\u201d barely surfaced in 2017. Yes, the United States economy grew around 2 percent and generated jobs at a healthy pace. But both trends date to well before Mr. Trump. Liberals who thought Mr. Trump would induce a global recession proved even farther off the mark.If one were to avoid the straight-line projections, political biases and single factors that so often distort forecasts, what would a 2018 forecast look like? Not like the consensus, which is euphoric over the current combo of high growth and low inflation. Usually staid Wall Street economists are giving their 2018 forecasts headlines like \u201cBoom Shaka-laka-laka\u201d and \u201cAs Good as It Gets.\u201d Inspired by a cocksure consensus, investors are holding less money in cash than they ever have before \u2014 meaning they are all-in on risky investments.Confidence this solid is a warning sign of complacency. For one, gross domestic product growth is at the top end of the range that has prevailed over the past decade, so it is more likely to slip than accelerate. That should be sobering for every major power, including Trump\u2019s America. But please, it\u2019s not all about him. For better or worse, Mr. Trump had less impact on the global economy than most experts expected in 2017. The lesson \u2014 the inevitable rarely happens, the unexpected often does \u2014 applies as well to forecasting 2018.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Microsoft\u2019s highest closing value in 1999, when translated into today\u2019s dollars, was roughly $901 billion.Apple\u2019s value has been rising for quite some time. Earlier in this decade, Apple passed Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company in the contemporary stock market.To put its current size in context, Apple is worth more than the entire G.D.P. of Turkey.But Apple\u2019s dominance is not just a question of inflation. Using another metric \u2014 Apple\u2019s weight in the current stock market \u2014 IBM and AT&T, in their halcyon days, were far more dominant than Apple is today.No surprise: When the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, Apple is the largest company on the list by a large margin, followed by Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Microsoft. In this list, all three hit their high point in November. Apple has been moving above and below its pinnacle since then, and its value was just above $895 billion at the close of trading Wednesday.The list is basically split between the hot markets of the last 25 years: the current one, which started in March 2009, and the stock market surge associated with the dot-com era and its aftermath. General Electric was in fourth place over all, based on its $594 billion market cap in August 2000.

That would have been enough to place it in third place, without taking inflation into account.But over extended periods, the compounding effects of inflation are powerful. That $647 billion translates into a nearly 40 percent increase in value in November 2017 dollars. It has probably gained slightly more since November, because inflation has remained positive.General Electric has been shrinking lately as it restructures. But in inflation-adjusted terms, its August 2000 market cap is still growing and it moved up one spot on the list, to third place. Cisco and Intel moved into fourth and fifth place, based on their soaring shares during the dot-com boom.Even more than the first list, the inflation-adjusted ranking provides a reminder of the stock market highs during these two exuberant periods \u2014 the dot-com era in 1999 and 2000, and the bull market that is still underway.Seven of the all-time biggest companies reached their peaks in October or November, the most current data in this ranking, and 12 of the companies did so from late 1999 to early 2001.Exxon Mobil is the only company to have achieved a top-20 market cap unaided by the momentum of one of these rising stock market eras. In inflation-adjusted terms, Exxon\u2019s peak occurred in July 2007, several months before its pinnacle in nominal 2007 dollars.Share of the total market since 1980 NO.

Using this metric, Apple in late 2017 does not tower over the rest of the stock market as much as many other companies did in previous eras.In fact, although Apple\u2019s market cap is far higher today than it was five years ago, Apple shares represented a larger share of the total stock market in September 2012 than they do now.The Apple of 2017 does not show up at all in either of the two Top 20 lists that Mr. Poukchanski produced, one starting in 1980 and one going all the way back to 1925.In December 1985, IBM\u2019s shares constituted 4.4 percent of the entire stock market, a higher percentage than any other company since 1980.That is a very high figure, given the enormous expanse of the universe covered by the Center for Research database, which included 6,225 stocks for December 1985. (By contrast, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has, as you might imagine, 500 stocks; the Dow Jones industrial average has 30.)In November, Apple\u2019s shares constituted only 2.5 percent of the overall stock market. In September 2012, they reached 3.2 percent of the total market, far more than today.In other words, many other stocks have become giants in the 2017 market: Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook and more.  Apple does not tower over them as much as IBM once did over its contemporaries.Share of the total market since 1925NO.

In March 1928, General Motors accounted for 8 percent of the stock market. And in 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8 percent of the market of that day.One explanation for the outsize status of these companies in earlier times is that the stock market itself was much smaller: 6,715 listings in November compared with only 704 in May 1932 and 584 in March 1928. It was easier to be a big fish in those smaller ponds.That said, at the end of 1985, when IBM\u2019s market cap was far larger than any other company\u2019s, there were 6,225 publicly traded stocks in the market, nearly as many as today. So the size of the stock market isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation:  Companies like IBM and AT&T simply were more dominant than Apple is now.For example, the old AT&T was so big that Standard & Poor\u2019s excluded it from a predecessor to the S.&P. 500-stock index \u201cbecause S.&P. did not want to let the performance of such a large firm dominate the index,\u201d as Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in his book, \u201cStocks for the Long Run.\u201dConsidered a monopoly, the old AT&T was forcibly broken up in 1984. (A descendent of the company is embroiled in antitrust issues of its own, arising from its proposed merger with Time Warner).But a 1935 law during President Roosevelt\u2019s administration called for the abolition of such holding companies. After a lengthy court fight, U.G.I. transformed itself into a much smaller entity. On the list of the most dominant companies, it is an artifact of a bygone era.These questions may seem strange today, and those who are so inclined may celebrate as Apple sets new stock market records. But it is worth recalling that other companies played monumental roles in the stock market, until their day was done.Notes: All data as of Nov. 30, 2017.

The correction undercut the main thrust of CNN\u2019s story, which had been seized on by critics of President Trump as evidence of coordination between WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign.It was also yet another prominent reporting error at a time when news organizations are confronting a skeptical public, and a president who delights in attacking the media as \u201cfake news.\u201dThe report fueled theories about coordination between the Trump campaign and a foreign power, and stocks dropped after the news. In fact, Mr. Trump\u2019s instruction to Mr. Flynn came after he was president-elect.Several news outlets, including Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, also inaccurately reported this week that Deutsche Bank had received a subpoena from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for President Trump\u2019s financial records.The president and his circle have not been shy about pointing out the errors.CNN\u2019s erroneous scoop, about the email to Donald Trump Jr., rocketed around cable news and social media on Friday morning. But it fell apart after The Washington Post reported that the email \u2014 which included a decryption key to access hacked documents \u2014 was dated Sept. 14, not Sept. 4, as CNN initially reported. WikiLeaks publicized links to the documents in question on Sept. 13.CNN said that its report had been based on information from two sources and vetted by the network\u2019s in-house fact-checking team. But both sources were apparently incorrect about the date of the message.\u201cThe new information indicates that the communication is less significant than CNN initially reported,\u201d CNN wrote in an updated article.There were lamentations on social media in the wake of CNN\u2019s error, as some press advocates worried that it could further erode trust in the media and gird the president\u2019s attacks.In June, CNN severed ties with three journalists after a botched report about ties between Russia and a Trump confidant, Anthony Scaramucci, who went on to briefly serve as the White House communications director.On Friday, the network said it would take no disciplinary action in this latest case, because the reporters, Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb, followed its editorial guidelines.

Inter Ikea, through a Dutch subsidiary, receives franchise fees equal to 3 percent of the revenue from Ikea stores worldwide, according to regulators. Although Ikea was founded in Sweden in 1943, the parent company is based in the Netherlands.European regulators are concerned in particular about a 2006 Dutch ruling that allowed Inter Ikea to send a significant part of its franchise profits, in the form of an annual license fee, to a company in Luxembourg, where it was not taxed.Over the years, Ikea has argued that its business structure was perfectly legal.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedIncreasing optimism that the Republican tax overhaul will be signed into law this week has pushed shares of bank stocks to levels not hit since before the financial crisis.Goldman Sachs in a note Monday said lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 percent could lead to a 14 percent increase in earnings per share on average for banks.

{"Headline": "2017: The Year in Charts", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "Advertisement\nThe overbearing persona of President Trump dominated 2017. From his angry early morning tweets to the stain of corruption bleeding into his administration to the sharp rightward tilt in his governing philosophy, Mr. Trump in his first year in office could not stand in starker contrast to his predecessor, Barack Obama. Meanwhile, strong economic performance in 2017 \u2014 a legacy for which Mr. Trump should thank Mr. Obama \u2014 masked the reality that the new president failed to propose or carry out any significant policies that would help the white working-class Americans who helped elect him.The divisive campaign waged by Mr. Trump and his harsh inaugural address put him in office with the poorest approval ratings of any recent president. From that inauspicious beginning, his ratings continued to tumble, as a result of his numerous false and sometimes racially charged statements, his often unpopular policy initiatives and allegations regarding Russian meddling in the election. Of course, many new presidents see their approval ratings fall in their first year as the postelection glow begins to fade. But because of his poor start, Mr. Trump is distinguished as being the only president to finish his first year with more Americans disapproving of his performance than approving of it.Here are net ratings \u2014 the gap, in percentage points, between those who approve and disapprove \u2014 for six presidents in the months after their first inauguration.+80+76ReaganBush IClintonBush IIObama+60+51+40+14+20+8+80\u20137\u201320Trump\u201326Jan.Dec.Jan.Dec.+80+76ReaganBush IClintonBush IIObama+60+51+40+14+20+8+80\u20137\u201320Trump\u201326Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.+80+76ReaganBush IClintonBush IIObama+60+51+40+14+20+8+80\u20137\u201320Trump\u201326Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Surprisingly, Mr. Trump chose to pitch his young presidency toward his base, in contrast to most new presidents who try to reach out to those who did not vote for them, particularly moderates. As a result, Mr. Trump has remained as popular within his own party as his predecessors but more unpopular among the opposition party than previous presidents. The fear of a Trump counterpunch or worse, a primary challenge, as well as a strong desire to pass at least some Republican legislative priorities such as tax cuts, has helped keep Republican senators and representatives from criticizing him. And for all his unpopularity, most observers (including me) believe that the president will complete his first term, as the prediction markets indicate.Party affiliation governs presidential approval ratings.

It will confer embarrassingly modest benefits on middle- and working-class Americans relative to what will be received by the wealthy. While America\u2019s corporate tax code was in desperate need of revamping, the lack of any meaningful effort to eliminate corporate loopholes suggested that far from draining the swamp, Mr. Trump embraced it. So far, the American people aren\u2019t fooled; this appalling piece of legislation has the lowest approval rating of any major bill passed since 1990.In both dollar and percentage terms, the 2018 tax cuts skew to the richest American households (and will continue to do so for many years).

The improvement in sentiment in the private sector shouldn\u2019t be shocking: If you had been told that you would receive a huge tax cut and be freed from thousands of government regulations, wouldn\u2019t you feel better about your business? As for consumers, their improved mood since the election represents a continuation of a trend that began in 2009 as the floodwaters of the financial crisis were starting to recede. But interestingly, immediately after  the election Democrats became more pessimistic about the economy while Republicans became more optimistic.Consumer and business sentiment rose after the election.

For one thing, at long last, the world economy is firing on all cylinders \u2014 perhaps not as strongly as we would like in the United States and Europe, but moving upward nonetheless. In fact, only six countries are expected to be in recession in 2018, the smallest number on record. Growing economies have helped propel corporate profits and thus  stock markets upward worldwide. So while Mr. Trump\u2019s emphasis on business-friendly policies has helped turbocharge the American stock market, we are hardly alone in enjoying rising share prices. And let\u2019s not forget that markets rose more during President Obama\u2019s first 11 months in office (37 percent for the S.&.P. 500 versus 18 percent for Mr. Trump).942009: 80Number of countries in recession604062018: 20\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201918\u201921PROJECTIONS2017 in three indicators Global stock markets+21%U.S. stock market+20%Global corporate profits+8%942009: 80Number of countries in recession604062018: 20\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201918\u201921PROJECTIONS2017 in three indicators +21%Global stock markets+20%U.S. stock market+8%Global corporate profitsWhat\u2019s clear is that Mr. Trump deserves little or no credit for the continuing economic and job growth in the United States, despite his frequent claims to the contrary. On Sept. 19, he declared that \u201ccompanies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.\u201d Not true. The rate of job increases has actually slowed since Mr. Trump was inaugurated, by about 44,000 jobs a month. As for Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that the current 3.3 percent rate of growth in the gross domestic product \u201cis the largest increase in many years,\u201d that is false as well; President Obama achieved similar or higher increases in six quarters of his administration.Job creation is down. And six quarters of G.D.P. growth under Obama exceeded Trump\u2019s best quarter thus far, contrary to his claims.Monthly job growth: Obama\u2019s last term vs. Trump\u2019s first300,000Obama average: 214,000200,000Trumpaverage:170,000100,000Feb. \u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917Nov.Quarterly G.D.P. growth+4.6%+5.2%+3.3%4th qtr. 20113rd qtr. 20143rd qtr. 2017+4%+20\u20132Obama administrationTrump\u20134\u20136\u20138Last quarter of Bush administrationMonthly job growth: Obama\u2019s last term vs. Trump\u2019s first300,000Obama average: 214,000200,000Trumpaverage:170,000100,000Feb. \u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917Nov.+5.2%Quarterly G.D.P. growth+4.6%+3.3%3rd qtr. 20144th qtr. 20113rd qtr. 2017+4%+20\u20132Obama administrationTrump\u20134\u20136\u20138Last quarter of Bush administrationDonald Trump won election in large part by riding the wave of discontent among working-class Americans over their wages, which, after adjustment for inflation, have been largely stagnant or have even shrunk since the onset of the financial crisis and ensuing recession. (The brief period of seemingly rising wages in 2009 was a function of declining prices, not higher incomes.) In late 2014, as labor markets began to tighten, employers trying to hire were compelled to increase pay by more than inflation. But since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, this improvement has ebbed and real incomes again have been barely edging upward faster than prices.Year-over-year percentage change in average hourly wages.+5%Aftermath of recessionTrumpelected+4+3+0.2%+2+10\u20131\u20132Mar. \u201907\u201908\u201909\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917+5%+4Trump electedAftermath of recession+3+2+0.2%+10\u20131\u20132Mar. \u201907\u201908\u201909\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917While the Republicans failed in their frontal attack on the Affordable Care Act, they managed a flanking victory by wedging a provision into the new tax bill repealing the requirement that all Americans purchase or otherwise obtain health insurance. That requirement was a key component of Obamacare because it ensured that insurance companies had a supply of healthy customers along with those in greater need of medical care. As a consequence, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, 13 million fewer Americans than previously projected will likely have coverage in 2025. To put that in perspective, before its disfiguration, the A.C.A. was projected to add 34 million to the insurance rolls by 2025. And the news gets worse: The new provision is expected to increase premiums quickly by 10 percent, a jump that will come on top of the premium increases resulting from the Trump administration\u2019s cancellation of payments to reduce insurance costs.In less than a decade, the repeal of Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate is estimated to add 13 million more nonelderly Americans to the ranks of the uninsured \u2014 equivalent to the population of Pennsylvania.Additional uninsured after repeal:Uninsured, in millions, before repeal of mandate471212121213Totaluninsured,2025:2830313144million\u201917\u201918\u201919\u201920\u201921\u201922\u201923\u201924\u201925Additional uninsured after repeal:Uninsured, in millions, before repeal of mandate:Totaluninsured,2025:4712121212134428303131million2017\u201918\u201919\u201920\u201921\u201922\u201923\u201924\u201925While the new administration has struggled to advance its legislative priorities, it has (unfortunately) excelled at another of its responsibilities: appointing judges. While it has a poor record in filling executive branch positions, the Trump team has outshone the Obama administration in both putting forth candidates for the bench and getting them confirmed. The latter accomplishment got a big assist from a procedural change put in place by the Senate Democrats during Mr. Obama\u2019s second term that reduced the number of votes required from 60 to a simple majority. Not surprisingly, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees are more likely to be white than those of any president since Ronald Reagan. He has also nominated a startling four candidates for the judiciary rated \u201cunqualified\u201d by the American Bar Association, and three of his nominees have already had to be withdrawn. Finally, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to these lifetime positions are relatively young, effectively tilting the ideological balance of the federal courts for decades to come.First-year nominations for two presidents, and race and gender of nominees for the last seven presidents.Supreme CourtCONFIRMEDDistrictcourtsCircuitcourtsPENDINGObama139911Trump1127643White nominees as percent of totalReagan94%Trump91Bush I89Bush II83Carter79Clinton75Obama64Male nomineesReagan92%Carter84Bush I81Trump81Bush II78Clinton71Obama58SupremeCourtCircuitcourtsDistrictcourtsObama139911CONFIRMEDPENDINGCONFIRMEDPENDINGTrump1127643CONFIRMEDPENDINGCONFIRMEDPENDINGWhite nominees as percent of totalMale nomineesReagan94%Reagan92%91Carter84TrumpBush I89Bush I81Bush II83Trump81Carter79Bush II7875ClintonClinton71Obama64Obama58SupremeCourtCircuitcourtsDistrictcourtsObama139911CONFIRMEDPENDINGCONFIRMEDPENDINGTrump1127643CONFIRMEDPENDINGCONFIRMEDPENDINGWhite nominees as percent of totalMale nomineesReagan94%Reagan92%91Carter84TrumpBush I89Bush I81Bush II83Trump81Carter79Bush II7875ClintonClinton71Obama64Obama58Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In South Korea, the Virtual Currency Boom Hits Home", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Choi Whal-soo has been through the wringer of speculative bubbles.After selling his real estate agency near Seoul, he invested in South Korean stocks and then watched them plummet in value after the Asian financial crisis of 1997. He tried to recover, continuing to play the stock market and lotteries, but lost yet more money.Last week, Mr. Choi visited the physical location of one of South Korea\u2019s many new virtual currency exchanges, with a plan to put about a quarter of his remaining $18,000 in savings into virtual currencies.\u201cI may have missed the Bitcoin boat but new boats are coming and I want to hop on those,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is possible that some might be scams but even with those, the prices will rise at least in the middle of their life cycles so that there will be a chance to make money from trading them.\u201dAround the world, ordinary people, with no prior experience in virtual currencies, have been lured into the virtual currency markets in recent weeks by the soaring prices of Bitcoin and its competitors.In Japan, small-time speculators have swarmed to Bitcoin since the government there essentially legalized the virtual currency earlier this year and gave licenses to several exchanges.But nowhere has the public frenzy been more feverish than in South Korea. It was on South Korean exchanges that the price of Bitcoin first hit $10,000 last Monday, hours before traders in the United States reached the same level of exuberance.These volumes are all the more remarkable because just a year ago virtual currency markets barely existed in Korea, unlike in the United States and China, where virtual currency trading has grown over a number of years.\u201cThis can lead to serious distortion or social pathological phenomena, if left unaddressed,\u201d he said in a statement after a cabinet meeting.Mr. Lee called on the Ministry of Justice and other agencies to take a closer look. South Korean regulators have already announced a ban on so-called initial coin offerings, in which entrepreneurs sell custom virtual currencies.But the exchanges where existing virtual currencies are traded come under essentially no regulatory oversight in South Korea, unlike in the United States and Japan.Mr. Lee said he was particularly worried about young people who have gotten caught up in the markets.\u201cThere are cases in which young Koreans including students are jumping in to make quick money and virtual currencies are used in illegal activities like drug dealing or multilevel marketing for frauds,\u201d he said.Virtual currencies are not the first speculative markets to take off among ordinary investors in South Korea. The country has some of the most active foreign currency markets for small-time investors, allowing people to trade between the won, dollar, euro and smaller currencies.Ha Tae-hyeong, a professor of economics at the University of Suwon, said that South Koreans have been drawn to speculative trading because of the lack of other high-yield investment options.\u201cPeople were looking for anything that would bring them higher return on investment,\u201d Mr. Ha said.Chung Gong-jin, a 16-year-old high school student, said he had been drawn to Bitcoin because it has gone up so quickly, and doesn\u2019t require the same amount of knowledge as stock investing.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I have to study so much to invest in Bitcoin \u2014 about the market or the economy, for example \u2014 that I need to do to invest in stocks,\u201d said Mr. Chung, who lives in a suburb of Seoul.Mr. Chung is part of a 100-person group that meets to talk about investments and attend virtual currency conferences.Even virtual currency enthusiasts in South Korea are concerned about the sudden rush into Bitcoin and Ether. They say investors are often getting in with little grasp of how virtual currencies work, like the decentralized network where all the transaction records are kept, or why they may be valuable over the long term.\u201cI do feel sorry to see so many people being shortsighted about Bitcoin, just trying to predict its price changes over short term to make quick money,\u201d said Kim Joon-young, a 28-year-old who runs a popular virtual currency Facebook group, Plan B.For now, the South Korean Bitcoin exchanges that have sprung up over the past year have done their best to stoke the excitement.Unlike in the United States and Japan, where exchanges are entirely online, a number of South Korean operations have set up store fronts where investors can come to buy in and learn more.Coinone, the second largest exchange in the country, opened a location in September in the financial district of Seoul, Yeouido, with an area for meetings, a help desk and virtual currency ATMs.One day last week, around lunch time, a group of about 35 students from Konyang University were visiting the Coinone office for an introductory class on virtual currency investing.Lee Jeong-min, a 39-year old social worker and author, was there to buy Ripple, a virtual currency that has been popular for cross-border bank transfers.Ms. Lee said she saw some of her conservative friends, including teachers and pharmacists, getting rich on Bitcoin and she didn\u2019t want to miss the next wave.\u201cI realized that I missed a bus, the Bitcoin bus, so that I can\u2019t hop on that bus anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t miss the next bus coming, can I?\u201dMs. Lee said she spent around 300,000 won, or around $275, on 900 Ripple.Mr. Choi, the 77-year-old former real estate agent, was also at Coinone, getting advice from the help desk on how to log in and invest from his home computer. He didn\u2019t trust his cellphone with the transactions.Like Ms. Lee, Mr. Choi felt it was too late to get in on Bitcoin. He is placing his big bet on the Ethereum network, and its Ether currency, which was designed to allow for a wider variety of transactions than Bitcoin.He said he knows he might lose money, but he was holding out hope.\u201cI might die tomorrow. I am an old man,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that hope keeps people going. Without dreams, there is nothing for a man. Hoping that things would get at least a little better is important.\u201dSu-hyun Lee reported from Seoul, South Korea and Nathaniel Popper reported in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "A Rainmaker Seeks to Grow His Firm at a Time of Big Media and Tech Deals", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive years ago, the investment banker Aryeh B. Bourkoff, on his own after having left UBS, hitched a ride on the private plane of the billionaire John C. Malone and pitched a deal: Now was the time for the mogul to get back into the telecommunications business.The vehicle was a small cable company named Charter Communications that had emerged from bankruptcy a few years earlier.Mr. Malone was intrigued by the possibility. And what started with a $2.6 billion investment into Charter has become a national cable empire that includes the former Time Warner Cable \u2014 and the promise of yet more deal-making, led in part by Mr. Bourkoff and his boutique bank, LionTree.But the question Mr. Bourkoff faces is whether he can transform his schmoozing into a business that can outlast him.\u201cAryeh is going to be involved or peripherally involved in everything that\u2019s going on,\u201d said Les Moonves, the chief of CBS.Mr. Bourkoff said he was ready to turn the moment to his advantage.\u201cIt\u2019s a fortunate thing that we happen to be at the right place at the right time,\u201d Mr. Bourkoff said in an interview in his Midtown Manhattan office. He added, \u201cThe entire firm today, based on what we see coming into the future, is keenly structured to play into that.\u201dStanding out among independent investment banks, many started in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, is difficult. Mr. Bourkoff and his team at LionTree are hoping that their focus on tech, media and telecom \u2014 as well as some untraditional features, including a publicly traded investment vehicle, a weekly newsletter and podcast \u2014 will lead to success.\u201cThe pitch was, \u2018help me build something fun and exciting,\u2019\u201d Mr. Donavan said in an interview. Referring to how Wall Street refers to tech, media and telecom, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s a unique time in the T.M.T. ecosystem.\u201dLionTree remains a relative minnow in the world of deal making. The 60-person firm has cracked the top 25 advisers on worldwide tech, media and telecom takeovers three times since its founding, according to Thomson Reuters. Its advisory business\u2019s best year to date was in 2015, when it ranked eighth, outpacing every other independent bank. Last year, it ranked 24th, behind firms like Evercore and Raine Group. (LionTree did not have a role in the Disney deal, even though other boutique banks were involved.)But the company, whose offices reflect a sort of sleekly modernized \u201cMad Men\u201d d\u00e9cor, match Mr. Bourkoff\u2019s vision for what his bank should look like.Few in the firm have formal titles, in what is meant to create a \u201cflat\u201d organization in which young bankers can feel free to propose transaction ideas. Much effort has been spent on data analysis and reaching out to young tech start-ups run by millennial founders.Yet at the center of LionTree remains Mr. Bourkoff. Mr. Malone \u2014 who controls the Liberty constellation of companies \u2014 called him the \u201choneybee\u201d of the T.M.T. world, flying from flower to flower cross-pollinating ideas.\u201cThe streets are littered with research analysts who tried to make the transition to investment banking, who thought they could leverage their relationships,\u201d Rob Wiesenthal, once the chief financial officer of Sony Music and now the chief of Blade, the helicopter-ride start-up, said. \u201cAryeh is one of the only ones who has successfully done that.\u201dKen Lerer, a co-founder of HuffPost and now a Viacom board member, credited Mr. Bourkoff with helping to resolve an impasse over the makeup of Viacom\u2019s board involving Shari Redstone, the daughter of its chairman.\u201cIt was a deal that wasn\u2019t getting done otherwise,\u201d Mr. Lerer said.Among LionTree\u2019s most prized clients is Liberty and Mr. Malone, who have retained the firm on numerous assignments.\u201cWhen people ask me, \u2018Who should I use,\u2019 he\u2019s sort of the top of my list as an adviser,\u201d Mr. Malone said in an interview.But changing the perception that LionTree centers solely around Mr. Bourkoff may be difficult. \u201cThis is the Aryeh show,\u201d Mr. Wiesenthal said. \u201cThis is not the LionTree show.\u201dMr. Bourkoff is working to alter that view.

Immediate expensing will have a big impact. Biggest Tax Cuts and Reform EVER passed. Enjoy, and create many beautiful JOBS!Other presidents have occasionally talked about market booms, but often avoided saying anything that could move markets, particularly on individual company stocks. More commonly, they have talked about unemployment numbers, housing starts and other indicators that are less sensitive to market forces.Mr. Trump has ignored those conventions, with relish.\u201cI think that in some sense, he might be responsible for the show he is putting on for some of the increase in stock prices, but I don\u2019t think it is rational,\u201d said Robert J. Shiller, a Yale University economist and a 2013 Nobel laureate.Mr. Shiller said the president has \u201clegitimized\u201d the mood that \u201cthe market might continue to go up and up.\u201dThe peril for Mr. Trump is that market cycles invariably have downturns, too, sometimes significant ones, and claiming credit for the rise could also mean owning the fall.\u201cI liken him to Calvin Coolidge, a pro-business president who kept constantly trying to boost the stock market,\u201d Mr. Shiller said. \u201cHe was president until 1929 and then it started to crumble.\u201dStock markets have been rising essentially since March 2009, when the global financial crisis was near its worst. The stock markets are now in the second-longest bull run in history, trailing only the rally that lasted from 1987 until 2000.\u201cThere is no doubt that the promise of a big corporate tax cut and rampant deregulation have had some effect on the markets,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s also a fake measure of the rooster taking credit for the dawn, as the economy here and globally were steadily improving when he arrived.\u201dConsumer confidence is also on the rise, which helps to add to an overall pro-market investment psychology.\u201cThe market is not the economy,\u201d said Dean Baker, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. \u201cThe market is a measure of future profitability.\u201dThat is a compelling statement \u2014 as long as the market climbs. But even the longest bull markets have eventually come to an end.\u201cIf you want to say everything on a market going up is to your credit, it would seem to follow that if it goes down, it is to your blame,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on that in this case.\u201dPresident Bill Clinton also benefited from a stock market surge in the late 1990s, but within the White House, there was concern about aligning too closely with the gains.Paul Begala, a former adviser to Mr. Clinton, said that the Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, \u201cused to tell me that the thing about stocks is that they go down as well as up, so he never wanted President Clinton to associate himself too closely to the stock market.\u201d\u201cWe felt like jobs and wages were what we should focus on, as well as the deficit,\u201d he said.The president\u2019s rating hit that level \u201cwith a roaring stock market,\u201d Mr. Begala said. \u201cWhere do you think he will be when there\u2019s a correction?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Austria Gas Explosion Leaves One Dead and 18 Injured", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn enormous explosion rocked a major natural gas hub in Austria on Tuesday, killing an employee, injuring at least 18 people and raising concerns about tightening supplies across Europe.Firefighters and emergency workers rushed to the natural gas hub in Baumgarten an der March, about 25 miles east of Vienna, after the blast occurred just before 9 a.m., ordering an evacuation of the site. The fire was brought under control within hours, the state police in Lower Austria said.Johanna Mikl-Leitner, the governor of Lower Austria, which includes Baumgarten, ordered the local authorities to investigate the cause of the explosion. Gas Connect Austria, which operates the facility, said the cause appeared to be technical.The Baumgarten station, Austria\u2019s largest entry point for natural gas, receives the product from Russia and Norway for inspection and compression, and then sends it to Austrian and other pipelines. Baumgarten operations were suspended after the explosion.Natural gas flows to Austria remain secure, Gas Connect Austria said after the blast, but the company warned that flows to other countries could be disrupted.\u201cThe biggest implications are for the Italian market,\u201d said Trevor Sikorski, who leads natural gas research at Energy Aspects in London.While Italy has large amounts of gas in storage, he said, a prolonged outage would reduce stocks and set the stage for higher prices this winter.As is customary in such cases, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development declared a state of emergency on Tuesday to guarantee gas supplies, adding that it was monitoring the situation.\u201cThe supply of gas to Italian consumers is assured because the shortage is covered by a greater supply of gas from the national underground gas reserves,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.The Italian energy company Eni said in a statement on Tuesday that the Baumgarten gas hub provided 30 percent of Italian gas. The state of emergency seeks to facilitate gas imports, particularly from northern Europe, Libya and Algeria.Natural gas prices were volatile on Tuesday, rising about 6 percent on the TTF hub in the Netherlands.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the natural gas hub rocked by an explosion. The hub is in Baumgarten an der March, roughly 25 miles east of Vienna, not in Baumgarten, about 45 miles south of Vienna.Stanley Reed, Elisabetta Povoledo and Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How the media landscape has changed.Procter & Gamble has appointed the activist investor Nelson Peltz to its board following a certified recount of shareholder votes cast at its annual meeting in October, Reuters reported.At its annual shareholder meeting two months ago, Procter & Gamble said its preliminary count of proxy votes showed that it had fended off an effort by Mr. Peltz to win a seat on its board. But last month, Trian Fund Management, the investment firm controlled by Mr. Peltz, announced that a vote count by the independent inspector of elections showed that he had, in fact, been elected.Procter & Gamble waited to make Mr. Peltz a director while it looked into the election results from the independent election inspector IVS Associates.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said Friday he would vote yes after winning a more generous child tax credit in the final bill and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who voted against the initial Senate bill over deficit concerns, said he would support the legislation despite the cost of the tax cuts.The markets, which have risen and fallen with the fate of the tax bill in recent weeks, rose Friday as passage looked more certain.\u2022 The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq closed at records.\u2022 The Russell 2000 jumped 1.6 percent, its best day since Nov. 16, according to Bloomberg.\u2022 The dollar rose for the ninth time in 10 sessions.Jared Kushner\u2019s legal team is looking for a crisis public relations firm.In a statement to the Post, Mr. Lowell \u201cconfirmed he was looking for a firm that would handle media for all high-profile clients that receive attention from the press.\u201d\u201cMy law firm and I are considering hiring an outside consultant to handle the time-consuming incoming inquiries on the cases in which I am working that receive media attention. This inquiry from you about whether I am doing this is a good example of why we need one.\u201dThe question is whether any of usual suspects among Wall Street\u2019s crisis management world will take this on? Here are some of the firms:Joele FrankBrunswick GroupAbernathy MacGregorSard VerbinnenGladstone Place PartnersRubensteinAnd it seems they got it.Mr. Rubio, in a tweet on Friday, called it \u201ca solid step\u201d and suggested he would now vote for the bill.Here are the details from The New York Times\u2019s Jim Tankersley and Thomas Kaplan report.The change intended to shore up Mr. Rubio\u2019s support would allow 70 percent of the $2,000 per-child tax credit to be refundable, up from 55 percent in the original draft of the bill, according to lawmakers and those briefed on the change. The change would allow families with no tax liability to claim up to $1,400 in tax refunds per child, up from $1,100 in the version that passed the Senate earlier this month.The news pushed stocks higher Friday on optimism the tax legislation would be enacted. Stocks have risen and fallen in recent weeks on the prospects for the tax bill.On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index were up 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. The Russell 2000 index is up 1.5 percent in recent trading. The index is made up of small-cap stocks, which typically have a higher effective tax rate than their larger brethren. For that reason, the index has been particularly sensitive to the likelihood the tax bill will pass.With Disney\u2019s bid for a large portion of 21st Century Fox, four of the five biggest deals have been announced in the past three years.

Here\u2019s a look at the biggest telecom, cable, and media companies then and now as well as the tech firms they are up against.Here\u2019s what Mr. Murdoch told analysts on a call yesterday:I know a lot of you are wondering, \u201cWhy did the Murdochs come to such a momentous decision?\u201d Are we retreating?

{"Headline": "Why Are Mutual Fund Fees So High? This Billionaire Knows", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe billionaire investor Ronald S. Baron flashed the grin of a proud father at his annual investor jamboree in November, as the chief executives of his favorite companies explained how slashing prices stoked their bottom lines.That is, until a shareholder in one of his mutual funds drew an awkward parallel.\u201cExcuse me \u2014 Schwab is charging a very low fee,\u201d a woman pointed out, after a presentation by Walter W. Bettinger II, the chief executive of the discount broker Charles Schwab. \u201cGod bless him, but no one ever said Baron\u2019s fees are little.\u201dYou can say that again.Mr. Baron\u2019s mutual funds charge some of the higher investment fees around, and the fees have held steady despite a $1 trillion exodus out of old-school mutual funds into cheaper, better performing rivals that track a variety of indexes and investment styles.In a global economy where competition and Amazonian price destruction have forced companies to cater to cost-wary customers, the mutual fund industry is a rare outlier. Fees on most actively managed mutual funds, which house the retirement savings and other assets of millions of Americans, have barely budged.The reasons for that \u2014 quiescent mutual fund boards, complacent investors and a general unwillingness to call a halt to one of the great gravy trains in financial history \u2014 are all visible inside Mr. Baron\u2019s fund family.The Baron Funds group manages $26.4 billion in assets on behalf of hundreds of thousands of small and large investors. An old-fashioned stock picker, Mr. Baron achieved renown in the 1990s and the 2000s for successfully betting on small companies.But his performance has suffered in recent years. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, his flagship fund, Baron Growth, trailed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index by an average of seven percentage points.This year, the results have been better: He is up 27 percent, compared with 20 percent for the S. & P.The 13 Baron funds impose fees that were 54 percent higher than last year\u2019s industry average \u2014 and vastly higher than what a comparable exchange-traded fund would charge.In November, Baron reduced fees on three of its smaller funds. But the largest, Baron Growth, with $6.3 billion in assets, still charges 1.3 percent of assets. That is a third higher than the median level for similar funds, according to Morningstar.Since 2010, investors have withdrawn, in net terms, just over $5 billion from the growth fund, according to Morningstar. But many have stuck around.Mr. Baron, 74, is perhaps best known for his annual investment conference, now held at the Metropolitan Opera House at New York\u2019s Lincoln Center and in its 26th year. Mixing rock stars, pop entertainment (Barbra Streisand and Paul McCartney have performed in the past), patriotism (this year celebrated the 100th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s birth) and triumphant chief executives, the gala is a giddy ode to American capitalism.Few fund companies offer a comparable perk, and some 5,000 Baron fund holders travel to New York to attend.At the conference in November, with markets hitting new highs each day, investors were exultant. But there was a lingering concern.\u201cThe fees are very high,\u201d one man said to a friend as they exited the Chris Rock comedy show. \u201cYou really have to have the market go up to do well.\u201dEven longtime fans acknowledge they are paying up.\u201cI won\u2019t say performance warrants the fees they charge,\u201d said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. \u201cBut I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.\u201dWhen the shareholder asked Mr. Baron why his rates were so much higher than Schwab\u2019s, the audience response was telling: The opera hall erupted in sympathetic laughter \u2014 and applause.Mr. Baron has been getting flak for his funds\u2019 high costs for years.Mr. Baron is unapologetic about the high fees. He argues that his skills and experience \u2014 and the arduous task of researching small growth companies \u2014 justify the fees.\u201cSince inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.\u201dBut if you want to bet on American growth stocks, \u201cyou can double your money in 10 years,\u201d he said. He frequently sticks with his top picks for decades.While this year has been stellar, over a longer stretch his performance is less robust.Mr. Baron believes that the true measure of his success is performance since his fund\u2019s launch in 1994. A $10,000 investment in his main fund then would be worth $163,207 today, according to Baron data. That compares with $57,889 for the Russell growth index and $84,904 for the S. & P. 500, per Baron.Mr. Baron\u2019s funds are not the only ones refusing to budge on fees. In fact, the average fee for 2,000 actively managed mutual funds has remained 0.84 percent of total assets for the past three years, according to Morningstar.Some, like the Capital Group and Fidelity, have gotten the message and have reduced their fees over this period.Industry experts say there are several reasons that active mutual fund fees have not succumbed to broader pricing trends in the economy.The first is their power. While more than $1 trillion has left higher-fee funds in favor of passive competitors, that still leaves some $10 trillion. That generates about $100 billion in fees for fund companies. And it suggests they don\u2019t need to cut fees to retain assets.It\u2019s dizzyingly complicated for investors to figure out what fees they\u2019re paying. With funds\u2019 multiple share classes, varying structures and oceans of boilerplate, even sophisticated investors may not realize they are paying up for a laggard.Another reason for elevated fees, experts say, is lax oversight.Every mutual fund is overseen by a board of trustees \u2014 a mix of executives from the fund company and mostly independent officers that must, by law, look out for investors\u2019 interests.But are these boards truly effective advocates for investors?A number of lawsuits brought against major investment companies, including Axa, BlackRock and Pimco, allege that trustees are not pushing hard enough for lower fees. The judge overseeing the BlackRock case in 2015 declined to dismiss the suit, saying the allegations raised questions about \u201crubber stamping\u201d by boards.BlackRock has said the suit lacks merit.At the Baron fund family, the fee oversight is complicated by the fact that Mr. Baron, the largest shareholder in the investment company and the manager of its largest fund, has a financial incentive to keep fees high. In addition to his salary and bonus, tied to performance among other measures, he gets a reward based on a percentage of the fees his funds bring in, according to regulatory filings.That is unusual. At most fund companies, compensation packages reward managers for beating their benchmarks \u2014 not collecting fees.While the average age for independent mutual fund directors is 66, some directors stay on boards into their 80s and even 90s. Such long tenures often make directors weak voices for investors, he said.Baron funds are overseen by nine directors. Seven are listed as independent. Four of those seven have served as trustees since Mr. Baron established his first funds 30 years ago.One of them, David A. Silverman, has zero financial experience: He is a doctor with an expertise in infectious diseases.The lead independent trustee, Raymond Noveck, worked as a managing director at Baron from 1985 to 1987.\u201cTrustees have very little incentive to fight managers,\u201d Mr. Birdthistle said. \u201cKicking and scratching is unlikely to lower fees but certainly will antagonize the manager, which is the one institution that can arrange for the trustees\u2019 dismissal. Besides, trustees will tell themselves, if a fund\u2019s fees really are too high, the market will sort things out and investors simply won\u2019t invest in the fund.\u201dThe board has taken steps to recruit trustees with bulkier backgrounds, most recently Tom Folliard, a former chief executive of CarMax.In a statement, Baron Funds said that it regularly assessed its board\u2019s effectiveness and that the long tenure of some members was a sign of the board\u2019s experience and expertise. It said fees were approved via data and analysis from an outside party. The board also said it was represented by an independent lawyer.One clear winner of this arrangement is Mr. Baron. \u201cIn 1970, my net worth was minus $15,000,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cNow my children and I have over $670 million invested in our funds.\u201dForbes pegs his wealth at just over $2 billion \u2014 and he is not shy about showing it off.His office in Manhattan\u2019s General Motors Building is a museum of trophies and curiosities, from paintings by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein to Kennedy\u2019s rocking chair. He has invested about $150 million in a 59-acre beachfront estate in East Hampton, N.Y., that he bought in 2007.Mr. Baron\u2019s investment philosophy \u2014 that over the long term the stocks that he picks will keep doubling \u2014 is fired by a relentless optimism that he attributes to his life\u2019s good fortune.A grandchild of immigrants from Poland and Russia, Mr. Baron grew up scraping for extra cash in Asbury Park, N.J. He worked his way through college and law school, which he left without getting a degree.In 1982, after a stint as a Wall Street analyst, he founded his investment firm.His timing was perfect. It was the start of a bull market, and he developed an expertise in picking small companies that would grow into big ones such as Charles Schwab, Vail Management Company and Tesla.It was the heyday of the individual stock picker. Peter Lynch at Fidelity and Bill Miller at Legg Mason gained cultlike followings, accumulating billions of dollars in assets and gracing the covers of the personal finance magazines that lionized them.Mr. Baron\u2019s star power was of a lesser variety, but it was not insubstantial. He became a regular television commentator and won a reputation as the longest of long-term investors, holding positions for decades. His assets peaked at $28 billion in 2015.\u201cWe have made $23.6 billion for our clients,\u201d Mr. Baron said.But it is his annual investor gala, which he pays for himself, that defines him. Onstage, he cultivates a grandfatherly mien, bragging about how much money the chief executives of his portfolio companies made for Baron shareholders. His chief maxim is \u201cWe invest in people,\u201d and he treats management as family.There are warm bear hugs onstage for some. Others get personal advice.Spotting a top executive from the data firm FactSet, another portfolio holding, he offered to connect her with his longtime tax lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what he has done,\u201d Mr. Baron said.A surprise raffle is part of the atmospherics, and this time a Model 3 from Tesla was the grand prize. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill performed.As the event ended, attendees streamed out of Lincoln Center into a freezing evening. Mr. Baron, without a coat, greeted them on the plaza. He hugged and kissed old friends and posed for selfies with new ones.Nobody complained about the fees.An earlier version of this article misstated how the iShares Russell 2000 Growth fund performed over a five-year period. It is up 15 percent, not 96 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coinbase: The Heart of the Bitcoin Frenzy", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The booming stock market of the 1920s had the New York Stock Exchange. The tech bubble of the 1990s had Nasdaq and E-Trade. And the virtual currency market of the last year has had Coinbase. The company faces challenges that are a reminder of the early days of now-mainstream online brokerages, which suffered through untimely outages and harsh criticism from traditional finance companies and government regulators. And Coinbase\u2019s missteps make it clear that the virtual currency industry is still young, with little of the battle testing that other financial markets have faced.Recently, every last inch of space has been pressed into action. The day after Bitcoin hit $10,000 last week, a training session for Coinbase managers was moved to the game room because the engineering team needed to set up an emergency war room in the regular conference room. The engineering team was trying to get Coinbase back up after the company\u2019s site was knocked offline, overwhelmed by a wave of incoming traffic. The number of visitors was double what it had been during the previous peak \u2014 two days earlier \u2014 and eight times what it had been in June, the peak until recently. All of the big Bitcoin exchanges went down for at least part of the day, and Coinbase got back online faster than most. Still, any sort of downtime like that would be unacceptable in more traditional exchanges where stocks and commodities are traded. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a little bit too focused on the price or people trying to make money,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said last week. \u201cThe thing I\u2019m passionate about with digital currency is the world having an open financial system.\u201d In addition to the brokerage service for small investors, Coinbase also runs an exchange, called GDAX, tailored to larger investors. GDAX is overseen by Adam White, a former Air Force officer and a graduate of Harvard Business School. The day Bitcoin hit $10,000, he was in New York speaking with big financial institutions that are looking into Bitcoin. Some companies are getting ready to begin trading Bitcoin futures contracts in December, when that activity becomes available on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A year ago, his Wall Street outreach was difficult, but \u201cit\u2019s all inbound now,\u201d Mr. White said. Not surprisingly, Coinbase is on a building spree. It recently leased office space in New York that will handle the Wall Street business and a new service that holds virtual currencies for large customers. In San Francisco, the company is adding two new floors in the building where it now has one. Coinbase is trying to be more responsive. At the beginning of the year, the company had 24 employees providing customer support. It now has around 180, with most of them outsourced from a call center in Texas and an email response team in the Philippines. The cafeteria is often turned into a \u201cCrypto Club\u201d where new employees are taught the ins and outs of virtual currency. Daniel Romero, the general manager of Coinbase, said he wanted to have 400 customer support employees by the first quarter of next year to provide phone support around the clock. But in the meantime, there is a 10-day backlog of service requests.\u201cWhen your customer support issues are that publicly bad, and you have your site go down when people want to be trading,\u201d it\u2019s a very humbling experience, Mr. Romero said. A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified where Coinbase employees were gathered for lunch. It was the company's gaming room, not the cafeteria.Advertisement"}
