{"Headline": "In a Bowie Oral History, a Glimpse of How Others Saw the Faker", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionAn oral history of David Bowie is almost an act of redundancy. His whole career was an exercise in fragmentation and disconnection, a hodgepodge of widely varied aesthetic propositions and provisional identities that any hundred people could take a hundred different ways. \u201cHe gave you what you wanted,\u201d the journalist Angus MacKinnon recalled to the pop-culture writer and editor Dylan Jones for \u201cDavid Bowie: A Life,\u201d the first major book about Bowie to be published since his death in January 2016. \u201cIf you were in shades and tight black leather trousers he would give you the rock and roll interview, and if you were me, wearing drainpipe cords and a tweed jacket and the air of the rock pseudo-intellectual about you, he would give you that. \u2026 It must have been exhausting to be David Bowie.\u201d\u201cDavid Bowie: A Life\u201d brings together excerpts from interviews with some 200 people who knew Bowie \u2014 or believed or suspected or imagined things about him, having been granted temporary access to parts of the many personas Bowie parceled out over more than 50 years as a performer. The author, a longtime Bowie watcher who interviewed his subject on multiple occasions and wrote an earlier book about him, \u201cWhen Ziggy Played Guitar,\u201d has the cred necessary to land most of the key players in Bowie\u2019s life, from Peter Frampton, one of Bowie\u2019s childhood friends, to Iman, Bowie\u2019s widow. The book delivers expert and entertaining testimony from Tony Visconti, the producer who worked extensively with Bowie from his early years to his last recordings; Brian Eno, the composer and producer who collaborated with Bowie on the trilogy of albums (\u201cLow,\u201d \u201c\u2018Heroes\u2019\u201d and \u201cLodger\u201d) that are among his most highly regarded; Elton John, who goes through no effort to disguise his displeasure with his onetime colleague in the making of space-oriented, sexually transgressive pop; the guitarists Mick Ronson and Carlos Alomar; Coco Schwab, Bowie\u2019s longtime personal assistant and protector; and others such as the actress/publicist Cherry Vanilla and the singer Ava Cherry, who, along with countless other women (and perhaps some, if not as many, men), had affairs (or just sex) with Bowie.Organized chronologically with interstitial text by Jones to fill in biographical data and provide some context here and there, the book covers Bowie\u2019s life from his middle-class upbringing in Brixton, in South London, and then Kent, on the city\u2019s outskirts, to his final years of low-key, nearly anonymous life with his wife and their young daughter in Lower Manhattan. Raised by a cinema-usher mother and a public-relations-executive father, David Jones grows up with a taste for Hollywood glamour and a sense of the power of hoopla. Longtime Bowie followers will have read elsewhere about this, as well as the family history of mental illness that affected at least two of his maternal aunts (Bowie sometimes claimed all three of his mother\u2019s sisters committed suicide, but the book is more circumspect) and his older half brother, Terry, who was understood to be schizophrenic and was institutionalized for a time.Bowie would talk of his brother sparingly, but with affectionate gratitude, acknowledging Terry for introducing him to Beat literature and jazz, the emblems of American cool for postwar youth everywhere. As Jones quotes Bowie: \u201cI guess most of us have battled with reality and something else all of our lives. I think Terry probably gave me the greatest, serviceable education that I ever could have had. He just introduced me to the outside things.\u201dThe dynamics between the real and the imagined, facts and artifice, the \u201ctrue\u201d self and performance \u2014 the great themes of David Bowie\u2019s work \u2014 provide the otherwise scattershot materials of \u201cDavid Bowie: A Life\u201d with a semblance of continuity. In a charming recollection of Bowie\u2019s childhood, his old friend George Underwood describes Bowie\u2019s father taking the two boys to a public appearance by Duncan Renaldo, a B-movie actor who played in kiddie cowboy adventures as \u201cthe Cisco Kid.\u201d Renaldo was accompanied by Leo Carrillo, who portrayed the comic sidekick Pancho on screen. \u201cAfter we\u2019d chatted to the Cisco Kid for a while,\u201d Underwood recalls, Carrillo \u201cleaned in and whispered to us, and, in a strong Mexican accent, said, \u2018He is the real Cisco Kid.\u2019 We all thought he was a fictional character, but it stuck with us.\u201dAfter a conventional pop-music apprenticeship, trying out rock, blues and folk-rock in bands with interchangeable names like the King Bees, the Night Timers and the Lower Third, David Jones took up the surname Bowie to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees. He escaped association with a made-for-TV act tainted by its fakeness, and proceeded to implode the whole paradigm of authenticity in rock by glorying in a radically plastic, sexually indefinite persona that was essentially a kind of anti-persona \u2014 less an image than a capacity to accommodate any identity at will. A genuinely transformative figure, Bowie changed the way people thought about rock stardom by abandoning everything but change itself.\u201cHe didn\u2019t like being comfortable,\u201d Carlos Alomar points out. \u201cComfortable is genre-driven, and be careful, because it will outlive you and it will surpass you. David had a lovely saying, \u2018Let go, or be dragged.\u2019 \u2026 It was change, change, change. Bryan Ferry would introduce something and stay there. David would introduce something and leave it.\u201dAngus MacKinnon attributes Bowie\u2019s restlessness as an artist to basic insecurity. There\u2019s no knowing the truth in such conjecture, of course. But this is oral history in which amateur pathology runs as freely as insight, tale-telling and gossip. \u201cHis self-analysis was lacerating,\u201d MacKinnon asserts. \u201cHe talked a lot about his sense of self, and one of the things that came across, and this was not false modesty, was his constant anxiety that what he was doing wasn\u2019t quite interesting enough. Here was a person who seriously pushed himself, and constantly re-evaluated his contribution, and he found himself lacking. Blessing and curse.\u201dGossip is surely plentiful in \u201cDavid Bowie: A Life.\u201d Wendy Leigh, a Bowie biographer quoted here, says Bowie\u2019s early manager Ken Pitt was \u201cmadly in love\u201d with his client, \u201cand David used that.\u201d Simon Napier-Bell, an artists\u2019 manager in the \u201960s, was introduced to Bowie while he was still unknown and told by another manager, Ralph Horton, that if he agreed to co-manage Bowie, he \u201ccould have sex with him.\u201dThe book has lots of sex \u2014 lots and lots and lots of sex \u2014 though there\u2019s no reason to believe the subject is overrepresented. Cyrinda Foxe, a groupie, recalls being summoned into Bowie\u2019s bedroom while he was having sex with another woman, because \u201che needed someone to talk to.\u201d At other times, Foxe would be in bed with Bowie herself while, in the next room, Bowie\u2019s wife, Angie, would be in bed with someone else. Like that.A welcome surprise of \u201cDavid Bowie: A Life\u201d is its strength on the essential subject of music making. There are multiple accounts of the speed and professionalism of Bowie\u2019s work in the recording studio, and an illuminating explanation of his cut-and-paste method of writing lyrics \u2014 a system for sustaining the elusiveness at the heart of Bowie\u2019s songs that has something in common with the way this fragmentary, disjointed oral history is constructed. As biography, this \u201cLife\u201d is an imperfect one. It\u2019s erratic, at once bloated and too thin, and sometimes hard to parse, with passing references to names and events that could use a bit of explanation. That is to say, it suits its subject perfectly.David Hajdu is the author, most recently, of \u201cLove for Sale: Pop Music in America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Microsoft\u2019s highest closing value in 1999, when translated into today\u2019s dollars, was roughly $901 billion.Apple\u2019s value has been rising for quite some time. Earlier in this decade, Apple passed Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company in the contemporary stock market.To put its current size in context, Apple is worth more than the entire G.D.P. of Turkey.But Apple\u2019s dominance is not just a question of inflation. Using another metric \u2014 Apple\u2019s weight in the current stock market \u2014 IBM and AT&T, in their halcyon days, were far more dominant than Apple is today.No surprise: When the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, Apple is the largest company on the list by a large margin, followed by Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Microsoft. In this list, all three hit their high point in November. Apple has been moving above and below its pinnacle since then, and its value was just above $895 billion at the close of trading Wednesday.The list is basically split between the hot markets of the last 25 years: the current one, which started in March 2009, and the stock market surge associated with the dot-com era and its aftermath. General Electric was in fourth place over all, based on its $594 billion market cap in August 2000. Companies like Intel, Cisco and Oracle appear on the all-time list, too.When you adjust for inflation, the ranking changes.Highest market capitalization adjustedfor inflation, as of Nov. 30PEAK1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.AppleMicrosoftG.E.Cisco SystemsIntelAlphabet (Google)Exxon MobilAmazonBerkshire HathawayWalmartPfizerFacebookCitigroupAT&T (old)Johnson & JohnsonLucent TechnologiesOracleIBMJPMorgan ChaseA.I.G.$903901848755716688623576478454440437402389385378371370365340billionNov. 2017Dec. 1999Aug. 2000March 2000Aug. 2000Nov. 2017July 2007Nov. 2017Nov. 2017Dec. 1999July 2000Nov. 2017Feb. 2001March 2000Oct. 2017Dec. 1999Sept. 2000July 1999Nov. 2017Dec. 2000Highest market capitalization adjustedfor inflation, as of Nov. 30PEAKAppleMicrosoftG.E.Cisco SystemsIntelAlphabet (Google)Exxon MobilAmazonBerkshire HathawayWalmartPfizerFacebookCitigroupAT&T (old)Johnson & JohnsonLucent TechnologiesOracleIBMJPMorgan ChaseA.I.G.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.$903901848755716688623576478454440437402389385378371370365340billionNov. 2017Dec. 1999Aug. 2000March 2000Aug. 2000Nov. 2017July 2007Nov. 2017Nov. 2017Dec. 1999July 2000Nov. 2017Feb. 2001March 2000Oct. 2017Dec. 1999Sept. 2000July 1999Nov. 2017Dec. 2000Apple\u2019s margin in first place is dramatically reduced.In December 1999, Microsoft\u2019s market cap was $647 billion. That would have been enough to place it in third place, without taking inflation into account.But over extended periods, the compounding effects of inflation are powerful. That $647 billion translates into a nearly 40 percent increase in value in November 2017 dollars. It has probably gained slightly more since November, because inflation has remained positive.General Electric has been shrinking lately as it restructures. But in inflation-adjusted terms, its August 2000 market cap is still growing and it moved up one spot on the list, to third place. Cisco and Intel moved into fourth and fifth place, based on their soaring shares during the dot-com boom.Even more than the first list, the inflation-adjusted ranking provides a reminder of the stock market highs during these two exuberant periods \u2014 the dot-com era in 1999 and 2000, and the bull market that is still underway.Seven of the all-time biggest companies reached their peaks in October or November, the most current data in this ranking, and 12 of the companies did so from late 1999 to early 2001.Exxon Mobil is the only company to have achieved a top-20 market cap unaided by the momentum of one of these rising stock market eras. In inflation-adjusted terms, Exxon\u2019s peak occurred in July 2007, several months before its pinnacle in nominal 2007 dollars.Share of the total market since 1980 NO.

Using this metric, Apple in late 2017 does not tower over the rest of the stock market as much as many other companies did in previous eras.In fact, although Apple\u2019s market cap is far higher today than it was five years ago, Apple shares represented a larger share of the total stock market in September 2012 than they do now.The Apple of 2017 does not show up at all in either of the two Top 20 lists that Mr. Poukchanski produced, one starting in 1980 and one going all the way back to 1925.In December 1985, IBM\u2019s shares constituted 4.4 percent of the entire stock market, a higher percentage than any other company since 1980.That is a very high figure, given the enormous expanse of the universe covered by the Center for Research database, which included 6,225 stocks for December 1985. (By contrast, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has, as you might imagine, 500 stocks; the Dow Jones industrial average has 30.)In November, Apple\u2019s shares constituted only 2.5 percent of the overall stock market. In September 2012, they reached 3.2 percent of the total market, far more than today.In other words, many other stocks have become giants in the 2017 market: Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook and more.

In March 1928, General Motors accounted for 8 percent of the stock market. And in 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8 percent of the market of that day.One explanation for the outsize status of these companies in earlier times is that the stock market itself was much smaller: 6,715 listings in November compared with only 704 in May 1932 and 584 in March 1928. It was easier to be a big fish in those smaller ponds.That said, at the end of 1985, when IBM\u2019s market cap was far larger than any other company\u2019s, there were 6,225 publicly traded stocks in the market, nearly as many as today. So the size of the stock market isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation:  Companies like IBM and AT&T simply were more dominant than Apple is now.For example, the old AT&T was so big that Standard & Poor\u2019s excluded it from a predecessor to the S.&P. 500-stock index \u201cbecause S.&P. did not want to let the performance of such a large firm dominate the index,\u201d as Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in his book, \u201cStocks for the Long Run.\u201dConsidered a monopoly, the old AT&T was forcibly broken up in 1984. (A descendent of the company is embroiled in antitrust issues of its own, arising from its proposed merger with Time Warner).But a 1935 law during President Roosevelt\u2019s administration called for the abolition of such holding companies. After a lengthy court fight, U.G.I. transformed itself into a much smaller entity. On the list of the most dominant companies, it is an artifact of a bygone era.These questions may seem strange today, and those who are so inclined may celebrate as Apple sets new stock market records. But it is worth recalling that other companies played monumental roles in the stock market, until their day was done.Notes: All data as of Nov. 30, 2017.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Thirst for Cheap Labor Fuels a Boom in Disposable Workers", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost of the workers had been recruited from Romania, Bulgaria and other Central European countries by a large employment agency. When their contracts are up, they will be sent home, with another group of migrant workers brought in as required \u2014 replaceable cogs in a tireless machine.Across Europe, nearly 55,000 agencies recruit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers each year for cheap manual labor and service jobs. The agencies allow employers to tap into a more flexible work force \u2014 and avoid some of the region\u2019s more onerous labor costs.For companies, the challenges of hiring low-cost workers are growing: An economic recovery is shrinking the pool of cheap labor that initially attracted Foxconn and others to Europe. Employment agencies like Xawax, which finds workers for the Foxconn and Panasonic factories, are an important conduit.For migrant workers, the choice is difficult. Those from poorer European countries are eager to find better paying jobs. But the agencies sometimes operate in a gray area: requiring workers to sign contracts in foreign languages, and saddling them with conditions and pay that few in-country nationals would accept.Nearly a dozen workers at the Pardubice plants, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, said they had possessed little understanding that the contracts they had signed would expose them to frequent overtime shifts, including nights and weekends, while leaving them constantly on call. The Czech government is conducting an inquiry into Foxconn\u2019s employment practices.One Romanian couple were jobless until they saw a Xawax ad on Facebook this summer.The couple, ages 23 and 24, said a recruiter had promised free lodging, regular shifts and wages on par with Czech factory workers \u2014 at least \u20ac585 a month \u2014 better than what they could get in Romania. They boarded a bus packed with other recruits bound for Pardubice. There, they signed a six-month employment contract with Xawax that was written in Czech, a language they couldn\u2019t comprehend, without a translator present.At 5:30 the next morning, they were transported to the Panasonic factory to join more than a hundred laborers in a cavernous hall assembling electronic components. The couple said Xawax had soon told them that they would have to frequently work overtime or receive bonuses just to get their promised wage. The terms were included in the contract they could not understand. After the woman got sick at work and fainted one evening, requiring her to be rushed to a hospital, she received little help from the agency in organizing follow-up treatment, she said.\u201cThe agencies have a lot of power over these people,\u201d she said.In a statement, Foxconn Technology Group said it and the agencies that recruited on its behalf had ensured workers received wages and benefits above the Czech Republic\u2019s basic requirements. Foxconn added that its operations were regularly audited, and that it complied with relevant local laws and regulations.Panasonic said that it relied on agencies like Xawax to recruit workers amid a tight labor market and that both parties complied with Czech labor law. In a statement, the company added that migrant workers, who hold agency contracts, did not work beyond the legal workweek and were paid above the Czech minimum wage.Pardubice became a low-cost manufacturing hub after the fall of Communism.It managed to attract Foxconn in 2000 after the Czech government gave the company a 10-year investment tax break. Foxconn quickly energized the region, buying a mothballed electronics factory and hiring thousands of workers. Restaurants, clothing stores and other businesses soon sprang up to cater to the growing population.Agencies like Xawax are a powerful tool for Foxconn and other manufacturers to juice productivity and manage costs.The Taiwanese company has assembled electronics for HP, Dell and Cisco, using recruitment agencies to expand or shrink its labor force around production cycles. At its peak, about half of a nearly 10,000-person work force were temporary workers; today, the company said, there are 4,000 workers, of which 20 percent to 30 percent are temps.The agencies give Foxconn and other companies another advantage: The workers aren\u2019t technically employed by Foxconn. The setup transfers legal and other responsibilities, including the risk of potential labor violations, to the agency.In the concrete dorms, which are managed by Xawax and other agencies, workers from Romania, Slovakia and elsewhere filed in from an afternoon shift and cooked a modest meal in a threadbare communal kitchen. They were tired, but neither the heat nor the hot water was working. One grumbled that he had lost pay after he injured his arm on the assembly line. Still, the workers said, they needed the money.Here in the Czech Republic, the authorities have been looking into Foxconn\u2019s labor practices, though Jiri Vanasek, the deputy labor minister, acknowledged it can be hard to prove wrongdoing. The government is also scrutinizing the country\u2019s many employment agencies. It recently imposed a registration fee to discourage attempts by agencies to change their names frequently to avoid putting workers in full-time jobs once temporary contracts have expired, and to clamp down on fly-by-night operators.Hana de Goeij contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Alabama\u2019s Election Could Reshape Washington\u2019s Policy Battles: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re following today:\u2022 What\u2019s at stake in Alabama\u2022 Will Republicans enact their tax plan by year\u2019s end?\u2022 What does Apple spend its cash on? Not acquisitions.\u2022 Is Broadcom making a jobs promise it can\u2019t fulfill?\u2022 Republicans have a two-seat majority in the Senate. Alabama hasn\u2019t had a Democratic senator in 25 years, but the controversy around Roy Moore has made a once-safe seat potentially up for grabs.\u2022 Even if the tax legislation is signed into law this year \u2014 we\u2019ll get to the state of play in a moment, though there\u2019s a chance things don\u2019t get wrapped up before the holidays \u2014 Republicans still have plenty of other issues, from health care to infrastructure spending, that will have to get through the Senate.Having Doug Jones, Mr. Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, in the Senate would make that effort more difficult. (So could having a Republican senator who feuds with Mitch McConnell and other G.O.P. leaders.)That point was one of six observations that Goldman\u2019s economic team put out Tuesday. Here are a few others:The answer? Not very, especially for a company with more than $250 billion in cash on its balance sheet and a market value within spitting distance of $1 trillion.Apple has disclosed only 11 acquisitions valued at $4.5 billion in its history, according to Thomson Reuters.To put that into perspective, we asked Thomson Reuters to pull some numbers. (One note on the data below, deal values include completed acquisitions and ones that are currently pending.)\u2022 The most acquisitive company? General Electric, which has made 1,206 acquisitions valued at $311 billion. Of course, G.E. has been around for more than a century, while Apple went public in 1980. So how does Apple compare with other tech companies?\u2022 Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, HP and Intel each have made acquisitions valued at more than $50 billion.\u2022 Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which was founded in 1998, has done 223 deals valued at $29 billion. Facebook? The social media giant, which has been around since 2004, has pulled the trigger on 65 deals with a value of $23 billion.\u2022 Apple, in fact, doesn\u2019t even rank in the top 100 most acquisitive tech companies.More from Andrew\u2019s column:Mr. Tan of Broadcom has boasted that he plans to spend $3 billion \u201cin research and engineering.\u201d Mr. Tan has been given high marks for managing the portfolio of Broadcom assets effectively, but he has never been known for industry-changing innovations.Qualcomm has its own headacheWhile some analysts and investors think Qualcomm might raise its bid for NXP as a way to deter Broadcom \u2014 which doesn\u2019t want the NXP deal to become any more expensive \u2014 Qualcomm says that for now it\u2019s sticking by its $110-a-share offer.Under the terms, Interstate will become the exclusive supplier of car batteries to Advance, one of the biggest auto parts sellers in the United States starting this spring.Interstate believes that the partnership could bolster its sales significantly, while Advance is hoping that a product alliance with a well-regarded parts maker would help stanch a 43 percent drop in its stock price over the past year.From a statement by Scott Miller, Interstate\u2019s C.E.O.:This alliance places us where our professional and retail customers are making purchasing decisions, allowing Advance Auto Parts and independent Carquest stores to serve as convenient, one-stop shops to meet our customers\u2019 needs.The department\u2019s long-awaited study of the Senate Republicans\u2019 proposed overhaul runs to about 489 words in length (including the title and footnotes) and, in the reckoning of even conservative commentators, does not actually detail the legislation\u2019s economic effects.The reaction from analysts\u2022 It\u2019s \u201can odd way to analyze a tax bill,\u201d said Scott Greenberg at the Tax Foundation.\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t believe in magic,\u201d said David Brockway, a staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation during the Reagan administration.The tax flyaroundThat clears the path for Disney to buy the Fox television and movie studios, stakes in the international broadcasters Sky and Star and other significant divisions. As we said yesterday, a deal could be struck this week, though it\u2019s unclear whether an announcement would specify a role at Disney for James Murdoch. (If he does get one, it probably would involve overseeing the international broadcast businesses.)A lighter takeThe short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse. No cooperation. Misinformation. Mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem. So we are in a really bad state of affairs right now, in my opinion.Regulators have already tightened the reins on at least one digital currency matter: The food review app Munchee canceled its initial coin offering yesterday after the S.E.C. issued a warning about the forthcoming deal.The Bitcoin flyaround\u201cThose who bought bonds in the hopes of windfall profits should not be protected at the expense of the island, its economy and its future. And they should certainly not be bailed out by U.S. taxpayers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
