{"Headline": "With Billions at Stake in Tax Debate, Lobbyists Played Hardball", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the largest tax rewrite in decades powered through Congress, lobbyists found themselves sprinting to keep up and find ways to persuade, influence or cajole the small group of lawmakers empowered to tweak language in the final version of the joint Senate and House bill.The lobbyists and their allies opened their wallets wide to fund advertisements, phone banks and field campaigns. They leaned on longstanding relationships with lawmakers and staff, dashed off letters to congressional leaders and wrote checks to secure a few minutes of precious face time at fund-raisers.They brought families struggling with rare diseases to Capitol Hill. Some deployed an outside-in approach, enlisting rank-and-file allies in both chambers to bend those writing the bill to their point of view. Others went for the jugular, trying to use partisan politics to prevent a provision from getting through.The winners and losers in the $1.5 trillion bill are just beginning to emerge after a scramble that, in different times, would have taken months or weeks, instead of days, and involved scores of lawmakers, not a handful.\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with 14 people instead of 535 people,\u201d said a lobbyist who attended a recent fund-raiser for Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, in an attempt to make a client\u2019s case to the senator, who sits on the joint House-Senate conference committee that hammered out the compromise bill.The tactics range from boring to brass-knuckled.When a lobbyist for the travel industry wanted to kill an amendment to the tax bill sought by Delta Air Lines over concerns it would dampen United States tourism, he emailed Republican tax writers with links to a series of posts written by consultants who have worked with Delta that were sharply critical of President Trump.The travel industry was concerned that the Delta amendment would depress international travel to the United States because it would impose a tax on foreign airlines that American carriers contend are subsidized by the governments of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.The implication from the emails \u2014 one of which arrived under the subject line, \u201cDelta Lobbyists: RESIST\u201d \u2014 was that Republicans should not reward a company whose representatives were bad-mouthing the party\u2019s leaders.In fact, none of the anti-Trump posts were actually written by Delta lobbyists, but rather by consultants working for a coalition that includes Delta and other United States-based airlines.The two-page provision sought by Delta had been inserted into the bill passed by the Senate Finance Committee by Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, where Delta has its headquarters.Business lobbying heavyweights, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, had pushed hard for the signature reform in the overhaul \u2014 drastically lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from today\u2019s 35 percent rate. But they also prevailed in extracting additional changes from the conference committee, including the repeal of a corporate alternative minimum tax that had been included, unexpectedly, in the Senate bill.The Business Roundtable, desperate to remove the corporate alternative minimum tax, worked behind the scenes, calling lawmakers and raising concerns about how it would effectively kill the ability of companies to utilize the prized research and development tax credit. Companies that try to use tax breaks to lower their effective tax rate, like that tax credit, would face the 20 percent alternative minimum tax, largely nullifying the value of incentives that are supposed to promote research by allowing firms to write-off those expenses.Republicans have resolved the differences between the two versions of their tax bill.Other groups went public, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which devoted two blog posts to denouncing what it called the \u201cbombshell\u201d inclusion in the bill.Lawmakers got the message quickly, lobbyists said. \u201cThere was a clear understanding within a short period of time that this was a problem,\u201d said one business association official.Paul Melmeyer, the head lobbyist for the National Organization for Rare Disorders, said his group is not sure of the fate of its signature issue, but added of lawmakers, \u201cWe\u2019re confident that they\u2019ve heard our voice.\u201dAn ad hoc coalition fighting to save a state and local tax deduction found itself largely on the losing end of the process.The coalition objected to versions of the tax bill that passed the House and Senate that substantially rolled back that deduction by capping the tax break at $10,000 and limiting it to property taxes only. And on Thursday, it registered its opposition to a compromise brokered in the conference committee allowing a $10,000 state and local tax deduction, split between property and either income or sales taxes.The compromise \u201cdoes virtually nothing to alleviate the severe cost imposed on middle-class families caused by the partial elimination,\u201d the coalition said in a statement issued Thursday afternoon.The coalition, consisting of groups representing state and municipal governments, as well as powerful labor unions and the National Association of Realtors, urged lawmakers to vote against the conference report.As of Thursday afternoon, the Realtors were waiting to take a formal position on the conference committee bill until they had a chance to thoroughly review the final language. But they waged a multifront battle to shape the language right up to the last minute.The Realtors\u2019 approach focused on \u201chaving members of the conference who are sympathetic, reach out to the conferees,\u201d said Jamie Gregory, a deputy chief lobbyist for the association.The deal reached by the conference committee would cap the deduction for interest on mortgage debt at $750,000 for newly purchased homes, a higher cap than the $500,000 limit in the House-passed bill but lower than the $1 million limit that currently exists and remains in the Senate-passed bill.No matter how convincing the policy analysis or how steady the constituent pressure, though, personal and financial connections to policymakers remained among the most important currency on K Street during the tax debate, as has been the case in legislative battles for decades.Fund-raisers held by members of the conference committee during the tax reform debate were hot tickets for tax lobbyists, who eagerly forked over a few hundred \u2014 or even a few thousand \u2014 dollars for face time with lawmakers who controlled the fate of valued loopholes.A Republican who attended a fund-raiser late last month for another member of the conference committee, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, said several lobbyists asked the senator about tax reform. Mr. Cornyn kept his responses vague, telling attendees that he was hopeful that the process could be completed before Christmas.Sheila Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Television commercials are running in key districts. On Tuesday, evangelical Christians supporting the immigrants were arrested after demonstrating outside the office of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan.With their future now in jeopardy, a wide range of well-organized, well-financed supporters are lining up behind the Dreamers, including celebrities, philanthropists, religious groups and pillars of corporate America.Republicans control Congress but cannot keep the government running without Democrats, and several Democrats have said they will not vote for a spending bill unless it also resolves the plight of the immigrants. \u201cWe will not leave here without a DACA fix,\u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, said on Thursday.The multipronged campaign to help the young immigrants underscores how much the country has come to identify with them and how extensively they have been integrated into the economy. Many Republicans have joined Democrats in supporting DACA beneficiaries, and polls show overwhelming support for them. It is no longer politically risky to get behind them.In a recent conference call with religious leaders who supported helping the immigrants, one Republican, Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois, told them he would support legislation to shield the immigrants from deportation only if it came with enhanced border measures. In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Roskam\u2019s office said his view had not changed.The mobilization began in September, as soon as the Trump administration announced the repeal of the deferred-action program.The companies, which have a substantial lobbying presence in Washington, began leveraging relationships with lawmakers from districts where they have major operations. In mid-November, a lobbying blitz on Capitol Hill involved officials from 40 large companies introducing DACA recipients who work for their firms to lawmakers.\u201cWe held dozens of meetings with members of Congress from both parties and we heard consistently that they want a solution,\u201d said Christopher Padilla, vice president of government affairs for IBM, which employs more than 30 DACA recipients. He added that the company wanted lawmakers to \u201cgive Dreamers the clarity and stability they deserve.\u201dAmong those photographed was a DACA recipient named Laura Cruz, a public-health major who clutched the cap and gown she had just picked up to wear at her December graduation. Given the uncertainty over her future, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to decide what to do next.\u201dDavis Darnsman, a junior studying corporate communications, said his best friend had received DACA protection. He also said he would be amenable to bolstered border security. \u201cThere has to some compromise that can be made to benefit everybody,\u201d he said.On Tuesday, the dozens of evangelical Christians who gathered outside Mr. Ryan\u2019s office bore boxes stuffed with cards on which young immigrants in their communities had written messages relating their \u201cdreams.\u201d Several protesters poured the cards onto the floor as if they were an offering, then knelt, prayed and sang \u201cSilent Night\u201d before being arrested on civil disobedience charges.Cheryl Miller, a lifelong Republican who had traveled from rural Texas to the demonstration, said, \u201cThis is the first time I have done anything like this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I Root for That Dream.", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySportingOne of the first things that disappears when you write about sports for a living is fandom. It\u2019s a necessary sacrifice. The teams you grew up watching with your parents, your siblings and your best friends become part of the job.But as a hockey writer, I still root. Sometimes it\u2019s rooting for a compelling story to emerge where there isn\u2019t one. Or rooting for a game to avoid overtime so I can make it home in time for parent-teacher conferences.It is also completely impossible to relate to them as fellow human beings. That\u2019s why I feel closer to the coaches. They\u2019re a little more relatable. And they often arouse my curiosity more than any other part of the game \u2014 and are therefore more fascinating to analyze.What goes into the player matchups or who is getting icetime? How do they get a bunch of athletes pulling in the same direction? And, to begin with, how did they even get the opportunity?When it was done, it was natural to try and find a common thread among the personalities. One existed.Somewhere along the line, most of these coaches faced a major life decision. On one side of the equation was an opportunity that was completely safe, often in a profession outside of sports. Mike Babcock, the coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs, could have been a business consultant. Joel Quenneville, coach of the Chicago Blackhawks, could have had a career in finance.Bob Hartley, who won a Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche in 2001, had a job at a windshield plant he expected to keep the rest of his life. Because he had two young children, it was certainly the safe thing to do.\u201cThe story of a factory worker is, once you buy a lunch pail, you die with that lunch pail,\u201d Hartley said, as we sat and watched his Avalanche win a Stanley Cup on a laptop screen in front of us. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in this.\u201dNope, none at all.It\u2019s the path most of us take. Find a job with benefits, a salary that comes close to covering the monthly bills and hope you can hang on to it long enough to put the kids through college.The coach of the N.H.L.\u2019s best team so far this season, Jon Cooper of the Tampa Bay Lightning, left a successful career as a lawyer to pursue his coaching dream.These guys took on major risks, they chased their passions and, often along the way, they were fired. Some of them multiple times. It\u2019s how it goes as a coach.The path to the top isn\u2019t a linear one. Certainly not in a profession with as much volatility as coaching.Mike Sullivan, coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins, was fired multiple times, including from stints as an assistant coach, by teams like the Boston Bruins and Vancouver Canucks. Still, he grabbed his whistle and looked for ways to earn one more shot.\u201cI always said to myself, I\u2019m not going to be able to control certain aspects of the business,\u201d Sullivan told me. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to be willing to do what it takes to get where I want to go. Did it happen as fast as I wanted it to? No. There were some days I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to get a chance again.\u201dWhen he took the job as the head coach of Sidney Crosby and the Penguins, he suspected it was his last shot to make it as a head coach. He was probably right.All he\u2019s done since is become the first coach in N.H.L. history to win back-to-back Stanley Cups in the salary-cap era (which began in the mid-2000s).I admire that passion, the perseverance and the constant pursuit of improvement.Am I rooting for these guys? Not every night, not when the games are being played. But on larger level, maybe I am.So I guess I still root. I root for the dream to be kept alive. I root for one more good story for these guys to tell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Melting Arctic Ice Makes High-Speed Internet a Reality in a Remote Town", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "The receding ice has opened new passageways for high-speed internet cables. Point Hope, a gravel spit in northwest Alaska, is along one of the new routes.Supported byPOINT HOPE, Alaska \u2014 This is one of the most remote towns in the United States, a small gravel spit on the northwest coast of Alaska, more than 3,700 miles from New York City. Icy seas surround it on three sides, leaving only an unpaved path to the mainland.Getting here from Anchorage, about 700 miles away, requires two flights. Roads do not connect the two places. Basics like milk and bread are delivered by air, and gas is brought in by barge during the summer.\u201cI don\u2019t know if people even know that we exist,\u201d said Daisy Sage, the mayor.Needless to say, this is not the sort of place you expect to be a hub of the high-tech digital world.But in a surprising, and bittersweet, side effect of global warming \u2014 and of the global economy \u2014 one of the fastest internet connections in America is arriving in Point Hope, giving the 700 or so residents their first taste of broadband speed.High-speed internet cables snake under the world\u2019s oceans, tying continents together and allowing email and other bits of digital data sent from Japan to arrive quickly in Britain. Until recently, those lines mostly bypassed the Arctic, where the ice blocked access to the ships that lay the cable.But as the ice has receded, new passageways have emerged, creating a more direct path for the cable \u2014 over the earth\u2019s northern end through places like the Chukchi Sea \u2014 and helping those emails move even move quickly. Quintillion is one of the companies laying the new cable, and Point Hope is one of the places along its route.Financial companies would certainly welcome \u2014 and pay for \u2014 a faster connection between London and Toyko. Over the past decade, traders have increasingly relied on powerful computer programs to buy and sell securities at huge volumes and lightning speeds. A millisecond can be the difference between a big profit and a big loss. Quintillion\u2019s faster connection would also appeal to the operators of data stations around the world that store and send information for social media sites, online retailers and the billions of gadgets that now connect to the internet.But it will be years before the full connections between countries are made. For now, Quintillion\u2019s undersea cables are just around the northern part of Alaska, and the company is taking advantage of a nascent business boom in the Arctic. Oil, shipping and mining companies that can benefit from a faster internet are rushing into the more open waters.Quintillion is also teaming up with local telecommunications companies to use the undersea cables to bring faster internet service to some of the nation\u2019s most disconnected communities.In Point Hope, the new connection could mean better health care, as patients in the town and doctors in faraway cities communicate via seamless webcast. It could help improve education, too. Teachers, now used to waiting hours to download course materials, will now be able to do it in minutes.Many of Point Hope\u2019s older residents cringe at the incursion of technology. For the most part, this is still a traditional community of Inupiaq native Alaskans. Until the 1970s, many families lived in sod houses framed with whale bones.People here also have no illusions about the overall effect of global warming. They see the waters rising and worry about sea mammals disappearing. They rely on the sea for food, and their year is built around festivals for berry picking and whaling.\u201cInupiaq people are taught to be patient,\u201d said Steve Oomittuk, a leading local whale hunter whose family has lived in Point Hope for many generations. \u201cWe wait for animals to come to us for our food, our shelter, our medicine, our clothing. The internet makes people impatient for everything. This is not our way of life.\u201dBut interviews with dozens of Point Hope residents suggest that people here see Quintillion\u2019s cable as a way of connecting with an outside world that has long been beyond easy reach \u2014 and something that could change their lives for the better.Leona Snyder, for one, is excited about what the connection could do for her Justice Jones, who turns 16 on Sunday. She wants him to go to college, which would mean leaving the village. Having broadband internet could help him study and research outside opportunities.\u201cInternet means exposure to the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI want that for Justice. I want him to be a judge. Judge Justice Jones. It has a ring to it, don\u2019t you think?\u201dIn June, three ships carrying huge rolls of cable traveled through waters in the Bering Strait and the Chukchi Sea to lay the final miles of Quintillion\u2019s undersea internet network.The boats unfurled 40 miles of fiber optic cable into the dark, choppy water. An enormous shoveling tool plowed the sea floor and buried the cables for protection. It was the final stretch of a 1,200-mile network connecting six coastal towns, including Kotzebue, Nome and Point Hope.\u201cA project like this has been discussed for 20-plus years but was formidable from a cost and weather standpoint,\u201d said Tim Woolston, a Quintillion spokesman. \u201cThe ice situation has evolved to the point where it\u2019s now physically possible.\u201dAn infusion from Cooper Investment Partners, a private equity firm in New York, has helped Quintillion finance the laying of the cable. The company would not say how much the network had cost to build so far. But it insisted that supplying high-speed internet service to an estimated 20,000 people along the cable\u2019s route would be a good business.Quintillion makes money leasing the bandwidth from its undersea cable network to local telecoms that then bring internet service directly to homes and businesses in Alaska. The company has not announced its business plans for connecting internet service between Asia and Europe, but will probably use a similar model.Although that is a relatively small number of people, Quintillion believes it will increase along with what the company expects to be broader commercial growth in the region driven by oil and mineral exploration. With broadband service available, Quintillion is also betting that more data centers, research centers, hospitals and schools will make the Arctic Circle home.Other broadband-internet providers have the same idea. Cinia, a telecom company owned by the Finnish government, has completed the first stage of a multiyear plan to lay a subsea broadband network between Europe and Asia through the Arctic Ocean. Cinia, which expects the Arctic network to cost about $700 million, just completed the first leg, from Germany to Finland.\u201cThe financial sector wants the shortest route for trading, and we are talking about fractions of milliseconds, but it makes a difference,\u201d Ari-Jussi Knaapila, Cinia\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. Multiplayer video games that connect participants around the world also demand faster internet traffic with less delay, he added.After Alaska, Quintillion plans to bring its undersea cables to Asia. A third stage would extend the network to Europe. The company would not predict how long the project would take to complete.In the meantime, Quintillion is offsetting some of its costs by joining forces with local telecom companies to sell the internet service directly to customers. In Point Hope, several local companies, including the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative, have rushed to prepare homes. Alaska Communications, another telecom, has signed up city offices and businesses at other sites.The fiber network will bring connection speeds of 200 gigabits per second to the village, among the fastest rates in the country. Point Hope will not feel the full effect right away. Residential customers will initially be able get service at 10 megabits per second under plans starting $24.99 a month, while service will be faster for businesses.That is still 10 times faster than the existing phone-line connections here, and good enough for streaming video on a service like Netflix. The companies said they planned to offer faster speeds if demand warrants doing so.People here are already thinking that the new broadband lines could transform the local economy.The one general store, the Native Store, will be able to order new supplies more easily. The phone association has installed computer terminals at City Hall to provide free internet service to the public. Point Hope\u2019s transportation director is building a conference center with Wi-Fi and web video conferencing above a bus garage to host state events. Artists are planning to sell native crafts and jewelry online.Last month, about 25 residents, including the mayor, gathered at City Hall and talked about how internet service could turn Point Hope, one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in North America, into a tourist destination with a museum with interactive displays and a website. The village\u2019s small motel with 20 beds would offer Wi-Fi.\u201cThe trigger to all of this is lower-cost broadband that will bring a whole new economy and hope to places like Point Hope,\u201d said Jens Laipenieks, president of the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative.Nome, a few hundred miles to the south and with 4,000 residents, offers a glimpse into Point Hope\u2019s future. Climate change, and broadband connections, have already altered education and commerce.With the warming of the Bering Sea, the Crystal Serenity cruise ship, 820 feet long and with a capacity of more than 1,000 passengers, has started to anchor offshore, bringing new tourism. The ship has only recently been able to navigate around the ice.If local politicians have their way, it will be only the beginning. They are lobbying the state to build a deep water port so that even larger cruise ships can dock in Nome. The officials have indicated Quintillion\u2019s broadband service improves its case to state officials, who want to make sure Coast Guard and tourist boats will have access to high-speed internet service.\u201cThe future is here and there is not anything changing that,\u201d said Richard Beneville, Nome\u2019s mayor, who also runs a tour company.Nome has had broadband internet service for years. The arrival of Quintillion\u2019s lines, which were turned on Dec. 1, will make the connections much faster.Like the changes that Point Hope is experiencing, the ones in Nome worry some residents. Austin Ahmasuk, a marine environmentalist who lives along the coast, is among them. He is concerned that the change will dilute some of the local culture and result in harm to the environment.\u201cThe very thing that kept most global development away from the north \u2014 ice \u2014 is disappearing in all its formats,\u201d Mr. Ahmasuk said. \u201cHistory shows that outside people don\u2019t have the same interest in our culture and environment.\u201dBut residents here are mostly embracing having a stronger connection with the rest of the world.Early on a weekday evening, Bryan and Maggie Muktoyuk organized more than a dozen people at the Lutheran Church on Bering Street for a weekly rehearsal of native dance and drums.Seated in a row, men and teenage boys pounded on round drums made of stretched walrus stomach. Women with mittens and ornate mukluk boots swayed their hips to the beat.Ms. Muktoyuk held up her iPhone and, with a Wi-Fi connection, started to stream a video of the rehearsal on Facebook. Mr. Muktoyuk had set up a group page on the social network for other native dancers around the Alaska\u2019s North Slope region.A line of men took to the community room\u2019s floor, pounded their feet and shouted as they reached toward the sky. They were learning a new dance that Mr. Muktoyuk had choreographed, inspired by an exhausting whale hunt he had participated in months earlier in Wainwright, near Point Hope.\u201cMake sure you get this,\u201d he said to Ms. Muktoyuk.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Far-Right Leaders, Meeting to Condemn the E.U., Are Greeted With Boos", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRAGUE \u2014 As European far-right leaders gathered in Prague on Saturday for a two-day conference to unify their stance on immigration and other issues, they were met by throngs of protesters who booed, shouted \u201cShame\u201d and denounced populism and xenophobia.The members of the European Parliament, including Marine Le Pen of France and Geert Wilders of the Netherlands, met as part of the nationalist Europe of Nations and Freedom coalition at a heavily fortified hotel just outside the city center in the Czech Republic, which has seen a rise in far-right politics and nationalist rhetoric.At a news conference, Mr. Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom, called on the European Union to adopt more restrictive immigration policies and said the conference would serve to usher in a new era of cooperation among like-minded parties.\u201cIn 30 or 50 years, the Czech Republic will be surrounded by countries with population where 20 percent of people will be Muslims.\u201d Mr. Wilders said. \u201cThat is as if the Czech Republic became a Gaza Strip. We need to prevent mass migration even if we should build a wall.\u201dThe conference was hosted by the anti-Islam and anti-immigrant Freedom and Direct Democracy party, known as the SPD. The party emerged as a major force in Czech parliamentary elections in October, winning nearly 11 percent of the vote.Tomio Okamura, the Czech-Japanese leader of the SPD, said the gathering on Saturday was to demand a reformed European Union based on the tightest possible cooperation of sovereign nations, guided by mutual benefits without any dictate from Brussels, while maintaining free movement of people, goods, capital and services.\u201cEurope should not be a denationalized state directed by bureaucrats in Brussels,\u201d Mr. Okamura said. He added that he believed Europe was threatened by the degradation of traditional values and the suppression of patriotism.During the news conference, Mr. Okamura, Ms. Le Pen and Mr. Wilders accused the bloc of destroying the sovereignty of member states by adopting a mandatory quota for asylum seekers from the Middle East.\u201cBecause we like Europe, we say that the E.U. is going to kill her,\u201d said Ms. Le Pen, president of the National Front and a former French presidential candidate. \u201cWe are patriots; we defend our sovereignty,\u201d she added.The Muslim community in the Czech Republic is between 5,000 and 20,000, or less than 0.2 percent of the total population. So far, the country has taken in just 12 asylum seekers as part of the European Union quota. The bloc plans to take the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to court for failing to accommodate their fair share of refugees under a plan agreed to by the 28-country body.Mr. Wilders said he hoped the Czech capital would keep its doors closed to migrants.As in neighboring Poland and Hungary, anti-immigrant and anti-establishment rhetoric has become a mainstay in politics in the Czech Republic, helping the eccentric billionaire and Euro-skeptic Andrej Babis to become prime minister in the last elections.While he is also staunchly against the European Union\u2019s migrant quotas, he pledged during his campaign not to cooperate with the far-right groups. But since taking office this past week without a majority in Parliament to rule outright, he has shown a willingness to work with Mr. Okamura and his SPD party on a quid pro quo basis.Several leftist groups that opposed the meeting in Prague organized protests on Friday and Saturday in the center of the capital and on the outskirts of city, where the conference took place. About 400 people gathered Saturday outside the news conference, chanting, whistling and booing far-right supporters as they entered the compound, guarded by security and police officers.\u201cIn the Czech Republic, there is an increasing number of attacks against minorities due to the policies of the Czech SPD party,\u201d said Jan Cemper, the protests\u2019 organizer. \u201cAt the same time, we want to show that such congresses of xenophobes and populists are not welcomed here.\u201dFedor Gal, a former dissident and a public figure in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, referring to extreme right politicians, said, \u201cThose are people that do not care for a dialogue, and they do not deserve our tolerance.\u201dCzech politicians condemned the conference. Jiri Pospisil, chairman of TOP 09, a center-right party, wrote in a Facebook post: \u201cExtremists that threaten the interests of both the Czech Republic and Europe gather in Prague. They want to leave the EU and NATO and bring us close to Russia of Vladimir Putin. What a shame that the host is vice chairman of the Czech parliament.\u201dSecurity measures were tight for the far-right politicians, particularly Mr. Wilders, who has faced threats. No violence was reported, however, and the police did not intervene in the demonstrations.Though no public agenda for the conference was made public, the group introduced the Belgian right-wing politician Gerolf Annemans as the Europe of Nations and Freedom\u2019s new president and visited the Czech Parliament on a guided tour.Also expected at the conference were Janice Atkinson, an independent member of the European Parliament who was expelled from Britain\u2019s populist U.K.I.P. party two years ago amid a financing scandal; and Marcus Pretzell, a German member of the European Parliament formerly with the Alternative for Germany party, known as the AfD.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of Muslims in the Czech Republic. Muslims make up less than 0.2 percent of the country\u2019s population, not less than 0.02 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Power Prices Go Negative in Germany, a Positive for Energy Users", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGermany has spent $200 billion over the past two decades to promote cleaner sources of electricity. That enormous investment is now having an unexpected impact \u2014 consumers are now actually paid to use power on occasion, as was the case over the weekend.Power prices plunged below zero for much of Sunday and the early hours of Christmas Day on the EPEX Spot, a large European power trading exchange, the result of low demand, unseasonably warm weather and strong breezes that provided an abundance of wind power on the grid.On Sunday, factory owners and other major consumers were at times paid more than 50 euros, about $60, per megawatt-hour, a wholesale measure, to take power.Here is a rundown of these negative power prices, and the impact they have.Basically, when the supply of power outstrips demand for it.Demand is particularly low on weekends and holidays, when factories are idle and offices empty. The energy supplies that Germany depends on, however, are less predictable than they used to be.Wind power, in particular, is highly dependent on changes in weather patterns. Giant spinning turbines produce, on average, about 12 percent of Germany\u2019s power, but on windy days, they can generate several times that amount.At the same time, other mainstays of the country\u2019s electricity supply, especially some coal and nuclear power plants, are unable to dial back quickly enough, leading to negative prices on electricity trading markets.Several countries in Europe have experienced negative power prices, including Belgium, Britain, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.But Germany\u2019s forays into negative pricing are the most frequent. At times, Germany is able to export its surplus electricity to its neighbors, helping to balance the market. Still, its experiences of negative prices are often longer, and deeper, than they are in other countries.In one recent example, power prices spent 31 hours below zero during the last weekend of October. At one point, they dipped as low as minus \u20ac83, or minus $98, per megawatt-hour, a wholesale measure.In other words, anyone who was able to hook up for a large blast of electricity at that time was paid \u20ac83 per unit for the trouble.The major drawback of both wind and solar power is that they wax and wane with the breeze and sunshine, and not in response to when they are most needed.Battery storage capacity, meanwhile, is not yet advanced enough to take in all of the excess generation. And because older power plants that run on fossil fuels take a long time to ramp up and reduce electricity generation, they are not able to respond decisively enough to the shifting supply.Like most traditional power systems, Germany\u2019s was designed to match output to demand. However, \u201cwe now have technology that cannot produce according to the demand, but is producing according to the weather,\u201d said Tobias Kurth, the managing director of Energy Brainpool, a Berlin-based consulting firm.That, he said, is \u201cone of the key challenges in the whole transition of the energy market to renewable power.\u201dNegative prices indicate that Germany\u2019s power grid, like most others around the world, has not yet adapted to the increasing amounts of renewable energy being produced.\u201cWe have a lot of stress on the grid,\u201d said Ulrike H\u00f6rchens, a spokeswoman for Tennet, a large grid operator in Germany and the Netherlands.For now, technological improvements that would help store additional power, and better distribute it across and between countries, are lagging.But regulatory tweaks could make a difference. Germany, for example, does not do enough to encourage customers to increase their use at times of oversupply.On a basic level, that could be as simple as providing incentives for people to turn on the washing machine when power is plentiful, and cheap. Companies could make even more use of such guidance, ramping up energy-hungry tasks at times of low-cost electricity.Not directly.The wholesale costs of power make up only about a fifth of the average household electricity bill in Germany. The rest is a stew of taxes, fees to finance renewable-energy investments, and charges for use of the grid.That means their bills are lower than they otherwise would be, because power prices are sometimes negative, though household energy bills have been rising over all anyway. Basically, utilities are not depositing money in customers\u2019 bank accounts.Power producers are learning to adapt to this new world.RWE, one of Germany\u2019s largest operators of power installations, employs a weather forecaster to help anticipate surges in wind power, and to match the spikes to when the company expects peak demand.While negative prices create problems for the company, they also enhance the value of its more flexible installations, including large storage systems.In one case, it takes advantage of negative prices by being paid to pump large volumes of water into a mountain lake in Austria. When prices are higher, the company releases the water, using turbines to generate electricity.\u201cWe are able to ramp units down, and switch the pumps on,\u201d said Martin Keiner, RWE\u2019s head of commercial asset optimization. \u201cYou can earn a lot on flexibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublican leaders say their proposals will fuel investment and job creation. Critics say that the rich are the beneficiaries and that debt will weigh on growth. We asked two economists, one from each side, to make their cases. There is no disagreement that changes to the tax code should promote economic growth, fuel job creation and increase incomes. The question is whether the Republican tax bills would accomplish those goals. Several prominent conservative economists have argued that the proposals would do just that.There is also substantial disagreement about who would ultimately gain. Republican leaders argue that the substantial tax cuts for business would eventually result in wage increases. Critics counter that there is little historical evidence for that claim.GrowthThis capital deepening \u2014 having more and better capital for each worker \u2014 reverses recent trends and raises productivity growth. More rapid productivity growth, in turn, raises the real wages of the middle class and restores upward mobility to a stagnant labor market.There is nothing wrong with the idea that reducing a tax on capital will spur investment, which should increase worker productivity and, eventually, wages. But these models ignore important features of the real world, the tax code and the proposed tax law changes.BUDGETA fair concern has been raised over the need for additional federal borrowing as a result of the proposed reform. Certainly the level and trajectory of the federal debt are a troubling issue, and a revenue-neutral approach would have been preferable. But it is important to get the right order of magnitude of any impact. That means the Treasury will need to finance another $40 billion to $60 billion more each year. This is a drop in the bucket of the Treasury market, with inconsequential implications for the overall level of interest rates.MULTINATIONALSAmerican businesses have booked roughly $3 trillion overseas to avoid paying United States taxes. Under the Republican plan, they would get a tax break worth about $500 billion in return for bringing the money home. Republicans argue that the money would be used to create jobs. Critics say the proposal would reward companies for tax-avoidance strategies without \u2014 based on past cases \u2014 an economic dividend.WAGES PROSPERITY Capital accumulation, productivity growth and living better: That is the case for tax reform. It would be an easier political sale if there were a straight line from the policy to the prosperity (which is why the left prefers programs that write checks). But the logic is sound, the evidence conclusive and the case for tax reform helping the middle class impeccable.This tax bill is not about workers. It is about giving shareholders and businesses lower taxes and merely hoping benefits will trickle down. Instead, give workers any tax cuts, and rely on the strength of the middle class to bubble up, strengthening American business. Sound tax reform should not lose revenue, and it should not give the vast majority of benefits to those at the top.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "De Blasio Seeks to Turn Homeless \u2018Cluster Sites\u2019 Into Affordable Housing", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, New York City has placed thousands of homeless families into so-called cluster or scatter-site housing, using private apartments, usually in run-down buildings, as an expensive way to help the city meet its legal mandate to provide shelter to those eligible.Now the mayor is taking a large step toward ending that reliance: On Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio is expected to announce a plan to essentially convert many of the homeless apartments into affordable housing, hoping to solve a problem that has worsened over his first term.Under the plan, the city would use public financing to help nonprofits buy roughly a third of the apartments currently used for the homeless, and then convert the apartments into affordable units, helping the mayor fulfill two goals: lowering homelessness and adding to the city\u2019s affordable housing stock.If landlords do not cooperate, the city intends to use eminent domain to take the property, officials said.The planned acquisition involves 800 apartments spread throughout 25 to 30 buildings, mostly in the Bronx, which has the overwhelming majority of cluster apartments in the city. The city targeted buildings where more than 50 percent of the units were occupied by homeless people \u2014 a threshold that would guide future acquisitions, the city said.In a statement, Mr. de Blasio said his administration had to \u201cthink creatively and be bold.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re fast-tracking the transition from shelter to higher-quality, permanently affordable housing for New Yorkers caught in the grips of our city\u2019s affordability crisis,\u201d he said.The planned acquisition could place about 3,000 people into permanent housing; in some cases, homeless families living in the apartments would simply stay put, but would no longer be considered homeless. It was not immediately known how much the program would cost the city.The rise in homelessness has been a paradox for Mr. de Blasio, a self-described progressive railing against income inequality. An estimated 77,000 people were living in the city\u2019s different shelter systems and on the streets in February, according to a count overseen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. When the mayor took office in January 2014, there were an estimated 68,000.Mr. de Blasio has conceded that he took too long to recognize the homelessness crisis and to outline a strategy that would reverse decades of damage \u2014 exacerbated by rising rents, stagnant wages and the loss of affordable housing. The city addressed the problem with short-term fixes, including its reliance on cluster sites.The cluster program began in 2000 under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, with a few hundred apartments. Year after year, the city increased its reliance on the cluster sites, largely because the apartments were the most expedient, least intrusive way to help the city meet its legal mandate to provide shelter to anyone eligible.The clusters drew little community outcry when they opened because, unlike traditional shelters, they were not immediately visible. The apartments are tucked away in mostly decrepit, private buildings, and homeless families have simply blended in with people who are not homeless.Under Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan, once the nonprofits purchased the apartments, the units would be subject to regulations that would require them to remain affordable for 30 years.In a way, Mr. de Blasio, a longtime critic of clusters, inadvertently increased the city\u2019s dependence on them. Early in his tenure, the mayor asked his administration to slow down on opening new shelters, as elected officials expressed concern to him about shelters materializing in their districts without notification.At the same time, Mr. de Blasio directed his administration to reduce how much the city paid to landlords for the cluster apartments. But without new shelters opening, the city still needed the more discreet clusters. And because of that need, some landlords refused to reduce the prices of apartments.The lucrative circumstances sometimes led landlords to drive out residents who were not homeless just so they could collect the larger payments from the city.But with few alternatives, the city has been stuck with clusters. By January 2016, the number of cluster apartments had ballooned to about 3,650 apartments, with an estimated 11,000 people at its height.Around that same time, the mayor unveiled a plan to phase out the use of clusters by 2018, only to have to push back that deadline to 2021 earlier this year. Getting out of them, the city has found, has meant even more expensive alternatives.Since early 2016, the city has stopped using about 1,000 cluster apartments. But because it had slowed the pace of opening new shelters, the city was forced to place homeless families into even costlier hotel rooms, which cost it about $400,000 a day.But with the city falling short of opening the 18 to 20 shelters it said it wanted to open by March 2018 \u2014 the city has opened eight new shelters and has announced that three other shelters will be opening soon \u2014 it clearly needed a more aggressive tack.The takeover of the buildings could also alleviate concerns of some elected officials and housing advocates who feared abandoning the cluster program wholesale would increase the risk that landlords could turn the apartments, which had once been rent stabilized, into market-rate ones.The city Department of Homeless Services does not have the authority to make sure landlords are in compliance with rent regulations, but it is working with other agencies, like the state Homes and Community Renewal, to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Islanders Say New Arena Will Be Privately Financed", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Islanders celebrated a return to Long Island at a news conference on Wednesday at the site of their future home: Belmont Park.The state\u2019s top development agency, Empire State Development, accepted the Islanders\u2019 proposal for an 18,000-seat arena adjacent to the Belmont Park grandstand. The arena will host at least 41 Islanders games a season and other events. A 400,000-square-foot retail village and a hotel are also planned in the $1 billion project.The Islanders\u2019 majority owner, Jon Ledecky, did not say how much the arena itself would cost, but he said it would be privately financed.\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for government funds,\u201d he said.Wednesday\u2019s event was a victory lap for Ledecky, who became the Islanders\u2019 majority owner with Scott Malkin in 2016. He has sought a way out of the team\u2019s unhappy marriage with Barclays Center in Brooklyn for much of the time since.For 43 seasons, the Islanders played at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, about eight miles east of Belmont Park. But after the previous majority owner, Charles Wang, failed to persuade Nassau County voters to approve his Lighthouse Project, which included plans for a new arena, the team decided in 2012 to move to Brooklyn for the 2015-16 season.Sharing Barclays Center with the Nets has been difficult. Fans have not shown up in numbers needed to make the arrangement worthwhile. The Islanders are last in the N.H.L. in attendance this season, with about 11,500 fans a game, and they were near the bottom the previous two seasons. There are hundreds of obstructed-view seats and frequent complaints about the quality of the ice at Barclays Center, which opened in 2012 but was not built with hockey in mind.The Islanders or Barclays Center can opt out of their lease in January. The team has said it intends to play in Brooklyn through next season. But the new arena will not be ready until 2020 at the earliest, so the Islanders may need a temporary home.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a native of nearby Queens, attended the news conference on Wednesday in support of the Islanders\u2019 arena plan. He urged the N.H.L. commissioner, Gary Bettman, to let the team return on an interim basis to Nassau Coliseum, which after a recent renovation can seat only 13,500 for hockey.\u201cWe\u2019ll take a look at it,\u201d Bettman said.Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment, which runs Barclays Center and the new Nassau Coliseum, said in a statement that it hoped the Islanders would use their former home after they leave Brooklyn and before their first opening face-off at Belmont.\u201cWe are currently awaiting a response from the Islanders to our proposal to bring N.H.L. games back home to the Coliseum on an interim basis,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe understand the required approvals from all parties involved to make that happen, and are prepared to facilitate any necessary enhancements.\u201dThe addition of yet another arena in the New York area represents a different kind of challenge in an already crowded marketplace. The Islanders\u2019 new home would be the fifth arena in the area, including Madison Square Garden and Prudential Center in Newark.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about other arenas,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about making our arena the best in the world.\u201dBelmont Park, which opened in 1905, hosts horse racing from roughly May through October, including the Belmont Stakes in June. There would not be much overlap with the hockey season unless the Islanders made a long playoff run.Some certainty about their arena will improve the Islanders\u2019 chances of re-signing their star center John Tavares to a new long-term contract. Tavares, 27, the face of the franchise since he was selected first over all in the 2009 draft, could become an unrestricted free agent on July 1.\u201cThe Islanders are called the Islanders for a reason,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cThis is really where the team belongs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Kinzinger is not high on anyone\u2019s endangered list.But Democrats are clamoring to enter the ring.\u201cI started seeing changes to U.S. policy that concern me,\u201d said Sara Dady, one of the candidates. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing immigration law under three administrations. I have a client who has a green card. He did everything right. He was denied boarding. To me that is not the America I know and love.\u201dDemocrats are investing in candidates like Ms. Dady. She attended three trainings before declaring her candidacy, including events hosted by the Illinois Democratic County Chairmen\u2019s Association and Representative Cheri Bustos, who represents another Illinois district.Mr. Ossoff and Mr. Jones\u2019s campaign funds were primarily from small-dollar donors, many of them from outside the district. It is unclear whether those donors will be able to maintain the pace in an election where every seat is up. They will have a formidable opponent in the Congressional Leadership Fund, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that supports Republican candidates and can raise unlimited money. The Congressional Leadership Fund raised more than $12 million in 2017, mostly from a few donations measured in the hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars.The Republican National Committee has also built up a war chest of $40 million, compared with $6 million for the Democrats.Even with the political wind at their backs, most Democratic challengers will be underdogs.\u201cIncumbents have a lot of built-in advantages,\u201d said Michael Beckel of the bipartisan campaign finance reform group Issue One. \u201cThey have higher name recognition, and they can spend a lot of time building up a huge campaign war chest to ward off opponents. Additionally, interest groups in Washington are incentivized to bet on incumbents.\u201dBut at least the Democrats have the candidates.\u201cIf you have a candidate running,\u201d Mr. Beckel said, \u201cyour odds of picking up seats increases.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the size of donations to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a \u201csuper\u201d PAC. They were in the hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars, not millions and tens of millions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prosecutors Said to Seek Kushner Records From Deutsche Bank", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal prosecutors in Brooklyn have sought bank records about entities associated with the family company of Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, according to four people briefed on the matter.Mr. Kushner, who was the Kushner Companies\u2019 chief executive until January, still owns part of the business after selling some of his stake. The family businesses include many legal entities. It is not clear which records were sought by prosecutors, what they are seeking to learn from them or to what degree, if any, they directly involve Mr. Kushner.There is no indication that the subpoena is related to the investigation being conducted by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russian meddling in the 2016 United States presidential election. Three prosecutors on Mr. Mueller\u2019s team previously worked at the United States attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn, one as recently as this year. Federal prosecutors around the country typically check with Justice Department headquarters when their investigations may overlap.The Brooklyn United States attorney has been investigating the Kushner businesses\u2019 use of a program known as EB-5. It offers visas to overseas investors in exchange for $500,000 investments in real estate projects.But Deutsche Bank does not appear to have been involved in Kushner real estate projects financed through the EB-5 program. That suggests the prosecutors\u2019 subpoena may be unrelated to the visa program. \u201cWe are unaware of any inquiry directed at Deutsche Bank from the E.D.N.Y. and have no reason to believe there is one,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the Kushner Companies, referring to the Eastern District of New York.A subject of a subpoena wouldn\u2019t necessarily know that the subpoena had been served on a bank or other institution.Mr. Kushner\u2019s company bought the space from Africa Israel Investments, a company owned by Lev Leviev. Mr. Leviev\u2019s company has an extensive real estate portfolio in Russia.The interview, and the subpoena of Deutsche Bank, does not mean Mr. Kushner is suspected of wrongdoing. Defense lawyers typically do not consent to such interviews if they believe their clients are the target of an inquiry.Deutsche Bank served as a so-called correspondent bank, routing money from a foreign bank to Mr. Manafort\u2019s United States account, according to one of the people briefed on the matter.Deutsche Bank is also a big lender to Mr. Trump\u2019s companies, though Mr. Mueller has not subpoenaed the bank for information about those accounts, according to people familiar with subpoenas that Deutsche Bank has received.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said publicly that they have been assured that Mr. Mueller has not subpoenaed bank records related to him or his family. People close to Mr. Kushner, who declined to be named, said they do not think he is in jeopardy from Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.In a statement, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman said the bank \u201ctakes its legal obligations seriously and remains committed to cooperating with authorized investigations into this matter.\u201dBefore Deutsche Bank got the recent subpoena, Kushner Companies had received inquiries from the Brooklyn prosecutors about its use of the EB-5 visa program on a pair of luxury apartment towers in New Jersey.\u201cEB-5 is a longstanding federal program that is frequently used by many large developers to raise funds and help create jobs,\u201d Kushner Companies\u2019 general counsel, Emily Wolf, said in a previous statement. \u201cKushner Companies utilized the program, fully complied with its rules and regulations and did nothing improper.\u201dReporting was contributed by Matt Apuzzo, Jo Becker, Jesse Drucker and William K.

{"Headline": "Builders Said Their Homes Were Out of a Flood Zone. Then Harvey Came.", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE WOODLANDS, Tex. \u2014 Leslie Martinez heard the floodwaters before she saw them. They rushed across the lawn, seeped around the doors and into the house. It was 2:15 a.m. on Aug. 28, three days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall. Her young daughter was asleep in her arms. Ms. Martinez\u2019s first reaction was to spread towels around the floor.After all, Ms. Martinez recalled, the home builder had assured her that \u201cflooding was not even a possibility\u201d when she and her husband purchased the house in this suburban enclave north of Houston in 2011. They would never have bought here otherwise. Flood insurance, of course, was neither required nor needed.Now, with the rains outside lashing and the water inside rising, the family and their terrified pet, a one-eyed goldendoodle named Coco, took refuge on the second floor. Later that day, rescue boats came and ferried them to safety.The flooding forced Ms. Martinez and her husband, John Ahearn, to borrow money from their parents and accept a donation from their daughter\u2019s school. It left them feeling furious and betrayed. \u201cI\u2019m scared that it\u2019s going to continue happening,\u201d Ms. Martinez said, even as she wondered how they had become the victims of something they had been told had a vanishingly small chance of coming to pass in such a short time since the purchase.What they did not know was that their home, and those of many of their flooded-out neighbors in this new section of The Woodlands, had been built on land that not long ago lay squarely, and sometimes soggily, in a flood plain.A New York Times examination found that in the years leading up to Hurricane Harvey, with a surging local economy fueling demand for new upscale housing, the developers of The Woodlands had used a wrinkle in the federal flood-mapping system \u2014 along with many dump trucks\u2019 worth of dirt \u2014 to lift dozens of lots out of the area officially deemed prone to flooding. What they had done, in effect, was create gerrymandered maps of risk.In Ms. Martinez\u2019s case, documents show, the land was raised less than 10 inches above the level that, under federal flood-insurance rules, would have required the family to be notified of their risk and purchase insurance. Other lots in their area were raised as little as 1.2 inches above that height.No one has suggested that the developers broke any laws, and the company that owns The Woodlands says it followed all applicable regulations and standards. But the experiences of the family of Ms. Martinez and their neighbors show that even when the mapping rules are followed to the letter, the results can be disastrous.Across the country, documents show, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the insurance program, has granted more than 150,000 map changes in the last five years. In some cases, lots were raised, and in others, levees, drainage systems, water-detention ponds and other methods changed the calculated flood risk for a swath of land.Many of these changes were unquestionably appropriate. But in the Houston area, a Times analysis of FEMA documents shows, at least 6,000 properties in redesignated zones were damaged during the flooding caused by Harvey.What happened in The Woodlands underscored one of the great lessons of Harvey\u2019s assault on Houston: the profound vulnerability of a metropolis with an ethos of untrammeled development built, essentially, on a swamp.Don Hickey, a 37-year resident of The Woodlands who was an early employee of Mr. Mitchell, said people paid more to live here in part because they felt they would be safe. Mr. Hickey, who works in real estate finance and is collaborating with fellow homeowners to get their flooding problems fixed, summarized the situation in caustic terms, saying, \u201cThe developer had an economic benefit to more aggressively develop land around the flood plain or spend less money on flood control.\u201dThe company says there has been no slippage of quality through the transition of ownership.\u201cSince development began at The Woodlands more than four decades ago, it has strived to be a model master-planned community. While ownership has changed, what has never changed \u2014 nor will ever change \u2014 is our strict adherence to standards and our commitment to our communities,\u201d said Grant Herlitz, president of the Howard Hughes Corporation.Hurricane Harvey, the company argues, was an exceptional flooding event, and all map revisions followed federal and local guidelines. \u201cTo the extent that standards are re-evaluated, we will do as we have always done and act in accordance with any new regulations,\u201d Mr. Herlitz said.The risk is defined by law, not nature: FEMA and the flood insurance program look to what is known as 100-year flood elevation to determine who needs to buy insurance. Anything lower than that is considered to be in the flood plain. Above that level, supposedly, is safety.To Mr. Blackburn, the 100-year line is too arbitrary for comfort. What\u2019s more, the flood maps have long been considered highly inaccurate.This led to a lot of unhappiness among homeowners forced to pay perhaps $5,000 annually for insurance that would cost less than a tenth of that outside the official flood plain.\u201cPeople started to come in and argue and said, \u2018You showed me in a flood plain and I\u2019m 40 feet above that level.\u2019 Because FEMA\u2019s topography was so inaccurate,\u201d said Larry A. Larson, director emeritus of the Association of State Floodplain Managers in Madison, Wis.By the 1980s, he said, the agency, too overwhelmed and underfinanced to make all the corrections itself, instituted new procedures for accepting revised elevation data from engineers hired by aggrieved citizens.Developers have taken advantage of the new system as well, FEMA documents show, with a range of techniques from hiring surveyors to correct elevations to building structures like levees and drainage channels. In one of the most common methods, developers truck in tons of soil \u2014 known as \u201cfill\u201d in the building trade \u2014 and dump it over wide areas to raise the elevation above the flood plain. Mr. Larson called changes that lifted the ground only slightly above the flood plain \u201ca bad idea\u201d because such areas generally remain prone to flooding.\u201cOnce a flood plain, always a flood plain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still got risk.\u201dHis observation was borne out in striking fashion in the neighborhoods covered by the two map revisions examined by The Times: Eighty of the 81 homes within those areas near Spring Creek \u2014 which flows through The Woodlands \u2014 sustained some degree of flooding, according to FEMA statistics.Harris County, home to large parts of suburban Houston, including the newer sections of The Woodlands, is one of a handful of districts around the nation that FEMA has granted a sort of shared authority in approving map revisions. Although the conditions of this authority are complex, and vary from district to district, others have used it to enforce standards that are more stringent \u2014 for example, generally requiring higher elevations for any change and pushing developments further from creeks than FEMA does.For its part, Harris County has stuck with FEMA\u2019s elevation standards. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to touch the FEMA process; we want to keep it intact,\u201d said Ataul Hannan, planning division director for the Harris County Flood Control District.What the county has done is put a great deal of effort, and expense, into creating special software model for more accurately calculating flooding risks and the wider effects of development in the relatively flat terrain of the Houston area, Mr. Hannan said. Comparing Harris County\u2019s regulations to those in other parts of the country is unfair, he added, because the topographies are so different.\u201cThe shrinkage of the flood maps,\u201d she said, \u201cis always treated in a very positive way.\u201dAs early as 2006, The Woodlands filed a plan for a new subdivision on thousands of acres containing \u201cwooded areas and a few rural home sites,\u201d according to documents obtained from Harris County. But it was not until the years leading up to 2011, when the Hughes Corporation put together the final pieces of its purchase of The Woodlands, that the housing market caught up with the plan. Houston shook off the wreckage of the subprime mortgage crisis and encountered a very different problem: a shortage of housing on the high end of the market.That influx would have all but saturated the existing home market, said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It drove a spike in land prices, allowing developers to consider new construction on relatively low-cost lots that previously would have been too costly to improve.\u201cThis would just give you the opportunity to make those extensive improvements and still come out ahead,\u201d Mr. Gilmer said.FEMA maps of The Woodlands showed a tantalizing stretch of undeveloped land hard by a waterway called Spring Creek \u2014 including acreage in the 2006 plan. Building right along the creek would have been out of the question, but farther south, portions of the land were slightly above the 100-year flood plain, according to the maps. Those who knew the land and its history saw warning signs. Nick Rife, whose family owned land in the area, said he used to hunt there \u201cwhen it wasn\u2019t flooded.\u201dBy bringing in thousands of dump truck loads of dirt, it would be possible to expand the acreage above the flood plain, making the whole area suitable for construction. That is exactly what The Woodlands decided to do, documents show.The former edges of the flood plain run through what are now the lots of Ms. Martinez and Mr. Hickey, the longtime Woodlands resident who once worked for Mr. Mitchell and had built a new home in the neighborhood. On the strip of land containing Wood Drake Place \u2014 Ms. Martinez\u2019s street \u2014 60,907 cubic yards of dirt were laid down. FEMA approved a map change for that area on Feb. 8, 2011, documents show. The large extrusion of development around Lake Reverie Place \u2014 Mr. Hickey\u2019s street \u2014 and the nearby Sundown Ridge Place got 19,890 cubic yards of dirt. On June 13, 2013, FEMA approved a map change for what would become lots for the 81 homes in those areas.The result: neighborhoods that seemed safe from flooding. When Esteban and Paola Sea\u00f1ez moved into their home next to Spring Creek in 2015, their mortgage company assured them that the plot was high and dry. When the couple asked about flood insurance, \u201cThey said, \u2018You don\u2019t even have to purchase it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sea\u00f1ez recalled.Last year, after water came within several feet of their door, Mr. Hickey\u2019s neighbors James and Gayle Soeder inquired about flood insurance. Initially, the agent warned that the policy would be very expensive; the house was in a flood plain, she said. Mr. Soeder, who knew he had bought a home at the 500-year elevation, asked her to check again. \u201cWe see that the flood plain was revised recently,\u201d the agent said. So, for a bargain rate of $450 per year, the Soeders became one of the families in the neighborhood to be covered by insurance when Harvey struck.Mr. Hickey dug into damage statistics and found that his recently constructed neighborhood flooded at far higher rates than others in The Woodlands. In older parts of the community, his research revealed, about 215 out of 33,000 homes flooded during Harvey, or less than 1 percent \u2014 a far smaller percentage than many other communities in the greater Houston area. Yet among homes built in more recent years in Harris County, 331 out of 4,993 flooded, or more than 6 percent.In the newest areas of that Harris County expansion, including those where the Soeder, the Hickey and the Sea\u00f1ez families live, 331 out of 1,450 homes were affected \u2014 a whopping 23 percent. Mr. Hickey questioned whether adequate measures had been taken in the fill project to provide water storage and drainage in big storms. Marc Crudgington, who bought his home the year after Ms. Martinez and her husband did, voiced similar concerns.\u201cThey\u2019ve filled in lakes that have been around forever just so they can build on them, and clear-cut trees like nobody\u2019s business,\u201d he said. \u201cOur name for it is not The Woodlands, it\u2019s Concrete Land.\u201dThe company stated that \u201cthe senior development team is \u2018essentially the same team\u2019 that has worked on The Woodlands for 25 years.\u201dTim Welbes, co-president of The Woodlands Development Company, said the company had complied with FEMA standards for its homes, but that the neighborhood had been overwhelmed by the storm\u2019s waters. \u201cWe met the standard,\u201d he said. \u201cThis event exceeded the standard.\u201dStill, at a recent meeting of The Woodlands Storm Drainage Task Force, residents expressed anger at local officials over the damage to homes from Hurricane Harvey \u2014 and, for many of them, from earlier floods. This task force was actually formed last year in response to previous flooding, and little had been done to improve the situation before Harvey.Steve English, 71, said the value of his house has dropped to $400,000 from $800,000 after the two floods. Hurricane Harvey brought 30 inches of water into his home.\u201cDo we all have to get to where our house is down to $50 and we have to walk out of here naked before you do anything?\u201d he said.Any fixes could take years, and are quite likely to require coordinating efforts among communities and the state of Texas. Until then, homeowners stew, fret and wait for the next big storm. Raul Giorgi, a real estate agent in The Woodlands for 35 years, owns a home near the Soeders that also was damaged.He made the same decision to buy there that his customers make \u2014 and, like his clients, his ability to dig through years of regulatory decisions and paperwork is limited. They look to real estate agents like him, he said, for information about risks, and he looks to the developers. \u201cWho am I? I\u2019m not an engineer,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I can do is trust the experts.\u201dNow, he says, \u201cI personally believe, in hindsight, this should not have been developed.\u201dJohn Schwartz and James Glanz reported from The Woodlands, and Andrew W. Lehren from New York. Robert Gebeloff contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Plan Aims to Slay a Reagan Target: The Government Beast", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneAnd yet to a Republican Party embroiled in a fundamental debate on how to shrink the government, it was an idea hard to resist: a direct shot at states\u2019 capacity to spend. Bruce Bartlett, then a conservative tax expert who would go on to serve under Reagan and his successor, George Bush, estimated that without federal deductibility, state and local spending would fall 14 percent.Reagan ultimately failed to kill the deduction. Mr. Bartlett, who often contributes to The New York Times, has come full circle to reject the Republican project to shrink the government at all costs. Still, his words from over 30 years ago provide an apt description of what drives Republican thinking in Congress today.High earners in Democratic counties are the most likely to receive a tax increase as a result of the repeal of the state and local tax deduction.But there is more strategic vision than is immediately evident. The plan to starve the beast of government by depriving it of money, it seems, is back in the saddle. This time around it might succeed where Reagan failed: Barring taxpayers from deducting state and local income taxes and limiting the property taxes they can deduct on their federal returns, the Republican bills could, for the first time, force high-tax states run by Democrats to capitulate.Excluding payroll taxes \u2014 which pay for Social Security and Medicare \u2014 federal tax revenues declined to 11.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 from 12.1 percent in 1980, when Reagan was elected, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a policy group of industrialized nations. That is a difference worth some $170 billion a year, in today\u2019s money.This bucks the trend among the rest of the countries in the group, with central government revenue increasing by about two percentage points of G.D.P., on average. But it also rows against the current of states and municipalities in the United States. From 1980 to 2016, state and local revenues increased to 8.5 percent of G.D.P., from 7.8 percent, the O.E.C.D. says \u2014 a rise worth $130 billion a year.That alone will call on states to fill the gap. \u201cA lot of responsibility for social programs is going to shift to the states,\u201d said Kim S. Rueben, director of the state and local finance initiative at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. This doesn\u2019t apply only to, say, New York or California \u2014 states with higher taxes funding more generous social programs. It applies to Mississippi, a poor, low-tax state that provides very little in social insurance and relies heavily on the federal government to provide a safety net.\u201cThis is one of the more strategic efforts in the starve-the-beast mode,\u201d said Lawrence F. Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard. \u201cNobody can be a blue state anymore. They are going after the flexibility of states to do things.\u201dIndeed, Republicans\u2019 new tax proposals seem to be taking the country a few decades back.Think about unemployment insurance. It didn\u2019t exist until 1935, when the Great Depression inspired Congress to write it into law, funded by a levy on businesses and granting states great leeway in carrying out the program. But states had been talking about it for two decades, and seven had already passed unemployment insurance provisions when Congress got involved. \u201cThis is the best example of the laboratory of democracy,\u201d said Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard.This is not to say that the state and local tax deduction is the ideal mechanism to bolster the finances of state and local governments. It is loaded heavily to benefit the rich, who pay the highest federal tax rates and are the most likely to itemize their deductions.It is unclear, moreover, to what extent the provisions in the Republican bills will, in fact, hinder state finances. Eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes raises their \u201cprice\u201d for taxpayers: Those paying a top federal rate of 35 percent get 35 percent off their state and local contributions. But the Republican bills \u2014 which still have to be mushed together into one piece of legislation \u2014 do other things, too.They expand the standard deduction, so fewer people will itemize their deductions in the first place. They also pare back the alternative minimum tax, which prevented some taxpayers from benefiting from the state and local deduction. Both these provisions could mute the effect of the changes in deductibility.\u201cThis will mitigate the effect in some ways,\u201d Ms. Rueben said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t eliminate it.\u201dToday, it seems inevitable that the federal government will shrink into an earlier version of itself. As Professor Goldin noted, it looks a bit the way it did in the early years of the 20th century, when the government had little money to pay for social policy.\u201cStates were the only place where social policy could be conceived of,\u201d she told me.Republican efforts to starve the beast imagine state governments falling in line with federal austerity. But as wages stagnate, inequality widens, and new social challenges like opioid addiction arise, that seems at odds with what the moment calls for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Wild Parties, No Pledging as Universities Crack Down on Fraternity Excesses", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter months of waiting, party night finally arrived on Dec. 2 for the brothers of Phi Kappa Psi at the University of Iowa. But this was no \u201cAnimal House\u201d gathering; it was held in the ballroom at a Hilton Garden Inn.IDs were checked at the door. Those old enough to drink got plastic bracelets with five pull tabs \u2014 one for each beer, wine or hard cider they would be permitted over the next three hours. Hard liquor was banned; Jell-O shots were definitely out. Security guards walked the floor.The party limped along, and by 10 p.m., an hour ahead of schedule, the staff was already cleaning up.Fraternity misbehavior has frustrated colleges as long as fraternities have been around. But now, amid worries about endemic binge drinking, sexual assault and a startling spate of deaths, schools are going beyond the old practice of shutting down individual houses to imposing broad restrictions on all Greek life.Concerns have grown to the point that some Big Ten presidents are inviting counterparts from around the country to a conference in April to talk about how to better control Greek life on campus. The president leading the effort is from Penn State, where one of the uglier deaths occurred, leading to criminal charges for more than two dozen students. A grand jury investigation made public on Friday faulted the university for not acting sooner and for ignoring obvious signs of a fraternity culture that had spun out of control.Notably, students themselves are beginning to take action.The moves are an attempt to prove to college officials that fraternities are indeed adult enough to govern themselves.\u201cIs it a cultural shift?\u201d asked Hank Nuwer, a journalism professor at Franklin College in Franklin, Ind., who studies hazing deaths. \u201cThat was the absolute missing link, getting undergraduates on board to police themselves.\u201dIn a tragedy that horrified college administrators, students and parents, a 19-year-old Penn State sophomore, Timothy Piazza, died in February after a hazing ritual at Beta Theta Pi. He had a ruptured spleen and traumatic brain injury. Mr. Piazza had been given 18 drinks in less than 90 minutes, and tumbled down a flight of stairs, but fraternity members waited nearly 12 hours to call for help, prosecutors say. Several students have been charged with involuntary manslaughter and aggravated assault and others face lesser charges, including hazing.There is no guarantee, of course, that the new measures will ultimately change fraternity behavior or avert tragedies. One of the more dispiriting aspects, Mr. Nuwer said, was that two of the deaths, at Penn State and at Louisiana State, involved fraternities that had promised to take strong steps against hazing.\u201cThese are the kind that have a respectable exterior, and then behind closed doors are doing whatever they want,\u201d he said.The grand jury on Friday said that Penn State had received a number of reports in recent years about dangerous behavior at fraternities including: paddling and punching pledges, making them drink bodily fluids and drink alcohol to the point of vomiting, and holding parties where women drank so much they were seen crawling on the floor before being taken into a fraternity brother\u2019s room.The report criticized the university for delegating much of the oversight to the student-led fraternity council, which the grand jury said was lenient on violations. The district attorney who led the investigation, Stacy Parks Miller, called the system a \u201cjoke and a catastrophe.\u201d\u201cSince the university has maintained control over employees directly responsible for overseeing the participation of students in fraternity life,\u201d the grand jury wrote, \u201cthe university bears the ultimate responsibility for the failure to supervise the safety of its students involved in the fraternity system.\u201dIn an aggressive response, Penn State said the grand jury and Ms. Miller had found an easy \u201cscapegoat\u201d for a widespread social problem by blaming the university.The university said many people were to blame, including parents who brought alcohol into fraternity houses. It also said it had made substantive reforms since Mr. Piazza\u2019s death, including taking over the primary role of monitoring and disciplining fraternities from the council. And it said it would permanently revoke recognition of fraternities for violations, as it did with Mr. Piazza\u2019s fraternity.Another school wrestling with the problem, the University of Iowa, ranked sixth in Princeton Review\u2019s list of the top \u201cparty schools\u201d for 2017. But the label lost its allure last spring when Kamil Jackowski, a freshman, was found unresponsive in his motel room while attending a fraternity formal in Missouri, and was later pronounced dead. Alcohol was a factor, according to the Camden County, Mo., medical examiner.The university immediately imposed a moratorium on alcohol at fraternity and sorority events. The moratorium remains in place, but as a reward for good behavior, 26 of the 36 fraternities and sororities at Iowa are being permitted to host one holiday party around the end of the year.Phi Kappa Psi and a sorority, Chi Omega, were the first to do so, and had to follow the new rules, which included guest lists crosschecked against photo identification; limits on the number, sizes and types of drinks; and sobriety monitors stationed at bathrooms, entrances and exits.Even so, there was only so much the university could control; several guests at the Phi Kappa Psi party, for instance, could be seen at the hotel\u2019s rooftop bar drinking before their party officially began.Ten chapters at Iowa have not received permission to resume parties because they violated the moratorium by holding an event with alcohol or committed some violation of the code of student life, according to the university. On a recent Friday night, two young men casually carried liquor bottles into one of those chapters, Phi Delta Theta, where people had gathered to watch a football game, and two more strolled out later holding plastic cups of beer.Asked later about whether the fraternity had run afoul of the moratorium that night, Anthony Rose and Jake Shiltz, the incoming and outgoing presidents, said they had become aware of a violation by one person, who was being dealt with. \u201cThe chapter is in full support and cooperation of the university\u2019s moratorium as well as Phi Delta Theta\u2019s alcohol-free housing policy,\u201d they said in a statement.There has been some backlash against the new rules among Iowa fraternity members, said Heath Schintler, a member of Delta Tau Delta who is the outgoing vice president of risk reduction and management on Iowa\u2019s fraternity council.\u201cFor better or worse, the ability to purchase and consume alcohol is seen as a right instead of a privilege,\u201d he said.Mr. Schintler, the son of a schoolteacher and retired sheriff\u2019s deputy from the small city of Kalona, Iowa, said he initially had no interest in joining a fraternity because of their \u201cAnimal House\u201d reputations. Then his older brother joined one and brought home literature extolling leadership, community and a sense of balance, mental and physical. He said he had found that through Delta Tau Delta, and \u201cit\u2019s been an absolutely marvelous experience.\u201dFraternities are a formidable force in college life, well financed, politically connected and a big source of alumni donations. The grand jury report cited alumni pressure as one reason Penn State had not acted more aggressively.Defenders say that fraternities promote a sense of community and belonging amid the stress of campus life, and they are a lure for many high school students choosing where to apply.Universities are also wary of being attacked for impeding freedom of speech and association. Instead, they are squeezing fraternities with regulations or trying to establish more direct control, as Penn State now is doing.\u201cWe may be seeing the slow attrition on the way to the end of Greek life, or we may see that by being forceful and aggressive, we will start to promote the behavior that is expected from a group of young men and young women who claim to be leaders in society,\u201d Eric Barron, the president of Penn State, said.Mr. Schintler, the Iowa fraternity leader, said that ultimately, the challenge was not in turning fraternity brothers into teetotalers but changing the widespread view of drinking as a form of rebellion, a game of chicken.\u201cI\u2019ve never had a conversation where somebody was, \u2018Oh my gosh, I blacked out last night, how do I prevent that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cPeople tend to think it\u2019s funny. They are lighthearted about it.\u201dJohn Peragine contributed reporting from Iowa City, and Steve Friess from Ann Arbor, Mich. Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla the Car Is a Household Name. Long Ago, So Was Nikola Tesla.", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Tesla is an electric car. Just about everybody knows that.But it is less widely known that the car was named for Nikola Tesla, an electrical engineer who was once renowned as the prototype of a genius inventor.While Tesla\u2019s star began to fade long ago, Elon Musk has contributed to something of a Nikola Tesla revival.In the age of Edison, Westinghouse, Marconi and J. P. Morgan, Tesla was a giant of innovation because of his contributions in the fields of electricity, radio and robotics.\u201cIt\u2019s a sociological fact that Elon Musk took the Tesla name and launched Nikola Tesla into the stratosphere,\u201d says Marc Seifer, the author of \u201cWizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla.\u201d \u201cTesla\u2019s risen to the surface again, and now he\u2019s getting his due.\u201dIn 1884, Tesla came to New York to work for Thomas Edison with the hope that Edison would help finance and develop a Tesla invention, an alternating-current motor and electrical system.But Edison was instead investing in highly inefficient direct-current (D.C.) systems, and he had Tesla re-engineer a D.C. power plant on Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan. The men soon parted company over a financial dispute.But George Westinghouse provided funding for Tesla\u2019s A.C. induction motors and devices, which soon came to dominate manufacturing and urban life. Unlike the D.C. motors of the time, Tesla\u2019s motors didn\u2019t create sparks or require expensive permanent magnets to operate. Instead, they used a rotating magnetic field that used power more efficiently in a basic design that is still the core of most electric motors.Tesla developed radio technology and tested it from 1892 through 1894. He called radio an \u201coscillator\u201d through which electricity is converted into high-frequency radio waves, enabling energy, sound and other transmissions over great distances.He envisioned a system that could transmit not only radio but also electricity across the globe. After successful experiments in Colorado Springs in 1899, Tesla began building what he called a global \u201cWorld System\u201d near Shoreham on Long Island, hoping to power vehicles, boats and aircraft wirelessly. Ultimately, he expected that anything that needed electricity would get it from the air much as we receive transmitted data, sound and images on smartphones. But he ran out of money, and J. P. Morgan Jr., who had provided financing, turned off the spigot.Tesla\u2019s ambitions outstripped his financing. He didn\u2019t focus on radio as a stand-alone technology. Instead, he conceived of entire systems, even if they were decades ahead of the time and not financially feasible.\u201cHe proved that you could send power a short distance,\u201d said Jane Alcorn, president of the Tesla Center. \u201cBut sending power a long distance is still proving to be a hurdle. It would be monumental if it could be done.\u201dAnother Tesla invention combined radio with a remote-control device. We\u2019d now call it a robotic drone.An innovation in the boat\u2019s circuitry \u2014 his \u201clogic gate\u201d \u2014 became an essential steppingstone to semiconductors.Tesla\u2019s tub-shaped, radio-controlled craft heralded the birth of what he called a \u201cteleautomaton\u201d; later, the world would settle on the word robot. We can see his influence in devices ranging from \u201csmart\u201d speakers like Amazon\u2019s Echo to missile-firing drone aircraft.Tesla proposed the development of torpedoes well before World War I. These weapons eventually emerged in another form \u2014 launched from submarines.Tesla failed to fully collaborate with well-capitalized industrial entities after World War I. His supreme abilities to conceptualize and create entire systems weren\u2019t enough for business success. He didn\u2019t manage to build successful alliances with those who could finance, build and scale up his creations.Tesla\u2019s achievements were awesome but incomplete. He created the A.C. energy system and the basics of radio communication and robotics but wasn\u2019t able to bring them all to fruition. His life shows that even for a brilliant inventor, innovation doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. It requires a broad spectrum of talents and skills. And lots of capital.An earlier version of this article misstated who named the carmaker Tesla after the inventor Nikola Tesla. It was Martin Eberhard, one of the company\u2019s founders, not Elon Musk, another founder and the current chief executive.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Congress Passes Stopgap Bill to Avoid Government Shutdown Against a Friday Deadline", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congress gave final approval on Thursday to legislation to keep the government funded into January, averting a government shutdown this weekend but kicking fights over issues like immigration, surveillance and health care into the new year.The stopgap spending bill extends government funding until Jan. 19 while also providing a short-term funding fix for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, whose financing lapsed at the end of September.The House passed the bill 231 to 188, with most Republicans voting for it and most Democrats opposing it. The Senate later gave its approval, as well, in a 66-to-32 vote.The extension of government funding saves Republicans from what would have been a colossal embarrassment just after they celebrated passage of the biggest tax rewrite in decades. But the lack of a resolution to several pressing issues leaves lawmakers facing a tough task when they return after the holidays, with the possibility of a high-stakes showdown when the next government funding deadline approaches.\u201cI guess we better recharge our batteries,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican. \u201cIt seems like Groundhog Day. We get up and do the same thing over and over and over again. It\u2019s maddening.\u201dSeparately, the House voted Thursday to approve $81 billion in additional disaster aid in response to this year\u2019s hurricanes and wildfires. But the Senate does not plan to take action on the aid package until the new year.The failure to resolve so many issues left bruised feelings in both parties. Promised bills to shield young immigrants from deportation, extend a surveillance program, bolster the military and stabilize health insurance markets were all left for another day.Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, declared the stopgap bill to be an \u201cepic failure of governing.\u201dBut the disappointment was not enough to keep Congress away from its holiday break.Lawmakers needed to take action because government funding was set to lapse at the end of Friday, though as Thursday began, it was unclear whether Republican leaders would be able to find the votes they needed to avert a crisis.Representative Alcee L. Hastings, Democrat of Florida, read Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet aloud at a House committee meeting and said that he knew no Democrat or Republican who wants to shut the government down. Mr. Trump, he said, needs to put his Twitter account \u201cunder his pillow and sleep on it rather than continue to divide this country the way that he has.\u201dOn Capitol Hill, the big question was whether enough Republicans would support the stopgap spending bill in the House in order to pass it.House Democrats showed little willingness to support a stopgap measure as they push for other priorities, including securing a deal to shield from deportation young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Such \u201cDreamers\u201d will have to wait until at least January for action on that issue.\u201cAll of us as members of Congress, we\u2019re eager to return to our families as soon as possible back across America,\u201d said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas. \u201cBut our Dreamers are left with fear and uncertainty about returning to their families and about their future.\u201dDemocrats complained that Congress was lurching from one crisis to the next, with a stack of big issues still unresolved, including a long-term spending deal.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be funding the government week to week, month to month, but yet my Republican friends have ended up doing just that,\u201d said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts. \u201cThey can\u2019t seem to get their act together.\u201dThe stopgap bill provides money for CHIP and community health centers through March. And it directs the secretary of health and human services to distribute leftover CHIP funds to states with the most urgent financial problems so they do not have to shut down the program.But the $2.85 billion provided for CHIP is far less than the five years of funds that congressional leaders had promised, and it is unclear whether those funds will be adequate. Some states had already begun to inform parents that their children could lose coverage early next year if Congress did not act. The bill does not provide the certainty that state officials had been seeking.\u201cI do not think this is anywhere close to enough money,\u201d said Bruce Lesley, the president of First Focus, a child advocacy group. \u201cFor a $12 billion to $14 billion program, this provides less than $3 billion for what is effectively six months\u201d \u2014 the first half of the 2018 fiscal year, which began in October.Leaders of both parties in the House and the Senate support legislation to provide five years of funds for CHIP, but they have been unable to agree on how to pay for it. The standoff over CHIP is remarkable because the program has had strong bipartisan support since it was created 20 years ago, when Bill Clinton was president and Republicans controlled both houses of Congress.It also comes after the Republicans passed the $1.5 trillion tax measure with little effort to pay for it.The stopgap bill also extends through Jan. 19 a statute that provides the legal basis for the National Security Agency and F.B.I.\u2019s warrantless surveillance program, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, which is set to expire on Dec. 31. Congress will have to return to the issue of whether to impose new privacy safeguards on that program as part of a longer-term extension.Nicholas Fandos, Robert Pear and Charlie Savage contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s First Major Trade Fight With China Could Be Over Solar Panels", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 With President Trump vowing to get tougher on trade, troubled American makers of everything from steel tubing and aluminum foil to washing machines have lined up to ask Washington for protection from foreign rivals.But Mr. Trump\u2019s first big international trade fight could be over solar panels.Major manufacturers in the United States and China, as well as numerous other businesses that buy and use solar panels, are readying for a clash that could begin as soon as January. The solar panel dispute comes at a time when senior administration officials have been signaling their intention to take a much tougher trade stance toward China, where most solar panels are made.China\u2019s push to become a major maker of solar panels has driven down global prices by close to 90 percent over the past decade, helping international efforts to curb emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases. That has blurred the lines over the pending solar trade fight even within the United States, where American manufacturers are squaring off against American installers and users of the panels.Chinese officials contend they are helping the world move toward cleaner energy. \u201cEverybody needs the kinds of cheaper panels, not only in China, but also the world,\u201d said Li Junfeng, a senior Chinese economic adviser and the architect of many of China\u2019s renewable energy policies, at The New York Times\u2019s Climate Tech conference on Thursday in San Francisco.But American manufacturers say the cheap panels have been unfairly financed by the Chinese government. Chinese manufacturers have benefited from cheap loans from government-run banks. Even some Chinese companies that have struggled with losses and had trouble making loan payments have been able to stay afloat.Such manufacturers in China \u201care technically insolvent, but they still get capital,\u201d said Mark Widmar, the chief executive of First Solar, a large manufacturer based in Phoenix.The United States has already imposed tariffs on solar panels from China over the past five years, prompting Chinese manufacturers to build vast factories in Southeast Asia. Now, the Trump administration has indicated it may raise the stakes by authorizing tariffs on all solar panel imports, including those from Southeast Asia.Administration officials have so far allowed two solar panel companies with factories in the United States to ask Washington for tariffs on all solar panel imports.Thanks to a complicated series of maneuvers within the United States system for evaluating trade cases, the Trump administration now has a Jan. 26 deadline to grant the companies\u2019 requests for wider tariffs.China opposes the move, which it argues would hurt solar panel buyers. When the Chinese-owned factories in Southeast Asia are included, Chinese panel makers account for about four-fifths of global sales.Solar panel installers, developers of utility-scale solar panel power generation projects and others connected to the industry also oppose broader tariffs. The Solar Energy Industries Association, which represents those groups, contends that the tariffs would destroy more installation jobs than they would protect or create among manufacturers.\u201cIf my price goes up, I\u2019m not going to win\u201d orders, Abigail Ross Hopper, the chief executive and president of the Washington-based association, said in a telephone interview.Yet the effects of tariffs are disputed within the industry. Solar panel makers in the United States say higher tariffs would add only modestly to the cost of projects.\u201cThat\u2019s still very compelling for any utility,\u201d said Mr. Widmar, of First Solar.Many trade experts predict the United States will impose tariffs on all solar panel imports, because Mr. Trump has expressed sympathy for industrial workers in the United States and for fossil fuels, while voicing skepticism about the use of renewable energy.If the Trump administration decides to impose more tariffs next month, it could be the first blow in a one-two punch to China on trade, making it even more likely that Beijing might retaliate against American exports. The deadline for the administration to act on possibly imposing tariffs on washing machines from around the world, and particularly from China, comes a little more than a week later, on Feb. 3.Mr. Li, the Chinese economic adviser, contended that China, not the United States, was the country that had proved willing to let market forces determine winners and losers in the solar panel market. China had 800 solar panel companies a decade ago and now has just 70 or 80, after allowing the rest to become insolvent. Yet China\u2019s solar panel production has more than quintupled in the past decade because, he said, Beijing has allowed market forces to winnow the industry to the most efficient competitors.\u201cYou are a little bit worried by Solyndra; very small companies, why are you worried about them?\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cThen you hurt all the users.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Is Fashion Having an Astral Moment?", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf anyone can restore proper awe to the notion of space travel, Buzz Aldrin can. At 87, Mr. Aldrin, who made history in 1969 when he set foot on the moon, has hung on to his plain-as-folk charm and easy, infectious enthusiasm.Those attractions may well factor into pop culture\u2019s resurrected romance with the pioneering astronaut, who raised his profile in recent years with guest spots on shows including \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d and an appearance at the Summer Olympics in Rio last year. In November Mr. Aldrin led the annual Veterans Day parade in New York City, serving as grand marshal.Unstoppable, it seems, he recently embarked on yet another life chapter: Last winter he strode the runway of the men\u2019s wear designer Nick Graham, showing off a silver foil jacket with distinctly aerodynamic loft. So it may have been only a matter of time before Mr. Aldrin made the leap to a mainstream brand.\u201cBuzz was the man who gave us a taste of space in the \u201960s,\u201d said David Ben-David, Sprayground\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cWe thought it would be cool to see where his head\u2019s at now.\u201dMr. Aldrin, a space evangelist preaching the gospel of interplanetary travel through his Space Share Foundation, said he had little practical input into the products\u2019 design. Their value, he maintained, is less in pushing the wares than in promoting a vision.\u201cThe idea of flying around in space, even though it seems a little far out, certainly catches young peoples\u2019 attention,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cEspecially when you jazz it up by carrying a briefcase that lights up in your hands.\u201dThis quirky rag-trade partnership resonates for sure in the popular culture, which is celebrating its own astral moment. The notion of space travel appears to be exerting a new hold on people\u2019s imaginations, seducing with the promise of a fresh start on unsullied terrain.\u201cEverything streams from the zeitgeist,\u201d said Daniel H. Wilson, a robotics engineer and the author of science fiction novels including \u201cA Clockwork Dynasty\u201d and \u201cRobogenesis.\u201d In the world of sci-fi publishing, he said, there has been tendency to forsake gloom-and-doom scenarios in favor of more exhilaratingly upbeat fare. The objective, it seems, is to revive the optimism of the late 1960s, when the promise of adventure and discovery \u2014 and the reality of a lunar landing \u2014 spawned a generalized blue-sky optimism.That mood contrasts mightily with the one of the moment. In a currently divisive, often chaotic sociopolitical climate, \u201cspace exploration offers a vision of escape that\u2019s really appealing,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cIf reality is dystopia, why shouldn\u2019t our dreams turn utopic?\u201dIt\u2019s a concept that seems to have wings. And it goes some way toward explaining why a novel like \u201cArtemis,\u201d an account of life on a lunar colony by Andy Weir (the author of \u201cThe Martian\u201d), quickly entered the New York Times best seller list. Or how \u201cStar Wars: the Last Jedi,\u201d which arrives in movie theaters next week, came to be one of this year\u2019s most anticipated releases.Interstellar travel has proved at least as intoxicating in the rarefied realms of art and style. Late last year, the sculptor Tom Sachs installed a interplanetary launch station at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, complete with space-suited astronauts and a plywood mock spaceship destined for a simulated mission to the moon. Elements of Mr. Sachs\u2019s D.I.Y. project were highlighted in an auction of space artifacts last summer at Sotheby\u2019s.Fashion is celebrating its own return to the galaxies. Past expeditions included those of Karl Lagerfeld, Rick Owens and Christophe Decarnin of Balmain, who nearly a decade ago cast a wistful backward glance at the swashbuckling universe of space-traveling superheroes, a universe earlier explored by Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges, Paco Rabanne and Pierre Cardin.Somehow their vision persists. This year Alessandro Michele of Gucci introduced fall 2017 advertising images of U.F.O.s, and beam-me-up-Scottie teleportation platforms. Mr. Lagerfeld, in his fall show, offered the spectacle of a simulated rocket launch to highlight a collection of sparkle tights, dresses and cap-toe boots, and a silver Mylar space blanket.Last spring, Stuart Vevers of Coach, no laggard in this latest fashion space race, unveiled a retro-futuristic capsule collection of NASA-themed handbags, light jackets and sweatshirts. \u201cThe collection is very nostalgic,\u201d Mr. Vevers said at the time. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the time of the space program that just gives this feeling of possibility.\u201d His cosmic references, he said, \u201care symbolic of a moment of ultimate American optimism and togetherness.\u201dMr. Aldrin, who predicts settlements on Mars by 2040, has loftier aims, some founded on his indelible recollections. \u201cYou\u2019ll always remember the times when you launch and when you\u2019re in a coasting condition \u2014 zero gravity,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is the view of other spacecraft that you\u2019re close to, and, of course, the landing, touching down on soil that in hundreds of thousands of years has been ground to a little fine dust.\u201cYou can\u2019t find anything like that here on Earth. It is exciting to see something that is so absolutely unreproducible.\u201dHe hopes to inspire a youthful generation, \u201cobsessed,\u201d in his phrase, with \u201cthe short-term payoff,\u201d to participate in a larger, more ennobling scheme. While not technically suited for space exploration, his backpacks and solar-panel flight jackets serve metaphorical function, he said, to remind wearers that they are but fragments in a whole, \u201cmembers of a team, part of something bigger than themselves.\u201dMr. Ben-David of Sprayground wants to share in that dream.

Lobbyists Kept it Alive.", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s signature on the Republican tax bill marks his most important legislative achievement to date. It also represents the breaking of a signature promise that helped propel his populist presidential campaign.This week, as senior White House officials acclaimed passage of the tax overhaul in Congress, they also expressed one regret: failing to close the so-called carried interest \u201cloophole\u201d that benefits wealthy hedge fund managers and private equity executives. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s vows to eliminate a tax rule that allows some rich business leaders to pay lower tax rates than their secretaries, the president in this case was no match for the powerful lobbyists protecting the status quo.\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the conservative economist who crafted Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign tax plan. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that thing survived,\u201d he said, adding \u201cI\u2019m sure the lobbying was intense.\u201dCarried interest is the percentage of an investment\u2019s gains that a private equity partner or hedge fund manager takes as compensation. At most private equity firms and hedge funds, the share of profits paid to managers is about 20 percent. Under existing law, that money is taxed at a capital-gains rate of 20 percent, which is about half of the top individual income rate, which is currently 39.6 percent and will fall to 37 percent under the final tax bill.Critics of the existing practice, which include both Democrats and Republicans and the billionaire Warren Buffett, argue that this money is effectively income and should be taxed as such at the ordinary individual income tax rate.Mr. Trump used to be one of those critics.\u201cThey make a fortune, they pay no tax,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to pay taxes.\u201dA year later, in a speech at the Detroit Economic Club, Mr. Trump was more explicit about what he planned to do about it if elected.\u201cWe will eliminate the carried interest deduction, well known deduction, and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors and for people like me but unfair to American workers,\u201d Mr. Trump said, incorrectly referring to the special treatment of carried interest as a tax deduction.So what happened?Gary D. Cohn, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said on Wednesday that the administration tried more than two dozen times to eliminate the carried interest loophole and that, as recently as this week, Mr. Trump asked why it was not gone.Mr. Cohn, a former top Goldman Sachs executive, said opposition from lobbyists and lawmakers on Capitol Hill was intense and that the best that could be done was to extend the \u201cholding period\u201d for investments that qualify for the tax break to three years from one.\u201cThe president strongly believes, and he ran on this, that carried interest is a loophole,\u201d Mr. Cohn said at an event sponsored by Axios. He said the president continues to believe that venture capitalists and hedge fund managers are getting a preferred rate of return on someone else\u2019s capital.While the president managed to get much of what he wanted in the tax bill, including a lower corporate rate and a lower top individual rate, Mr. Cohn suggested that Mr. Trump had met his match when it came to those carrying water for carried interest.\u201cThe reality of this town is that constituency has a very large presence in the House and the Senate, and they have really strong relationships on both sides of the aisle,\u201d he said.Critics pounded on that explanation, saying that Mr. Trump could have done away with it had he publicly intervened. Unlike the other provisions Mr. Trump advocated, eliminating the carried interest loophole would have actually raised revenue for the Treasury.\u201cEnding this specific Wall Street giveaway was a defining economic promise that Donald Trump made to the American people, claiming that it set him apart from other Republicans,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Democratic political action committee American Bridge. \u201cThis is the latest proof that Trump\u2019s rhetoric on the campaign trail was nothing but empty.\u201dLobbyists for private equity, venture capital and real estate groups, aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to carried interest, mobilized their forces early this year to prevent the carried interest tax break from being eliminated. In particular, they sought to ensure that tax preferences for long-term investment were not scrapped as part of an effort to punish hedge fund managers, who typically turn over investments more quickly.The groups appealed to lawmakers as engines of job creation, saying their industries were responsible for creating millions of jobs across the country. They pressured Republicans, particularly in the House, to fight to keep their taxes from going up. They also took their battle to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary and former hedge fund manager, who has publicly sympathized with their arguments.To the industries that enjoy the tax break and the lawmakers who do their bidding, the stakes were clearly high.During the last few months, lawmakers who were central to the process of rewriting the tax code would often dodge the question and say they did not know what was happening with carried interest when asked about it in the halls of the Capitol.Ultimately, it was largely left alone.\u201cThe private equity, venture capital and real estate industries won on carried interest because they stressed the critical role that long-term investment plays in the U.S. economy, and they pushed all the right levers along the way,\u201d said Ken Spain, a Washington-based consultant who has worked with the private equity industry on tax issues.While Mr. Sommers was generally pleased with the outcome of the tax bill, he said it was still disappointing that the term \u201ccarried interest\u201d is now being written in the tax code for the first time. This makes it more likely that future lawmakers will try to raise taxes on private equity funds. Also, while the three-year holding period will not affect many firms that hold onto assets longer, he said it could scuttle some deals that might have otherwise happened more quickly.Mr. Sommers said that there was tension both within the White House and among Republicans in Congress throughout the year on how carried interest would be handled. He said that Mr. Mnuchin was often the mediator who pushed to protect private equity.\u201cWhat came out of this is what I would call the Mnuchin compromise,\u201d Mr. Sommers said. \u201cHe wanted to make sure that we weren\u2019t discouraging the kind of investment that we provide. Secretary Mnuchin certainly would be an all-star on this in terms of our perspective.\u201dEven with all of the investment industry\u2019s lobbying muscle, Mr. Sommers said that the wild card was the person living in the White House, and that he could never be too sure how things would play out. Mr. Trump made a habit throughout the process of wading into the tax debate through Twitter, sending lawmakers scrambling.\u201cWe of course were concerned about an errant tweet from President Trump on this, or him doing something,\u201d Mr. Sommers said.In this case, the tweet never came.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "William Agee, \u201970s C.E.O. Whose Star Was Dimmed, Dies at 79", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWilliam Agee was 38 and a rising corporate star in 1976 when the Bendix Corporation, a large auto parts maker, made him one of the youngest chief executives of a major American company.Handsome and articulate, with an M.B.A. from Harvard, Mr. Agee personified a new, more fast-moving, less bureaucratic management style that was starting to take hold. He got rid of Bendix\u2019s boardroom table as a stodgy artifact of the past, banned executive parking spaces and often dressed in a style now known as business casual.Three years after he took the reins at Bendix, Time magazine featured him in a cover article with the headline \u201cFaces of the Future.\u201d He was personally appealing, and so was his message: Success at his company should be based on merit rather than seniority or tradition. He acted on that notion by recruiting and promoting young managers.As it turned out, it was a recruiting decision \u2014 the hiring in spring 1979 of a bright, promising female employee named Mary Cunningham \u2014 and Mr. Agee\u2019s subsequent handling of their relationship that largely defined his business career, touching off a national discussion about workplace behavior that reverberates today.Mr. Agee died on Wednesday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle. He was 79. His daughter Suzanne Agee said the cause was respiratory failure as a complication of scleroderma, a degenerative disease in which the immune system harms healthy tissue.Mr. Agee originally hired Ms. Cunningham, who also had a Harvard M.B.A., as his executive assistant. She quickly moved up the ranks at Bendix, becoming vice president for strategic planning within 15 months.Soon after that, however, she was forced to leave the company under pressure amid allegations that she and Mr. Agee were having an affair \u2014 something they both denied. They later divorced their spouses, and they married in 1982.Ms. Cunningham\u2019s abrupt departure from Bendix provided fodder for months of newspaper and magazine articles and commentary. The author Gail Sheehy wrote a syndicated newspaper series titled \u201cThe Saga of Mary Cunningham.\u201dIn her book \u201cPowerplay: What Really Happened at Bendix,\u201d written with Fran Schumer and published in 1984, Ms. Cunningham denied that she and Mr. Agee had a sexual relationship while they were co-workers. But she admitted to being \u201cvery na\u00efve\u201d and said she had miscalculated the strength of gender stereotypes inside the company.\u201cIt was my very competence that threatened them,\u201d she wrote.Although the episode differed in key respects from the current wave of sex-related office scandals \u2014 the question then centered on romance-fueled favoritism, not harassment or assault \u2014 it helped lay the foundation for the current debate over gender and behavior in the workplace, especially the dynamics involved when one of the people in a relationship is the boss.Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Human Resources at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said the drama that swirled around Mr. Agee and Ms. Cunningham at Bendix had \u201ca big effect, especially on boards\u201d at large public companies. In recent years, Mr. Cappelli noted, boards have pushed out senior executives at corporations including Best Buy, Boeing and Hewlett-Packard for inappropriate behavior, typically affairs with subordinates.William McReynolds Agee was born on Jan. 5, 1938, in Boise, Idaho. (He later changed his middle name to Joseph.) His father, Harold J. Agee, held various jobs, including manager at a manufacturing company, dairy farmer and state legislator. His mother was the former Suzanne McReynolds.Mr. Agee paid his own way at the University of Idaho while working in a supermarket\u2019s accounting department. After graduating from Harvard Business School, he joined the paper company Boise Cascade, earning a series of promotions and becoming chief financial officer at 31.He joined Bendix, which was based in a Detroit suburb, in 1972 and thrived immediately. He was named chief executive when W. Michael Blumenthal, his predecessor, left the company to become Treasury secretary under President Jimmy Carter.Bendix performed well under Mr. Agee at first, although his relationship with Ms. Cunningham raised questions about his judgment. His strength was mainly in finance. Increasing the value of a company\u2019s shares, he wrote in an Op-Ed essay in The New York Times, is \u201cthe foremost objective of responsible management.\u201dTo that end, he pursued asset sales, investments and mergers. But even as a deal maker, he was occasionally dogged by the public perception of his ties to Ms. Cunningham.When Bendix purchased a 5 percent stake in RCA in 1982, RCA rebuffed the move. \u201cMr. Agee,\u201d RCA said, \u201chas not demonstrated the ability to manage his own affairs, let alone someone else\u2019s.\u201dUltimately, an ill-conceived takeover attempt that year led to Mr. Agee\u2019s departure from Bendix.Seeking new markets, he bid for the rocket maker Martin Marietta. In what The Times described as \u201cone of the most bizarre takeover battles in American corporate history,\u201d Martin Marietta responded by trying to take over Bendix.Asked about her role, she told The Post: \u201cWhat was I supposed to do? Retire into the bedroom like the dutiful wife?\u201dIn 1988, he was back as a chief executive, this time at Morrison Knudsen, a construction company with headquarters in Boise that was known for building bridges, factories and dams. It was losing money when he took over, and he made a bet on moving into rail cars and locomotives. The plan looked promising for a while, but the big contracts to rebuild America\u2019s rail and public transit networks, which Mr. Agee was counting on, did not materialize. The board fired him in 1995.\u201cNobody controlled Bill Agee,\u201d she said.For the past 22 years, she and Mr. Agee lived in St. Helena, Calif. He managed his investments, consulted for businesses and worked as a local philanthropist and volunteer, reading once a week to the youngest students at a Roman Catholic school.In addition to Ms. Cunningham Agee and his daughter Suzanne, from his first marriage, to Diane Weaver, Mr. Agee is survived by two other children from that marriage, Kathryn Gillis and Robert William Agee; two children from his second marriage, Mary Alana Kurz and William Nolan Agee; two sisters, Carolyn Hjort and Jacqueline Agee; and eight grandchildren.Mr. Agee\u2019s second marriage caused a break with his children from his first, and even from his mother. She refused to speak to him, prompting him to legally change his middle name in 1990, after she had died, so that it was no longer her maiden name.The estrangement between the two families lasted for decades. But in October, Suzanne Agee said, her father, in frail health, contacted the children from his first marriage, all of whom live in Seattle, and went to stay with them.\u201cThat was the great gift of these last two months,\u201d she said, \u201call of us spending time with my father.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the current name of the company once known as Allied Corporation. It is Honeywell, not Allied Signal. (That company merged with Honeywell and took its name in 1999.)Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Working Families Party Starts Small, but Thinks Big", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the months leading to the November election, the Working Families Party spent thousands of dollars aiding left-leaning Democratic candidates in dozens of races across the state, often with relatively small amounts in contests for obscure offices. There was the $663 spent on a race for trustee in the Westchester County village of Croton-on-Hudson, or the $1,549 for a candidate running for Monroe County legislator.In taking a hyper-local view of politics, the party, which considers itself to be the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, is trying to lay the groundwork for bigger things. Party officials are focusing on small local races in the hopes of grooming politicians for more high-profile offices, like state legislator or a seat in Congress, while at the same time pushing the Democratic Party to the left.\u201cIf you want to build a progressive pipeline of candidates you\u2019ve got to give people some steppingstones,\u201d said Bill Lipton, the party\u2019s New York State director. \u201cThey have to learn how to govern. They have to develop a track record.\u201dThe Working Families Party has gradually increased its presence across the state. This year it identified 148 contests as priority races, winning 109 of them. Two years earlier, the party prioritized 111 candidates, winning 71 of those races. Two years before that, it backed 38 candidates and 25 of them won.But the party, which is much smaller than the state Democratic Party and has far fewer resources, is not spending large amounts on television ads or mailings. Instead, it puts resources into coaching a candidate or training candidates or volunteers to use voter databases to pinpoint possible supporters.\u201cWe are providing expertise and additional resources to progressive local Democratic allies,\u201d Mr. Lipton said, adding that the state Democratic Party has little or no engagement with most local candidates. \u201cWe train people how to do a stump speech, we get donors to give money, we get unions to endorse.\u201dIn some cases, Working Families also contracts with local Democrats to bring in paid canvassers or organizers \u2014 filling a void left by the state Democratic committee, which has not typically been involved to that extent in lower level races, and by county committees, which often do not have the organizational resources. That was the case this year in Dutchess County, where canvassing by Working Families helped boost the number of Democrats elected to the 25-member County Legislature from seven to 11.\u201cThey fill that gap when we need more people on the ground,\u201d said Elisa Sumner, the Democratic Party chairwoman in the county.Working Families has also benefited from grass-roots Democratic anger after the election of President Trump.David Wasserman, an editor at the Cook Political Report, said that the surge of Democrats running for and winning local offices across the country is part of the cyclical nature of politics.\u201cSometimes it takes an election loss to regrow,\u201d Mr. Wasserman said. \u201cWe saw this on the Republican side in the early stages of the Obama era, and we\u2019re seeing it on the Democratic side now. It\u2019s a natural and healthy regrowth for a party that had lost a lot of ground locally.\u201dHe added, \u201cThis is a story of Democrats being angry and running because anger is a stronger motivator than love.\u201dIn some cases this year, the Working Families Party supported candidates running in Democratic primaries in heavily Democratic areas where the primary was the only contested race.One of those candidates was Alfredo Balarin. He had never run for office before he took on an incumbent Democrat in a four-way primary race for a seat on the Albany Common Council, the city legislature. Mr. Balarin won the primary in September with 161 votes, which was 22 more than the incumbent who came in second. Then he went on to win the general election in November.Mr. Balarin, 37, a college administrator who has been active in his neighborhood association, attended candidate training sessions held by the Working Families Party, which helped him learn the basics of running for office. The party also provided him a staff member and volunteers as the primary neared. The party reported spending $2,065 on his campaign.\u201cIn a four-way race, going up against an incumbent, I had a lot of people saying I was wasting my time,\u201d Mr. Balarin said. \u201cGetting the technical support was critical.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tax Bill That Inequality Created", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMost Americans know that the Republican tax bill will widen economic inequality by lavishing breaks on corporations and the wealthy while taking benefits away from the poor and the middle class. What many may not realize is that growing inequality helped create the bill in the first place.As a smaller and smaller group of people cornered an ever-larger share of the nation\u2019s wealth, so too did they gain an ever-larger share of political power. They became, in effect, kingmakers; the tax bill is a natural consequence of their long effort to bend American politics to serve their interests.Most political campaigns now rely on a small group of wealthy donors who give tens of thousands of dollars or more per election cycle. About 40 percent of contributions to campaigns during the 2016 federal election came from an elite group of 24,949 donors, equivalent to 0.01 percent of the adult population. In 1980, the top 0.01 percent accounted for only 15 percent of all contributions, according to an analysis by Adam Bonica, a Stanford professor, and his collaborators.Of course, the growing importance of wealthy donors is not exclusively a Republican phenomenon. Democratic candidates have also benefited from the largess of wealthy donors like George Soros, Tom Steyer and James Simons. But on economic and tax issues, big-money liberal donors have not really shoved their party to the far left. Donations from Wall Street and corporate America have, in fact, pushed many Democrats to the center or even to the right on issues like financial regulation, international trade, antitrust policy and welfare reform.Further, liberal donors have been nowhere near as skillful at coordinating their giving as conservative donors have been. No liberal organization comes close to rivaling the network of donors and political activists created by the conservative Koch brothers, says Theda Skocpol, a professor at Harvard, who has written extensively about these issues. The Koch network has spent years methodically pushing state and federal lawmakers to cut regulations, taxes and government programs for the poor and the middle class. The leading donor network on the left, the Democracy Alliance, is smaller and much less successful.But the cuts have done little to bolster the economy or the working class. In fact, incomes have stagnated, and workers have been forced to part with a larger share of their pretax earnings in the form of payroll taxes.Inequality in America does not have to be self-perpetuating. When people turn up at the polls, as they did recently in Alabama, they can produce unexpected results. That\u2019s why Republican lawmakers might want to think again about whether they want to be the means through which their wealthy donors pull off this heist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paid Parental Leave, Except for Most Who Need It", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityThey must return to work right away unless they can afford to stay at home in the absence of remuneration (federal law provides for 12 weeks of unpaid leave), but how many correction officers, more than 40 percent of whom are female, wind up married to bond traders? The city\u2019s structured inequality got, in effect, another load-bearing wall.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we get the month? You have to start somewhere,\u2019\u2019 Jim Gannon, a spokesman for the union, told me. \u201cWe were at zero; this was a big victory.\u201dHowever much we\u2019d like to believe that the patriarchy is toppling because Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer have been expunged from television, there is still a great distance to go before the many remnants hit the ground. There is a special resonance to the fact that New York City schoolteachers, most of them women, do not receive paid parental leave. They are forced to hoard sick days or rely on the good luck that they will give birth at the end of June. The low regard in which teachers are held has been an expression of collective misogyny for decades. Into the 1960s, teachers hid pregnancies as long as they could because the law mandated that they tell principals as soon as they discovered they were expecting and begin unpaid leave right away.Jessica Jean-Marie, who teaches at Harvest Collegiate High School, laid out the dilemma. Her second child is due at the end of January. The Department of Education gives teachers 10 sick days a year, and she has accumulated 17, giving her three weeks of hiatus. She can borrow 20 days from the future, but if she or her children get sick and she actually has to use them next year or the year after, she would be in debt to the system. If teachers leave or quit still owing days, their final pay is docked.\u201cI\u2019ve been to school with strep and the flu, but when my son is sick it\u2019s another story,\u201d Ali Phetteplace, a sixth-grade math teacher in Queens who is having a second child this spring, told me. \u201cYou have to choose between your kid and 30 others, and it\u2019s a terrible feeling.\u201d She waited six years between having her two children in part to accrue enough time off for an adequate leave, but health issues left her on the negative side of the ledger, and so she will have only eight days paid for when she delivers her baby.Many unionized city employees, among them the 125,000 members of DC 37, which is the largest municipal public employee union in the country, can, in certain instances, use disability insurance for maternity leave, which provides partial pay for several weeks. In the case of DC 37, the pay is $200 a week. Beyond that, the continued association of pregnancy with sickness perpetuates the benighted notion of childbearing as a threat to ordinary human experience when many would argue that it is the singular manifestation of it. \u201cWe are supposed to be at the forefront of progressive thinking,\u201d another pregnant teacher, Melody Anastasiou, remarked, \u201cand I don\u2019t understand why more politicians, including our mayor, are just not embarrassed.\u201d Another white-collar union worker, I spoke with, not a teacher, said she had chosen the public sector over the private because she believed it would be easier on family life. She now regrets the decision.The city maintains that if it offered the parental-leave benefit to every city worker who needed it, the cost to taxpayers would amount to approximately $1 billion over four years. Union leaders have pointed to a report from the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office to show that the city did not lose money providing parental leave to managers; in fact, it saved money, because it financed the benefit by rescinding a pay raise and eliminating some vacation days. Not surprisingly, these leaders don\u2019t want to give something up to get something they consider essential. Among the unions, the United Federation of Teachers has been the most vocal in calling for parental leave; conversations between the city and unions are ongoing.Led by its first female mayor, Megan Barry, the city of Nashville earlier this year managed to adopt a paid-family-leave plan that covers all municipal workers employed directly by the city, indicating, once again, that there are lessons to be gleaned from a look at life outside the bubble.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Business Schools Now Teaching #MeToo, N.F.L. Protests and Trump", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNASHVILLE \u2014 Tim Vogus, a professor at Vanderbilt University\u2019s business school, was stoking the debate in his classroom one day this fall, asking first-year M.B.A. students about one of the most successful, and controversial, companies of the day. On the syllabus was Uber, a case study in both sensational business success and rampant corporate misbehavior.There were some awkward chuckles, and then hands started popping up. \u201cIt\u2019s carrying fraternity culture with you into adult life,\u201d said one student, Nick Glennon. Another student, Jonathon Brangan, said, \u201cIt\u2019s arrogance mixed with the feeling of invincibility.\u201d\u201cYou basically have these 20-year-olds who are in charge of these companies that are worth billions of dollars,\u201d said Monroe Stadler, 26. \u201cAnd they fly too close to the sun.\u201dAn M.B.A. education is no longer just about finance, marketing, accounting and economics. As topics like sexual harassment dominate the national conversation and chief executives weigh in on the ethical and social issues of the day, business schools around the country are hastily reshaping their curriculums with case studies ripped straight from the headlines.At Vanderbilt, there are classes on Uber and \u201cbro\u201d culture. At Stanford, students are studying sexual harassment in the workplace. And at Harvard, the debate encompasses sexism and free speech.\u201cSomething has changed,\u201d said Ed Soule, a professor at the Georgetown McDonough School of Business. \u201cI would be kidding you if I told you there wasn\u2019t a different vibe in the classroom.\u201dThis fall, Professor Soule assigned coursework covering sexual harassment at Uber, how companies like Amazon respond when attacked by Mr. Trump and the social justice protests by N.F.L. players.During one class, students debated whether players should have been more deferential to the wishes of team owners and the league, or whether the league should have supported players more vocally. The conversation grew tense when the topic turned to respect for the national anthem, and Mr. Trump\u2019s forceful response to players who continued to kneel as it was played.\u201cEthics and values have taken on more significance,\u201d Professor Soule said. \u201cIt has to do with all of the things going on in this administration, often things that challenge our understanding of ethics and leadership.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a growing body of M.B.A.s who are really passionate about this,\u201d said LaToya Marc, who graduated from Harvard Business School last spring and now works in sales and operations at Comcast. \u201cIt may not affect your bottom line directly, but it needs to be affecting how you make decisions.\u201dStudents also realize that as leaders of increasingly diverse work forces, they will need to understand their employees\u2019 perspectives on national debates, and how corporate decisions affect them.\u201cIt is a shift, absolutely, mostly because all of our companies are just starting to look a lot different,\u201d Ms. Marc said.One way that some business schools are responding is by drawing on the social sciences, like behavioral economics and psychology. The Stanford Graduate School of Business\u2019s ethics class \u2014 taught by two political scientists, one an expert in behavior and the other in game theory \u2014 sounds more like a course in human nature than in finance.A new topic this year is sexual harassment, and how to create a workplace culture in which people feel comfortable reporting it. The Stanford students studied psychological research showing that people are more willing to challenge authority if at least one other person joins them, and discussed ways to encourage such reporting.\u201cIt\u2019s not just how the C.E.O. of Uber was treating women,\u201d Ms. Mandelbaum said. \u201cThe bias is throughout the system.\u201d\u201cWe said, \u2018This is not just a gender issue. It\u2019s a business issue,\u2019\u201d Ms. Meyer said. \u201cIt has marketing implications, legal implications, H.R. implications.\u201dTwo dozen schools have started groups based on the program, including groups called the Manbassadors, for men committed to gender equity in business, at the business schools at Columbia, Dartmouth and Harvard.The goal is \u201cmaking sure that as men we\u2019re very aware of some of the privileges we\u2019re afforded simply because of gender,\u201d said Alen Amini, a third-year student at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth and a founder of its Manbassadors group.As previously taboo subjects enter the classroom debate, students and professors are still adjusting.At Vanderbilt, Professor Vogus solicited ideas from the class about how Uber might change its ways. One student suggested hiring fewer star engineers and more team players. Another proposed hiring a woman to lead human resources.\u201cWe have a \u2018C.E.-bro\u2019 culture in the technology sector today, but we\u2019ve had \u2018C.E.-bros\u2019 throughout time,\u201d said a student, April Hughes. \u201cEnron was an example of this. All the guys there thought they were smarter than everyone else.\u201dThe class turned testy, however, as students debated whether Uber\u2019s hard-charging culture might have been an asset.\u201cSome of that brashness was actually critical to the company being successful,\u201d said one student, Andrew Bininger.When the Uber conversation turned to gender and power dynamics, a female student suggested that women in the Vanderbilt M.B.A. program had to work harder than their male counterparts.\u201cThe women who do make it to business school are all super strong personalities, whereas the men here can float through without being the cream of the crop,\u201d Natalie Copley said, adding of the women in the class, \u201cThey\u2019re not meek little timid things.\u201dThat drew jeers from the men in the group, and Professor Vogus changed the subject.Advertisement"}

Now, in the worst-case scenario, one of its renowned clubs could face a ban from European competition next year if it qualifies, as well as limits on acquiring new players.At issue is whether A.C. Milan has a credible business plan that can stanch millions of dollars in losses and meet rules, known as Financial Fair Play, that prohibit clubs from spending beyond their means so club soccer does not turn into a battle of wealthy owners\u2019 bank accounts.At stake is not only the reputation of Milan and its owner, but also of UEFA\u2019s cornerstone financial regulations, which it says are critical to ensuring the health of clubs across the continent. UEFA is also examining the finances of Paris St.-Germain, the French champion, which acquired the two most expensive players in soccer history \u2014 Brazil\u2019s Neymar and the teenage France striker Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2014 despite warnings about the deals from UEFA\u2019s president, Aleksander Ceferin.A.C. Milan has said it remains confident it can refinance its debt and meet UEFA\u2019s standards.UEFA is unlikely to issue penalties to the club before May. There are a range of economic and sporting penalties the group can enforce, including restrictions on new signings and even a ban from playing in European competition, the setting in which A.C. Milan forged its international reputation. Its seven European Cups are more than any other team, except Real Madrid, has won.UEFA declined to comment on its plans or its discussions with A.C. Milan.Li\u2019s spending has failed to improve matters on the field for his new club. Twelve new players bought to return the team to glory have failed to jell, and the squad\u2019s struggles near the middle of the Italian league table cost the coach Vincenzo Montella his job. On Sunday, in its first game under its new coach, Gennaro Gattuso, Milan allowed goalkeeper Alberto Brignoli to score on a header in the final minute to give last-place Benevento a 2-2 tie \u2014 and its first point of the season.Li\u2019s $860 million takeover of A.C. Milan was the most expensive among a number of Chinese buyouts in global soccer in recent years. It has also proved to be the most troubled. With the deal on the verge of collapse after several missed deadlines, Li turned to the hedge fund firm Elliott Management, which lent him $354 million at more than 11 percent interest.Terms of the loan mean Elliott could take control of the club if Li does not repay Elliott in full by next year\u2019s deadline. The club said last month that it had entered into a two-month exclusive discussion period with an unidentified firm in an effort to refinance the loan.Ceferin, who became UEFA president in 2016, has talked tough about not being swayed by reputations when it comes to ensuring teams play by the rules. The situation with P.S.G. \u2014 whose Qatari owners have remade the club with more than $1 billion in acquisitions \u2014 has attracted the most attention because its purchases of Neymar and Mbapp\u00e9 in a single summer threatened its ability to comply with the Financial Fair Play regulations.P.S.G. is now trying to raise additional money before UEFA\u2019s financial controllers make their decision about its case. The club is likely to sell high-value players during next month\u2019s European transfer window, and its marketing department is trying to renegotiate key sponsorship agreements.UEFA will scrutinize those agreements because the governing body has questioned the amount the club has booked as income for some of its previous deals, notably an agreement with Qatar Tourism, which P.S.G. has claimed to be worth 200 million euros (about $235 million) a season.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At E.U. Meeting, a Hobbled Merkel and a Stalled Agenda", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 For the past decade or more, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has commanded the stage at European Union summit meetings. But as she strode through the red carpeted entrance at the start of this week\u2019s meeting, her usual aura was missing.Everyone understands that her era is ending. Even so, it was telling that as leaders arrived on Thursday for this meeting, France\u2019s energetic young president, Emmanuel Macron, was already there, responding to reporters. Smiling indulgently, Ms. Merkel went over to his side and said, \u201cOh, he\u2019s answering all the questions.\u201dThe paralysis in Berlin, however, with a new government not expected until March and Ms. Merkel weakened, has delayed what was meant to be the central task of the bloc \u2014 figuring out how to reform itself institutionally to ensure that the euro is weatherproof and sustainable, to avoid new shocks from member states like Greece, Spain and Italy.This was the summit meeting where European leaders were supposed to grapple with Mr. Macron\u2019s sweeping proposals for institutional change. But Ms. Merkel cannot move without a mandate. And while she participated in a relatively acrimonious dinner discussion Thursday night over migration, defending past policy about the need for bloc solidarity in distributing refugees, she has been noticeably media-averse, canceling her normal after-dinner news briefing.\u201cThere is a strong sense in Europe that something has to change and Germany will have to be at the center of that,\u201d said Jan Techau, a German political analyst. \u201cBut whether the issue is the economy or defense, I\u2019m not sure Germans feel that they can get it done, given Merkel\u2019s declining political capital. The problems are huge, but Germans are not sure we\u2019re up to it.\u201dEven more, Mr. Techau said, \u201cGerman and French ideas on European governance are very far from each other.\u201dWith Germany\u2019s caretaker government unable to make new policy, Mr. Macron and the commission cannot get a considered response, blocking progress. So the summit meeting discussed migration, with no decisions expected before June at the earliest, and nascent moves toward more cooperation and efficiency on European defense and procurement.In a symbolic gesture, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron gave a joint news conference at the conclusion of the meeting. She thanked him for his \u201cclose relations with us,\u2019\u2019 and said that French-German agreement was important for European solutions.But Mr. Macron noted, a touch wistfully, that \u201cGermany, which has constraints that go with its political system, just had its elections and is in the process of forming a government.\u201d He added, \u201cWe need a strong and stable German government to move forward.\u201dHe added that Ms. Merkel was busy building a coalition, \u201cbut we can still talk to one another, and we have the aim of converging in March\u201d their positions on eurozone reforms, so that the bloc could agree on a \u201croad map\u201d in June.On real substance, though, Europe waits for the Germans. The Social Democrats, who had originally refused to form a government with Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives, are beginning to negotiate just such a return. To enhance their profile, Social Democratic leaders have been pressing for a bigger role for Europe to stabilize the eurozone and carve out a clearer global role in the era of President Trump, when Washington has retreated from its traditional leadership of multilateral alliances, institutions and global trading systems.Both trial balloons, which were perceived as slightly desperate, were quickly shot down, and for good reason.The lesson of recent European elections \u2014 in Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Central Europe \u2014 is one of increased nationalism, populism and skepticism about \u201cmore Europe.\u201d Mr. Macron\u2019s election, which depended on the collapse of the two main parties from infighting and scandal, seems more like an outlier than the herald of a new European commitment.With impending European parliamentary elections and a change in European leadership in Brussels in 2019, the window for pushing through any serious change in European structures is very tight and closing \u2014 essentially the same window for getting an agreement on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc in March 2019.Simon Fraser, a former senior British diplomat with long experience in Brussels, sees positive energy in Mr. Macron\u2019s proposals and in his commitment to reform France\u2019s labor market.\u201cMacron wants to re-energize the E.U.,\u201d Mr. Fraser said. \u201cBut he\u2019s being left a bit high and dry by the Germans, and what Macron proposes won\u2019t get a lot of traction with Berlin. His big risk, with only about six months left to this European Commission, is to push too hard. He has a lot of cards, but he needs to play them very carefully.\u201dTo show that this time, NATO is on board with this new European initiative, NATO\u2019s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, made a rare appearance on Thursday at the meeting of European leaders.Elmar Brok, a conservative German member of the European Parliament, saw great progress now that British anxiety about European defense harming NATO has evaporated.\u201cWe\u2019ve advanced in 12 months more in defense than in the last 12 years, because the British no longer stopped us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the answer to spending more and more efficiently on defense.\u201dWhile the German elite talks of embracing Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas, only 12 percent of Germans regard the French-German partnership as crucial to the European Union, and 54 percent oppose Mr. Macron\u2019s proposal for a eurozone finance minister.German mistrust of Mr. Trump is high, with 88 percent believing Germany\u2019s security is best protected in the context of Europe, but only 32 percent want to spend any more money on defense. And three times as many Germans see refugees, and not Russia, as their biggest security concern. (The telephone poll of 1,005 people has a margin of error of 5 percentage points.)\u201cIn Germany there is a fin de si\u00e8cle quality around Merkel,\u201d he said, \u201cbut without an obvious successor, and there is none of the usual sense of power moving smoothly from one party to another. There\u2019s deep skepticism about political parties and what they have been delivering; populism survives and the uncertainties are stretching into 2018 \u2014 with new ones, like migration and worries over Italy.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s Brexit, Phase 2.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Russia Inquiry Began: A Campaign Aide, Drinks and Talk of Political Dirt", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 During a night of heavy drinking at an upscale London bar in May 2016, George Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, made a startling revelation to Australia\u2019s top diplomat in Britain: Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton.About three weeks earlier, Mr. Papadopoulos had been told that Moscow had thousands of emails that would embarrass Mrs. Clinton, apparently stolen in an effort to try to damage her campaign.The hacking and the revelation that a member of the Trump campaign may have had inside information about it were driving factors that led the F.B.I. to open an investigation in July 2016 into Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of President Trump\u2019s associates conspired.It was not, as Mr. Trump and other politicians have alleged, a dossier compiled by a former British spy hired by a rival campaign. Instead, it was firsthand information from one of America\u2019s closest intelligence allies.Interviews and previously undisclosed documents show that Mr. Papadopoulos played a critical role in this drama and reveal a Russian operation that was more aggressive and widespread than previously known. They add to an emerging portrait, gradually filled in over the past year in revelations by federal investigators, journalists and lawmakers, of Russians with government contacts trying to establish secret channels at various levels of the Trump campaign.They have also insisted that Mr. Papadopoulos was a low-level figure. But spies frequently target peripheral players as a way to gain insight and leverage.Russia, he said, had tried to \u201csuborn\u201d members of the Trump campaign.Mr. Papadopoulos had no experience on Russia issues. But during his job interview with Sam Clovis, a top early campaign aide, he saw an opening. He was told that improving relations with Russia was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top foreign policy goals, according to court papers, an account Mr. Clovis has denied.Traveling in Italy that March, Mr. Papadopoulos met Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese professor at a now-defunct London academy who had valuable contacts with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Mifsud showed little interest in Mr. Papadopoulos at first.But when he found out he was a Trump campaign adviser, he latched onto him, according to court records and emails obtained by The New York Times. Their joint goal was to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Moscow, or between their respective aides.In response to questions, Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s lawyers declined to provide a statement.Before the end of the month, Mr. Mifsud had arranged a meeting at a London cafe between Mr. Papadopoulos and Olga Polonskaya, a young woman from St. Petersburg whom he falsely described as Mr. Putin\u2019s niece. Although Ms. Polonskaya told The Times in a text message that her English skills are poor, her emails to Mr. Papadopoulos were largely fluent. \u201cWe are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\u201d Ms. Polonskaya wrote in one message.When Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy team gathered for the first time at the end of March in Washington, Mr. Papadopoulos said he had the contacts to set up a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Mr. Trump listened intently but apparently deferred to Jeff Sessions, then a senator from Alabama and head of the campaign\u2019s foreign policy team, according to participants in the meeting.Mr. Sessions, now the attorney general, initially did not reveal that discussion to Congress, because, he has said, he did not recall it. More recently, he said he pushed back against Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s proposal, at least partly because he did not want someone so unqualified to represent the campaign on such a sensitive matter.If the campaign wanted Mr. Papadopoulos to stand down, previously undisclosed emails obtained by The Times show that he either did not get the message or failed to heed it. He continued for months to try to arrange some kind of meeting with Russian representatives, keeping senior campaign advisers abreast of his efforts. Mr. Clovis ultimately encouraged him and another foreign policy adviser to travel to Moscow, but neither went because the campaign would not cover the cost.\u201cThat is a statesman speech,\u201d Mr. Mifsud agreed. Ms. Polonskaya wrote that she was pleased that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cposition toward Russia is much softer\u201d than that of other candidates.Stephen Miller, then a senior policy adviser to the campaign and now a top White House aide, was eager for Mr. Papadopoulos to serve as a surrogate, someone who could publicize Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy views without officially speaking for the campaign. But Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s first public attempt to do so was a disaster.From then on, Mr. Papadopoulos was more careful with the press \u2014 though he never regained the full trust of Mr. Clovis or several other campaign officials.Mr. Mifsud proposed to Mr. Papadopoulos that he, too, serve as a campaign surrogate. He could write op-eds under the guise of a \u201cneutral\u201d observer, he wrote in a previously undisclosed email, and follow Mr. Trump to his rallies as an accredited journalist while receiving briefings from the inside the campaign.In late April, at a London hotel, Mr. Mifsud told Mr. Papadopoulos that he had just learned from high-level Russian officials in Moscow that the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d on Mrs. Clinton in the form of \u201cthousands of emails,\u201d according to court documents. Although Russian hackers had been mining data from the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computers for months, that information was not yet public. Even the committee itself did not know.Whether Mr. Papadopoulos shared that information with anyone else in the campaign is one of many unanswered questions. He was mostly in contact with the campaign over emails. The day after Mr. Mifsud\u2019s revelation about the hacked emails, he told Mr. Miller in an email only that he had \u201cinteresting messages coming in from Moscow\u201d about a possible trip. The emails obtained by The Times show no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos discussed the stolen messages with the campaign.Not long after, however, he opened up to Mr. Downer, the Australian diplomat, about his contacts with the Russians. It is unclear whether Mr. Downer was fishing for that information that night in May 2016. The meeting at the bar came about because of a series of connections, beginning with an Israeli Embassy official who introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to another Australian diplomat in London.It is also not clear why, after getting the information in May, the Australian government waited two months to pass it to the F.B.I. In a statement, the Australian Embassy in Washington declined to provide details about the meeting or confirm that it occurred.\u201cAs a matter of principle and practice, the Australian government does not comment on matters relevant to active investigations,\u201d the statement said. The F.B.I. declined to comment.Once the information Mr. Papadopoulos had disclosed to the Australian diplomat reached the F.B.I., the bureau opened an investigation that became one of its most closely guarded secrets. Senior agents did not discuss it at the daily morning briefing, a classified setting where officials normally speak freely about highly sensitive operations.With so many strands coming in \u2014 about Mr. Papadopoulos, Mr. Page, the hackers and more \u2014 F.B.I. agents debated how aggressively to investigate the campaign\u2019s Russia ties, according to current and former officials familiar with the debate. Issuing subpoenas or questioning people, for example, could cause the investigation to burst into public view in the final months of a presidential campaign.It could also tip off the Russian government, which might try to cover its tracks. Some officials argued against taking such disruptive steps, especially since the F.B.I. would not be able to unravel the case before the election.Others believed that the possibility of a compromised presidential campaign was so serious that it warranted the most thorough, aggressive tactics. Even if the odds against a Trump presidency were long, these agents argued, it was prudent to take every precaution.Ultimately, the F.B.I. and Justice Department decided to keep the investigation quiet, a decision that Democrats in particular have criticized. And agents did not interview Mr. Papadopoulos until late January.He was hardly central to the daily running of the Trump campaign, yet Mr. Papadopoulos continuously found ways to make himself useful to senior Trump advisers. In September 2016, with the United Nations General Assembly approaching and stories circulating that Mrs. Clinton was going to meet with Mr. Sisi, the Egyptian president, Mr. Papadopoulos sent a message to Stephen K. Bannon, the campaign\u2019s chief executive, offering to broker a similar meeting for Mr. Trump.After days of scheduling discussions, the meeting was set and Mr. Papadopoulos sent a list of talking points to Mr. Bannon, according to people familiar with those interactions. Asked about his contacts with Mr. Papadopoulos, Mr. Bannon declined to comment.Mr. Trump\u2019s improbable victory raised Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s hopes that he might ascend to a top White House job. The election win also prompted a business proposal from Sergei Millian, a naturalized American citizen born in Belarus. After he had contacted Mr. Papadopoulos out of the blue over LinkedIn during the summer of 2016, the two met repeatedly in Manhattan.Mr. Millian has bragged of his ties to Mr. Trump \u2014 boasts that the president\u2019s advisers have said are overstated. He headed an obscure organization called the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce, some of whose board members and clients are difficult to confirm. Congress is investigating where he fits into the swirl of contacts with the Trump campaign, although he has said he is unfairly being scrutinized only because of his support for Mr. Trump.Mr. Millian proposed that he and Mr. Papadopoulos form an energy-related business that would be financed by Russian billionaires \u201cwho are not under sanctions\u201d and would \u201copen all doors for us\u201d at \u201cany level all the way to the top.\u201dOne billionaire, he said, wanted to explore the idea of opening a Trump-branded hotel in Moscow. \u201cI know the president will distance himself from business, but his children might be interested,\u201d he wrote.Nothing came of his proposals, partly because Mr. Papadopoulos was hoping that Michael T. Flynn, then Mr. Trump\u2019s pick to be national security adviser, might give him the energy portfolio at the National Security Council.The pair exchanged New Year\u2019s greetings in the final hours of 2016. \u201cHappy New Year, sir,\u201d Mr. Papadopoulos wrote.\u201cThank you and same to you, George. Happy New Year!\u201d Mr. Flynn responded, ahead of a year that seemed to hold great promise.But 2017 did not unfold that way.

{"Headline": "Kazakhstan Prizes Its Cowboys, but Few Want to Saddle Up for Harsh Life", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKERBULAQ, Kazakhstan \u2014 It has been a long, rough ride for the cowboys of Kazakhstan, descendants of the nomadic herders who roamed across Central Asia until Russia declared in 1864 that it could no longer tolerate their \u201cturbulent and unsettled character\u201d and would force them to settle down.Steadily stripped of their pastureland by Russian officials and settlers in the 19th century, and then of their cattle after Russia\u2019s 1917 revolution, nomads became hired hands on collective farms. But they still knew how to ride, becoming cowboys for the state instead of themselves.The state farms have now all gone, replaced by big private ranches and small family-owned herds, which also still need cowboys.But so harsh is life on the steppe that today\u2019s Kazakh cowboys, while proud of providing their rapidly modernizing nation with a link to its nomadic past, rarely want their own children to follow them into the saddle and instead urge them into more sedentary and better-paying work.Erlan Kozhakov, 63, a herder on the sandy scrubland between Kazakhstan\u2019s biggest city, Almaty, and the Chinese border, has three sons and three daughters, and all but one followed his advice not to be taken in by the romantic notions about herding cattle spread by schoolbooks that extol the glories of their country\u2019s nomadic traditions.Mr. Kozhakov is not really a nomad, as he returns each winter with his family to the same wood-and-brick shack on a frozen plateau with barns and cattle pens. But he and other herders like him represent the last remnants of a vanished past that Kazakhstan \u2014 now, thanks to immense oil reserves, slightly richer per capita than Russia \u2014 both celebrates and desperately wants to escape.Pausing for a cigarette on his horse while his sheep and cows vanished into the mist on the ice-covered steppe, Mr. Kozhakov, who learned to ride when he was 5, said he had seen American cowboys in films and envied what struck him as their cushy and carefree lives.\u201cThey have it so easy over there compared with us,\u201d he said, gesturing across an expanse of shrub land carpeted with frail, ice-frosted sagebrush. He earns less than $300 a month, which is only two-thirds of the national average, and is constantly reminded of how much better off many of his countrymen are by the expensive cars that race along a new highway built through his pastureland.He recently bought himself a new pair of leather and rubber riding boots lined with felt but still has cold feet after riding around each day from early morning until evening in frigid weather.While his oldest son, 38, works as a cowboy, his five other children, he said, \u201call see how hard this work is and want to do something else.\u201d His youngest daughter, the family\u2019s standout student with no interest in cows, is studying finance at a university in Almaty.Mr. Kozhakov\u2019s wife, Kenzhi, 57, who was raised on the other side of Kazakhstan near its western border with Russia, recalled a brutal side of nomadic traditions: She said she was \u201cstolen\u201d when, at 18, she made a trip east to visit her sister and was forced into marriage.\u201cHe saw me and decided he wanted me,\u201d she said, recalling how she had been effectively kidnapped by Mr. Kozhakov, whom she had never met before. She was held prisoner at his home, guarded by his mother and grandmother, until she agreed to marry him.\u201cFortunately, he still likes me,\u201d she said as she prepared a lunch of lamb and rice for her middle son, who recently returned home after losing his job as a driver near Almaty.The mockumentary remains so deeply upsetting, particularly to Kazakhstan\u2019s educated political and economic elite, that the police in the capital, Astana, recently arrested and fined six Czech students for dressing up in the revealing swimsuit, or mankini, favored by Mr. Cohen\u2019s spoof Kazakh journalist, Borat.The Russian project to uproot nomadic life, begun by tsarist administrators and pursued with particular zeal by communist commissars, was so successful that, by the time the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the only remnant of nomadic life left were the cowboys tethered to crumbling state farms.As the world\u2019s largest landlocked country, Kazakhstan covers an area nearly four times the size of Texas but has only 18 million people, a ratio that leaves plenty of open spaces for cattle and cowboys.In the first two decades after independence, Kazakhstan focused mostly on developing its oil fields and mostly ignored its cows, whose number declined steeply. Also neglected were cowboys.In 2012, the government decided, for both economic and cultural reasons, to start pouring money into the cattle industry. It sent groups of cowboys to train in North Dakota and brought in American cowboys to help out on the steppe. The number of cattle has since risen sharply.Nearly all of the money, however, went to big ranches linked to or owned by the government, not to small-time cowboys like Mr. Kozhakov. Instead of delighting in Kazakhstan\u2019s progress, both he and his wife say they miss the Soviet Union.His wife said she and her family were living in a remote camp without television or telephone when the Soviet Union fell apart and did not even know anything had happened until the state farm they were herding cattle for stopped sending supplies.\u201cWe knew nothing,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAll the leaders of the state farm were too busy dividing up the property among themselves to tell us anything.\u201dHer husband then found a job with a new private ranching company, which often delays salary payments and insists that its supplies of cattle fodder be used to feed only its own animals and not those owned by Mr. Kozhakov. He recently had to sell 200 of his sheep because he could not afford to feed them.\u201cThese new people count every penny,\u201d his wife complained, waxing nostalgic for Soviet days when, she said, nobody on the state farm paid much attention to who was doing what with whose money.Alidin, the 9-year-old son of another cowboy, Nurzhan Mazhit, in a pastureland about 100 miles away, said he had no intention of following in his father\u2019s footsteps and instead wanted to become like the wealthy rancher who visits the family periodically in an expensive car to check on his cows.Mr. Mazhit\u2019s wife, Rangul, said her five children, who live in a town near Almaty so they can go to school, cried whenever they came back to the steppe to visit their parents because life is so hard and they don\u2019t like animals. None of them want to be a cowboy like their father.\u201cMy sons see the owner of the cows drive up in his fancy Jeep, and they want to be him not their father,\u201d Ms. Mazhit said. One wants to be a doctor, another a police officer.Mr. Mazhit, who gets paid no salary and herds the owner\u2019s cattle in return for being allowed to feed his own livestock for free, said he was glad his children\u2019s horizons reach beyond life on the steppe. All the same, he hopes his own profession can live on.\u201cCowboys won\u2019t disappear,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they are the identity of Kazakhstan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Polish Parliament Reshapes Courts, Drawing Criticism", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARSAW \u2014 Poland\u2019s Parliament on Friday adopted widely condemned legislation to reshape the country\u2019s courts, shrugging off criticism from the European Union and local opponents that the measures would threaten the rule of law and place judges more firmly under government control.Leaders of the right-wing ruling party, Law and Justice, have long championed the laws as necessary to fix a broken judicial system and rid it of corruption. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the party\u2019s leader, and other officials have also defended Poland\u2019s sovereign right to structure its courts without outside interference.But Grzegorz Schetyna, head of the leading opposition party Civic Platform, told journalists after the vote: \u201cIt\u2019s a dark day for Polish democracy. Something embarrassing and shameful happened.\u201dMembers of the ruling party did not speak during Friday\u2019s parliamentary debate, saying they did not want to \u201cprovoke\u201d opponents. But after a protest group named Citizens of the Republic of Poland called upon Poles to converge on Parliament, several hundred people gathered outside. Some carried a huge Polish flag, sang the national anthem and chanted, \u201cFreedom, equality, democracy.\u201dThe president presented his own versions in the fall, which the ruling party then amended and approved on Friday.Opponents said these new versions did little to dispel the original concerns. The Venice Commission, a legal group attached to the Council of Europe, said on Friday that the draft laws constituted a \u201cserious threat to the independence of the judiciary.\u201dBut a top presidential aide, Pawel Mucha, addressing Parliament on Friday, said the bills were in line with the Polish Constitution and were needed for \u201cthe reform of the judiciary.\u201dLaw and Justice officials said Mr. Morawiecki, who has a background in international banking, would be better able to explain Poland\u2019s position to international critics. But their opponents said it was just a ploy to distract attention from Friday\u2019s court bills.Since Law and Justice took power in late 2015, relations between Warsaw and the European Union have been strained over concerns that Mr. Kaczynski was leading the country in an authoritarian direction.This week, the European Commission voted to take Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic before the International Court of Justice over the countries\u2019 refusal to accept refugees.Even before Friday\u2019s vote, the commission had initiated a disciplinary process over the Polish court legislation that could result in sanctions or even a loss of voting rights.Two bills were approved on Friday, the first involving the Supreme Court. Earlier legislation called for the entire court, made up of more than 80 judges, to be fired, with replacements appointed by the government.The new version lowers the retirement age for the court\u2019s judges to 65 from 70, effectively forcing the immediate removal of 40 percent of the justices. That bill was approved by a vote of 239 to 171.The second bill covered the National Judiciary Council, which selects the candidates to be judges. Previously, 15 of the council\u2019s 25 members were chosen by a panel of judges. Under the earlier proposal, those 15 would have needed approval by a majority vote in Parliament.Under the new version passed on Friday, candidates would need a 60 percent vote, although subsequent amendments meant that could revert to a simple majority vote in time. It passed 237 to 166.\u201cA free and independent Supreme Council has just fallen,\u201d said Monika Wielichowska, an opposition member of Parliament. \u201cYou have demolished the constitution and democracy. And now you\u2019re destroying the National Judiciary Council.\u201dThe bills must pass the Senate \u2014 a foregone conclusion given the ruling party\u2019s dominance in that chamber \u2014 and then be signed by the president. Mr. Duda is expected to do so this time, since their passage followed months of closed-door talks with Mr. Kaczynski over the legislation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Plan Crowns a Big Winner: Trump\u2019s Industry", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe real estate industry ended up with an even more generous depreciation timetable, allowing owners to shelter more income.And in a break from previous practice, rental and mortgage-interest income qualifies for a lower tax rate, the kind of special treatment traditionally reserved for long-term capital gains and certain qualified dividends.Real estate investment trusts, known as REITs, have extra cause for celebration. They are companies that make money by owning, financing and operating real estate. Both the Trump Organization and Kushner Companies, the family real estate firm partly owned by Mr. Kushner, have important deals with such trusts.A REIT functions like a mutual fund, but instead of assembling a portfolio of stocks, it allows people to invest in a bundle of real estate assets, both buildings and mortgages. More important is the way they are taxed. They pay no separate business tax and instead are required to pass along virtually all of their taxable income to shareholders, who pay the tax when they file individual returns.That\u2019s a big savings, and a big advantage. Those receiving mortgage-interest income outside a REIT would have to pay taxes based on ordinary rates.Kushner Companies has teamed up with another New York-based REIT, SL Green Realty Corporation, in several deals. They are collaborating on a development in Brooklyn, and SL Green lent Mr. Kushner\u2019s firm $85 million in 2016 to refinance its slice of the former headquarters of The New York Times in Manhattan.A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said the firm had not done any lobbying on the tax bill.Kurt Koegl, a partner at the national accounting firm Marcum, noted that a lower corporate tax rate would enable other kinds of companies to better compete with REITs.But REITs are favored in other ways. Individuals who borrow money to invest in a REIT will be able to deduct the interest they pay on the loan at the top individual rate. When it comes to paying taxes on the interest income they earn from that REIT investment, however, the new, lower pass-through rate would apply.\u201cThat\u2019s a great deal, and it\u2019s going to create giant new tax shelters,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The tax code generally tries to prohibit this kind of tax rate arbitrage, he added.The REIT advantage is one example of a broader issue: different tax treatment for similar activities.Writers of the congressional bills promised that their overhaul would simplify the tax code, but the intricacies of the changes create countless opportunities for gamesmanship.\u201cSuddenly, there are a dozen different tax rates that apply to different businesses, in different industries, and to different investments,\u201d said Adam Looney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury Department official. That means opportunities to come out ahead by making deals between these different groups or structuring businesses to take advantage of various provisions.That could lead to a flurry of restructuring and asset shifting that has no purpose other than lowering the tax rate. One business might borrow money to invest in another, or buy equipment and treat it as an expense and then lease it to another company.Ideally, the tax code is meant to encourage businesses to make sound economic decisions, and forgo activities whose sole purpose is to avoid taxes. But the proliferation of different business rates rewards loophole hunting and earnings shifting.\u201cThe speed with which they\u2019re doing this creates a level of ambiguity that will keep tax lawyers and tax professionals busy for 20 years,\u201d said Scott D. Michel, a tax lawyer with Caplin & Drysdale.For some industries, such accounting acrobatics may not be necessary. A Senate provision that is being marketed as an aid to small craft breweries would save money even for the largest beer, wine and liquor producers, whether they are in the United States or abroad.Foreign cruise lines that operate in the United States got a last-minute reprieve from a new tax that was in an earlier version of the Senate bill.Whistle-blowers and their attorneys are happy about a provision specifying that they can collect rewards based on criminal fines.Car dealers escaped the cap on interest deductions that apply to most other businesses. Private equity firms were not able to sidestep that cap, but they held on to most of the carried-interest benefit that allows private equity managers, hedge fund managers and real estate investors to pay a lower rate on much of their income. Firms will have to hold an asset for three years instead of one, but the average hold time is already more than five years.The energy industry also did well. Coal and natural gas would potentially benefit from provisions that undercut their renewable-energy competitors. In a reversal of more than four decades of national policy, the Senate bill would open a pristine 1.5-million-acre expanse of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration.House and Senate Republicans are still wrangling over the final version, and every comma is subject to change. But to some tax experts, an unlevel playing field that gives certain types of business and structures advantages over others is a bigger concern than a tax break for real estate or any other industry.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to look at the deals that are explicitly in the bill \u2014 like the special treatment of auto-dealer financing or whistle-blowers \u2014 and call out \u2018loophole,\u2019\u201d Mr. Looney of Brookings said. \u201cBut the big problems are the things that aren\u2019t specifically noted in the bill, but will arise because of tax planning.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I fall in the latter camp.So, what say you here?

It ranges from writers and humorists to artists, journalists, crafty people, gamers \u2014 really whatever service you think people will pay to receive. It\u2019s been growing, and has an indie flair to an ancient practice. (\u201cPatrons\u201d were quite common among artists hundreds of years ago.)But Patreon is also a business that has promised huge gains to its investors, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it manages these two audiences. This time it seemed to go too far in the direction of its investors; perhaps now that it\u2019s been burned, it\u2019ll keep a closer eye on its indie artists.Yes, this is an extended way of saying, \u201cLook how smart I am.\u201d But also, it\u2019s more: Do you think we\u2019re basically creating artificial, overinflated value in these alternative currencies that really has no long-term staying power? And do we think a plethora of other, potentially scam alternative currencies may draft on the surging power of Bitcoin? (Hint: The answer is \u201cyes.\u201d)No, seriously, I think for once you have a point. There\u2019s no earthly way that Litecoin becomes something people will use and consider valuable in the future. It\u2019s obviously being run up by bubbly speculation. But Bitcoin?

{"Headline": "How Big Tech Is Going After Your Health Care", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Daniel Poston, a second-year medical student in Manhattan, opened the App Store on his iPhone a couple of weeks ago, he was astonished to see an app for a new heart study prominently featured.People often learn about new research studies through in-person conversations with their doctors. But not only did this study, run by Stanford University, use a smartphone to recruit consumers, it was financed by Apple. And it involved using an app on the Apple Watch to try to identify irregular heart rhythms.\u201cIt\u2019s not inconceivable, by the time I graduate from medical school,\u201d Mr. Poston said, \u201cthat the entire practice of medicine can be revolutionized by technology.\u201dThe companies are accelerating their efforts to remake health care by developing or collaborating on new tools for consumers, patients, doctors, insurers and medical researchers. And they are increasingly investing in health start-ups.In the first 11 months of this year, 10 of the largest tech companies in the United States were involved in health care equity deals worth $2.7 billion, up from just $277 million for all of 2012, according to data from CB Insights, a research firm that tracks venture capital and start-ups.Each tech company is taking its own approach, betting that its core business strengths could ultimately improve people\u2019s health \u2014 or at least make health care more efficient. Apple, for example, has focused on its consumer products, Microsoft on online storage and analytics services, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, on data.Physicians and researchers caution that it is too soon to tell whether novel continuous-monitoring tools, like apps for watches and smartphones, will help reduce disease and prolong lives \u2014 or just send more people to doctors for unnecessary tests.But now they, and other companies, are more visibly focused on creating, or investing in, new kinds of technologies for doctors, patients and consumers.\u201cWe are creating devices that collect information, new molecular assays \u2014 and all of that is just to try to understand health at a deeper level,\u201d said Dr. Jessica L. Mega, Verily\u2019s chief medical officer.Apple is taking a different approach \u2014 using its popular iPhone and Apple Watch to help consumers better track and manage their health.\u201cApple is trying to drag medicine from where it currently takes place \u2014 in hospitals and clinics \u2014 and move it to the consumer side, to your phone,\u201d said Malay Gandhi, an executive in residence at Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm.In 2015, Apple introduced new software, called Apple ResearchKit, for health researchers. Stanford used it to develop an app to enroll volunteers in a heart study and track their physical activities, sleeping hours and fitness.Dr. Lloyd B. Minor, dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, said the app enabled researchers to smoothly enroll more than 54,000 patients \u2014 a large number for a study conducted by one medical center \u2014 and collect much more data than they could have otherwise.\u201cFor us, it was an eye-opener,\u201d he said.Stanford is also conducting the Apple Heart Study. It is intended to determine whether an app for the Apple Watch can accurately detect irregular heart rhythms \u2014 particularly those associated with atrial fibrillation, a condition that can lead to blood clots and strokes.If the app detects irregular heart rhythms, it will send participants a notification and offer them a free video consultation with a doctor. The study is not designed to assess whether people who used the watch app had a reduced incidence of stroke and cardiac death compared with people who did not use the app.Microsoft, already a major supplier of software and cloud services to medical centers, is also ramping up its health business.This year, the company announced an initiative, Healthcare NeXT, to create products for medical providers and patients using artificial intelligence and cloud services like speech recognition.\u201cWe\u2019re really focusing on what people in the health care world are doing today and how we can make it better,\u201d said Peter Lee, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for artificial intelligence and research.Facebook, too, has been expanding its business and research efforts in the health sector.And this year, Oculus, the virtual reality gear maker owned by Facebook, teamed up with Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles to develop V.R. simulations for doctors and medical students to practice handling high-risk pediatric medical emergencies.Dr. Topol of Scripps said tech companies had an opportunity to remake longstanding, cumbersome systems \u2014 like hospital alarms at a patient\u2019s bedside that go off dozens of times every day \u2014 and re-envision how health care is delivered.\u201cThere\u2019s not one tech company that isn\u2019t involved one way or another,\u201d Dr. Topol said. \u201cMany of the companies see this as somewhere between rescue and a great business opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Inside the backpack were all of the girl\u2019s clothes and a few personal possessions.Dahlia was hardly bigger than a toddler, but her mother claimed she was 5, which Ms. Nasim did not believe; 4 at most, she said.\u201cHer mother would always say, \u2018The last time when you didn\u2019t take her, she cried all day.\u2019 She begged me please take her,\u201d Ms. Nasim said. Their orphanages were not equipped for children younger than 5, but Dahlia was advanced for her apparent age, toilet trained and able to dress herself, and Ms. Nasim finally gave in. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d she said.Most of the women in Afghan jails are there for so-called morals crimes, like abandoning abusive husbands or having been charged with \u201cattempted adultery,\u201d which is the suspicion of leaving home to commit adultery.The women are hardly career criminals; most want what is best for their children, and that is not an adult jail, Ms. Nasim said. \u201cSome of them have been so desperate they threaten that they\u2019ll start beating their children if we don\u2019t take them.\u201dWhen journalists from The New York Times visited the group\u2019s Kabul center recently, Dahlia had only been out of prison a few months, and had not yet started going to school. (The school year ends in early December in Kabul.) But the girl had already learned how to sing the Afghan national anthem, which she did, solo and a cappella, to applause from the center\u2019s staff. Some 55 staff members, mostly women, work there.Women for Afghan Women runs four children\u2019s support centers around the country, housing 356 children. The future of those centers, however, is endangered.The American government expects the Afghan government to take over financing the orphanages, but Afghan officials say they do not have the funding or capacity to do so. American financing was continued recently for one more year, but is expected to run out after that, according to Afghan government officials.If the children\u2019s centers end up closing, it would double the population of innocent children in Afghan jails.Women for Afghan Women, which runs an extensive network of shelters and other facilities for vulnerable women and girls in Afghanistan, began opening the orphanages in 2009. \u201cSince then, with generous U.S. government support, we have offered lifesaving services to over 1,100 children whose families could not afford an alternative care while their mothers were serving their time in prison,\u201d Ms. Naderi said.The centers\u2019 supporters say they have been more successful than they originally imagined was possible. The children are taken to normal public schools in buses, but aside from occasional outings, most of their free time is spent in the center, where extra tutoring is available. The result is grades for the centers\u2019 children far above the average for children from less troubled homes \u2014 generally in the 90th percentile or better, according to Ms. Nasim.One of the Kabul center\u2019s high achievers was Laila Rasekh, 19, who did so well that she won scholarships first to a high school in India, and then to college. She now studies at Ashoka University in Haryana, India.Ms. Rasekh said her mother forced her into prostitution beginning at the age of 8. When her mother was sentenced to five years in prison for that crime, Ms. Rasekh would have had to join her mother in jail, even though she was a prosecution witness against her.Women for Afghan Women found out about Ms. Rasekh, however, and brought her to the child support center, where she spent five years before going on to India. \u201cIf the C.S.C. or W.A.W. wasn\u2019t there, if I had gone with my mother, I would have been in one of the prostitution centers in Kabul now,\u201d Ms. Rasekh said.What is needed is more such centers, not the closure of the few that now exist, said Bashir Ahmad Basharat, the director of the Child Protection Action Network, a joint government and private sector partnership that brings charities, international organizations and government agencies together to support child welfare programs.\u201cThere\u2019s a massive need to have more of these support centers,\u201d Mr. Basharat said. \u201cBut the U.S. government says the Afghan government should take over the ones there are, and the government can\u2019t afford even to support those four. If you close them, these kids will be forced back into jail with their mothers, or worse.\u201dThe four centers cost about $2 million annually to operate, Ms. Nasim said.Dahlia is precocious for a 4- or 5-year-old, so a staff member at her center asked how life in the center compared to prison.\u201cI was never in prison,\u201d she said, earnestly. She looked around, nervously, as if checking to see if anyone was contradicting her. \u201cI like it here.\u201dFahim Abed and Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a Company Actually Plans to Spend Its Tax Cut Money", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORO GRANDE, Calif. \u2014 Republicans have pitched their tax plan as an economic godsend that will offer deliverance from middling growth and set off a torrent of investment, hiring and raises. But at a quarry here in Southern California\u2019s high desert, the outcome doesn\u2019t look so straightforward.The pit of rock belongs to CalPortland, which mines limestone to create the cement that goes into some of the country\u2019s most iconic stadiums and hotels. The company would hardly object to keeping a chunk of profits that currently goes to the government. But the extra cash probably wouldn\u2019t be enough for CalPortland to expand immediately in ways requiring serious hiring.\u201cTen percent extra profit would be good,\u201d said Steven Regis, a senior vice president for corporate services at the company. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to fund big projects.\u201dLike executives across the country, Mr. Regis has spent the last few weeks scouring the House and Senate tax proposals for signs of hope for his industry \u2014 and new sources of pain.Mr. Regis\u2019s deliberations suggest why those executives \u2014 especially at manufacturers like CalPortland, the companies at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s vision for the economy \u2014 may have muted expectations.Many welcome tax savings, but each industry and company will make different calculations about whether and how to spend that money. Much will depend on what customers and suppliers do and, of course, on the vicissitudes of the American economy.\u201cYou always have competing interests for that cash,\u201d Mr. Regis said. \u201cDo you pay dividends? Do you buy new equipment? Do you buy out competitors? Do you add employees? Do you pay employees better?\u201dMany CalPortland drivers are unionized, and he expects a tax cut to produce demands for the wage increases that Republican sponsors said the tax plan would generate. Mr. Regis said he would like to oblige, but wasn\u2019t sure which of the company\u2019s priorities would win out.Mr. Regis, who says he \u201cleans to the right,\u201d said he believed in the economic logic of cutting corporate taxes to 20 percent from 35 percent. Yet he\u2019s worried about how the Republicans in Congress are pushing through their tax bills, quickly and without the support of Democrats. Can a business count on the provisions of a law that the other side might try to rewrite in a couple of years?\u201cI think it\u2019s bad news for the country to have one side make the rules,\u201d Mr. Regis said. \u201cIt was bad when they passed the health care bill; it\u2019s bad now if they pass the tax bill.\u201dThe uncertainty is particularly frustrating for a company like CalPortland, since its biggest spending commitments often have to be made far in advance. And the tax bills have fleeting components, like the idea of allowing companies to take the entire cost of equipment off their taxable income the year they start using it. In the House bill, that provision expires after five years. In the Senate version, it phases out gradually after five years and ends by the 10th year, 2027.In Washington, five or 10 years may be a lifetime. But CalPortland probably could not even get the permits for a new cement plant in that amount of time. The company, Mr. Regis noted, is not popping out iPhones \u2014 it is blowing up rocks in the desert.Workers at its quarry in Southern California blast limestone out of the ground once a week. They then load it into trucks, crush it, combine it with other minerals and heat it to 3,000 degrees in a giant kiln until it rains down like lava into a cooler.After being ground up, the cement that emerges travels to concrete plants, which operate a bit like massive bakeries \u2014 whipping the powder together with sand, more rock and water to form concrete. By law, the company has just 90 minutes to move that mud from one of its 100 concrete plants into the foundation of a building. CalPortland\u2019s proprietary mix has gone into the Hoover Dam, Los Angeles City Hall and the football stadium being built for the Los Angeles Rams and Chargers.Ryan Montgomery, whose father and grandfather worked here in Oro Grande, spends most days scooping limestone into a dump truck. \u201cIt may get a little bumpy,\u201d he says, before breaching a wall of boulders that shakes his cab, perched a healthy 30 feet from the ground.His loader \u2014 a sunflower yellow Caterpillar vehicle with an arm attached to an oversize shovel \u2014 costs $2.3 million. Replacing a pair of tires is a $50,000 expense, and the transmission goes for $130,000. The company leased the vehicle from a bank.Quicker expensing for tax purposes would not prompt CalPortland to make an upfront purchase of Mr. Montgomery\u2019s loader.\u201cGetting the money back faster definitely helps, but that\u2019s big money, and that big investment means we have to be able to have the cash or the financing available,\u201d Mr. Regis said. The company is slowly replenishing its bank account after six years \u2014 from 2008 to 2014, a period bridging a housing bust and a fragile economy \u2014 in which it did not turn a profit.On the rise once more, CalPortland is making new bets on its future that will take years to pan out. The company is planning, for example, to buy new equipment that will wash clay and dust off rocks so they can eventually be turned into concrete and asphalt.But regulatory permits for such a project, covering everything from land use to pollution, can take four years to materialize. Then, CalPortland has to buy and build the washers and crushers, which can take another year or so. By then, the House bill\u2019s five-year window for immediate expensing will have closed.\u201cIt takes businesses time to plan and time to envision and time to start building,\u201d said Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the Tax Foundation, an independent group that typically finds tax cuts an economic boon. The foundation expects that making fast expensing permanent will stimulate growth. \u201cWhen the provision expires,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said, \u201cthe positive effects in the first years would go away.\u201dAnother sticking point for CalPortland is that the tax bills tie the amount of interest that companies can deduct to a measure of their earnings. For now, the threshold is high enough that it wouldn\u2019t affect the company\u2019s borrowing \u2014 it finances much of its spending with debt because the tools it needs are so costly. But Mr. Regis said he is worried that introducing any limit opens the door to further restrictions down the line, or even bigger changes, especially if the Republicans lose control of Congress.That is not to say the company won\u2019t make some shorter-term use of the extra cash \u2014 most likely to buy concrete trucks to augment and eventually replace an older fleet in the Northwest. That would also mean hiring two dozen new drivers, but they would stay on in the long term only if orders remain strong.That will be up to big builders like Turner Construction Company, one of its most voracious customers and a giant in the industry.Turner is optimistic about the future, but not because of lower taxes. \u201cOn the list of 200 things we worry about, that would be No. 300 right now,\u201d said Michael Kuntz, an executive vice president at Turner, which recently built the Wilshire Grand Hotel in Los Angeles \u2014 the tallest building west of the Mississippi. \u201cIt\u2019s a nonissue for us.\u201dConstruction is going gangbusters everywhere, Mr. Kuntz added, and the company already has billions in projects on its books for in 2018. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that the 35 percent corporate rate has held anyone back from building,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Governor\u2019s Run Gives Democrats a Bit More Hope of Retaking the Senate", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Former Gov. Phil Bredesen, the last Democrat to win statewide office in Tennessee, announced on Thursday that he would run for the seat being vacated by Senator Bob Corker, handing his party a conceivable, if extremely narrow, path back to a Senate majority in 2018.Mr. Bredesen, a wealthy business executive and two-term governor who swept every county in the state in his 2006 re-election bid, was aggressively courted by Senate Democrats, who have been eyeing any potential openings in a year that features a forbidding map for the party.Democrats are defending 25 Senate seats next year, 10 of them in states that President Trump won. But if Mr. Bredesen can mount a strong campaign, Tennessee would join Nevada and Arizona as states where Republican-held Senate seats could be in jeopardy. Republicans currently have a two-seat majority.A win by Doug Jones, a Democrat, in the Alabama special election on Tuesday would provide a wider path to the majority.Mr. Bredesen, 74, declared his candidacy with a web video that illustrated why he could prove a formidable candidate but also why he faces a bruising campaign that could prove the most expensive in state history.\u201cI\u2019m running for the Senate because I have the right kind of experience and the actual track record that it will take to start working across party lines to fix the mess in Washington and bring common sense back to our government,\u201d he said, clad in a hunting vest and sitting on a porch, a verdant expanse of lawn behind him.Mr. Bredesen discussed his business record and trumpeted his tenure as mayor of Nashville, Tennessee\u2019s booming capital, before recalling that he had not raised the sales tax as governor or sought to create an income tax, long a political third rail in the state.Yet in an indication of how precarious it can be to run statewide as a Democrat in the South, he also made no mention of his party and did not refer to President Trump by name. His only allusion to the Affordable Care Act was to say that \u201cit needs fixing.\u201dTennessee Democrats faced near extinction under President Barack Obama, losing House seats they had controlled for generations and swapping near-majorities in both chambers of the state legislature for the barest of minorities.Should Mr. Bredesen become the party\u2019s standard-bearer, however, he will test whether the state has undergone an enduring realignment or whether a well-financed and well-known Democrat can win when there is a more favorable climate and a Republican president. (It is often easier for Southern Democrats to prevail when they cannot be linked to a liberal boogeyman in the White House.)The race will also determine if Tennessee\u2019s tradition of electing political moderates, whether they be Democrats or Republicans, was a reflection of a less polarized time or still holds as a lasting feature of a varied state that spans two time zones and absorbs Appalachia, the transient-rich New South and more agrarian Old South.Even as it has shifted right in the same fashion of its Southern neighbors, Tennessee has continued to elect Republican pragmatists such as Mr. Corker, Senator Lamar Alexander and Gov. Bill Haslam, who briefly considered a Senate bid.Mr. Bredesen, himself a New York transplant, will probably face one of two conservatives: Representative Marsha Blackburn, who lives in suburban Nashville and serves a district that stretches to Memphis, or former Representative Stephen Fincher, who is from rural western Tennessee. First, though, the former governor must grapple with a primary against James Mackler, a lawyer and Army veteran. On Thursday, Tennessee Republicans voiced deep skepticism that any Democrat could win statewide there.\u201cThe Tennessee Phil Bredesen governed is a much different Tennessee than what will welcome candidate Bredesen in 2018,\u201d said Mark Braden, a Republican strategist in the state, which Mr. Trump carried by 26 points.But Mr. Bredesen\u2019s advisers believe that with Mr. Obama gone from the scene, the Democrats and independents who cast Republican ballots over the last decade will again be in play when presented with a consensus-oriented moderate.Senate Democrats are making the same bet. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, assiduously wooed Mr. Bredesen over the phone and in person, even underwriting a poll from a Washington survey research firm to lure him into the race.They believe that if 2018 becomes a wave election year, even red states such as Tennessee may be up for grabs.An earlier version of this article misstated the day on which former Gov. Phil Bredesen announced that he would run for the seat being vacated by Senator Bob Corker. It was Thursday, not Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Billions in Government Cash, Mexico Controls News Media", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Running a newspaper, radio station or television outlet in Mexico usually means relying on a single, powerful client that spends exorbitant sums on advertising with a simple warning: \u201cI do not pay you to criticize me.\u201dThat client is the government of Mexico.President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s administration has spent hundreds of millions of dollars a year in government money on advertising, creating what many Mexican media owners, executives and journalists call a presidential branding juggernaut capable of suppressing investigative articles, directing front pages and intimidating newsrooms that challenge it.Despite vowing to regulate government publicity, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has spent more money on media advertising than any other president in Mexico\u2019s history \u2014 nearly $2 billion in the past five years, according to government data compiled by Fundar, a transparency group. It found that his administration spent more than twice the generous media budget Mexican lawmakers allotted it for 2016 alone.And that is just the federal money.Leaders from all parties marshal hundreds of millions of dollars in state money for advertising each year, money they dole out to favored news outlets, Fundar calculated. According to the executives and editors involved in the negotiations, some government press secretaries openly demand positive coverage from news organizations before signing an advertising contract.The result is a media landscape across Mexico in which federal and state officials routinely dictate the news, telling outlets what they should \u2014 and should not \u2014 report, according to dozens of interviews with executives, editors and reporters. Hard-hitting stories are often softened, squashed or put off indefinitely, if they get reported at all. Two-thirds of Mexican journalists admit to censoring themselves.\u201cIf a professional reporter wants to cover the dirty elements of what is happening in the country today, neither the government nor private companies will give them a penny,\u201d said Enrique Krauze, a historian who edits Letras Libres, a Mexican magazine that receives some government money. \u201cThis is one of the biggest flaws in Mexican democracy.\u201dMr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s Institutional Revolutionary Party, also known as the PRI, pioneered this system during its 70 years in power. Former President Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo explicitly laid out the government\u2019s expectations decades ago \u2014 he was even quoted as saying that he did not pay the media to attack him \u2014 and the practice continued when the opposition claimed the presidency in 2000, then again in 2006.But the government\u2019s influence over the media goes well beyond the advertising spigot, with officials sometimes resorting to outright bribery. In Chihuahua, the former governor spent more than $50 million on publicity, officials say, in a state saddled with huge public debts. Yet that was just the official figure.Prosecutors have also collected signed receipts for bribes to local journalists \u2014 payoffs so common that some reporters were even listed as government contractors, documents show. With so much government money circling around, entire news websites sprang up with a single purpose, prosecutors contend: to support the former governor\u2019s agenda.\u201cThe relation between the media and power is one of the gravest problems in Mexico,\u201d said Javier Corral, the new governor of Chihuahua. \u201cThere is collusion, an arrangement, in terms of how the public resources are managed to reward or punish the media. It\u2019s carrot and stick: \u2018Behave well, and I\u2019ll give you lots of money and advertising. Act bad and I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u2019\u201dPick up a newspaper, tune into a radio station or flip on the television in Mexico and you are greeted with a barrage of government advertising. In some papers, nearly every other page is claimed by an ad promoting one government agency or another. At times, as much airtime is dedicated to venerating the government\u2019s work as it is to covering the news.The extraordinary spending comes at a time when the Mexican government is cutting budgets across the board, including for health, education and social services. The federal government spent as much on advertising last year, about $500 million, as it did to support students in its main scholarship program for public universities.The co-opting of the news media is more fundamental than any one administration\u2019s spending on self-promotion, historians say. It reflects the absence of the basic pact that a free press has with its readers in a democracy, where holding the powerful accountable is part of its mission.\u201cIt\u2019s a common problem in the developing world, but the problem is much, much graver in Mexico,\u201d said David Kaye, the United Nations special representative for freedom of expression. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable what the government spends.\u201dMost news outlets have relied on public advertising for so long that they would not survive without the government, giving officials tremendous leverage to push for certain stories and prevent others, analysts, reporters and media owners say.\u201cThis is an economic problem,\u201d said Carlos Puig, a columnist at the newspaper Milenio, which receives substantial government funding. \u201cThe classic American model does not exist here.\u201dLast year, a public outcry erupted after a top official in the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration went to Milenio\u2019s offices to complain about a story. The article, criticizing a national anti-hunger initiative, was taken down from the newspaper\u2019s website right after the visit.The piece later went back up, with a far less damning headline. The newspaper says the reason was simple: The article was \u201cdeplorable,\u201d an inaccurate and \u201cvulgar\u201d attempt to smear an official, requiring an apology to readers. But journalists and democracy advocates, citing the power of government advertising, cried foul and the reporter resigned in protest, claiming to have been censored. Eventually, the original headline was restored.Francisco Pazos did. He worked for years at one of the largest papers in Mexico, Exc\u00e9lsior. One of his most frustrating moments came in late 2013, he said, when the government was in the throes of a fight with commuters over a transit fare increase.Mr. Pazos said he tried to explore the commuters\u2019 anger in detail, until an editor stopped him, telling him the paper was no longer going to cover the controversy.\u201cI came to understand there were issues I simply couldn\u2019t cover,\u201d Mr. Pazos said. \u201cAnd eventually, I stopped looking for those kinds of stories. Eventually, you become a part of the censorship yourself.\u201dMany media owners and directors say they have so few independent sources of income outside the government that they face a stark choice: wither from a lack of resources, or survive as accomplices to their own manipulation.\u201cOf course, the use of public money limits freedom of expression, but without this public money there would be no media in Mexico at all,\u201d said Marco Levario, the director of the magazine Etc\u00e9tera. \u201cWe are all complicit in this.\u201dThe model means that some media outlets in Mexico can scarcely afford their own principles. Twenty years ago, the newspaper La Jornada was one of the most beloved in the nation, a critical voice and a must-read for intellectuals and activists who carried the tabloid around town, tucked under their arms.But the years have not been kind to the paper. A few years ago, it was on the cusp of financial ruin. Then the government intervened, rescuing the publication with more than $1 million in official advertising and, critics say, claiming its editorial independence in the process.\u201cNow they own them,\u201d Mr. Levario said. \u201cThe paper has been like a spokesman for the president.\u201dOther business ties link news outlets to the government. Many media companies are part of larger conglomerates that build roads or other public projects. The same person who owns Grupo Imagen, which includes radio, television and print media, also owns a major construction firm, Prodemex. It has earned more than $200 million in the past five years building government facilities, and will play a role in the construction of the new Mexico City airport.La Jornada, Exc\u00e9lsior and Exc\u00e9lsior\u2019s parent company, Grupo Imagen, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.The nation\u2019s Supreme Court recently took up the issue of official advertising, ruling in November that the government must act on the president\u2019s promise to regulate the flow of public money in an unbiased way.\u201cThe absence of regulation in official publicity allows for the arbitrary use of communications budgets, which restricts indirectly freedom of expression,\u201d said Arturo Zald\u00edvar, a Supreme Court justice.In a statement, the president\u2019s office referred to its official advertising as a form of constitutionally backed publicity that enables it to inform and educate the public about its work. But it rejects the assertion that such spending skews the media\u2019s coverage of important issues or stifles free speech in any way.\u201cEvery day journalists in Mexico question, with absolute freedom, the government\u2019s actions and those of our representatives, including the president,\u201d it said. \u201cThere is a permanent criticism from Mexican journalists toward the government. Just by opening any newspaper, turning on the television and going to social media, you can verify this.\u201dWhen he came to office in 2012, the president vowed to more fairly distribute the government\u2019s advertising dollars. Shortly after his election, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s team came up with a plan to regulate media spending, according to three people familiar with the proposal.But Aurelio Nu\u00f1o, the president\u2019s former chief of staff, said the effort never got far enough to produce a draft of any legislation that could yield action. The effort was subsumed by other campaign promises and left behind, he said.As the editor for recruiting at the newspaper Reforma, Diana Alvarez has grown accustomed to the flexible definition of journalism in Mexico.A few years back, she said, she interviewed one young woman from a large paper in Mexico City. The woman, who had a master\u2019s degree in journalism, said her job at the paper consisted of creating files of negative press clippings on governors across the country.Those files were turned over to the paper\u2019s sales department, which then approached the governors to sell them \u201ccoverage plans\u201d to improve their public image, the young woman explained.Mrs. Alvarez rattled off more examples. One applicant, an editing candidate, boasted that he knew how to work his relationships with politicians to score more advertising money.He called it \u201cheating them up,\u201d which involved showing the target a critical story that his newspaper was planning to publish. Then, as he explained to Mrs. Alvarez, an advertising contract with his paper would help \u201cput out the fire.\u201dYet another applicant, a former state government employee, said he knew how to \u201cdeal with the press,\u201d Mrs. Alvarez recalled. He told her how he had been in charge of distributing envelopes filled with cash for reporters as bribes.\u201cI wish I could say these are isolated cases, or just a few, but it isn\u2019t the case,\u201d Mrs. Alvarez said. \u201cThere have been many like these, where they come and speak about these practices in a way that makes you realize they have normalized them.\u201dDaniel Moreno, the director of the digital publication Animal Pol\u00edtico, says he receives almost nothing from the federal government, and relatively small amounts from state governors.It\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t want the money, Mr. Moreno says. It\u2019s just that the kind of critical coverage his news team does is not rewarded with government contracts, he contends.Recently, Mr. Moreno said he received a call from officials in the state of Morelos, which spends about $3,000 a month with him on advertising. The governor\u2019s wife was going through a rough period over claims that she was politicizing aid for earthquake victims \u2014 an accusation she rejected \u2014 so a state official suggested that Animal Pol\u00edtico do a few positive stories on her.Mr. Moreno politely declined.\u201cThey were pretty offended,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cAnd I\u2019m pretty sure that money is gone.\u201dStill, that was better than it is with most states, Mr. Moreno said. As a policy, Animal Pol\u00edtico publishes a banner on pieces that are paid advertising, so readers know the work is not independent journalism, he said.But officials in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Sonora have refused to pay for content unless it is published without the banner, he said. Mr. Moreno refused.\u201cI\u2019ve lost more money than I\u2019ve earned that way,\u201d he said with a laugh.But a few, including Animal Pol\u00edtico, were missing \u2014 on purpose. They had insisted on some extra lines in the announcement about the damage that official publicity does to free speech.A small uproar ensued, they said. Some large newspapers that rely heavily on government money objected.Ultimately, the letter was sent without the lines \u2014 and without the signature of Mr. Moreno and his compatriots. The news media, it appeared, would not challenge its livelihood.On Aug. 23, Ricardo Anaya, the president of the opposition National Action Party and now a candidate for president in next year\u2019s election, woke up to find his name and family splashed across the front page of El Universal, a major newspaper.The story went into details about his father-in-law\u2019s real estate empire and, more pointedly, the ways in which Mr. Anaya\u2019s political career had helped propel that fortune.The narrative was a familiar one in Mexico: A political leader had used his influence to enrich himself and his family. El Universal laid out the addresses and values of the various properties, and even published head shots of his entire extended family, 14 people in all. News outlets across the country carried the story.The only thing missing, a court ultimately decided, was accuracy. Mr. Anaya managed to show that much of the information was flawed, skewed or simply wrong. While his in-laws clearly owned a number of properties, many had been in their possession before his political career began, public deeds showed.Even more puzzling, Mr. Anaya said, were the photographs of his family. They had not been public before, as far as the family knew. In fact, they looked an awful lot like passport pictures.Given that such photos were held by the foreign ministry, which issues passports, Mr. Anaya suspected that his rivals in the government had leaked the pictures to the newspaper.\u201cThey are trying to destroy my political career with this campaign,\u201d he contended. \u201cYou can\u2019t compete with a government that pays $500 million a year to the media.\u201dFor the next two months, the newspaper dedicated more than 20 front pages to Mr. Anaya, accusing him of misusing public funds, benefiting financially from his position and fracturing his party.Mr. Anaya filed suit. In October, the court found that El Universal had misrepresented his in-laws\u2019 wealth and wrongly accused Mr. Anaya of using his office to benefit them.El Universal claimed that it was entitled to publish the story under the right to freedom of expression, an argument the judge questioned because the paper \u201chad not based its investigation in facts.\u201d The newspaper has appealed the court\u2019s decision.The case raises national questions of trust in a country where the news media receives so much money in government advertising.El Universal receives more government advertising than any other newspaper in the nation, about $10 million last year, Fundar found. Critics argue that the newspaper has become something of an attack dog for the government ahead of presidential elections next year.The suggestion is \u201cfalse and offensive,\u201d the newspaper says. Government advertising \u201cdoes not affect in any way the editorial line of the newspaper,\u201d it says, adding that \u201cthinkers of all political parties\u201d are represented in its pages.Not all its journalists agree. In July, a half-dozen columnists announced their resignations in protest over what they called biased coverage, saying the owners had destroyed the institution\u2019s credibility.Salvador Frausto, an investigative editor who earned the paper many awards, also left. Colleagues said he was clearly uncomfortable with how close the paper was becoming to the PRI and its new presidential candidate, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade.The person who replaced Mr. Frausto as the new investigative editor was most recently a press officer at the foreign affairs ministry, according to his LinkedIn profile.And the news director of El Universal had close ties with the new candidate: His wife was Mr. Meade\u2019s international press chief at the finance ministry.The paper says that there is no conflict of interest, and that it does not tolerate biased coverage of any kind.But it isn\u2019t the first time the paper\u2019s journalists have challenged its independence. Writers said that in 2012, when Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was running for office, editors and news directors began changing columns critical of the candidate, sometimes at the last minute, without warning them.\u201cThe reason I resigned is because I no longer felt like I was guaranteed a free space,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Lajous, now a doctoral student at Princeton University, wrote in an article recounting the events.Witnesses were calling it an execution.In January 2015, Laura Castellanos, an award-winning reporter, was sent by editors at El Universal to cover a pair of shootouts involving the federal police.At the time, self-defense groups had taken up arms to fight against organized crime, and Ms. Castellanos, who had written extensively on the subject, was considered an expert.She spent 10 days reporting the story, tapping old sources and interviewing witnesses in the state of Michoac\u00e1n, where 16 had been killed and dozens wounded.The issue was especially delicate because a close ally of the president, Alfredo Castillo, who had been appointed to oversee the security situation in Michoac\u00e1n, claimed that the deaths came from a shootout with armed assailants.Ms. Castellanos said she recorded interviews with 39 people \u2014 victims, bystanders, hospital workers \u2014 and came to a different conclusion. The federal police had summarily executed unarmed suspects, including some as they surrendered on their knees with their arms in the air, she said her reporting showed.After days of editing and fact-checking, she said the story was ready to run. Only it didn\u2019t.Ms. Castellanos and her editors were not surprised. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was already under heavy public pressure for his handling of the disappearance of 43 college students, as well as his wife\u2019s purchase of a multimillion-dollar home from a major government contractor.But after two and a half months \u2014 during which time one of her sources was tortured and killed, she said \u2014 Ms. Castellanos worried her story would never run.Working with lawyers, she said she discovered a loophole in her contract \u2014 one that allowed her to publish the material elsewhere.One of the few publications willing to take the story was a new website founded by Carmen Aristegui, another award-winning reporter, who had lost her radio station job after breaking the story about the president\u2019s wife.But the morning the Michoac\u00e1n story was scheduled to publish, under the headline \u201cIt Was the Feds,\u201d Ms. Aristegui\u2019s website went dark.Eventually, they figured out what happened: The website had been hacked.Neither the killings, nor the hacking, have been fully resolved. El Universal said it had not published Ms. Castellanos\u2019s story because it did not meet the newspaper\u2019s standards.The next year, Ms. Castellano\u2019s article was awarded Mexico\u2019s most coveted journalistic prize: the national award for investigative reporting.Paulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Designates U.S.-Backed Broadcasters as \u2018Foreign Agents\u2019", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The Russian government declared the broadcasters Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty \u201cforeign agents\u201d on Tuesday, in retaliation for a similar action against Russian state-run news outlets in the United States.Russian lawmakers and government representatives were infuriated by the decision, rushing through the retaliatory legislation within days. President Vladimir V. Putin signed the law at the end of November.But earlier fears that the law might extend the registration requirement to major Western news organizations were allayed when the act made no mention of them. Andrei Klimov, a senator, told the state-run news agency RIA Novosti on Tuesday that the list would not be expanded unless the American authorities took similar action on their side.\u201cOur attitude toward the American media is formed by the truly hostile actions of the American side toward our media,\u201d Aleksei K. Pushkov, a member of the upper chamber of Parliament, told the news agency Interfax. \u201cIf the U.S. will reconsider the decisions it made recently, then the Russian decisions can be reconsidered, too.\u201dIn addition to Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, the Justice Ministry designated seven subsidiaries of Radio Free Europe as \u201cfulfilling the role of foreign agents,\u201d according to a statement on its website.Some of the organizations focus on topics the Russian government considers sensitive, like Crimea.Realities, a website covering the peninsula annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and Caucasus.Realities, which reports on the situation in Russia\u2019s restive southern region.Radio Free Europe\u2019s president, Thomas Kent, said his group was aware of the Russian decision but was not sure what it would mean in practice.Russia also cracked down that year on foreign-backed nongovernmental organizations that engaged in the broadly defined area of political activity, requiring them to register as \u201cforeign agents.\u201dThe 86 organizations currently on that list have to label all information they broadcast to Russian audiences as the product of a \u201cforeign agent.\u201d They also have to submit extensive financial reports, and their work is subject to suspension at any time by the authorities.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Russian government-run Sputnik news agency had been required to register as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d in the United States. It was not required to do so (although a partner, Reston Translator, which transmits Radio Sputnik on FM frequencies, was).Advertisement"}

She was 66.Her sister Jeanne Straus said the cause was cancer.\u201cDiane didn\u2019t want to pitch ideology,\u201d Mr. Leonard said in a telephone interview. \u201cShe wanted the foundations to be sold on independent journalism. Let the facts take us where the facts go.\u201dPaul Glastris, the editor in chief, said Ms. Straus had been a staunch guardian of the magazine\u2019s independence.\u201cShe had a passionate belief in the power of small magazines to make a difference,\u201d Mr. Glastris said.\u201cA decade ago, foundations didn\u2019t want to interfere in the market,\u201d Ms. Straus once told The Chronicle of Philanthropy. But in recent years, she added, they decided \u201cthat they need to for serious independent journalism to survive.\u201dDiane (pronounced DEE-ann) Ellen Straus was born in Manhattan on Oct. 23, 1951. Her father, R. Peter Straus, built a small empire of radio stations in New York State that included WMCA, which moved from a Top 40 music format to talk radio in 1970. He later augmented those holdings with weekly newspapers.While attending Yale, where she studied psychology and sociology, Ms. Straus started the university\u2019s first women\u2019s varsity tennis team and was its captain. She was in Yale\u2019s first class of women to graduate, in 1973.After college, she held editing jobs at New York magazine and The Village Voice before being named publisher of one of her family\u2019s newspapers, The Cranford Citizen and Chronicle in New Jersey.After taking a break to run a catering business, she became publisher of Trader Publications, a company run by her husband at the time, Carll Tucker III.Ms. Straus balanced publishing work with amateur platform tennis, which is played on an aluminum deck about one-third the size of a traditional tennis court. Twelve-foot-high fencing that surrounds the court allows the ball to be played off the walls.Ms. Straus won more than two-dozen titles, some after she turned 60, including two this year.\u201cShe was determined and full of grit,\u201d Robin Rich Fulton, one of her playing partners, said in a telephone interview. \u201cShe had willpower and a forehand that was out of this world, which set me up to close out the point.\u201cHer only weakness,\u201d she added, \u201cwas her serve. She\u2019d toss the ball so high that you could read a chapter of \u2018Gone With the Wind\u2019 before it came down.\u201dThat year she took a hiatus from her job as group publisher of Manhattan Media to work for Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who was seeking the Democratic nomination for president.In addition to her sister Jeanne, Ms. Straus is survived by her companion, John Curtis; her daughter, Rebecca Tucker; her sons, Peter and David; two granddaughters; another sister, Katherine Straus; and a brother, Eric. Her marriage to Mr. Tucker ended in divorce.After her mother died, her father married Marcia Lewis, the mother of Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern who had an affair with President Bill Clinton.\u201cMonica is a bright, engaging and attractive young woman,\u201d Ms. Straus said in 1999. \u201cWho hasn\u2019t made mistakes in their 20s?\u201dShe returned to the print media world in 2005 as president and publisher of The American Prospect, where she stayed for three years before joining Washington Monthly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Pass Sweeping Tax Rewrite 51-49", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 Republicans passed the nearly $1.5 trillion tax rewrite along party lines. One Republican, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, voted against the bill.\u2022 Vice President Mike Pence provided a tiebreaking vote to pass an amendment offered by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, which would allow people to use up to $10,000 a year from tax-advantaged 529 savings accounts to fund tuition at private and religious K-12 schools or certain educational expenses for home-schooled students.\u2022 Democrats are crying foul over getting a revised, nearly 500-page bill just hours before being asked to vote on it.\u2022 The Senate rejected an amendment offered by Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah, both Republicans, that would have increased the child tax credit for low-income families and pay for it by nudging up the corporate tax rate.The Senate passed the Republicans\u2019 sweeping tax overhaul with several holdouts throwing their support behind the bill.Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who was the last big holdout, said she would support the bill after changes she wanted were made to the legislation.Mr. Corker voted against the bill, the only Republican senator to object to the legislation.Party leaders also picked up the votes of three other holdouts: Jeff Flake of Arizona, Steve Daines of Montana and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said on Friday morning that Republicans had the 50 votes they need to pass the tax bill.Republicans appeared increasingly confident as they milled into the Senate\u2019s ornate Strom Thurmond Room to hash out the remaining details of a tax bill that has been a moving target.Among the changes Ms. Collins secured was adding in a $10,000 property tax deduction into the Senate bill. Ms. Collins tweeted that she was \u201cdelighted\u201d with the move.Mr. Corker had pushed to scale back the tax cuts in the Senate bill in the wake of a report from the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation that projected the bill would add $1 trillion to deficits over the course of a decade, even after accounting for economic growth. On Thursday night, Republicans were discussing several possibilities for changing the bill to address deficit concerns, including gradually raising the corporate tax rate in later years.But other Republicans resisted the idea of raising taxes, and on Friday, that idea was off the table.The Senate approved the final bill, 51-49. A list of every senator\u2019s vote on the bill and selected amendments.\u201cThis is yet another tough vote,\u201d Mr. Corker said in a statement. \u201cI am disappointed. I wanted to get to yes. But at the end of the day, I am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that I believe, based on the information I currently have, could deepen the debt burden on future generations.\u201dPresident Trump sounded optimistic on Friday morning, in a tweet taunting Democrats over the bill\u2019s prospects.Democrats took to the Senate floor and social media to attack Republicans over the speed of the bill and the last-minute changes being made, saying it was irresponsible to approve such significant legislation with little time to review it.Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said the Republican bill had been worsened by changes made \u201cunder the cover of darkness.\u201d He added that those provisions would \u201cstuff even more money into the pockets of the wealthy and the biggest corporations while raising taxes on millions in the middle class.\u201d\u201cWe understand they have the votes to pass their bill,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, \u201cdespite a process and a product that no one can be proud of and everyone should be ashamed of.\u201dSenator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, called it \u201cWashington D.C. at its worst\u201d in a video in which he held up a page of the bill with handwritten changes scribbled in the margins.\u201cThis is unbelievable, we\u2019re doing massive tax reform on an absolute incredible timeline,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to affect everybody in this country.\u201dSenator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, posted a list of amendments to the bill on her Twitter account and cried foul over the fact that she got it from a lobbyist, not from her colleagues across the aisle.Many of the last-minute changes were included to help convince a handful of holdout Republican senators, including Ms. Collins and Mr. Johnson, to throw their support behind the legislation. Others were included for reasons that left many Democrats crying foul.In a closely watched vote, the Senate rejected an amendment that would have increased the child tax credit for low-income families while raising the corporate tax rate to 20.94 percent, from 20 percent as proposed in the tax bill.Mr. Rubio, who implored senators earlier in the day to allow the change since it would still be a reduction from the current corporate rate of 35 percent, was rebuffed by fellow lawmakers, who rejected the amendment in a 29-to-71 vote.A controversial provision that would have allowed parents to begin saving tax-free for the college education of an unborn child has been stripped from the Senate tax bill.Republicans appear to have removed the provision after it was challenged by Democrats on parliamentary grounds, a Senate Democratic aide said.Two less-controversial provisions were nixed or forced to be changed by the parliamentarian, who has broad power to determine which parts of a bill comply with the Senate budget reconciliation process.Mr. Daines and Mr. Johnson had objected to the bill because of how it treated pass-through businesses, whose profits are distributed to owners and taxed at individual rates.The Senate tax bill will now allow pass through owners to deduct 23 percent of their business income as a way of lowering their taxes, up from 17.4 percent in the original Senate bill.\u201cAfter weeks of fighting for Main Street businesses including Montana\u2019s farmers and ranchers, I\u2019ve decided to support the Senate tax cut bill, which provides significant tax relief for Main Street businesses,\u201d Mr. Daines said in a statement on Friday morning.The Senate tax bill has been marketed by Republicans as a tax cut for the middle class. How would people in your income group fare?Mr. Johnson said in a statement he also supports the bill.Mr. Flake, in a statement, said he would support the tax bill after getting changes to a budget \u201cgimmick\u201d and a commitment that Senate leaders and the Trump administration would work with him on a legislative solution on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.On Friday, Republicans rejected the idea of putting in place tax increases that would take effect some years from now, a step that would soften the deficit effects of the legislation.\u201cLarding the bill up with new tax increases would have been going the wrong direction,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.But lawmakers still need to find ways to pay for the changes being made and congressional aides said it will likely be a combination of things including:\u2022 Retaining the alternative minimum tax for corporations, which would raise $40 billion over a decade.\u2022 Retaining a modified version of the individual A.M.T., which would raise $133 billion over a decade.\u2022 Slightly increasing the tax rate on offshore assets under the \u201cdeemed repatriation\u201d provision, which would raise $97 billion over a decade.We modeled taxes for 25,000 middle-class families. Here\u2019s how the Senate bill would affect each of them.Republican leaders say their proposals will fuel investment and job creation. Critics say that the rich are the beneficiaries and that debt will weigh on growth. We asked two economists, one from each side, to make their cases.This bill has been promoted as a boon for the middle class. Does it fulfill that promise?Douglas Holtz-Eakin:Capital accumulation, productivity growth and living better: That is the case for tax reform. It would be an easier political sale if there were a straight line from the policy to the prosperity (which is why the left prefers programs that write checks). But the logic is sound, the evidence conclusive and the case for tax reform helping the middle class impeccable.Kimberly A. Clausing:This tax bill is not about workers. It is about giving shareholders and businesses lower taxes and merely hoping benefits will trickle down. Instead, give workers any tax cuts, and rely on the strength of the middle class to bubble up, strengthening American business. Sound tax reform should not lose revenue, and it should not give the vast majority of benefits to those at the top.The independent Tax Policy Center said on Friday that the Senate tax bill would add $1.2 trillion to federal deficits over 10 years, even after accounting for increased economic growth. That deficit estimate was slightly higher than the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation projected on Thursday.The so-called dynamic score from the center found that the bill, as approved in the Finance Committee, would increase economic growth by 0.7 percent next year, but that its growth boost would fade over a decade, as deficits and federal debt increase. The center said those benefits would be larger if the economy was struggling, and not operating under low unemployment: \u201cBecause the economy is currently near full employment, the impact of increased demand on output would be smaller and diminish more quickly than it would if the economy were in recession.\u201dRepublican senators have criticized the center\u2019s previous findings and largely dismissed the Joint Committee\u2019s analysis on Thursday. They say they expect much larger growth effects than the analyses have found.The independent Tax Foundation, which typically finds higher growth effects from tax cuts, has not yet released an analysis of the bill after it underwent significant amendments in committee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weinstein\u2019s Complicity Machine", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "\u2018One phone call and you\u2019re done.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m Harvey Weinstein \u2014 you know what I can do.\u2019\u2018I am a man who has great resources.\u2019\u2018I have ears and eyes everywhere!\u2019The producer Harvey Weinstein relied on powerful relationships across industries to provide him with cover as accusations of sexual misconduct piled up for decades.He gathered ammunition, sometimes helped by the editor of The National Enquirer, who had dispatched reporters to find information that could undermine accusers. He turned to old allies, asking a partner in Creative Artists Agency, one of Hollywood\u2019s premier talent shops, to broker a meeting with a C.A.A. client, Ronan Farrow, who was reporting on Mr. Weinstein. He tried to dispense favors: While seeking to stop the actress Rose McGowan from writing in a memoir that he had sexually assaulted her, he tried to arrange a $50,000 payment to her former manager and throw new business to a literary agent advising Ms. McGowan. The agent, Lacy Lynch, replied to him in an email: \u201cNo one understands smart, intellectual and commercial like HW.\u201dMr. Weinstein\u2019s final, failed round of manipulations shows how he operated for more than three decades: by trying to turn others into instruments or shields for his behavior, according to nearly 200 interviews, internal company records and previously undisclosed emails. Some aided his actions without realizing what he was doing. Many knew something or detected hints, though few understood the scale of his sexual misconduct. Almost everyone had incentives to look the other way or reasons to stay silent. Now, even as the tally of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged misdeeds is still emerging, so is a debate about collective failure and the apportioning of blame.Executives at Mr. Weinstein\u2019s film companies who learned of allegations rarely took a stand, cowed by their volatile boss or worried about their careers. His brother and partner, Bob, participated in payoffs to women as far back as 1990. Some low-level assistants were pulled in: They compiled \u201cbibles\u201d that included hints on facilitating encounters with women, and were required to procure his penile injections for erectile dysfunction. His lawyers crafted settlements that kept the truth from being explored, much less exposed. \u201cWhen you quickly settle, there is no need to get into all the facts,\u201d said Daniel M. Petrocelli, a lawyer who handled two agreements with accusers.Agents and managers across Hollywood, who wanted in on Mr. Weinstein\u2019s star-making films, sent actresses to meet him alone at hotels and advised them to stay quiet when things went wrong. \u201cThat\u2019s just Harvey being Harvey,\u201d more than one agent told a client. At C.A.A., for example, at least eight talent agents were told that Mr. Weinstein had harassed or menaced female clients, but agents there continued to arrange private meetings. Even Nick Wechsler, a talent manager at another firm who confronted Mr. Weinstein about Ms. McGowan, felt he had to maintain business ties with him: \u201cSometimes he was the only game in town.\u201dMr. Weinstein held off press scrutiny with a mix of threats and enticements, drawing reporters close with the lure of access to stars, directors and celebrity-packed parties. Some journalists negotiated book and movie deals with him even as they were assigned to cover him. The studio chief once paid a gossip writer to collect juicy celebrity tidbits that Mr. Weinstein could use to barter if other reporters stumbled onto an affair he was trying to keep quiet. He was so close to David J. Pecker, the chief executive of American Media Inc., which owns The Enquirer, that he was known in the tabloid industry as an untouchable \u201cF.O.P.,\u201d or \u201cfriend of Pecker.\u201d That status was shared by a chosen few, including President Trump.Mr. Weinstein, 65, is under investigation by law enforcement authorities in three cities. Though he has acknowledged that his behavior \u201chas caused a lot of pain,\u201d his lawyers denied that he committed sexual assault. His spokeswoman disputed claims of inappropriate advances in this article, saying Mr. Weinstein\u2019s recollections differed from those of his accusers.A master of leverage, Mr. Weinstein parlayed his films into relationships across the worlds of entertainment, politics, publishing and beyond, achieving a stature that at times proved useful in intimidating others and protecting himself. \u201cI know the president of the United States. Who do you know?\u201d Mr. Weinstein, a Democratic fund-raiser, would say during the years Barack Obama was in the White House, adding expletives. \u201cI\u2019m Harvey Weinstein,\u201d he used to say. \u201cYou know what I can do.\u201dIn late September, emails show, he was discussing a documentary television show he was working on with Hillary Clinton. He had long raised campaign cash for her, and her feminist credentials helped burnish his image \u2014 even though Tina Brown, the magazine editor, and Lena Dunham, the writer and actress, each say they had cautioned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides about his treatment of women. Now, Mr. Weinstein exchanged questions about distribution rights for the show. \u201cI am hopeful we can get a good price for this,\u201d Robert Barnett, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lawyer, replied.Two days later, Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, interrupted a vacation in Hawaii to field advice from Mr. Weinstein, according to the emails. The Wall Street Journal was reporting on turmoil at Amazon Studios, one of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s business partners. He recommended an aggressive response that involved hiring some of his own team, including a libel lawyer who \u201cmakes sure everyone sticks to the right narrative,\u201d Mr. Weinstein wrote. He added, \u201cI\u2019m happy to coordinate with whoever you\u2019d like, as a friend of the court.\u201d Mr. Bezos declined to comment.Even as Mr. Weinstein was aware that reporters were examining his behavior, he attended the Toronto International Film Festival in September and invited two women to his hotel room. He alternated between making massage requests, other unwelcome advances and offers of career help, said the women, who asked to remain unidentified, but whose account was backed up in part through text messages and a friend who was told at the time of the encounter. Then, the women said, he issued pleas and warnings not to tell anyone. Mr. Weinstein called the account \u201cnonsense.\u201dHe pressured his business associates, telling Lance Maerov, an outspoken member of the Weinstein Company board, that he would find embarrassing details from his past and use them against him. He pushed Irwin Reiter, an executive who had worked with him for three decades, to speak favorably of him to reporters. When Mr. Reiter refused, he said, Mr. Weinstein responded that he had damning information about him too.About the same time, he tried to facilitate a business deal with Ms. Lynch, the literary agent consulting with Ms. McGowan, and others. \u201cGetting together with three intelligent women would help my image immensely,\u201d he wrote in an email, proposing a meeting. That never happened, according to Ms. Lynch. She said that she felt Mr. Weinstein was trying to ingratiate himself with her because of her relationship to Ms. McGowan, and that she was simply playing along. Jill Messick, Ms. McGowan\u2019s former manager, never received or accepted money from the producer, her lawyer said.Minutes before The New York Times published the first allegations about Mr. Weinstein this fall, he called the reporters who wrote it. Swinging between flattery and threats, he said that he had ways of knowing who had cooperated with the investigation and the means to undermine it.\u201cI am a man who has great resources,\u201d he warned.Mia Kirshner, a Canadian actress who was 19 when she starred in the film \u201cExotica,\u201d traveled to New York not long after its 1994 release. Miramax distributed the movie, and her agents at C.A.A. had set up a meeting with Mr. Weinstein at her hotel. \u201cWe thought it was a coup,\u201d she recalled. The producer had already told Ms. Kirshner, whose grandparents had survived the Lodz ghetto in Poland, that he wanted to discuss a film about the Warsaw ghetto uprising. But when he came to her room, his agenda was to exchange sex for career opportunity, the actress said. While she rejected him, the experience left her feeling \u201cextremely upset and alarmed and scared,\u201d and somehow, like so many other women who say he targeted them, at fault.She told her primary agent, Lisa Grode, who sounded shocked. In a subsequent conversation, her talent manager, John Carrabino, and his boss, Sandy Gallin, joined the call. Mr. Gallin was outraged and urged Ms. Kirshner to meet with the producer again, while wearing a wire. \u201cI remember John and Lisa were both like, \u2018Sandy, no!\u2019\u201d Ms. Kirshner said. From the general tone of the conversation, she concluded she should drop the matter. \u201cI was told to forget about it; it was pointless to do anything about this,\u201d Ms. Kirshner said.She was grateful to Ms. Grode for signing her and for encouraging her to get a college degree, she said. But in that moment, she recalled, \u201cI was very disappointed by them.\u201d\u201cIt all came down to money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt speaks to why he was protected as opposed to the actors.\u201c Ms. Grode and Mr. Carrabino declined to comment; Mr. Gallin is deceased.It is impossible to say how many women might have been spared Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual aggression had more agents responded with the impulse to act. At C.A.A., at least eight agents had heard about Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior, largely from actresses they represented, but several former senior C.A.A. agents said they were unaware of it or any formal agency response.In a statement, C.A.A. said it apologized \u201cto any person the agency let down for not meeting the high expectations we place on ourselves.\u201d Like other agencies, it said it had begun revising its management structure to include more women and improve its sexual harassment policies.When asked if he had known of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged harassment of clients, Bryan Lourd, a partner at C.A.A., declined to comment, citing client confidentiality. In mid-September, Mr. Weinstein stormed into Mr. Lourd\u2019s office to complain about an article that Ronan Farrow, a C.A.A. client, was writing on Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged misconduct for The New Yorker, according to someone familiar with C.A.A.\u2019s dealings with Mr. Weinstein. Later that month, Mr. Lourd tried to set up a meeting at the producer\u2019s request. \u201cThis guy won\u2019t meet right now,\u201d he wrote to Mr. Weinstein on Sept. 26. \u201cHe did say he will call you soon. I think he is absolutely pursuing the story.\u201dThe top agencies are among Hollywood\u2019s most male institutions; none has ever been led by a woman. \u201cGiven everything that has happened, agencies are suddenly on a very steep learning curve, but I think they are doing the work to create a better environment,\u201d said Marti Noxon, a television producer. She had been disappointed in the past by an agent\u2019s response when she reported that she had been sexually harassed.Two decades ago, Ashley Judd, who met Mr. Weinstein in his hotel room for what she thought was a business meeting, said she turned down the producer\u2019s repeated offers of a massage, as well his efforts to steer her toward the bathroom so she could watch him shower. After the encounter, the actress made no secret of what had transpired, and told her agent, Michelle Bohan, who was then at the William Morris Agency. \u201cI know my agent would have done whatever I asked her to do,\u201d Ms. Judd said. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t know what to ask anyone to do.\u201d Ms. Bohan, who remains Ms. Judd\u2019s agent, declined to comment.Failure to take action in the face of misconduct accusations was hardly limited to cases involving Mr. Weinstein. After complaints about his treatment of women became public, Reese Witherspoon said in a recent speech that a director had sexually assaulted her when she was 16, and she expressed anger toward \u201cthe agents and the producers who made me feel that silence was a condition of my employment.\u201dAgents often sign actresses when they are at peak value to the industry \u2014 just out of their teens, if not still in them \u2014 and also at peak vulnerability, given their youth. Although agents are charged with protecting their clients\u2019 interests, they earn their living, indirectly, from the executives who write their clients\u2019 paychecks. For agents, actors and actresses might come and go, but Mr. Weinstein was one of Hollywood\u2019s seemingly permanent fixtures, distributing as many as 30 films a year.In the absence of any collective discussion of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged behavior, stories circulated in the industry, tainting many of those associated with him. More than two decades ago, Gwyneth Paltrow reported advances he made in a hotel room to her agent, Rick Kurtzman of C.A.A. Mr. Kurtzman \u201clooked incredulous\u201d and expressed revulsion, Ms. Paltrow said, but he did not suggest discussing the episode with the agency\u2019s leaders. Mr. Kurtzman declined to comment.Ms. Paltrow went on to become known as the first lady of Miramax, winning an Oscar in 1999 for her performance in \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d But without her knowledge, Mr. Weinstein was tarnishing and trading on her golden-girl image. Ms. Paltrow said she rebuffed Mr. Weinstein. But now, she is hearing that as he tried to coerce other women, he repeatedly boasted that he had sex with her. Complying with him was \u201cthe best thing you can do for your career now,\u201d Mr. Weinstein told one young actress in 2000, mentioning Ms. Paltrow and others. Another woman, who alleged that Mr. Weinstein assaulted her in 2004, recalled a photo of Ms. Paltrow prominently displayed in the room.In recent weeks, Ms. Paltrow has started to connect with some of those who said Mr. Weinstein cited her name in disturbing encounters. She said the phone calls with the other women have been devastating. \u201cHe\u2019s not the first person to lie about sleeping with someone,\u201d she said in an interview, \u201cbut he used the lie as an assault weapon.\u201dWhen Disney bought Miramax in 1993, it acquired an un-Disney-like duo from New York, brothers who already had reputations as ruthless businessmen and fearsome bosses.But the Weinsteins had an eye for talent and success in critically acclaimed art house films. They were given wide latitude \u2014 \u201cvirtual autonomy,\u201d as Disney put it in a statement \u2014 a move meant to preserve Miramax\u2019s creative culture. That hands-off supervision, several former executives now suggest, could have inadvertently created opportunities for misconduct that Mr. Weinstein exploited.But Disney continued to bankroll the Weinsteins with hundreds of millions of dollars a year \u2014 more money than they had ever handled before \u2014 and Mr. Eisner tolerated them as they were churning out hits. When Chris McGurk, then a Disney executive, broached the idea of selling Miramax in the mid-90s, he recalled Mr. Eisner saying, \u201cI\u2019m not selling as long I\u2019m chairman.\u201dDisney said that it did not know of any complaints, lawsuits or the settlements dealing with sexual misconduct involving Mr. Weinstein, and no clear evidence to the contrary has emerged. But there were hints of other troubling behavior.One involved a physical altercation with a male employee at a film conference in the mid-90s that resulted in a financial settlement. About that time, the producer Sybil Robson Orr said that when she complained to Mr. Weinstein about falling short on a distribution deal, he berated her with vulgarities, pounding his desk and vowing to destroy her career, according to a 1996 lawsuit. Two Disney executives joined in the threats, she claimed.She prevailed, receiving a \u201csizable award,\u201d said Bertram Fields, the lawyer who represented her. \u201cNo one is going to do that again,\u201d Mr. Weinstein vowed, according to a former Miramax official. The producer and his company later hired Mr. Fields and another star litigator, David Boies.By that time, dozens of women had become victims of Mr. Weinstein, they now say. One of them, a Canadian who anonymously filed a lawsuit accusing him of assaulting her in 2000, said in an interview: \u201cYou do not get to trade on my physical safety for your accolades and your Oscars.\u201dShortly after the news investigations of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged abuse were published, A. J. Benza, a former New York Daily News gossip columnist, received a two-word text from the producer: \u201cHelp me.\u201dMr. Benza had been integral to the network of friendly journalists \u2014 gossip columnists, magazine writers, editors and authors \u2014 whom the producer relied on to promote his entertainment empire and sometimes punish rivals or deflect threats.Over dinner in West Hollywood in late 2003 or early the next year, the men had discussed a plan to help Mr. Weinstein avoid embarrassment. While married to his first wife, he had become involved with someone else, Mr. Benza discovered. A clerk at a Los Angeles art studio where he commissioned a gift for Mr. Weinstein \u2014 a painting of a reimagined \u201cHollywood\u201d sign reading \u201cHarveywood\u201d \u2014 volunteered to Mr. Benza that a friend, Georgina Chapman, was seeing the producer. Mr. Weinstein, who would later marry Ms. Chapman, was separated and wanted to keep the relationship confidential until he was divorced, according to his spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister.Mr. Benza, then between jobs, had a suggestion. \u201cI could supply your P.R. girls with a lot of gossip \u2014 a lot of stories \u2014 and if people come at them with the \u2018Harvey\u2019s having an affair story,\u2019 they can barter,\u201d Mr. Benza recalled telling Mr. Weinstein. \u201cHe said, \u2018A. J., it\u2019s got to be good stories,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Don\u2019t you worry about it.\u2019\u201dCollecting a monthly retainer, Mr. Benza said, he reported items on Roger Clemens, Michael Jackson and others and sent them to Mr. Weinstein\u2019s communications team, though he didn\u2019t know whether they were used to trade away stories about the producer. Mr. Weinstein\u2019s spokeswoman said the payments to Mr. Benza were for public relations work during Miramax\u2019s dispute with Disney.Mr. Benza and Mr. Weinstein were exploiting a longstanding system of favor-trading between the press and the movie business. Gossip writers need a stream of insider scoops, industry beat reporters need exclusives on the next big deal and glossy magazines need celebrities who can drive newsstand sales. Mr. Weinstein, who wanted glowing coverage, could provide that and more.Mr. Auletta, of The New Yorker, said he learned about a sexual assault allegation that a former assistant had made against the producer, and a related settlement that required confidentiality. Mr. Auletta said that he and his editors concluded just before publishing that they could not include the allegation because the woman would not agree to cooperate.Mr. Carr, a New York Times columnist who died in 2015, heard about Ms. McGowan\u2019s assault allegation and other accusations while reporting a profile for New York magazine in 2001, his editors said.Several weeks before the article was published, Kroll, a private investigative agency that did work for Mr. Weinstein, provided him with some details of Mr. Carr\u2019s reporting, according to a former Miramax executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Carr wrote in the profile that Mr. Weinstein seemed to have \u201cnear-perfect visibility into my notebook,\u201d and told friends that Mr. Weinstein called him before publication to read a line he had written.His spokeswoman dismissed the account as \u201curban legend,\u201d and a top Kroll executive, Daniel E. Karson, did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Carr\u2019s article also did not include any sexual misconduct allegations; Caroline Miller, then New York\u2019s editor, said that none of the women would speak on the record. That same wall of silence would stymie other journalists in the years that followed.As he and his legal team worked to undermine Ms. Battilana\u2019s credibility, American Media entered the picture.In November last year, Lauren O\u2019Connor, a former Weinstein Company employee who had written a blistering memo asserting sexual harassment and other misconduct by Mr. Weinstein, received calls from a Coleman-Rayner reporter. He said he was working on a story about \u201cmajor studio heads\u201d and kept pressing her to speak even when she declined. She said it made her so uncomfortable she reported the phone call to her lawyer.By fall last year, Mr. Weinstein was trying to stop what he feared would be a story about the allegations against him by New York magazine. Once again, he called on Mr. Benza, meeting him at the Peninsula Beverly Hills that October.Saying the magazine was \u201cdoing a Bill Cosby on me,\u201d Mr. Weinstein asked for help, Mr. Benza recalled. He said he did not believe at the time that the studio chief had abused women, and despite feeling a debt of loyalty, would not have knowingly participated in a scheme to silence victims.He said Mr. Weinstein suggested that Mr. Benza pose as an author \u201cwriting a hit job,\u2019\u2019 so he could call potential sources to learn what they were saying about the producer. Mr. Weinstein discussed paying Mr. Benza up to $20,000 a month and providing a list of contacts, Mr. Benza said, though the producer never followed through. Mr. Weinstein\u2019s spokeswoman denied that he had proposed the scheme.But a list was shared with Mr. Howard, who sent Mr. Weinstein an email last December with an attachment called \u201cContacts\u201d and a note reading, \u201cLet\u2019s discuss next steps on each.\u201dThe New York magazine piece never materialized; the accusers would not speak on the record. But The Times, NBC and then The New Yorker began pursuing their own stories.The day before The Times published its article this fall, Mr. Weinstein was planning to make his last defense. He wrote an urgent email to Mr. Howard, instructing him to meet outside the newspaper\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan. American Media said that Mr. Howard did not show.If Mr. Weinstein built his wall of invulnerability from many varied bricks, it was covered with a sheen of celebrity. He created stars through his movies, but he also acquired famous friends through his other activities, including in the Democratic politics that dominate Hollywood.Mr. Weinstein\u2019s political activity \u2014 he provided consistent support for Mr. Obama as well \u2014 boosted his image as a man with friends in high places and close ties to the country\u2019s leading female politician. It is not clear if rumors of his record of sexual misconduct had ever reached them.But two prominent women said they warned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team. In 2016, Lena Dunham, the writer and actress, said she was troubled by the producer\u2019s visible presence during Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential run, hosting fund-raisers and appearing at campaign events. She had heard stories, both directly and secondhand from other actresses, about disturbing encounters with him, she said. So in March last year, Ms. Dunham, a vocal Clinton supporter, said she warned the campaign.\u201cI just want you to let you know that Harvey\u2019s a rapist and this is going to come out at some point,\u201d Ms. Dunham said she told Kristina Schake, the campaign\u2019s deputy communications director. She recalled adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s a really bad idea for him to host fund-raisers and be involved because it\u2019s an open secret in Hollywood that he has a problem with sexual assault.\u201dEarlier, during the 2008 presidential race, Tina Brown, the magazine editor, said she cautioned a member of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s inner circle about him. \u201cI was hearing that Harvey\u2019s sleaziness with women had escalated since I left Talk in 2002 and she was unwise to be so closely associated with him,\u201d Ms. Brown said in an email.Ms. Dunham said that Ms. Schake seemed surprised at her warning, and that Ms. Schake said she would tell Robby Mook, the campaign manager, Ms. Dunham recalled in an interview.The latest news and insights on the sexual harassment and misconduct scandals roiling society.Ms. Elrod and Ms. Schake, through Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director, denied that Ms. Dunham mentioned rape, while Mr. Mook said that no one had ever alerted him about the producer.Nick Merrill, the communications director, said in a statement: \u201cWe were shocked when we learned what he\u2019d done. It\u2019s despicable behavior, and the women that have come forward have shown enormous courage. As to claims about a warning, that\u2019s something staff wouldn\u2019t forget.\u201d Referring to Ms. Dunham, the statement continued, \u201cOnly she can answer why she would tell them instead of those who could stop him.\u201d Mr. Merrill added that no one could find people from the 2008 campaign who could recall a warning from Ms. Brown.Mrs. Clinton herself said in a statement in October that she was \u201cshocked and appalled by the revelations,\u201d adding that the alleged behavior \u201ccannot be tolerated.\u201dWhile Ms. Dunham says she has \u201can incredible allegiance to Hillary,\u201d and does not believe the reports ever traveled to Mrs. Clinton, she remains troubled by what had happened. \u201cA year and a half ago, on one of the most progressive campaigns in history, this wasn\u2019t a problem,\u201d she said, referring to the allegations about Mr. Weinstein.(Ms. Dunham herself stirred controversy recently for defending a former colleague accused of sexual assault, though she later apologized.)Days after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s election loss, the Clintons had dinner with Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Boies, the lawyer, and their wives at Rao\u2019s restaurant in Harlem, Manhattan.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Weinstein began planning a documentary TV show about her campaign. Discussions about the project stretched out for months with her lawyer, Robert Barnett, who emailed with Mr. Weinstein on Sept. 28 about potential European buyers.In a statement, Mr. Barnett said that \u201ctalks were ongoing until the allegations surfaced, at which point all discussions ceased \u2014 completely and permanently.\u201dBeginning in 2014, one of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s longest-serving employees had an overdue realization that he needed to do something about his boss\u2019s treatment of women.Irwin Reiter had done finance and accounting work for Mr. Weinstein for three decades. He knew the outlines of a few alarming episodes with female employees over the years, but he had never intervened. Like many others, he had brushed aside Mr. Weinstein\u2019s private relations with actresses, figuring it was an embarrassing but consensual extramarital habit.Now Mr. Reiter watched the public accusations mount against Bill Cosby. He learned that Mr. Weinstein allegedly harassed a new employee named Emily Nestor, offering her career help in return for sex. Sandeep Rehal, then a 28-year-old assistant, began confiding in him about some of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s demands. She had to rent him a furnished apartment, using his corporate credit card to stock it with women\u2019s lingerie, flowers, two bathrobes and extra clothes for Mr. Weinstein.Mr. Weinstein had long used his company credit card with abandon, relying on assistants to classify what was business or personal, sometimes writing checks to reimburse the company, according to several current and former employees. Now, on top of his salary \u2014 $2 million before bonuses in 2015, according to his contract \u2014 he wanted the business to pay expenses including a $27,000 tip for yacht staff and a private jet stop in Europe to pick up a model. Mr. Reiter and other executives also began to question why he was putting women on movie production payrolls without clear assignments.\u201cHow many????????????? How many are enough???? How many are too much???\u201d Mr. Reiter wrote in a February 2015 email to Tom Prince, the head of physical production.\u201cWe fly \u2018actresses\u2019 in from all over the world for 1-2 lines of dialogue,\u201d Mr. Prince wrote back.In a statement, Mr. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers, Blair Berk and Ben Brafman, said that he never used \u201ccompany resources for personal expenditures,\u201d and that he reimbursed the company \u201cwhere there was any confusion.\u201dConcerned that his boss\u2019s activities were \u201cgoing to take the company down,\u201d Mr. Reiter and other executives decided they should act. But Mr. Weinstein was the dominant figure in the company. He and his brother owned nearly half the business and served as co-chairmen, and he packed the board with allies.Fellow executives helped mask Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior going back to 1990. That year, a 23-year-old assistant said he sexually assaulted her when she ran an errand at his home. Bob Weinstein worked on the confidential settlement, according to two people familiar with the agreement \u2014 the first of at least three he would be involved in over the years. In a statement, Bob Weinstein said he did not recall being informed of the initial settlement, and denied being aware that his money was used to pay off two other accusers.After the episode with the young assistant, Harvey Weinstein confessed that he had done \u201csomething terrible,\u201d according to John Schmidt, then Miramax\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cI don\u2019t know what got into me. It won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Mr. Schmidt, in an interview, recalled Mr. Weinstein telling him. Mr. Weinstein denied having this conversation.But the allegations kept coming. Even as other women at the company complained of abuse, Mr. Weinstein was never fully held to account. In 1998, Zelda Perkins, an assistant in London, confronted him about harassing her and allegedly assaulting a colleague. Donna Gigliotti, a senior executive who had left Miramax a few years earlier, recommended a lawyer and encouraged Ms. Perkins to demand more settlement money. But \u201cShakespeare in Love,\u201d which Ms. Gigliotti had produced with Mr. Weinstein, was about to be released. \u201cShe clearly felt that it was perfectly fine to get me to down Harvey,\u201d Ms. Perkins said. But \u201cshe wasn\u2019t going to stick her neck out.\u201d\u201cWhen Zelda told me what happened to her colleague, I was horrified,\u201d Ms. Gigliotti said in a recent email. \u201cOnce I was sure she had good independent counsel, I thought it best to let her lawyer determine how to approach and deal with Harvey. I did what I thought was best for Zelda,\u201d she said, adding that she did not speak to Mr. Weinstein for years afterward.In 2010, Ms. Gigliotti resumed working with Mr. Weinstein, becoming the president of production at his company. She left a year later.The Weinstein brothers used \u201cfear, intimidation, psychological and emotional abuse\u201d on their executives, male and female, said Amy Israel, Miramax\u2019s former co-head of acquisitions. \u201cAs a spectator to the abuse you were silenced by the fear that you would become the next target,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only alternative seemingly was to quit \u2014 to throw away everything you had worked so hard for and walk out the door.\u201dEven as someone with stature, Ms. Israel was not immune: Mr. Weinstein promoted her, praised her work, then harassed her, she said. When she stopped by his hotel room to pick him up for a film festival screening in 1994, she said, he was nearly naked and asked her for a massage.\u201cI reported the incident to someone more senior,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was told that another one of my other colleagues had also been harassed. But no one had ever bothered to warn me. Even after reporting it, nothing was done.\u201d She started warning female colleagues never to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, she said.The human resources department was seen by many as protecting Mr. Weinstein more than his employees. When Ms. O\u2019Connor complained that she was frightened to travel with Mr. Weinstein, \u201cthe response was basically, \u2018let us know if he hits you or crosses a line physically,\u2019\u201d she wrote in a 2015 memo. After she submitted a document detailing allegations of sexual harassment and other misconduct by Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Boies and another lawyer helped reach a settlement with her.Do you have the next big story? Want to share it with The New York Times? We offer several ways to get in touch with and provide materials to our journalists.\u201cThe first time I spoke out, the message from H.R. was, \u2018This is not our problem,\u2019\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor said in an interview. \u201cThe second time I spoke up the response was, \u2018How can we quickly make this go away?\u2019\u201dMr. Weinstein shielded himself with legal measures that silenced alleged victims and muffled employees. Mr. Weinstein has said he struck at least eight to 12 settlements with women claiming mistreatment, according to two associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Steve Hutensky, a Miramax lawyer nicknamed the Cleaner-Upper by some colleagues, helped write an agreement with Ms. Perkins in 1998 that barred her from disclosing Mr. Weinstein\u2019s name, even to a therapist, and required her to provide \u201creasonable assistance\u201d to Miramax if the company chose to contest any criminal investigation that might arise.Mr. Hutensky also helped implement an unusually restrictive nondisclosure agreement, obtained by The Times, that prohibited Miramax employees from disclosing any information about \u201cHarvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein and their family members, friends and/or business associates,\u201d without the written consent of the brothers. Mr. Hutensky declined to comment.Mr. Boies, a trusted adviser to Mr. Weinstein, signed a contract this summer with Black Cube, a private investigative firm founded by former intelligence analysts from the Israel Defense Forces. The firm was hired to block The Times\u2019s reporting about Mr. Weinstein, and an operative posed as a women\u2019s rights advocate to get information from an accuser, The New Yorker reported. Black Cube declined to discuss its operations, and Mr. Boies said he did not select the firm or direct its work.Mr. Weinstein cast some of his youngest and least powerful employees in the most uncomfortable roles. In recent weeks, their actions have become a matter of painful debate: Were they careerists doing whatever it took to advance, or victims themselves?Some women whom the producer allegedly targeted describe assistants manipulating them with chilling detachment. In 2004, when Ashley Matthau was a dancer in a Weinstein film, she said his assistant ushered her into a car, told her that the meeting with the producer was for business purposes and then waited outside a hotel room. There, she said, Mr. Weinstein pushed her on a bed and masturbated on her. When she walked out, the assistant was waiting. Ms. Matthau began to cry, but the woman \u201cwouldn\u2019t even acknowledge me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just seemed like a well-oiled machine.\u201d She later reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein.Protesting could get an assistant fired: Michelle Franklin, who worked in London in 2012, said her initial alarm about arranging encounters only escalated as she saw women who appeared emotionally bruised by them. One day, as she guided a woman to Mr. Weinstein\u2019s hotel room, she confronted him. \u201cIt\u2019s not my job, and I don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d she remembers saying. \u201cYour opinion doesn\u2019t count,\u201d she said he responded. She was fired soon after.Others stayed quiet because they felt like they shared a shameful secret. \u201cYou become more and more aware of everything going on, then you realize what it is you\u2019re cleaning up, and you don\u2019t ever want to tell anyone that \u2014 friends, family, my parents \u2014 what kind of job this is,\u201d Ms. Rehal said. She and Ms. Franklin said they were tasked with procuring injectable erectile dysfunction drugs, Caverject and alprostadil. Mr. Weinstein paid with his company card and gave Ms. Rehal a $500 bonus for supplying the medication, she said. Ms. Rehal said she had to keep a supply of the shots at her desk, dispense them to him in brown paper bags and sometimes deliver the medication to hotels and elsewhere before his meetings with women. She and Ms. O\u2019Connor said they had to escort Mr. Weinstein to sex-addiction therapy in 2015.Mr. Weinstein somehow knew personal information about Ms. Rehal, mentioning her student loans and where her younger sister attended school and saying he could have her kicked out. Rewards awaited those who went along, he said. \u201cThis is Harvey Weinstein University, and I decide if you graduate,\u201d he told Ms. Rehal and other assistants. Other former employees recall him saying, \u201cOne phone call and you\u2019re done.\u201d Mr. Weinstein denied threatening Ms. Rehal about her sister.Even as Mr. Reiter learned more, he said his efforts to stop Mr. Weinstein went nowhere: The man and the business were too intertwined. Mr. Reiter several times confronted Mr. Weinstein, who brushed him off. Along with David Glasser, the president, and Andy Kim, the chief financial officer, Mr. Reiter voiced concerns with a board member in summer 2015 about whether Mr. Weinstein\u2019s employment contract should be renewed. The executives put together a plan with Bob Weinstein to eject his brother from the company \u2014 they called it \u201cPlan B\u201d or the \u201cnon-Harvey option,\u201d according to Mr. Reiter. In the end, the board renewed his contract.Soon Mr. Reiter found himself under scrutiny. Mr. Boies acknowledged to Mr. Reiter that a security firm was scanning his computer, Mr. Reiter said. It was not the first time Harvey Weinstein had surveilled his associates: Years before, a former Miramax executive who was in a legal dispute with the producer and his company said operatives from Beau Dietl & Associates tailed him, even while he and his wife drove their children to school in Westchester County, N.Y. Richard A. Dietl, head of the private investigative firm, said he could not recall working for Mr. Weinstein.A decade ago, Kroll investigators spent weeks sifting through employee emails looking for derogatory comments about Mr. Weinstein, searching for phrases like \u201chate Harvey\u201d and another that used the word \u201cfat\u201d followed by an expletive, according to a person familiar with the undertaking. More recently, when Mr. Weinstein heard that Jessica Lewis, a casting director on the television show \u201cMarco Polo,\u201d was discussing his behavior toward women, he told her, \u201cI have ears and eyes everywhere!\u201dJust before the Times investigation was published, Mr. Weinstein asked Mr. Reiter to speak favorably about him to reporters: \u201cIf you don\u2019t help me, 180 people will lose their jobs,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said, according to the finance official.When he refused, Mr. Weinstein threatened: \u201cYou\u2019re not so clean either \u2014 I have stuff on you,\u201d he said, referring to a decades-old anecdote about Mr. Reiter repeatedly calling a female co-worker. Mr. Reiter said that he saw her being grabbed at a bar, tried to intervene and called her multiple times the next day to discuss what had happened.\u201cHis modus operandi was always to try to find something on someone else,\u201d Mr. Reiter said. Through his spokeswoman, Mr. Weinstein denied threatening Mr. Reiter.After years of support for Mr. Weinstein, most of the board members have now quit, while publicly staying silent. Privately, at least one expressed loyalty. On Oct. 7, the day before he was ousted from his own company, Mr. Weinstein received an email from the investor Paul Tudor Jones.\u201cI love you,\u201d he wrote, while detailing the steps Mr. Weinstein should take to rehabilitate his image. Mr. Jones told The Times that he condemned Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged misconduct and wanted to encourage him to get help.\u201cFocus on the future as America loves a great comeback story,\u201d he wrote to the movie producer.He finished: \u201cThe good news is, this will go away sooner than you think and it will be forgotten!\u201dBrooks Barnes, Barry Meier and William K.

{"Headline": "Few Hurdles Left, G.O.P. Is Confident Tax Cuts Will Be Signed This Month", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans, buoyed by the Senate\u2019s approval early Saturday of a landmark tax overhaul, expressed confidence that final legislation would be sent to President Trump by the end of this month.While the tax bills approved by the House and the Senate diverge in significant ways, the same forces that rocketed the measures to passage appear likely to bond Republicans in the two chambers as they work to hash out the differences.Republicans passed their sweeping tax overhaul through the Senate just before 2 a.m. on Saturday, two weeks after the House passed its own measure. The Senate vote was 51 to 49, with every Republican but one \u2014 Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee \u2014 in favor. Senate leaders locked down the necessary votes on Friday with little drama, after making concessions to a handful of wavering Republicans.The plan to cut taxes by nearly $1.5 trillion has flown through Congress in the month since a bill was introduced in the House, with Republicans united in their belief in the economic power of tax cuts and desperate for a legislative victory to appease restless campaign donors and base supporters.During a news conference after the Senate vote, the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, expressed little doubt that a consensus plan would soon become law after a conference committee resolved the differences between the two bills. \u201cThis is a great day for the country,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.Mr. Trump echoed that optimism, writing on Twitter that \u201cwe are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts\u201d and that he looked forward to signing a final bill before Christmas.The differences between the measures, though substantial, do not appear troublesome enough to prevent Mr. Trump from achieving that goal, which would be his first major legislative victory.Among the issues that will need to be worked out: Under the Senate bill, tax cuts for individuals would expire at the end of 2025 to mitigate the losses in revenue, and the mandate that individuals obtain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act would be repealed. The House bill does not have these provisions.The Senate approved the final bill, 51-49. A list of every senator\u2019s vote on the bill and selected amendments.The two versions also employ different methods to try to prevent multinational companies from shifting profits out of America and into lower-tax countries.In addition, the House bill would set a new 25 percent top tax rate for profits earned by small businesses and other so-called pass-through companies, while the Senate bill would give the owners of those companies a 23 percent deduction on pass-through income, which is taxed at rates for individuals.The House bill would eliminate the alternative minimum tax for corporations and individuals and eventually eliminate the estate tax. The Senate bill would maintain the corporate A.M.T. and trim, but not end, the individual A.M.T. and the estate tax.Still, the bills share much of the same architecture and many core elements. Each would cut the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Each would eliminate deductions for state and local income taxes, nearly double the standard deduction for individual filers, and reduce individual tax rates. Because of those provisions, both bills are projected to cut taxes initially for the bulk of middle-class taxpayers, yet raise them on millions of other middle-class families.The House bill would preserve a deduction for up to $10,000 a year in state and local property taxes. The Senate bill would, too, thanks to a last-minute change that helped gain the support of Senator Susan Collins of Maine.Mr. Trump, after insisting for weeks that the top corporate rate be cut to 20 percent, signaled on Saturday that it could wind up being a little higher \u2014 22 percent. \u201cIt could be 22 when it comes out, but it could also be 20,\u201d he told reporters outside the White House. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what ultimately comes out.\u201dSuch an increase would give Republicans extra revenue to pay for other tax cuts in the overhaul, potentially easing its path to final passage.Lawmakers and lobbyists will battle furiously over the small details in a consensus bill, but party leaders show little worry that big issues will trip up the plan. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said early Saturday that the House would move \u201cquickly\u201d to a conference committee. House members are planning to return to Washington on Monday, a day earlier than planned, to vote to proceed to conference.\u201cNow it\u2019s time to take the best of both the House and Senate bills, make them even stronger in a conference committee,\u201d Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a news release on Saturday, \u201cand finalize one piece of legislation that will dramatically improve the lives of Americans for generations to come.\u201dThe Senate tax bill has been marketed by Republicans as a tax cut for the middle class. How would people in your income group fare?After the Senate vote, some ebullient Republicans seemed to hint that a conference might not even be necessary. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, when asked if he thought the House might just take up the Senate\u2019s bill.Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, suggested that such a move by House Republicans was possible, but said, \u201cThat\u2019ll be a question for House leadership.\u201d A senior administration official, however, said on Friday night that that was not likely to happen.If Republicans do go to conference, the House and the Senate would each need to vote again to pass the package that resulted from those negotiations, before sending the bill to Mr. Trump. If the House were to simply approve the Senate bill, it would head to Mr. Trump straight away.Unable to stop or stall the bill, because Republicans are employing a process that allows them to bypass a legislative filibuster, Democrats were left to fume about the tax plan and the process by which it was speeding toward approval.Democrats charged that the Senate bill had been loaded with last-minute favors for the rich and the well-connected at the expense of the middle class, and complained that the text of the bill had been released only hours before the vote, with handwritten changes scrawled in the margins. Lobbyists saw a list detailing the changes before they did, the Democrats said.\u201cIs this really how the Republicans are going to rewrite the tax code?\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, asked in a floor speech before the vote. \u201cScrawled like something on the back of a napkin? Behind closed doors? With the help of K Street lobbyists? If that\u2019s not a recipe for swindling the middle class and loosening loopholes for the wealthy, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201dAs a group, Democrats seemed resigned to the fact that there was little they could do to stop the tax overhaul from being enacted.\u201cMy sense is they may have a conference in name only,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said after the vote.But Mr. Wyden predicted that Republicans would eventually regret their victory. \u201cThe American people are going to be stunned when they see what\u2019s really in this,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deliverance From 27,000 Feet", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "Five Sherpas surrounded the frozen corpse. They swung axes at the body\u2019s edges, trying to pry it from its icy tomb. They knocked chunks of snow from the body, and the shattered pieces skittered down the mountain. When they finally freed a leg and lifted it, the entire stiff and contorted body shifted, down to its fingertips.More than a year of exposure to the world\u2019s wickedest elements had blackened and shriveled the man\u2019s bare face and hands. His hydrant-yellow summit suit had dulled to the hue of a fallen leaf. The bottom of his boots pointed uphill. His frozen arms were bent at the elbows and splayed downhill over his head. It was as if the man sat down for a rest, fell backward and froze that way.The Sherpas picked at the body and used gestures and muffled words to decide how best to move it off the mountain. The ghoulish face and bone-white teeth scared them, so they covered the head with the jacket\u2019s hood.There was no time to linger. That altitude is called the \u201cdeath zone\u201d for good reason. The Sherpas knew from experience how difficult it was to scale the world\u2019s highest mountain. The only thing more daunting might be to haul a dead body back down.The man\u2019s name was Goutam Ghosh, and the last time anyone saw him alive was on the evening of May 21, 2016, when it was obvious that he would become another fatality statistic, soon frozen and as inanimate as the boulders around him.Ghosh was a 50-year-old police officer from Kolkata, part of a doomed eight-person expedition \u2014 four climbers from the Indian state of West Bengal and four Sherpa guides from Nepal \u2014 that ran out of time and oxygen near the top of Everest. The four Bengali climbers were eventually abandoned by their guides and left to die. Three did; only one, a 42-year-old woman named Sunita Hazra, survived, as did the guides.At the time of the tragedy, the climbing season for Everest was almost over. On their way to the summit over the next two nights, the last two dozen of the year\u2019s climbers had come upon Ghosh\u2019s rigid corpse on a steep section of rock and ice.To get around him, climbers and their guides, sucking oxygen through masks and double-clipped to a rope for safety, stripped off their puffy mittens. They untethered the clips one at a time, stepped over and reached around Ghosh\u2019s body, and clipped themselves to the rope above him.Some numbly treated the body as an obstacle. Others paused to make sense of what they saw \u2014 a twisted man still affixed to the rope, reclined on the slope as if he might continue climbing after waking from his awkward slumber.Apparently abandoned at his time of greatest need, he was a mute embodiment of their worst fears. One climber stepped on the dead man and apologized profusely. Another saw the body and nearly turned around, spooked by the thought of his own worried family back home. Another paused on his descent to hold a one-sided conversation with the corpse stretched across the route.Who are you? Who left you here? And is anyone coming to take you home?Mount Everest occupies a rare spot in the collective imagination \u2014 a misty mix of wonder, reverence and trepidation. Hundreds of people successfully and safely reach the summit most years and return home with inspirational tales of conquest and perseverance. Other stories detail the occasional tragedies that leave a few people dead in a typical year. Those disaster stories are now their own genre in books and film.Where most of those stories end is where this one begins, long after hope is gone \u2014 the quiet, desperate and dangerous pursuit, usually at the insistence of a distraught family far away, to bring the dead home. The only search is for some semblance of closure.That was why the Sherpas with their oxygen masks and ice axes had come this far, this high, more than a year later.The four Indian climbers, from a vibrant climbing culture in West Bengal, were like so many others attempting Everest. They saw the mountain as the ultimate conquest, a bucket-list item that would bring personal satisfaction and prestige. They dreamed of it for years and made it the focus of their training. As motivation, they surrounded themselves with photographs of the mountain, from their Facebook pages to the walls of their homes.In other ways, however, they were different. Climbing Everest is an expensive endeavor, something to be both bought and earned. Many climbers are middle-aged Westerners \u2014 doctors, lawyers and other professionals \u2014 with the kind of wealth that the group from India could not fathom. Some spend $100,000 to ensure the best guides, service and safety.These four climbers measured monthly salaries in the hundreds of dollars. They borrowed money and sold off possessions simply for a chance. They cut costs and corners, because otherwise Everest was completely out of reach.Ghosh shared an apartment with eight members of his extended family. Paresh Nath, 58, was a one-handed tailor who barely scraped by with his wife and young son. Subhas Paul, 44, drove a small-goods truck and used his father\u2019s pension to pay for his Everest attempt. Hazra was a nurse, married and raising a son.They knew one another from the climbing circles of West Bengal, connected more by their common mission than strong friendships.About 5,000 people have reached the 29,029-foot (8,848-meter) summit of Everest at least once since Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary first did it in 1953. Nearly 300 people have died on the mountain in that period, according to the Himalayan Database, which tracks such things.Nepal officials estimate that about 200 bodies remain scattered across Everest. A few are so familiar, so well preserved by the subfreezing temperatures, that they serve as macabre mileposts for the living, including one corpse commonly called Green Boots. Other bodies remaining on Everest include those of George Mallory, dating to his fatal attempt in 1924, and the guide Scott Fischer, part of the 1996 disaster depicted in \u201cInto Thin Air.\u201dMost of the bodies are far out of sight. Some have been moved, dumped over cliffs or into crevasses at the behest of families bothered that their loved ones were someone else\u2019s landmark or at the direction of Nepali officials who worry that the sight of dead bodies hinders the country\u2019s tourist trade.More and more, however, families and friends of those who die on Everest and the world\u2019s other highest peaks want and expect the bodies to be brought home. For them and those tasked with recovering the bodies \u2014 an exercise that can be more dangerous and far more costly than the expedition that killed the climber in the first place \u2014 the drama begins with death.When someone dies, those left behind, from climbing partners on the scene to family and friends half a world away, are immediately faced with enormously daunting decisions and tasks. The rituals, customs and logistics of what happens next are always different.There are practical considerations, including whether to search for the bodies of those presumed missing or dead, if that is even feasible, and whether to recover the body or let it rest eternally where it is. There are emotional considerations, maybe cultural and religious ones, often in the name of closure, which can mean different things to different people. There are the wishes of the deceased, if those were ever communicated. There are logistical concerns, including danger and cost, local customs and international laws. Sometimes, in some places, recovery of a body is not just wanted, it is needed, to prove a death so that benefits can be provided to a family in desperate need of financial support.All these things came into play after the bodies of three men from India were scattered high on Everest in 2016. The dim hopes for rescue kindled into demands for recovery, led by the West Bengal government.Within a few days, in the short window between the last of the season\u2019s summit attempts and the start of the summer monsoon that racks the Himalayas and shuts down the climbing season until the following year, a recovery team of six hired Sherpas tried to find the deceased and carry them down. They had neither the manpower nor the time.The first they found was Paul, the delivery driver and a part-time guitar instructor who lived with his sprawling family, including his wife and 10-year-old daughter, in the small town of Bankura. He was steps from the well-worn route below Camp 4, roughly 26,000 feet above sea level. He was faceup, but only the toes of his boots stuck out of the fresh snow. It took four hours to chip and pry him from his icy grave and another 12 to drag him to Camp 2, where a helicopter carried the body to Base Camp.A few days later, thousands crowded Bankura\u2019s rough and narrow streets for a miles-long procession of Paul\u2019s body, which was carried on the open bed of Paul\u2019s small truck. The procession led to the banks of the Dwarakeswar River, where the body was cremated and the soul set free, according to Hindu tradition. There was heartache, but also closure.Back on Everest, above where Paul\u2019s body was extricated, two of the Sherpas moved up to Camp 4. At roughly 26,000 feet, higher than all but about 15 of earth\u2019s peaks, it sits at the edge of the oxygen-depleted death zone and is the last rest stop for climbers before their final push to the summit. The Sherpas searched the abandoned tents, some shredded to ribbons by wind, until they found the body of another of the missing Indian climbers. They knew it was Nath, the tailor, because he had only one hand, the other lost in a childhood firecracker accident.Raging winds kept them from climbing any higher in search of Ghosh, and the men were called back. The summer monsoon was on the way, ending the climbing season. Everyone rushed to pack up camp and get off the mountain. Ghosh and Nath, left dead in the death zone, would remain on Everest for at least a year, and maybe forever.The thought of Ghosh somewhere up there \u2014 alone and frozen, or maybe wandering around the Himalayas lost and crying into the wind for help \u2014 haunted his wife, his brothers, his mother and all those who lived in the cramped home off Old Calcutta Road, hundreds of miles away. Kolkata lies on the improbably flat and vast plain of the Hooghly River, a slow and wide offshoot of the Ganges in eastern India. There is nothing, not even a hill, to poke the horizon, and the thought of a mountain like Everest feels as far away as another planet.And so his wife, Chandana, kept the vermilion sindoor in the part of her hair, and the red and white bangles on her right wrist, to indicate that she was a married woman. She would not remove them until she was certain she was a widow. She left the calendar on the wall of the bedroom turned to May 2016. In her mind, that was when time stopped.\u201cI still believe he is alive,\u201d she said in her home in February. \u201cI am not a widow. I am the married wife to Goutam Ghosh. Not a widow. Unless I see him, and we cremate him, I will not change.\u201dIn the steel town of Durgapur, 100 miles northwest of Kolkata, Nath\u2019s wife, Sabita, tried to move on. She and Nath were poor, even by Indian standards, and she had no money to bring the body home. She and her husband never spoke about what to do if he died, but now she convinced herself that he would want to be left on the mountain. He dreamed about Everest so much that a photo of the mountain was one of the few things that decorated the chipped concrete walls of their bedroom.The two of them sat side by side through countless nights sewing backpacks and jackets to sell to support his quest. People in town marveled at his ability to cut and sew with just one hand, just as climbers wondered how he could navigate the ropes and harnesses used in mountaineering.Sabita let herself imagine that she might awake and find him sitting behind his sewing machine. The couple\u2019s 9-year-old son silently pretended that nothing had happened, that his father was simply on a long trip.That\u2019s what happens when the body is left on the mountain. Death feels like hearsay. Only the body coming through the door at home could make it something more than a haunting phantom in the imagination. Its return could bring honor and closure. It might not answer all the questions, but it could end the nightmares.But even if it could happen, even if the bodies of Ghosh and Nath were found where they were last seen, and even if impossibly huge sums could be raised to pay to recover them, and even if there were people willing to risk their own lives on Everest to honor the dead and appease the living, nothing could happen right now. It would have to wait a year.On the afternoon of May 20, 2016, Ghosh, Nath, Paul and Hazra anxiously rested inside a tent at Camp 4. They wore oxygen masks and bright, bulky snowsuits filled with down. They sipped tea and munched crackers. There was little chatter.They did not know one another well, but formed a ragtag group of modestly accomplished climbers, joined by their individual desires to summit Everest and their common need for a low-budget expedition. All had spent 10 years or more saving, borrowing and raising money for an Everest expedition. They found a company popular with West Bengali climbers that charged them each about $30,000, cheaper than other outfitters but still a daunting sum, far more than any of them dreamed of making in a year.Adding to their desperation was that it was their third attempt in three years. Their 2014 quest was scuttled by an avalanche that killed 16 Sherpas, ending the season just as it was about to start. The 2015 season was canceled after an earthquake rocked Nepal in late April, killing nearly 9,000 people. It caused an avalanche that roared into Everest Base Camp, killing 18.Now, finally, after weeks at Base Camp and on the lower slopes of Everest, they were within reach of the summit. If all went well, they would be back at Camp 4 within 24 hours, on their way home to India, where Everest summiters are revered as conquering heroes. \u201cEveresters,\u201d they are called.In the early evening, after dark and later than they had planned, they emerged from the tent, each with a guide. (Guides in the Himalayas are often called Sherpas, though not all are part of the ethnic group of Sherpa, from which many take their surname.) The sky was clear and the moon was full. A line of headlamps slinked up the face of the mountain above them.The summit of Everest cannot be seen from Camp 4, but much of the route can. It leads up a series of ropes, used by every Everest climber, that are tied to anchors drilled into the rock and ice and set by Sherpas at the start of the season.The route leads across a barren ice field, sliced with deep crevasses, and shoots up a steep and rocky slope until it reaches a small flat spot, a burr on the side of the mountain. The landing is known as the Balcony, and from there it is two hours or more along the exposed, knife-edged Southeast Ridge to the South Summit \u2014 at 28,700 feet, it would be the world\u2019s second-highest peak, if it were considered separate from Everest. From the South Summit, the top of Everest finally emerges in full view, tantalizingly close up a serrated ridge.The round-trip journey from Camp 4 takes some people less than 12 hours, and experienced guides and climbers know that it should take no more than about 18 \u2014 12 hours up, six hours back. Most follow a rule that at a predetermined time \u2014 rarely later than noon \u2014 all climbers still moving up should retreat. Prolonged exposure is dangerous, and sometimes deadly, because of the unpredictability of afternoon weather, the limited number of oxygen bottles that can be carried and the toll caused by extreme elevation and temperatures.A woman and two guides were the first of 74 people to reach the summit that day, at 3:36 a.m., according to the Himalayan Database. The last recorded time for climbers reaching the summit was 11 a.m.The West Bengal expedition stood at the Balcony well after dawn, resting and taking in the majestic views of snow-covered peaks and cloud-shrouded valleys. There were four clients and only three guides because Nath\u2019s guide appeared to stay behind at Camp 4, for reasons never understood. Other climbers were already coming down, having reached the summit hours before.The Base Camp manager for the Indian expedition received a radio call from Bishnu Gurung, the only one of the group\u2019s guides with experience reaching the summit of Everest. He said he recommended to the clients that they turn back, but they refused.\u201cI told them, \u2018If we are still on the Balcony at 10 in the morning, how can we reach the top?\u2019 \u201d Gurung said.Ghosh cried at the prospect of giving up, Gurung later said. Paul began ascending on his own.\u201cI stopped there just to check if he will return back if I didn\u2019t continue,\u201d Lakpa Sherpa, Paul\u2019s guide, said. \u201cI thought he would listen to me. Sherpas can\u2019t use force or hit him in that situation. They are our guest. All we could do is convince. As he wasn\u2019t convinced, I followed him.\u201dOnly Nath was persuaded to turn back to Camp 4. The three other Indian climbers persisted. The three guides joined them, carrying a dwindling amount of oxygen and a growing sense of dread.\u201cI thought that I won\u2019t return back,\u201d Lakpa Sherpa recalled.Throughout the late morning and early afternoon, dozens who had reached the summit descended past the Indian climbers. Paul Pottinger, a Seattle doctor, reached the summit at 7:48 that morning. He wore a camera on his head to record much of his daylight descent on the rope, a one-way lane used by both those going up and coming down. Negotiating past oncoming climbers can be a slow, clumsy and dangerous exercise.Pottinger passed Paul and his guide, Lakpa Sherpa, well below the South Summit. Lakpa Sherpa asked for the time. Pottinger lifted the sleeve of his jacket to expose his watch, visible to the camera. It was 10:23. He repeatedly told the guide that it was 10:20. He later speculated that the guide wanted Paul, his client, to hear how late it was.\u201cWho climbs Everest without a watch?\u201d Pottinger said months later. \u201cNow I wonder if he had a watch. And I wonder if he was really saying, \u2018Please tell my guy to stop because I can\u2019t.\u2019 \u201dMinutes later, Pottinger passed Pasang Sherpa, Hazra\u2019s guide, climbing alone. At 10:45, on a particularly steep pitch at an anchor tangled in a knot of ropes, Pottinger passed a group of three: Ghosh, Gurung and Hazra.Paul and Lakpa Sherpa reached the summit at 1:45 p.m., according to the camera later recovered from Paul\u2019s body. There were 31 photographs taken at the summit over 16 minutes.The others in their group \u2014 Ghosh, Hazra, Nath and their guides \u2014 were somewhere below.The last photograph of Ghosh taken with his camera appeared to be at the South Summit at 1:57 p.m. He wore an oxygen mask. He held flags and banners that he had carried in his backpack. A video recorder dangled around his neck. Ghosh turned it on.Wind whipped through the camera\u2019s microphone, but not enough to obscure the sound of Ghosh\u2019s quick-paced breathing. It was as if Ghosh were checking himself in a mirror. With a bare hand, he lifted his sunglasses to his forehead. His eyes were bloodshot. He pulled his oxygen mask to his chin, briefly showing his teeth and his gray-speckled mustache.\u201cGoutam,\u201d a voice said, and Ghosh glanced in its direction, put his mask on and reached to turn off the camera. It was the last record of him alive.Yet Gurung, Ghosh\u2019s guide, apparently kept going, alone. About 40 minutes later, he photographed himself 21 times with Ghosh\u2019s camera at what appeared to be the summit. There was no sign of Ghosh.(Hazra, the lone survivor, said that she reached the summit at about 3 p.m. There is no evidence that she got there. She has petitioned for a summit certificate from Nepal\u2019s Department of Tourism, the arbiter of such matters, without success.)In the area above 8,000 meters (over 26,000 feet), from Camp 4 to the summit, a dearth of oxygen and brutal weather kill those who dare stay exposed too long. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, and with the thin air comes less oxygen for the lungs and the bloodstream.The body tries to overcome it by sending more blood to the brain, which can cause swelling, leading to symptoms like headaches, nausea and exhaustion. At extreme heights, a condition known as high-altitude cerebral edema can also cause a lack of muscle coordination, impaired speech, confusion and hallucinations. As the body continues to fight for equilibrium, it sends blood to the lungs. High-altitude pulmonary edema results in coughing and major breathing problems.The sun\u2019s strong rays at high altitudes can burn the skin and eyes, causing snow blindness. The subfreezing temperatures, exacerbated by perpetually strong winds, cause frostbite, killing the skin and the underlying tissue, especially in the extremities.Confused and numb, climbers sometimes react to the onset of hypothermia by shedding their clothes, believing they are burning up, not freezing to death. It is why those who die in extreme conditions, like the ones on the slopes of Everest, are often discovered in a state of undress.Back in West Bengal, vague and inaccurate news reports spread quickly on May 21: The climbers had reached the summit. The houses of the climbers filled with friends offering congratulations and customary sweets.By nightfall, however, the festive moods faded. Updated reports from Everest arrived. The West Bengali climbers were lost on their way down.That evening, down at Camp 4, the first group to leave for a summit attempt included an experienced American climber and photographer, Thom Pollard, and his Nepali guide.They first passed a Sherpa, then another, both cold, scared and without oxygen. Then they came across climbers below the Balcony. One was a woman. One was a man in a yellow snowsuit, lying sideways across the hill, still attached to the rope. His hands were uncovered. He appeared close to death.Options for would-be rescuers are few at such extreme altitudes. Climbers carry finite amounts of oxygen, just enough for their own expected need, because of the weight of the canisters. They worry about their own survival, knowing that extra time exposed to the elements can prove fatal. They are often in a depleted state, physically and mentally. Even if they have all their faculties, they have paid tens of thousands of dollars, perhaps devoted many years of their lives, to this one day, and might be reluctant to abort it all for a faceless stranger whose needs cannot be assessed easily and who, most likely, speaks a different language.Pollard and his guide stopped, discussed the situation and continued past.\u201cI\u2019ve wrestled with this for a year,\u201d Pollard said from his home in New Hampshire.Pollard and his guide were the first to summit on the morning of May 22, at 2:40 a.m. On their descent, still in the dark, they were relieved to see Hazra was gone. There were marks in the snow where she had either scooted downhill or been dragged away.But Ghosh was still there, splayed on the slope and now alone.\u201cHe was dead,\u201d said Pollard\u2019s guide, Lhakpa Gyaljen Sherpa. \u201cI shouted: \u2018Hello, hello!\u2019 There was no response. Looking at his face, he was dead. That\u2019s why the others must have left him.\u201dLike everyone else who went up and back for the remaining days of the season, they stepped over him, clipped out of and back onto the rope around him, and continued down.Sunita Hazra\u2019s memories of that night are spotty, but she remembered leaving Ghosh, her closest friend on the expedition.\u201cI told Goutam, \u2018You must come,\u2019 \u201d she said in the living room of her home near Kolkata. \u201cI thought if I started moving downward, he would follow me. I had neither the strength to help him or to even look behind me to make sure he was coming.\u201dShe believes she would have died, too, if not for Leslie Binns, a British climber who was ascending above Camp 4 when he found her with her mittens off and her jacket unzipped. He gave her a shot of oxygen, which lifted her energy, but soon realized she would not make it to Camp 4 on her own. He aborted his own summit attempt to drag, encourage and cajole her downhill.They soon discovered Subhas Paul, in a dazed and hypothermic state of his own. Binns slowly coaxed the two Indian climbers down, sharing hits of oxygen and trying to lift them when they collapsed. They lost track of the roped route. Paul fell into a shallow crevasse and flailed his arms.Binns eventually made a decision to try to save one or the other. Figuring Paul had energy to expend, he chose Hazra and escorted her to a tent.\u201cWhen I got to Camp 4, Subhas was not behind me,\u201d Hazra said. \u201cI thought he was there. I thought Goutam and Nath were somewhere safe.\u201dSome in Camp 4 later awoke in the night to someone shouting, rhythmically but incoherently, over and over. They presumed it came from within the camp, part of another expedition. No one ventured into the dark to explore.When climbers emerged from their tents in the first rays of sunlight, they realized the shouting was from Paul, about 100 yards uphill from camp. He had been out in the elements for at least 32 hours.Hazra and Paul were reunited with their three guides in the tent. They did not know where Ghosh and Nath were.By midafternoon, persuaded by doctors from other expeditions to get to lower altitude immediately, the group was on its way downhill again, without Ghosh and Nath, carrying the last bits of oxygen it had stashed at Camp 4. Paul soon collapsed.\u201cSubhas started getting very weak,\u201d Lakpa Sherpa said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t getting better even after supplying oxygen. His hands froze. We tried very hard to rescue him from there.\u201dTwo guides stayed with Paul. The third led Hazra downward, but soon left her behind, feeling he was in worse condition than she was, suffering from frostbite on his hands and feet. Darkness came, bringing snow and wind.Alone, Hazra fell and broke her wrist. She had frostbite on her hands. Eventually, the other two guides caught up to her.\u201cI understood from the Sherpas that Subhas sat down to rest,\u201d Hazra said at her home earlier this year. She began to cry. \u201cAnd they left him,\u201d she said.Hazra and the guides made their way to the icy landing spot above Camp 2, where a helicopter winched Hazra to Base Camp. Ferried to Kathmandu, she was hospitalized for her injuries. A few days later, she received a hero\u2019s welcome at the airport in Kolkata.She knew little of what happened behind her, up the mountain. At about the time that Paul, Hazra and the three guides left Camp 4 to descend toward Camp 3, another Indian expedition returning from the summit spotted Nath off the trail in afternoon light. He was upright and alive, mindlessly digging into the ice with his one hand.Nath was carried to Camp 4. His eyes were swollen shut with snow blindness.By the next morning, the last day that anyone would summit Everest for the season, Nath was too weak to hold a bowl of soup. He died in a tent at Camp 4.Goutam Ghosh was still somewhere higher on the mountain. At least 27 people stepped over him on their way to the summit and again on their way down before the season ended and the mountain emptied for most of a year.Every spring, as hopeful climbers from around the world trek to Everest Base Camp in Nepal, an elevation of about 17,500 feet, to begin acclimating for a summit push in May, a team of local Sherpas is hired to create the season\u2019s route up the mountain. They establish the course up more than two vertical miles that hundreds of others will follow.First, the \u201cicefall doctors\u201d set ropes, ladders and makeshift bridges through the notoriously dangerous, ever-shifting Khumbu Icefall immediately above Base Camp. Others keep moving upward, setting anchors and stringing ropes until they reach the summit. The process can take weeks, and is often delayed by bad weather.Only when the ropes are fixed to the top does the Everest climbing season open. It usually lasts only a few weeks, squeezed between the route opening in early May and the projected start of the monsoon at the end of the month.Everest is rarely climbed at any other time of the year. That meant the rope-fixing Sherpas were likely to be the first to see Ghosh and Nath, if their bodies were still there from the year before. The forces of wind, snow, ice and gravity could have moved them or hidden them.Nath was last seen in a tent at Camp 4, at more than 26,000 feet, which gets battered into something unrecognizable from one year to the next. Ghosh was last seen higher on the mountain, clipped to a rope on a steep section called the Triangular Face, just below the perch called the Balcony. If that rope from last year\u2019s route was damaged \u2014 perhaps by a falling piece of ice \u2014 Ghosh\u2019s body could have fallen and disappeared for good.There were three major reasons the Ghosh family desperately wanted Goutam\u2019s body returned. The first was emotional. The idea that he lay near the summit of Everest, alone, exposed to the elements, left to serve as a tragic tourist marker for future climbers, was nearly too much to bear. And they wanted answers about what happened. Maybe his body could provide those answers. Maybe that video camera around his neck, if it was still there and still worked, held clues. Maybe there were memory cards from his camera in his pockets or backpack. Maybe a message for the family. Something.The second was religious. Hindus believe the body is merely a temporary vessel for the soul. Once the soul is severed from the body through cremation, it is reincarnated in another body. Like most in West Bengal and across India, the Ghoshes were devoutly Hindu. To them, closure required a cremation, and all the ceremonies that came with it.The third reason, as important as the others, was financial. Legally, in India, Ghosh was considered a missing person. Only when a body was produced, or seven years had passed, would the Indian government issue a death certificate, which the Ghosh family needed to gain access to his modest bank accounts and to receive financial death benefits like life insurance and the pension he had earned as a police officer.Ghosh was a police sub-inspector, the second in command at the local precinct of the Kolkata police. It was a good job that paid about $500 a month. Ghosh was a talented player of tabla, the Indian bongo-like drums, and sometimes performed with his wife. He took army courses to become an adept equestrian and was known in the neighborhood as a good soccer player. He had been mountaineering and rock climbing for most of his life.It might seem a strange hobby in Kolkata, hundreds of miles from the Himalayan foothills, but West Bengal is a surprising hive of mountaineering. There are hundreds of mountaineering clubs, in just about every small town and every neighborhood of the cities. Kolkata has dozens of them. The state government heavily promotes the activity through the West Bengal Mountaineering and Adventure Sports Foundation, where a 60-foot climbing wall rises outside its offices.The foundation gives grants to those who apply with realistic ambitions of scaling the biggest peaks. In the case of Ghosh, Paul, Nath and Hazra, it granted each 500,000 rupees, or about $7,500, toward their quest to climb Everest.Ghosh was the most experienced of the mountaineers \u2014 not a well-known climber in West Bengal, but a respected one. He was an instructor at summer camps held at a climbing center on Susunia Hill, a 1,450-foot hiccup on the plain a couple of hours\u2019 drive northwest of Kolkata. He had successfully climbed a number of 7,000-meter peaks in the Himalayas. In the bedroom he shared with Chandana was a poster of Everest. It hung there for 20 years.\u201cWe try to go through our routines,\u201d Chandana Ghosh said in February. \u201cThe peace is not there. We try to eat and we try to sleep. But all the time we are thinking about the beloved man of this family, lying up there all alone.\u201dGoutam Ghosh was the youngest of three brothers, all in their 50s. They lived with their parents, wives and children in a dim, two-story apartment in the concrete jumble of Barrackpore, a district of northern Kolkata. Their father had recently died. The door from the street led to an outside hallway, open to a sky obscured by rambling apartments, one on top of another, squeezed tight. The bathroom was to the left, a hole behind a half wall and a pitcher of water next to a hose.Debasish Ghosh, 53, unlike his younger brother, was not a mountaineer. A small man with a bushy mustache and a bit of a paunch, he ran a fast-food stall, serving chow mein and mutton rolls, not far from the family\u2019s home near the Barrackpore train station. He made a vow: If the body could be found, he would bring Goutam home.Debasish Ghosh hoped that the West Bengal government would coordinate and finance a retrieval attempt a year later. For months, he requested meetings with officials, slowly climbing the government\u2019s chain of command, until he and Chandana met with Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal.She expressed concern for the cost, Debasish Ghosh said, and asked who would venture up Everest to bring back the bodies. She wondered about the state\u2019s responsibility if members of a recovery team were hurt or killed.Without a commitment from the state government, the Ghosh family sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. His office forwarded it to the state government, with a note that said \u201cfor action as appropriate.\u201d Secretly, the state government approved money for the operation, but it did not share its plans with the Ghosh and Nath families.\u201cThey were saying that only if the body is located will they take up the decision,\u201d Debasish Ghosh said. \u201cBut who will inform us that the body is there? It has to be the Sherpas, because otherwise nobody is obligated to find the body.\u201dSo the family hired an experienced guide who was known among West Bengali climbers and who had been to the Everest summit five times. He told Debasish Ghosh that he would recover his brother\u2019s body for 26.3 Indian lakh rupees, or roughly $40,000, more than the cost of Goutam Ghosh\u2019s original expedition.The family agreed to pay 2.5 lakh (about $4,000) upfront, to organize and buy oxygen for those who would make the initial search, following closely behind the rope-fixing teams. The rest would be paid at intervals along the way \u2014 when photographs were produced, for example, and when the body reached Kathmandu.The Ghosh family did not have the money, but agreed to sell a small lot in Kolkata that Goutam owned, where he hoped to someday build a house. They sold jewelry, including a gold necklace that Chandana wore for her wedding. Family members and mountaineering club members scrounged the small bits of savings that they had. By early May, as the rope-fixing team was doing its work, it was still not enough.\u201cWe have arranged about 20 lakh so far,\u201d Debasish Ghosh said in Kolkata.A day later, too anxious to wait helplessly any longer, he packed a small yellow daypack with a few changes of clothes, plastic containers of homemade chicken and roti, and a folder of paperwork, protected in plastic sleeves. The sleeves held copies of Goutam Ghosh\u2019s identification card, his police service card, his permit for climbing Everest \u2014 all things that would help identify a body and cut through the logistics of bringing it home.He knelt at his mother\u2019s bed and touched his mother\u2019s feet, a sign of respect. He prayed with her as she cried. He stepped into the hot sun and through a huddle of well-wishers. Accompanied by one of Goutam Ghosh\u2019s friends, he waved and disappeared around a corner, swallowed by a street filled with cars, rickshaws, scooters, bicycles, walkers and cows, and walked to the train station.\u201cI cannot keep my mind cool staying at home,\u201d Debasish said. \u201cI want to be closer.\u201dAfter two trains, two buses and 40 hours, the two men were in Kathmandu. They found a $5-a-night room to share, and waited.The rope-fixing team reached Camp 4 on April 23, but weather stopped the Sherpas from going higher. The team descended to refresh at lower altitude in anticipation of its next push, carrying rumors that a body was seen amid the tatters and rubble at Camp 4 \u2014 the body of Paresh Nath, presumably.His wife, Sabita Nath, had little communication with the government for nearly a year. No one reached out to the family to discuss what might happen if the body was found. No one, in fact, had asked her if she even wanted her husband\u2019s body back.Sabita Nath did not share her tiny home with a large, extended family. With her husband gone, it was just her and their 9-year-old son, Adrishikar, living behind a storefront where her husband sold his handmade backpacks and jackets.\u201cAfter a while, I began to think there is no reason to bring him here,\u201d she said at her home one day, sitting near the sewing machines where they used to work side by side. \u201cHe loved the mountains like God. If he is there, let him be. His soul must be happy somewhere.\u201dShe and Paresh were not deeply religious. Some of Nath\u2019s relatives performed rituals after it was clear that he had died in 2016, but Sabita did not attend. She allowed herself the traditional 10 days of mourning, then removed all the signs of being a wedded woman \u2014 the circular red bindi from her forehead, the vermilion sindoor along the part of her hair and the red and white bangles on her wrist. She was a widow.Money was an issue. Paresh Nath once had a life insurance policy, his wife said, but the premiums were not paid and it was worthless. Sabita got busy at her sewing machine, making simple nylon shopping bags she sold to a nearby grocery market for about 1,500 rupees (about $23) per month. Climbers and friends provided donations of about 2,500 rupees per month ($39) to keep her financially afloat.For most of a year, Adrishikar did not ask if his father was dead, and his mother did not have the heart to tell him.\u201cI tell him that papa has built a room on Everest that he is living in,\u201d Sabita Nath said in February. \u201cI can\u2019t tell him the real fact, that he is gone.\u201dLike many Indians, the Naths ate without utensils, and Adrishikar carefully washed his father\u2019s one hand after meals. Paresh Nath drove the boy to school on a scooter even though he had no license because of his disability. Theirs was a special bond, Sabita Nath said, and her focus was on the boy\u2019s well-being, not her husband\u2019s body.\u201cEven if the government brings the body, what\u2019s the use to me?\u201d she said. \u201cIt is just a mortal body. To me, the more urgent thing is a job, so I can raise our son. To bring a body from Everest is a huge cost. And I cannot spend that money.\u201dIf the government wanted to help financially, she said, the money would be better spent on her son\u2019s education than on her husband\u2019s dead body. She reiterated her stance in May, just before photographs of Nath\u2019s body appeared on social media. He was identified by his boots and the snowsuit he had sewn himself.Nath\u2019s family and friends were stunned by the photographs. Sabita experienced chest pains and went to the doctor.\u201cI felt sick,\u201d she said afterward at her home in Durgapur. \u201cUntil that day, I was trying to console myself by thinking that maybe he was still alive and only lost.\u201dThe route to the summit of Everest changes slightly each year, depending on variable conditions, like the snowpack or snow slides. In 2017, it opened on May 15, later than usual. The new route was strung near previous ones, and the worn, faded ropes of past seasons could be seen threaded among the rocks and through the snow.The rope-fixing team returned down the mountain and reported seeing a body most of the way up the Triangular Face, below the Balcony \u2014 just where Goutam Ghosh\u2019s body was last seen, about 360 days before.\u201cI think that was the body of the Indian climber,\u201d Chime Chundub Gurung, one member of the team, said at the airport in Kathmandu a few days later. \u201cThe body was upside down with legs up. It was very close to the new rope. I didn\u2019t touch it, and I didn\u2019t see the face. I only saw boots, and he was wearing mountaineering clothes.\u201dThe hundreds of climbers below, eager for the route to open and seeing a forecast for good weather, began to stream toward the summit. Within days, dozens reached the summit and came back again. Few of them saw Paresh Nath\u2019s body, stashed away on a far side of Camp 4. But every one of them climbed within feet of Ghosh\u2019s body.The first photographs arrived on Tuesday, May 16. Debasish Ghosh received one on his phone at 6:17 that evening while sitting at his hotel. Numbly, he stared at it, tugging the edges with his fingertips to zoom in for a better look. He sent the message to his son and to Chandana at home in Kolkata. He also sent it to Sunita Hazra, the only survivor among the four Indians in the expedition the year before.The photo showed a body in a faded yellow snowsuit bent like a horseshoe and half-buried in snow. It looked like something archaeologists were midway through excavating. There was no face visible, but the boots and the gear matched what Ghosh was wearing a year before. The pattern of the yellow-and-black snowsuit matched what Sunita had in her closet at home, the one she bought alongside Ghosh at a little shop in Kathmandu.Everyone agreed: It was Ghosh\u2019s body.Three men from the West Bengal government rushed to Kathmandu, taking the 90-minute commercial flight that Debasish Ghosh could not afford. They quickly struck a deal with Mingma Sherpa, the owner of Seven Summit Treks, a major Himalayan expedition company based in Kathmandu. The sides agreed on a price that the government would pay for the two bodies to be recovered: $90,000, roughly the amount the government quietly set aside weeks earlier. The government announced it would pay for the retrievals.Sabita Nath and Chandana Ghosh received calls from a government official asking them to sign a \u201cno objection\u201d certificate to allow for the attempted recoveries. They agreed.Nepal\u2019s Department of Tourism, which oversees the country\u2019s mountaineering trade, placed only one major provision on the operation: It did not want the bodies coming down at the same time that hundreds of climbers were going up.\u201cWe just want to ensure that other mountaineers who planned to go up this season will not be hampered,\u201d Director General Dinesh Bhattarai said. \u201cI have talked to them, and they will try to bring them down at nighttime, and when there are less climbers moving up.\u201dThe issue, he admitted, was one of optics as much as congestion.\u201cThe climbers, they know pretty well that it is dangerous, and they are ready to encounter these kinds of incidents,\u201d Bhattarai said. \u201cThey are mentally prepared for that. It\u2019s more about not hampering the existing climber. But at the same time, we are also concerned about what they see.\u201dIt was also a matter of practicality. Digging out and dragging a body off the mountain typically requires at least six Sherpas. This effort needed about a dozen people. And most of the Sherpa guides were either still on the mountain with clients, or just returning, too exhausted to turn right back around and go up.The days of waiting piled up.It was late May, the tail end of the Everest climbing season, when five hired Sherpas quietly left Camp 2 at 1 a.m. Into the dark they carried ropes and oxygen canisters, but no food, only a little bit of water and a plastic half-liter bottle of Coke. The Coke froze quickly in the bitter temperatures, even inside their packs. When they wanted a sip, they used a small stove to melt ice and put the bottle in the warm water to turn it back to liquid.They turned their oxygen on low at what they called the \u201ccrampon point,\u201d an hour above Camp 2, where the trail becomes predominantly ice and climbers attach crampons, with fang-like spikes, to the soles of their boots.Sherpas typically use oxygen only in the death zone, at Camp 4 and above, but they wanted to move quickly. Oxygen was fuel, feeding the lungs and the blood, and it allowed them to keep a brisker pace than usual. Each man had two bottles, enough to last about 24 hours, they figured.The leader was Dawa Finjhok Sherpa, a 29-year-old guide who had been to the summit of Everest five times. He received a call a couple of weeks before from Mingma Sherpa, the owner of Seven Summits. The company needed an experienced guide to lead an expedition to retrieve a pair of bodies, he was told.(The New York Times hired Dawa Finjhok Sherpa, through Seven Summits, to shoot video of the retrieval effort.)Guides often did two, even three, major expeditions in the Himalayas each spring. By late May, many were either already home or exhausted. Mingma Sherpa dangled a $3,000 payout for a few days of work and scrounged up about a dozen men. He promised beer if they were successful.Like most Sherpas, Dawa Finjhok Sherpa did not love working as a guide, carrying heavy loads and the hopes and demands of foreigners \u2014 and sometimes the foreigners themselves \u2014 up and down the world\u2019s highest peaks. But it paid better than anything else.Many of the guides came from remote villages, and there was little work there. Some, like Dawa Finjhok Sherpa, were from Kathmandu. They knew that more conventional jobs, in construction or retail or finance or anything else, wouldn\u2019t give them the same money for the same amount of work. But it did not mean they liked it.\u201cI\u2019ve almost quit this job,\u201d Dawa Finjhok Sherpa said over a beer in Kathmandu one evening, \u201cbecause there are so many ways to die.\u201dAbout 11 a.m., the retrieval Sherpas reached Camp 4, a ghost town of abandoned tents and gear so late in the season. They heated their Cokes and sipped from the plastic bottles, but did not dawdle. Once rested, the five men stood in the midday light, put on their packs, secured their oxygen masks and kept moving, up the Triangular Face toward the Balcony of Everest, looking for a frozen man who had waited a long time for someone to take him home.A few hours behind them, following the same route, six more Sherpas left Camp 2 and headed to Camp 4. Their mission was to recover Paresh Nath.The danger increased with every foot of altitude toward the summit, where the air grew thinner and the chances of rescue, should anything go wrong, grew slimmer. The same threats faced by climbers from around the world were faced by Sherpas from Nepal. But Mingma Sherpa, an experienced climber himself, said no mission to recover bodies was off limits, if the price was right.\u201cAbove the South Summit, from the South Summit to the summit, we might have to think about it,\u201d Mingma Sherpa said. \u201cBut below the Balcony, the only question is weather. I cannot fight the weather. The technical part, we can handle. The weather can kill us.\u201dIf it all went right, then, the bodies of the Indian climbers would return from Everest. They would be among the highest-altitude recoveries ever made.At 1:39 local time on a Wednesday afternoon, the recovery team searching for Goutam Ghosh got to his body, a pale-yellow crescent on a steep black-and-white backdrop, icebound between jagged rocks the color of coal.The head was downhill, the face turned slightly to the outside. The arms were splayed overhead, the back was arched and the feet were curled to the right. His once-bright clothes were bleached by the elements. So was the rope that was still attached to the rigging around his waist. It was red when all the Everest summiters of the year before climbed it, but was now faded to a dusky pink.There were no signs of his depleted oxygen bottles, probably scavenged and sold in Kathmandu for a hundred dollars. There were no signs of his mittens, likely pulled off by Ghosh in his final desperate, hypoxic moments. The snowsuit was unzipped to the waist, a sign that hypothermia had tricked Ghosh into thinking he was overheating.A skull cap that Ghosh wore the day of the summit attempt was still on, but the yellow down-filled hood attached to his snowsuit was loose and filled with snow. It was still knotted where Ghosh had cinched it at the chin. His hands were bare, black and leathery, like his face. His white teeth, like the silver crampons still attached to his boots, gleamed in the sunshine.The men were able to pry Ghosh\u2019s hood loose and pull it over his face. They tied the hood with rope so they would not have to see the face.\u201cAt first when we saw him, we were a little bit afraid,\u201d Dawa Finjhok Sherpa said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t see the skin, it\u2019s easier.\u201dThe Sherpas connected Ghosh to a new rope, anchored in a rock about 30 feet uphill, and used ice axes to dig and pry the body from the snow. When the body moved, it moved as one piece, without torque, all the limbs, muscles and joints frozen solid. Pulling on a wrist turned the body all the way to the toes. Once the body was freed from the mountain\u2019s grip, the men hammered blocks of ice from it. Dawa Finjhok Sherpa estimated the load weighed more than 300 pounds, double Ghosh\u2019s weight when he was alive. Two men could not lift the body. Three struggled to maneuver it.They tied ropes through Ghosh\u2019s carabiner. They lowered him by rigging a pulley-type system through the same anchors used for climbers attempting the summit. They used Ghosh\u2019s jumar, a ratcheting device used in climbing, to help belay the load, sliding it downhill one stretch of rope at a time.They had the mountain to themselves above Camp 4, which they could see far below in the saddle between Everest and Lhotse.\u201cIt was easier because there was a lot of snow this year, so the rocks were covered in snow and we could slide him,\u201d Dawa Finjhok Sherpa said. \u201cBut the snowy, flat areas were hard. He was heavy.\u201dNot far from where they found Ghosh\u2019s body that morning was another body that Dawa Finjhok Sherpa estimated had been there for five or six years. And somewhere nearby, they knew, was the body of a doctor from Alabama who had died a few days before. There was no plan to bring it down.It took an hour to drag Ghosh\u2019s body to Camp 4, where Dawa Finjhok Sherpa opened Ghosh\u2019s backpack. Inside he found a video camera and a pair of gloves. There were banners and printouts of the India and West Bengal flags, and for the Kolkata police department and Ghosh\u2019s climbing club.Dawa Finjhok Sherpa put the gloves on Ghosh\u2019s hands and put the video camera in his own backpack. He left Ghosh\u2019s backpack at Camp 4, with the wind-torn remains of the 2017 climbing season.The recovery team had a rolled-up plastic toboggan that it intended to use as a stretcher, but Ghosh\u2019s body was too stiff and contorted to fit on it properly. So the men found an abandoned blue plastic tarp, wrapped it around Ghosh\u2019s lower body and lashed it tight with mismatched pieces of rope. They found a thin, gray foam sleeping pad and did the same thing for his upper body.The men tried to keep the body on its back, but it slid better facedown. Soon the snowsuit was ripped open at the elbows, spilling down feathers.By nightfall, the team was pulling, lifting and sliding Ghosh down the mountain, past where Subhas Paul had died the year before. It came across the group assigned to retrieve Paresh Nath, which was on its way up. There were few other climbers. The mountain was practically empty so late in the season, and those who remained traveled different parts of the slopes at different times. Like drivers familiar with a city\u2019s traffic patterns, the recovery Sherpas knew the rhythms of the route.They rested in the middle of the night at Camp 3, which is carved into the precipitous ice of the Lhotse Face. A Seven Summits cook had hiked up from Camp 2 to meet them, and fed them noodles and juice. The Sherpas trudged downhill from there.\u201cI started to make a system to belay the body below Camp 3,\u201d Dawa Finjhok Sherpa said. \u201cMy partner was holding the rope, but he fell asleep. He let the rope slip just as I was hooking up our system. Three of us held on as tight as we could and we screamed. We all got rope burns. If we wouldn\u2019t have held on, the body would have slipped down the mountain.\u201dAt dawn, Ghosh\u2019s body arrived at the crampon point. The Sherpas assigned to get his body had been working nearly 28 hours, but Ghosh\u2019s journey was held up, awaiting Nath and the helicopter that would carry them off the mountain.Clouds shrouded Everest. Ghosh\u2019s recovery team sought shelter down at Camp 2, leaving Ghosh alone on the mountain again. The body was soon covered in snow.The body of Paresh Nath, still in the red-and-black snowsuit that he sewed for himself, reached the crampon point at about 2 p.m. on Thursday, May 25. He was wrapped in a malleable, plastic stretcher, with a tangle of ropes laced through grommets at its edges.Nath\u2019s right hand, his one hand, was bare and appeared to grip a rope across his chest. His other arm was tucked along his side. It was the position he died in a year before. His body was hard as stone.Their toughest work done, the sun shining again, the Sherpas assigned to Nath\u2019s recovery shed their outer layers. They huddled on the snow and were presented with noodles and juice.The Ghosh team came up the short distance from Camp 2, and having strapped the contorted Ghosh into a plastic stretcher of his own, his arms sticking over the edges, coaxed both men downhill in their makeshift sleds. It was not an easy journey, the trail pocked by crags and crevasses. In an hour, they got to the helicopter landing spot, nothing but a relatively flat space covered in snow and ice near the tents at Camp 2. At more than 21,000 feet, it is the highest spot on the mountain that most helicopters can reasonably reach.When the Sherpas called to Base Camp, they were told the helicopter would not come that day. It would come tomorrow, the 26th. The next day, reports were the same. The helicopter would come the 27th.The excuse was weather; it was raining in Kathmandu, and clouds were thick between there and Everest. What the Sherpas did not know, and what the families of Ghosh and Nath did not know, was that they were also waiting for the body of another Indian climber, one who had died just days before.A third team of Sherpas hired by Seven Summits had rappelled into a crevasse near the Balcony and pulled him out. The team followed the teams of Ghosh and Nath back down the mountain, and arrived at Camp 2 late on May 26, well after dark.The biggest expense for most recovery operations is helicopters. Seven Summits wanted to minimize the cost by ferrying three bodies down at once, rather than performing multiple missions over several days.Finally, on May 28, the bodies were in place and the sky was clear and blue. A helicopter curled around the valley and touched down, just for a moment, in a cloud of blowing snow. Its skids briefly tickled the slope, and the helicopter spun sideways. Its tail nearly wiped away the man trying to direct it.The pilot brought it around for another try, flying about 10 feet above the ground as he approached. The helicopter landed and slid 20 or 30 feet before it stopped. The pilot kept the rotors on to hold the copter on the icy shelf. Three men pulled Ghosh\u2019s body to the vessel, and a fourth helped them lift it into the small space behind the pilot, who breathed oxygen from a tank through a tube to his nose.The helicopter, already at its altitude limit, unable to take more than one body at a time, lifted off the snow only slightly and followed the throat of the snow-filled valley downhill, into some low clouds and over the steep, chunky landscape of the Khumbu Icefall.A year before, the climb between Base Camp and Camp 2 took Ghosh and his colleagues about 20 hours, divided by a night\u2019s sleep at Camp 1. The ride down took two minutes.The icefall gave way to a barren strip of gray moraine dotted with yellow and orange tents, the remnants of the season\u2019s Base Camp. The helicopter landed in front of about two dozen people, some pointing cameras and others shielding their faces from the dust.Two men pulled Ghosh\u2019s body out of the copter, letting it drop to the rocks, and another four carried it by the ropes. Soon the helicopter was gone again, to get Paresh Nath.Over a couple of hours that morning, the bodies, along with guides and supplies coming off the mountain for the season, were ferried to a green plain at about 14,000 feet. At noon, the bodies of Ghosh, Nath and the other Indian climber were piled on top in the small cargo space behind the pilot\u2019s seat. Several guides climbed on top of the bodies, happy to have a ride downhill.They flew down a cloud-covered river bed, thick with spring runoff. Seven minutes later, the helicopter landed at Lukla in a cold, light rain. Men muscled the bodies to the ground.Among the men waiting who converged on the cargo was one of the three West Bengal government officials and several police officers from Lukla. Soon, more officers arrived, in uniform. Part of their job was to identify and investigate dead bodies coming out of the mountains above.\u201cThe police tried to take the bodies inside, but we didn\u2019t have the manpower to move them,\u201d Dawa Finjhok Sherpa said. \u201cThey asked us to remove the clothes and the wraps, but they were all frozen. So they said, O.K., just unwrap their faces. They took pictures of their faces.\u201dThe formal investigation took a couple of hours. Down in Kathmandu, Debasish Ghosh stood among about three dozen people waiting at a hospital helipad in the late-afternoon light. The helicopter soon appeared as a silent dot over the city\u2019s skyline. It grew larger and louder until it touched down in a swirl of wind and dust.\u201cI cannot stop thinking about the money spent to retrieve his body,\u201d Debasish Ghosh said. \u201cIf we had spent the money earlier, if we had helped Goutam when he was alive, so that he could find a better agency, or buy more oxygen or make better preparations, could he have survived? Would he be home now, alive? Did we contribute to his death because we didn\u2019t help him until now?\u201dNo one paid Debasish much attention. Not the government officials from West Bengal, quick to reach the helicopter the moment it landed. Not Loben Sherpa, who organized the fateful expedition the year before, or Mingma Sherpa, the owner of Seven Summits, who was paid to recover the bodies. Not the few journalists who had gathered, nor the neighborhood children who rushed to see what the excitement was about.Debasish stood back, without expression, his hands folded behind him. His brother\u2019s body was the first out, laid stiffly on the concrete. People surged forward to get closer. Debasish crossed his arms.Within a couple of minutes, the helicopter was emptied of its cargo and gone again. People and their cameras followed its skyward arc, but Debasish stared intently at his brother\u2019s corpse. No one spoke to him. No one asked if he wanted to get closer to the body. No one comforted him. No one offered to have him meet Dawa Finjhok Sherpa, who led the recovery effort and accompanied the body every step from its yearlong home near the Balcony of Everest to the helipad in Kathmandu.The bodies were lifted into the back of a waiting, unmarked sport utility vehicle and driven around the vast compound of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, to the service entrance at the Department of Forensic Medicine. Government officials arrived quickly by car. Nobody offered Debasish a ride. He walked the 10 minutes, alone.On the ground floor was a warm, dimly lit hallway where a dead body lay uncovered on a table. The lights and air-conditioning in the building had been on sporadically because of power failures, a persistent problem. A service entrance from the dock was on one end. A table was at the other, where a police representative kept guard.Two silver, dented doors opened into what was called the Forensic Demonstration Room. There were three stainless steel tables, each framed with edges to keep things from spilling off the edges. The tables had drains that fed into tubes under the table, and the tile floors had drains, too. Above each table was an electrical outlet to plug in power tools.The three bodies were unloaded from the car and carried into the service entrance. Ghosh\u2019s and Nath\u2019s were placed on the floor of the hallway, to one side. Their names were written in marker on the tattered coverings that had wrapped them all the way from near the summit of Everest.Debasish Ghosh was escorted inside. He told someone that his brother\u2019s name was misspelled.The bodies were not unwrapped, and Debasish did not see his brother\u2019s face. He touched the body only through the layers of clothes and wrappings, and tried to give it a squeeze. It needed to thaw for a couple of days before it could be examined.At 11 in the morning on May 31, a team of forensic doctors huddled over the body of Goutam Ghosh.The bodies had been placed on their own examination tables the day before. A pipe ran warm water over them to help them thaw. For the first time, Debasish Ghosh was taken to look at his brother\u2019s face. He was struck not by overwhelming emotion, but by how black his brother\u2019s face was. He was in the room for less than a minute.Bodies found at such high elevations, where the temperatures remain below freezing, are well preserved. The outside of the body appears intact, if shrunken and mummified. There is little decomposition internally. Threats found in other remote locations, such as heat, soggy conditions or animal scavengers, are not an issue at such high elevations.The university\u2019s forensics department, led by Dr. Pramod Kumar Shrestha, performs six to eight post-mortems on a typical day. Maybe 15 examinations a year are for people who died high in the Himalayas, some of them climbers, some of them villagers.\u201cAfter one year, it may be difficult to determine the cause of death,\u201d Shrestha said. \u201cBut we eliminate the possibilities one by one, until we are left with plausible explanations.\u201dMany climbers who succumb to the elements are said to have died of high-altitude illness, a vague diagnosis. It was presumed to be what happened to Ghosh and Nath.\u201cThe head-regulating mechanics stop functioning when you\u2019re in extreme cold temperatures,\u201d Shrestha said. \u201cWith a lack of oxygen, the brain stops functioning. It is not able to coordinate various functions of the body. It\u2019s the brain that coordinates the regulation of your body.\u201dSometimes there are several possible explanations.\u201cThey may have some injuries from falling or something,\u201d Shrestha said. \u201cThey may have broken bones, internal injuries, a skull fracture, bruises. It depends on the conditions of their death. A lack of oxygen, an exposure to cold, starves the brain. The lungs get a froth in the respiratory passages. But it could be accompanied by a disease. Maybe they died there, but they had heart disease. We check all the internal organs for signs of pre-existing conditions.\u201dWith Ghosh, the doctors began with external observations, something often done by a police investigator looking for clues to a violent death. \u201cThe face appears partially mummified. Both the feet are soddened,\u201d the doctors wrote in the final report for Ghosh. The eyes were \u201cshrunken and collapsed,\u201d they reported. They found lacerations on his right hand, perhaps stemming from rough handling during the recovery. There were no broken bones.A saw was used to cut into the head to retrieve the brain and to split the rib cage to inspect internal organs. The saw cut from behind one ear to the other, over the top of the head. The skin was pulled back, front to back, the skull opened and the brain removed. It was weighed and examined. No abnormalities were found. The brain was replaced, the skull fitted together and the skin sewn.\u201cWe try to keep the body as presentable as possible,\u201d Shrestha said.There was an abnormal amount of fluid in the lungs. The chambers of the heart contained only \u201cpost-mortem clot.\u201d The kidneys \u201cappear congested,\u201d the report said. But the heart and Ghosh\u2019s other organs, most of them removed and weighed, were determined to be normal for a 50-year-old man.The abdomen and the chest were sewn back together, leaving a crude, thick laceration. The exam lasted about 45 minutes. In the final report, the doctors listed the cause of death as \u201cundetermined.\u201dA similar examination for Nath, noting his missing left hand and some abrasions, ended with the same conclusion.The bodies of Ghosh and Nath were carted to a nearby room, in the Department of Anatomy, for embalming. A mix of formaldehyde, glycerin and rectified spirits was injected into their cavities and soft tissue. The bodies were shrouded in plastic wrapping and placed inside wood coffins, along with white cotton cloths.On one coffin was a photocopy of Ghosh\u2019s passport. On the other was a copy of Nath\u2019s. They were attached to the lids of the coffins with clear packing tape.Before the coffins were sealed, though, Debasish Ghosh, wearing a surgical mask, entered and took another look at his brother. He asked for his brother\u2019s boots as a memento. And he asked for the boots of Nath, to give to his family.Preparations were complete at the Ghosh house when the sun came up in Kolkata on June 2, the temperature on its way past 100 degrees. The family\u2019s sitting room, really an unused storefront with yellow walls, was cleared of furniture and the roll-up door raised. Ghosh\u2019s faded climbing boots sat in a corner near his photograph.\u201cI must see him again,\u201d his wife, Chandana, said in the room the day before. \u201cMost times, the bodies are left on Everest. No one can see the body again. No one can touch the body again. At least I will see him once more. I will touch him one more time.\u201dThe hearse crept into the crowd, and was immediately surrounded by mourners. Some hung on to the vehicle and cried. Many aimed their cameras inside, where Ghosh\u2019s body was out of the coffin, draped in white cloths, his feet and face exposed for all to see. A yellow cap, like the one he wore when he died, was on his head. It covered the scar from the autopsy on his skull.The women of the family rushed inside the house, and the body was carried through the throng and placed on the floor. A human chain formed to keep people back amid pushing and shouting. The room, about 10 feet by 20 feet, was stuffed with 50 people. It was swelteringly hot. Women knelt at Ghosh\u2019s side and cried.Chandana broke down near her husband\u2019s left hip and flung herself on top of his corpse. She sat up again, inconsolable, her face and hair wet with tears and sweat. Her nephew lifted a cup of water to her lips and wiped her face with a wet cloth.Ghosh\u2019s mother, her face anguished, wailed and fell atop her dead son.After 20 minutes, the body was carried across the street, onto a platform in the shade. A line formed to pay respects, starting down the block and curling around Ghosh\u2019s body, soon piled with flowers.After an hour in the midday heat, the body was lifted back into the hearse. A group with a banner led the procession onto Old Calcutta Road, followed by mourners in two single-file lines. The hearse followed, and then family members and close friends, some dropping puffed rice and splashing water to the ground, followed by police and military officers. Debasish\u2019s teenage son had downloaded the music of his uncle\u2019s favorite singer into his phone, and Kishore Kumar\u2019s voice warbled from the hearse\u2019s speakers en route to the crematory.At the same time, more than 100 miles to the northwest, a similar ritual unfolded for Paresh Nath in Durgapur. His body arrived in a hearse to the courtyard of his home, where a huge crowd awaited. The lid of the coffin was pried off, and the plastic wrap that encased his body was torn open at the head. A flag of the Durgapur Mountaineers Association was draped on top of him. The body was soon smothered in garlands and petals.Sabita Nath sobbed, and held tight to her son, Adrishikar, now 10, who came face-to-face with the corpse of his father after a year of denying his death. The body was taken to the mountaineering club, where another crowd gathered, and then to the Birbhanpur Cremation Ground along the Damodar River.Adrishikar, as his son, was responsible for the cremation rituals. He was shown all the ritualistic steps and performed them \u2014 the touching of rice and water and fire to the lips, the chanting, the circling. The young boy who had washed his father\u2019s hand after meals when his father was alive was there when his father\u2019s body was slid into the incinerator, and there to take the ashes to the river, and to break the urn, and to dunk himself in the water. And when it was over, he returned home and held his mother again.Thirteen men carried Ghosh\u2019s body up some steps inside the dim, dusty crematory in Kolkata. In the room upstairs, fluorescent bulbs overhead did not provide enough light, and a ceiling fan did not provide enough breeze. One side of the room had an iron gate that opened to an incinerator.The group lifted Ghosh\u2019s body onto a bamboo stretcher. The white linen sheet that covered him was pulled back to reveal a red-and-black track suit. The jacket was opened, exposing a thick, zipperlike scar from the autopsy.Several sticks of incense were lit. In a bowl, rice, banana and ghee were mashed together. A nephew fed it to his uncle\u2019s lips. He poured sacred Ganges water into his hand and sprinkled it on Ghosh\u2019s blackened face, then over the rest of his body. The group chanted prayers and mantras. Debasish Ghosh stood in the corner, expressionless.The body was carried and placed headfirst on rails that disappeared under the metal door of a 10-foot-tall oven. Several times, a man called, \u201cBalo Hari.\u201d The group answered, \u201cHari Bol,\u201d a plea to Lord Krishna to take Ghosh from earth to heaven. The door opened slightly to reveal an orange glow. Someone pulled a lever, and the body slid into the opening. The door closed behind it.Back at the Ghosh house, Ghosh\u2019s widow, Chandana, had changed clothes. Gone was the colorful sari, replaced by a white one with small, subtle flowers. She had no sindoor tilak, the vermilion smear along the hairline that signaled marriage, and no red bindi dot on her forehead.The red and white bangles on her wrist were gone, too. While her husband\u2019s body was cremated, she broke them. A year after her husband died on Everest, she was finally a widow.The calendar on the bedroom wall still showed May 2016.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Republicans Rallied Together to Deliver a Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The sting of failure on health care still lingered in the Senate on Aug. 3, when Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, summoned the Republican members of the Budget Committee to his office. We need to pass a tax bill this fall, Mr. McConnell told his colleagues, and we need a budget that allows us to do that.There was no dissent.Within two months, party leaders had hammered out a budget that steamrolled their previous concerns over adding to the federal budget deficit, in order to pave the way for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. In rapid order, the budget passed the Senate, then the House, putting Republicans on track to deliver a tax bill at breakneck speed to President Trump\u2019s desk by Christmas.The $1.5 trillion bill represents the most sweeping overhaul of the United States tax code in decades, delivering deep and permanent cuts to corporations and temporary tax cuts to individuals. Early Wednesday morning, Republicans claimed victory as the Senate voted 51-48 to pass the bill, which the House passed on Tuesday 227 to 203.But in many ways, the bill represents a political and economic gamble for Republicans. A majority of Americans oppose it, and relatively few believe they will benefit personally from it, polls show. Economic analyses predict it will add more than $1 trillion to budget deficits over the next decade, an amount that would betray the party\u2019s longstanding messaging that mounting federal debt will sap economic growth.Republicans spurned those concerns, rallying around what has been the animating ideology of their party since the Reagan era: that tax cuts will drive faster growth and national prosperity. More immediately, they followed an overwhelming desire to notch a legislative \u201cwin\u201d for the president, their donors, the restless voters of their party base and for their own political fortunes.\u201cThere was never a moment where I thought, \u2018Oh, my gosh, we\u2019re going to fail at this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Toomey said in an interview. \u201cThere were many moments I thought, \u2018This is still an open question.\u2019\u201dWhat there never was, in the minds of Republican leaders, was doubt the bill would pass \u2014 not even in the scattered moments over the past several weeks when individual senators held it up to demand changes.\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in an interview, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a single person say, \u2018If you don\u2019t do this, I\u2019m going to vote no.\u2019\u201dThe House approved the final version of the bill on Tuesday afternoon over the opposition of 12 Republicans and every Democrat who cast a vote. Because of a procedural issue, the House will have to vote again on Wednesday, but the bill is expected to land on Mr. Trump\u2019s desk within days.On the House floor, Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s voice cracked as he signaled victory.\u201cMy colleagues, this is a day I\u2019ve been looking forward to for a long time,\u201d Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said Tuesday, in teeing up a vote he had worked toward his entire career. \u201cToday, we are giving the people of this country their money back.\u201dTo get to that moment, Republicans walled themselves off from criticism, convincing one another that unfavorable economic analyses of their bill were wrong, and that its poor poll numbers would improve once the cuts worked their way into Americans\u2019 paychecks.The schedule minimized time back home for members, allowing them to largely avoid the contentious town hall meetings that helped sink their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. They caught a break when Democrats reached a deal with Mr. Trump to keep the government open in early fall, freeing up valuable legislative time to push the tax bill forward.Mr. Trump pushed party leaders again and again to deliver a bill quickly, and for the most part, he let them write it, intervening only to push for a low corporate rate and to nix an idea to meddle with tax-advantaged 401(k) plans. At times, the president would briefly derail the process with stray and unexpected Twitter posts that sent lawmakers and his own staff scrambling to reconsider major parts of the plan.In the end, the bill met nearly every deadline in an \u201coptimistic\u201d timeline party leaders prepared in early October. That timeline called for House and Senate votes on a conference committee bill to occur Dec. 18. It was off by a day.Mr. Ryan and other Republican leaders have laid the groundwork for a large tax bill for years, but their efforts stalled in the early months of the Trump administration, as the party engaged in a high-visibility effort to dismantle President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law. That effort crashed to the ground in the early hours of July 28, when Mr. McCain and Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine broke from their Republican colleagues in a dramatic late-night defeat for party leaders.Republicans took fire from the party\u2019s base, which had voted for Republicans in large part over health care concerns, from conservative donors and from the president himself. Congressional aides said that criticism galvanized lawmakers, almost immediately, to rally behind what at that point was still only the broad outlines of a tax plan \u2014 but which Mr. McConnell and others saw as the key to appeasing furious Republican voters.A congressional aide said the health care failure united Republicans toward a single goal: tax cuts.At the time of the health care collapse, Republicans had made little public progress toward a tax bill, and it appeared on the back burner. The White House had released a one-page memo in April outlining its priorities. The House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Kevin Brady of Texas, a low-key business advocate better known for his work on health care, had put forth a tax-reform framework. But conservative groups had spent months killing one of its core provisions, a so-called border adjustment that would have effectively taxed imports, raising an estimated $1 trillion over a decade to help offset the revenues lost from reducing tax rates.When Mr. Brady and Mr. Ryan officially abandoned that provision in late July, Republicans faced a difficult question: How would they raise enough revenues in a tax bill to ensure they did not add further to the federal budget deficit, after complaining throughout the Obama administration that deficits and debt were choking the economy?The answer was, they did not.This was the first critical decision Republicans made to keep on their accelerated timeline: They embraced a budget that allowed for much higher deficits, on the assumption that their tax cuts would generate enough new growth and revenues to pay for themselves.A few senators voiced concerns about the possibility of adding more to the debt. They included Mr. Corker of Tennessee, a member of the Budget Committee, who announced this year he was not going to run for re-election and got into a public Twitter fight with Mr. Trump.Mr. Corker was one of the committee members who gathered in Mr. McConnell\u2019s office in August and were charged with writing a budget document that would accelerate passage of the tax bill. Congressional leaders and administration officials had already agreed to utilize the budget reconciliation process, which would allow them to bypass a Democratic filibuster in the Senate and approve a bill entirely on party lines. To do that, they needed a budget, which would include a limit on how much the tax cuts in the bill could add to the budget deficit over the next decade.The Senate passed the bill 51-48, with every Republican present voting yes.Many senators, led by Mr. Toomey, wanted a $2.5 trillion limit, which was less than Mr. Trump had proposed in his campaign tax plan but would all but ensure an immediate return to $1 trillion a year deficits.At Mr. McConnell\u2019s request, Mr. Toomey negotiated for weeks with Mr. Corker, and they eventually compromised on a $1.5 trillion limit. Mr. Toomey convinced many of his colleagues, including Mr. McConnell, that the bill could easily produce enough growth to offset those lost revenues \u2014 an estimate that no detailed economic analysis of the bill has yet supported.\u201cFor some time there was a lot of talk from a lot of sources that tax reform had to score as revenue neutral,\u201d Mr. Toomey said. \u201cI was 100 percent certain we would never get it done if we held ourselves to that constraint, and furthermore that there was no need to hold ourselves to that constraint.\u201dMr. Corker felt $1.5 trillion was the best deal he could get, and he worried that if he refused, party leaders would bypass his committee and allow a vote on a budget with a much larger tax-cut cap.\u201cHindsight being 2020,\u201d Mr. Corker said this week, \u201cI wish we had attempted to limit even more on that front end.\u201dA significant moment came in September, when Mr. Trump cut a deal with the Democratic leaders, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, to prevent a government shutdown and raise the federal debt limit. Republicans say the move averted a protracted fight in both chambers, and left Republican leaders optimistic that they could move quickly on a tax bill by fall.In the Senate, groups of members and their staff met on an almost daily basis to work through individual provisions in the bill to come.By the end of the month, top congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump had released a more detailed framework, identifying a 20 percent corporate tax rate, down from a high of 35 percent today.This simple calculator describes a range of tax scenarios under the Republican tax plan. Find households like yours in five steps or fewer.But Mr. McConnell and Mr. Ryan pushed back on administration officials, including Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, when they attempted to release even more details, such as the break points for individual tax rates. That move, congressional staff said, gave House and Senate tax writers more freedom to craft their own bills and avoid getting boxed into proposals that could prove problematic.The House and Senate approved Mr. Corker and Mr. Toomey\u2019s budget compromise in October. House leaders introduced their bill at the start of November, and it sailed to passage two weeks later. Senators released their bill before Thanksgiving and quickly amended it in two controversial ways: To stay within the budget guidelines, they set individual tax cuts to expire at the end of 2025. And to free up more space for tax cuts, they eliminated the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate for health insurance coverage.To the surprise of their aides, senators embraced both changes.Mr. Trump beat a public drum for the tax bill throughout the process, but he engaged selectively on policy details, often over Twitter, sometimes backed with phone calls. He urged lawmakers to eliminate the mandate, and he scuttled a proposal in the House that would have raised revenue by shifting the tax treatment of some popular retirement contributions.On a long trip to Asia, Mr. Trump often called Mr. Brady to discuss the bills. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump stayed behind to lobby senators, and she helped push for an expansion of the child tax credit that was added in the Senate Finance Committee.In late November, Mr. Trump flew to the St. Louis suburbs to rally for the tax bill on a stage decorated for the holidays. It was there that he unveiled what would become his tagline for the closing presidential push on the bill, promising Americans a tax cut for Christmas.Back in the Senate, key votes were falling into place. Mr. McCain, satisfied that the bill was moving through proper Senate channels, turned to an old friend to assess its effect on the economy. That was Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who had overseen economic policy on Mr. McCain\u2019s failed 2008 presidential campaign, who gave Mr. McCain a frame for considering the bill.\u201c\u2018This is first and foremost about giving better opportunity to workers,\u2019\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin recalled Mr. McCain saying. \u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s going to create some debt. It\u2019s going to have some deficits, no matter what you hear. So your question is, is it worth it?\u2019\u201dMr. McCain concluded it was. He announced his support for the bill before the Senate vote.That was a crucial moment, Mr. McConnell said. \u201cJohn was not there for us on Obamacare, and he was getting urged by everybody center-left,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cto do it to us one more time.\u201d Mr. McCain will ultimately not vote on the bill, having returned to Arizona for medical treatment.The legislation would cut taxes for corporations. American taxpayers, in large part, would also get cuts, though most of the changes affecting them would expire after 2025.Ms. Collins also announced her support, after conversations with business owners in her state and with Mr. Holtz-Eakin, though she came away with the impression that the bill would pay for itself. Other wavering senators signed on \u2014 all but Mr. Corker, who was alone in being rattled by a Joint Committee on Taxation analysis that showed the bill would add $1 trillion to deficits even after accounting for additional growth. His lone no was not enough to stop the bill, even when coupled with every Democrat in the chamber, though it gave Republicans a slim margin for error. Mr. Corker later reversed course and said he would support the final version.As the bill raced through Congress, it sank in the eyes of the public. Majorities of Americans told pollsters they opposed it, and that they expected it would raise, not lower, their tax bills. Republicans told each other those polls would flip \u2014 that the country would come to love the bill when it saw its benefits.Democrats fanned the dissatisfaction, with constant complaints about the bill and its process. Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi thundered on the Senate and House floor that the bill would hurt middle-class Americans, clearly setting up a campaign theme for Democrats to embrace in the midterm elections.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he started the year with a sense of cautious optimism about tax policy but found Republicans unwilling to engage in a serious way.Mr. Wyden described a visit from Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, as a \u201cshow and tell\u201d and said that Mr. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, never followed up on a promise to look into ways to make the tax plan more populist.Mr. McConnell and Mr. Toomey lamented that the bill was not bipartisan and thus was less likely to be enduring. Mr. Toomey said that Republican leaders talked seriously about working across the aisle, but that when Democratic senators sent a letter last summer with strict conditions for working with them, it was clear that Republicans would have to proceed on their own.The final negotiations this month were entirely between Republicans. The Senate version of the bill largely won out, but House leaders pushed, successfully, for an immediate cut of the corporate rate, which was raised slightly to 21 percent from 20 percent, and for a reduction in the top individual tax rate to 37 percent.Negotiations completed, Republicans congratulated each other for what they remain convinced will be seen as a landmark legislative victory. On Tuesday, a few hours before the final Senate vote on the bill, Mr. McConnell acknowledged that Democrats believe the bill will spark a backlash that could determine control of Congress.\u201cThey must believe it must be a political winner for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a political win for the country, and thus, it\u2019s going to be good for us. So we\u2019ll take it to the country and see what happens in 2018.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Offers Tax Incentives to Persuade U.S. Companies to Stay", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is, however, a catch: To be eligible, foreign companies must invest those earnings in sectors encouraged by China\u2019s government \u2014 including railways, mining, technology and agriculture \u2014 according to a statement from the Finance Ministry. The measure is retroactive from Jan. 1 this year, the ministry said.The move would \u201cpromote the growth of foreign investment, improve the quality of foreign investment and encourage overseas investors to continuously expand their investment in China,\u201d the ministry said. It did not elaborate.Despite its appeal as a manufacturing hub, one where companies from around the world have set up operations to tap into a highly skilled work force and strong infrastructure, China charges high taxes. On top of a standard corporate rate of 25 percent, companies are required to make social security contributions and other payments that push their tax burden higher than it is in many other countries.The newly approved tax incentives in the United States could appeal to companies that are frustrated by China\u2019s rising labor costs, ambitious local competitors and tangled legal systems, or those that would rather spend their money at home or elsewhere. And officials in Beijing have worried that the overhaul could prove to be a challenge to Chinese laws that aim to keep money from leaving the country\u2019s borders.While Thursday\u2019s announcement did not explicitly refer to the tax overhaul in the United States, analysts have said that it is almost certain that the policy was in response to it. This month, China\u2019s vice finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, pledged to \u201ctake proactive measures\u201d in response to the overhaul, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency. He noted that the impact of the changes overseas \u201ccannot be overlooked.\u201dThe legislation would cut taxes for corporations. American taxpayers, in large part, would also get cuts, though most of the changes affecting them would expire after 2025.Asian and European officials have speculated that some of the measures in the revamped tax code could help encourage United States companies produce goods domestically for exporting. European leaders, for their part, have raised the specter of a trade battle and implied they may challenge the overhaul before the World Trade Organization.China, meanwhile, has had its own concerns.China sets tight rules on how much money flows out of the country, as a way of controlling the value of its currency and keeping its financial system stable. A significant repatriation of foreign earnings could set off a broader capital flight, and weaken the country\u2019s currency, the renminbi. And a sharp fall in the renminbi could spark a vicious cycle with even more companies \u2014 and possibly individuals \u2014 looking to minimize losses by moving their money out of China.The currency controls, which were tightened last year as Beijing tried to stem a tide of money leaving the country, have led to complaints from foreign companies doing business there.It is, for the moment, unclear how much money American companies actually keep in China, or how much they would seek to bring home. Many businesses use complex accounting techniques to book profits overseas, and firms with major investment plans in China could elect to keep their money here regardless.Regardless, business lobbying groups here said it was unlikely that the Chinese government\u2019s latest measures would be significant enough to keep many American companies from repatriating profits.Jake Parker, vice president for China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said some of his member companies had already said that they would seek to repatriate China earnings to the United States with the tax code change, and were considering doing so quickly to minimize the risk of being subject to capital controls.\u201cSome are concerned that China may impose foreign exchange controls if these repatriations mount up and lead to capital outflow pressures, like we saw early this year and last year,\u201d Mr. Parker said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bitcoin Boom: In Code We Trust", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet as Bitcoin continues to grow, there\u2019s reason to think something deeper and more important is going on. Bitcoin\u2019s rise may reflect, for better or worse, a monumental transfer of social trust: away from human institutions backed by government and to systems reliant on well-tested computer code. It is a trend that transcends finance: In our fear of human error, we are putting an increasingly deep faith in technology.What gives the Bitcoin bubble significance is that, like \u201990s tech, it is part of something much larger than itself. More and more we are losing faith in humans and depending instead on machines. The transformation is more obvious outside of finance. We trust in computers to fly airplanes, help surgeons cut into our bodies and simplify daily tasks, like finding our way home. In this respect, finance is actually behind: Where we no longer feel we can trust people, we let computer code take over.Bitcoin is part of this trend. It was, after all, a carnival of human errors and misfeasance that inspired the invention of Bitcoin in 2009, namely, the financial crisis. Banks backed by economically powerful nations had been the symbol of financial trustworthiness, the gold standard in the post-gold era. But they revealed themselves as reckless, drunk on other people\u2019s money, holding extraordinarily complex assets premised on a web of promises that were often mutually incompatible. To a computer programmer, the financial system still looks a lot like untested code with weak debugging that puts way too much faith in the idea that humans will behave properly. As with any bad software, it can be expected to crash when conditions change.We might add that major governments \u2014 the issuers of currency, the guarantors of banks and enforcers of contracts \u2014 do not always inspire confidence. Governments can be tempted to print money recklessly or seize wealth brazenly from their citizens \u2014 Venezuelan hyperinflation and Indian demonetization are recent examples. But even the most trusted governments can be dubious. Europe, riddled by internal struggles among states, is still in shock about the planned departure of Britain from the European Union. China is a secretive authoritarian state that can lash out against its citizens and rivals when it feels insecure. The United States, perhaps the main guarantor of world solvency, is some $20 trillion in debt, constantly on the verge of default and headed by a serial bankruptee who prizes unpredictability. It is little wonder that the world\u2019s citizens might be looking for alternatives.This all helps explain the popularity of Bitcoin as an asset independent of government, mainstream banks and their various shenanigans. But still, is it really worth anything at all? It is based on a \u201cblockchain,\u201d a technology that creates a decentralized public ledger and rigorously tracks transfers. It is maintained by its users, and no government can mint more coins. Bitcoin isn\u2019t backed by any sovereign, and unlike a stock or a bond, it gives you a claim to nothing other than Bitcoin itself. Yet that illusory quality is true of most forms of money, a shared hallucination that we tolerate as long as it works. If enough others value something, that can be enough to make it serve as a store of value. Sure, Bitcoin will crash again, but over its lifetime, it has already withstood multiple crashes, runs and splits. It actually feels tested.This isn\u2019t to idealize Bitcoin. Despite its virtual nature, it is still a human institution, facing its own misdeeds and governance problems. Odds are that Bitcoin may never function well as a general medium of exchange (something you can buy things with) because of its wild fluctuations, but might work fine as a store of value that you can sell. It may, like Netscape circa 1995, be portending changes to come. But Bitcoin has captured something. As much as we may love other humans, it is now in code we trust.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Robots Are Coming, and Sweden Is Fine", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "In a world full of anxiety about the potential job-destroying rise of automation, Sweden is well placed to embrace technology while limiting human costs.Supported byGARPENBERG, Sweden \u2014 From inside the control room carved into the rock more than half a mile underground, Mika Persson can see the robots on the march, supposedly coming for his job here at the New Boliden mine.He\u2019s fine with it.Sweden\u2019s famously generous social welfare system makes this a place not prone to fretting about automation \u2014 or much else, for that matter.Mr. Persson, 35, sits in front of four computer screens, one displaying the loader he steers as it lifts freshly blasted rock containing silver, zinc and lead. If he were down in the mine shaft operating the loader manually, he would be inhaling dust and exhaust fumes. Instead, he reclines in an office chair while using a joystick to control the machine.He is cognizant that robots are evolving by the day. Boliden is testing self-driving vehicles to replace truck drivers. But Mr. Persson assumes people will always be needed to keep the machines running. He has faith in the Swedish economic model and its protections against the torment of joblessness.\u201cI\u2019m not really worried,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are so many jobs in this mine that even if this job disappears, they will have another one. The company will take care of us.\u201dIn much of the world, people whose livelihoods depend on paychecks are increasingly anxious about a potential wave of unemployment threatened by automation. As the frightening tale goes, globalization forced people in wealthier lands like North America and Europe to compete directly with cheaper laborers in Asia and Latin America, sowing joblessness. Now, the robots are coming to finish off the humans.\u201cIn Sweden, if you ask a union leader, \u2018Are you afraid of new technology?\u2019 they will answer, \u2018No, I\u2019m afraid of old technology,\u2019\u201d says the Swedish minister for employment and integration, Ylva Johansson. \u201cThe jobs disappear, and then we train people for new jobs. We won\u2019t protect jobs. But we will protect workers.\u201dAmericans tend to dismiss Nordic countries as a realm of nanny-state-worshiping socialists in contrast to the swashbuckling capitalists who rule in places like Silicon Valley. But Sweden presents the possibility that, in an age of automation, innovation may be best advanced by maintaining ample cushions against failure.\u201cA good safety net is good for entrepreneurship,\u201d says Carl Melin, policy director at Futurion, a research institution in Stockholm. \u201cIf a project doesn\u2019t succeed, you don\u2019t have to go broke.\u201dIn the United States, where most people depend on employers for health insurance, losing a job can trigger a descent to catastrophic depths. It makes workers reluctant to leave jobs to forge potentially more lucrative careers. It makes unions inclined to protect jobs above all else.Yet in Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia, governments provide health care along with free education. They pay generous unemployment benefits, while employers finance extensive job training programs. Unions generally embrace automation as a competitive advantage that makes jobs more secure.Making the United States more like Scandinavia would entail costs that collide with the tax-cutting fervor that has dominated American politics in recent decades.For Swedish businesses, these outlays yield a key dividend: Employees have proved receptive to absorbing new technology.This is especially crucial in mining, a major industry in Sweden. Wages are high, with pay and working conditions set through national contracts negotiated by unions and employers\u2019 associations. Boliden\u2019s mines have some of the world\u2019s lowest-grade ore, meaning it contains minute quantities of valuable minerals. The prices are set by global markets.\u201cWe have every reason not to be competitive,\u201d says Boliden\u2019s chief executive, Lennart Evrell.The only way for the company to ensure profit is to continually increase efficiency. This is why Mr. Persson and his co-workers in the control room will soon be operating as many as four loaders at once via joysticks.The company is pressing ahead with plans to deploy self-driving trucks, testing a system with AB Volvo, the Swedish automotive giant, at a mine in the town of Kristineberg. There, Boliden has expanded annual production to close to 600,000 tons from about 350,000 tons three decades ago \u2014 while the work force has remained about 200.\u201cIf we don\u2019t move forward with the technology and making money, well, then we are out of business,\u201d says Magnus Westerlund, 35, vice chairman of a local union chapter representing laborers at two Boliden mines. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a degree in math to do the calculation.\u201dAt the mine below the frigid pine forests in Garpenberg, 110 miles northwest of Stockholm, Mr. Persson and his co-workers earn about 500,000 krona per year (nearly $60,000). They get five weeks of vacation. Under Swedish law, when a child arrives, the parents have 480 days of family leave to apportion between them. No robot is going to change any of that, Mr. Persson says.\u201cIt\u2019s a Swedish kind of thinking,\u201d says Erik Lundstrom, a 41-year-old father of two who works alongside Mr. Persson. \u201cIf you do something for the company, the company gives something back.\u201dThat proposition now confronts a formidable test. No one knows how many jobs are threatened by robots and other forms of automation, but projections suggest a potential shock.When automated teller machines first landed at bank branches in the late 1960s, some foresaw the extinction of humans working in banks. But employment swelled as banks invested the savings into new areas like mortgage lending and insurance. Similar trends may play out again.Three years ago, Soren Karlsson quit his job on the business side of a Swedish newspaper to start United Robots, a venture that one might initially think was aimed at ruining the lives of his former colleagues: He developed a robot, named Rosalinda, that scans data about sporting events to yield news stories.\u201cThe stories are not as colorful as a human would write,\u201d he says.But his robots never break for lunch. Today, Mr. Karlsson has six people working at his offices in the city of Malmo. He expects that Rosalinda will write 100,000 stories this year for various Swedish media outlets, bringing his company revenue of about 5 million krona (about $590,000).At the Swedish Union of Journalists, no one seems concerned. Rosalinda is mostly adding coverage that did not exist before \u2014 stories about high school floor hockey games, middling soccer matches.\u201cWe have always tried to applaud and embrace new developments,\u201d says the union president, Jonas Nordling. \u201cWe can\u2019t just moan about what is happening.\u201dYet even if robots create more jobs than they eliminate, large numbers of people are going to need to pursue new careers.Sweden and its Nordic brethren have proved successful at managing such transitions. So-called job security councils financed by employers help people who lose jobs find new ones.One such council in Stockholm, the TRR Trygghetsradet, boasts that 83 percent of participants have found new jobs this year. Two-thirds have landed in positions paying the same as or better than their previous jobs.But some worry that the system could be overwhelmed by the impact of automation. The number of students older than 35 has fallen by nearly one-fifth in recent years at Swedish universities, which have curtailed enrollment of midcareer laborers while focusing on traditional degree programs.\u201cThat\u2019s a kind of warning signal for us,\u201d says Martin Linder, president of Unionen, which represents some 640,000 white-collar workers.Maintaining Sweden\u2019s social safety net also requires that the public continue to pay tax rates approaching 60 percent. Yet as Sweden absorbs large numbers of immigrants from conflict-torn nations, that support may wane. Many lack education and may be difficult to employ. If large numbers wind up depending on government largess, a backlash could result.\u201cThere\u2019s a risk that the social contract could crack,\u201d said Marten Blix, an economist at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm.For now, the social compact endures, and at the Boliden mine, a sense of calm prevails.The Garpenberg mine has been in operation more or less since 1257. More than a decade ago, Boliden teamed up with Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications company, to put in wireless internet. That has allowed miners to talk to one another to fix problems as they emerge. Miners now carry tablet computers that allow them to keep tabs on production all along the 60 miles of roads running through the mine.\u201cFor us, automation is something good,\u201d says Fredrik Hases, 41, who heads the local union chapter representing technicians. \u201cNo one feels like they are taking jobs away. It\u2019s about doing more with the people we\u2019ve got.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s How It Works.", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAfter a couple, I was like, \u2018He\u2019s back,\u2019\u201d Mr. Forgione, 31, a photo producer in Brooklyn, said. He decided to take a chance and reach out in his direct messages. \u201cI asked him if he wanted to hang out, and he said yes,\u201d Mr. Forgione said. The two have continued seeing each other since, spending Thanksgiving together and attending a wedding as each other\u2019s dates.Anthea Fisher, 22, a project manager in finance, began a relationship on Instagram with someone she had known peripherally. \u201cWe liked each other\u2019s stuff from time to time,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter my ex-boyfriend and I broke up, he started liking a lot of my stuff and watching all of my Stories. He would DM me, he would send me memes. And I sort of knew he was trying to get my attention.\u201dNot only does Instagram provide a visually driven collage of your life, it also offers a subtle way of expressing interest through likes and comments, and connecting in the form of a private chat. Meanwhile, the lists of users who have looked at each of your Story cards mean that you now have data \u2014 rudimentary and inconclusive, but still, data! \u2014 on who exactly is obsessing over you today, tomorrow and yesterday.\u201cThe theory is that whoever are your biggest stalkers on Instagram are at the top,\u201d Ms. Fisher said, referring to the lists of users who have looked at your Story. But that is just a theory. According to a spokesperson, the order is \u201cbased on a number of signals including people who recently viewed your story, accounts you interact with the most on Instagram, and more.\u201dTheir experiments yielded mixed results, and Instagram will likely keep the algorithm under lock and key until the end of time. So, if you want to gauge interest anytime soon, we recommend a tried-and-true thermometer: the thirst trap.Thirst: a strong desire for something; a lust for attention.Thirst trap: An image or video that\u2019s intended to attract attention from someone and elicit a response.\u201cA thirst trap can be as simple as a selfie,\u201d said Andrew Keller, 25, a creative strategist at Paper magazine. \u201cI can put up a really cute selfie of me, and the caption can be, \u2018Just ate a bag of Twizzlers, hate myself.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re throwing out a net into a sea of fish,\u201d Mr. Yau said. \u201cWhenever I post a story, I kind of have an idea already of who will respond or what kind of response I will get.\u201d If you are successful, the person you are targeting will be tempted to comment. Might even actually comment. Might even \u201cslide into your DMs.\u201d If so, you have pulled off your very own thirst trap.\u201cEveryone has that one person in their mind that they want to see it,\u201d Mr. Keller said. Waiting for their response, he said, \u201ccan be torture in itself.\u201dOnce you have mastered the thirst trap, advance your skills by making use of the blocking tool. If you want to post something racy for a select few fans of your Stories, you can go into settings and hide the Story from other users. Ta-da! Now Susan from work will, quite fortunately, not see that photo of you perched seductively on her desk after-hours, a bottle of champagne from the holiday party in your hand.If you want your Dulcinea to know that you\u2019re categorically interested, you will have to do more than check their Stories and post thirst traps. Attend to their profile page, where you can see all their photos, as well. Paying a compliment on Instagram is as simple as liking a few photos. \u201cOne \u2018like\u2019 could be, \u2018I randomly liked your stuff\u2019\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cTwo is, \u2018I like two of your photos.\u2019 Three is, \u2018I\u2019m intentionally trying to get your attention.\u2019 It\u2019s the equivalent of eyeing someone in a bar.\u201d\u201cCommenting would be equivalent to walking up to someone and saying a very basic hello,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cThe DMing is the official, \u2018I\u2019m here and I\u2019m not playing around.\u2019\u201d Ms. Fisher agreed: \u201cOnce they\u2019re in your DMs and they\u2019re commenting on things, that\u2019s when they\u2019re trying to make a move.\u201d As in real life, reciprocation is important. \u201cYou, of course, have to wait a little bit to see if they like your photos back,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as if you\u2019re looking at someone at the club and they\u2019re not looking back.\u201dAnother factor to keep in mind in the era of Insta-fame is how many followers your romantic interest has. \u201cAnyone above 75,000 is probably not going to notice you if you like their stuff,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cIf they like your stuff, that\u2019s a different ball game because it means they went out of their way. Then it\u2019s, \u2018Ding, ding, ding.\u2019\u201dAnd though Instagram can offer more depth than an abbreviated Tinder or Bumble or Grindr profile, do not forget that it is still a curated highlight reel. \u201cI\u2019ve had guys straight up refuse to believe that I\u2019m me,\u201d said Kris Kidd, 24, a writer and model in Los Angeles with more than 24,000 followers on Instagram. When men meet him IRL, they are surprised to find that his real-life personality is not as exaggerated as his Instagram persona. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-dimensional platform, which inherently means we can\u2019t see everything. It would be really unhealthy to show all of ourselves on social media.\u201dAdjust your expectations accordingly.Unfortunately, Instagram is not all romance and daisies. In some cases, rather than serving as a conduit for an attraction, Instagram is a reminder of what is gone.When Mr. Forgione began dating his current flame, his ex-boyfriend started paying a lot of attention to his Stories and his feed. \u201cThe level of him creeping on me was out of control, to the point that he texted asking me, \u2018Who is your new boyfriend?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe guy I\u2019m seeing has posted things about me and just from him doing that and tagging me, I\u2019ve seen on my Stories guys who follow him looking at my stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are creeping on him and then creeping on me.\u201dAnd he is not alone. \u201cI add a guy on my fake account even before we break up,\u201d Mr. Yau said. \u201cAs soon as I know things are going south, I\u2019ll add him. I have a fake account that all my exes are on. And I have two exes watching my Stories on their fake accounts.\u201d Why look? \u201cI delete them [from my main account] to make a statement: \u2018I don\u2019t want to keep up with your life anymore,\u2019\u201d Mr. Yau said. \u201cBut I believe that knowledge is power,\u201d Mr. Yau said. \u201cEven if it makes me feel crappy, I still want to know.\u201d\u201cThe only person you want to be in that much pain with when you\u2019re breaking up is the person you\u2019re breaking up with, so maybe there\u2019s some impetus to look at their page to gauge how they\u2019re doing and look for some sign that they\u2019re also feeling bad,\u201d said Leora Trub, an assistant professor of psychology at Pace University and a clinical psychologist.Michel Kobbi, 27, a marketing manager from Montreal, offered a more positive take. \u201cSeeing the new life in pictures helps bring a certain closure,\u201d Mr. Kobbi said. \u201cThen I know I\u2019m totally fine with the relationship ending and I think it ends with another layer of healthiness to it. It\u2019s really turning the page for both people.\u201dOther social media platforms have had similar effects, but Instagram is massive (just Stories has nearly twice as many users as Snapchat does), and other pervasive platforms, such as Facebook, are not as dominated by daily, visual updates. Nor, frankly, are they considered as cool as Instagram. \u201cI obviously have Facebook, but I rarely, rarely use it,\u201d Mr. Forgione said. \u201cYour grandmother\u2019s on it.\u201dAs with real-life breakups, each person will have a unique experience. \u201cHow we interpret it is totally idiosyncratic,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cIt could be, \u2018They\u2019re having such a great time\u2019 or \u2018They must be really compensating for how sad they are.\u2019\u201d\u201cPeople are giving themselves just enough information to come to conclusions about how that person is doing that have more to do with how they\u2019re perceiving how that person is doing rather than how they\u2019re actually doing,\u201d Dr. Trub said.And therein lies the final lesson: Instagram is a window, but also a facade. \u201cThe truth is you can\u2019t look at someone\u2019s Instagram account and know how they\u2019re feeling,\u201d Dr. Trub said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Job Ads Raise Concerns About Age Discrimination", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was written through collaboration between The New York Times and ProPublica, the independent, nonprofit investigative journalism organization.A few weeks ago, Verizon placed an ad on Facebook to recruit applicants for a unit focused on financial planning and analysis. The ad showed a smiling, millennial-aged woman seated at a computer and promised that new hires could look forward to a rewarding career in which they would be \u201cmore than just a number.\u201dSome relevant numbers were not immediately evident. The promotion was set to run on the Facebook feeds of users 25 to 36 years old who lived in the nation\u2019s capital, or had recently visited there, and had demonstrated an interest in finance. For a vast majority of the hundreds of millions of people who check Facebook every day, the ad did not exist.Verizon is among dozens of the nation\u2019s leading employers \u2014 including Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Target and Facebook itself \u2014 that placed recruitment ads limited to particular age groups, an investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times has found.The ability of advertisers to deliver their message to the precise audience most likely to respond is the cornerstone of Facebook\u2019s business model. But using the system to expose job opportunities only to certain age groups has raised concerns about fairness to older workers.Several experts questioned whether the practice is in keeping with the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which prohibits bias against people 40 or older in hiring or employment. Many jurisdictions make it unlawful to \u201caid\u201d or \u201cabet\u201d age discrimination, a provision that could apply to companies like Facebook that distribute job ads.\u201cIt\u2019s blatantly unlawful,\u201d said Debra Katz, a Washington employment lawyer who represents victims of discrimination.The revelations come at a time when the unregulated power of the tech companies is under increased scrutiny, and Congress is weighing whether to limit the immunity that it granted to tech companies in 1996 for third-party content on their platforms.Facebook has argued in court filings that the law, the Communications Decency Act, makes it immune from liability for discriminatory ads.The precision of Facebook\u2019s ad delivery has helped it dominate an industry once in the hands of print and broadcast outlets. The system, called microtargeting, allows advertisers to reach essentially whomever they prefer, including the people their analysis suggests are the most plausible hires or consumers, lowering the costs and vastly increasing efficiency.Other tech companies also offer employers opportunities to discriminate by age. ProPublica bought job ads on Google and LinkedIn that excluded audiences older than 40 \u2014 and the ads were instantly approved. Google said it does not prevent advertisers from displaying ads based on the user\u2019s age. After being contacted by ProPublica, LinkedIn changed its system to prevent such targeting in employment ads.The database of Facebook ads collected by ProPublica shows how often and precisely employers recruit by age. In a search for \u201cpart-time package handlers,\u201d United Parcel Service ran an ad aimed at people 18 to 24. State Farm pitched its hiring promotion to those 19 to 35.Some companies, including Target, State Farm and UPS, defended their targeting as a part of a broader recruitment strategy that reached candidates of all ages. The group of companies making this case included Facebook itself, which ran career ads on its own platform, many aimed at people 25 to 60. \u201cWe completely reject the allegation that these advertisements are discriminatory,\u201d said Mr. Goldman of Facebook.After being contacted by ProPublica and The Times, other employers, including Amazon, Northwestern Mutual and the New York City Department of Education, said they had changed or were changing their recruiting strategies.\u201cWe recently audited our recruiting ads on Facebook and discovered some had targeting that was inconsistent with our approach of searching for any candidate over the age of 18,\u201d said Nina Lindsey, a spokeswoman for Amazon, which targeted some ads for workers at its distribution centers between the ages of 18 and 50. \u201cWe have corrected those ads.\u201dVerizon did not respond to requests for comment.Several companies argued that targeted recruiting on Facebook was comparable to advertising opportunities in publications like the AARP magazine or Teen Vogue, which are aimed at particular age groups. But this obscures an important distinction. Anyone can buy Teen Vogue and see an ad. Online, however, people outside the targeted age groups can be excluded in ways they will never learn about.\u201cWhat happens with Facebook is you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know,\u201d said David Lopez, a former general counsel for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission who is one of the lawyers at the firm Outten & Golden bringing the age-discrimination case on behalf of the communication workers union.Age discrimination on digital platforms is something that many workers suspect is happening to them, but that is often difficult to prove.Mark Edelstein, a fitfully employed social-media marketing strategist who is 58 and legally blind, doesn\u2019t pretend to know what he doesn\u2019t know, but he has his suspicions.Mr. Edelstein, who lives in St. Louis, says he never had serious trouble finding a job until he turned 50. \u201cOnce you reach your 50s, you may as well be dead,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone into interviews, with my head of gray hair and my receding hairline, and they know I\u2019m dead.\u201d\u201cHypothetically, had I seen a job for a social media director at HubSpot, even if it involved relocation, I ABSOLUTELY would have applied for it,\u201d Mr. Edelstein said by email when told about the ad.A HubSpot spokeswoman, Ellie Botelho, said that the job was posted on many sites, including LinkedIn, The Ladders and Built in Boston, and was open to anyone meeting the qualifications regardless of age or any other demographic characteristic.She added that \u201cthe use of the targeted age-range selection on the Facebook ad was frankly a mistake on our part given our lack of experience using that platform for job postings and not a feature we will use again.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Edelstein says he understands why marketers wouldn\u2019t want to target ads at him: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me a bit. Why would they want a 58-year-old white guy who\u2019s disabled?\u201dOne reason is that Facebook\u2019s sheer size \u2014 two billion monthly active users, versus LinkedIn\u2019s 530 million total members \u2014 gives recruiters access to types of workers they can\u2019t find elsewhere.Consider nurses, whom hospitals are desperate to hire. \u201cThey\u2019re less likely to use LinkedIn,\u201d said Josh Rock, a recruiter at a large hospital system in Minnesota who has expertise in digital media. \u201cNurses are predominantly female, there\u2019s a larger volume of Facebook users. That\u2019s what they use.\u201dThere are also millions of hourly workers who have never visited LinkedIn, and may not even have a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but who check Facebook obsessively.Deb Andrychuk, chief executive of the Arland Group, which helps employers place recruitment ads, said clients sometimes asked her firm to target ads by age, saying they needed \u201cto start bringing younger blood\u201d into their organizations. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that we wouldn\u2019t take someone older,\u201d these clients say, according to Ms. Andrychuk, \u201cbut if you could bring in a younger set of applicants, it would definitely work out better.\u201dMs. Andrychuk said that \u201cwe coach clients to be open and not discriminate\u201d and that after being contacted by The Times, her team updated all their ads to ensure they didn\u2019t exclude any age groups.But some companies contend that there are permissible reasons to filter audiences by age, as with an ad for entry-level analyst positions at Goldman Sachs that was distributed to people 18 to 64. A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Andrew Williams, said showing it to people above that age range would have wasted money: roughly 25 percent of those who typically click on the firm\u2019s untargeted ads are 65 or older, but people that age almost never apply for the analyst job.\u201cWe welcome and actively recruit applicants of all ages,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cFor some of our social-media ads, we look to get the content to the people most likely to be interested, but do not exclude anyone from our recruiting activity.\u201dPauline Kim, a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, unlike the federal anti-discrimination statute that covers race and gender, allows an employer to take into account \u201creasonable factors\u201d that may be highly correlated with the protected characteristic, such as cost, as long as they don\u2019t rely on the characteristic explicitly.In various ways, Facebook and LinkedIn have acknowledged at least a modest obligation to police their ad platforms against abuse.Earlier this year, Facebook said it would require advertisers to \u201cself-certify\u201d that their housing, employment and credit ads were compliant with anti-discrimination laws, but that it would not block marketers from purchasing age-restricted ads.Still, Facebook didn\u2019t promise to monitor those certifications for accuracy. And Facebook said the self-certification system, announced in February, was still being rolled out to all advertisers.LinkedIn, in response to inquiries by ProPublica, added a self-certification step that prevents employers from using age ranges when placing an employment ad, unless they affirm that the ad is not discriminatory.With these efforts evolving, legal experts say it is unclear how much liability the tech platforms could have. Some civil rights laws, like the Fair Housing Act, explicitly require publishers to assume liability for discriminatory ads.But the Age Discrimination in Employment Act assigns liability only to employers or employment agencies, like recruiters and advertising firms.The lawsuit filed against Facebook on behalf of the communications workers argues that the company essentially plays the role of an employment agency \u2014 collecting and providing data that helps employers locate candidates, effectively coordinating with the employer to develop the advertising strategies, informing employers about the performance of the ads, and so forth.Regardless of whether courts accept that argument, the tech companies could also face liability under certain state or local anti-discrimination statutes. For example, California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act makes it unlawful to \u201caid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing\u201d of discriminatory acts proscribed by the statute.\u201cThey may have an obligation there not to aid and abet an ad that enables discrimination,\u201d said Cliff Palefsky, an employment lawyer based in San Francisco.The question may hinge on Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for third-party content.Eric Goldman, professor and co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law, who has written extensively about Section 230, says it is hard to predict how courts would treat Facebook\u2019s age-targeting of employment ads.Mr. Goldman said the law covered the content of ads, and that courts have made clear that Facebook would not be liable for an advertisement in which an employer wrote, say, \u201cno one over 55 need apply.\u201d But it is not clear how the courts would treat Facebook\u2019s offering of age-targeted customization.\u201cDepending on how the targeting is happening, you can make potentially different sorts of arguments about whether or not Google or Facebook or LinkedIn is contributing to the development\u201d of the ad, said Deirdre K. Mulligan, a faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology.Julia Angwin and Ariana Tobin are reporters at ProPublica.

{"Headline": "In Tax Overhaul, Trump Tries to Defy the Economic Odds", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPerhaps more than any other American political leader, Mr. Trump knows that long shots, like his own presidential bid, sometimes pay off. In that vein, he and congressional Republicans are arguing that their bitterly contested and expensive rewrite of the tax code will ultimately create more jobs and raise wages.If they are proved correct, they will be repudiating not only historical experience, but most experts. From Congress\u2019s own prognosticators to Wall Street\u2019s virtuosos, scarcely any independent analyses project anything like the rosy forecasts offered by the president\u2019s top economic advisers.To Mr. Trump and his allies, the normal models just do not fully capture the high-octane \u201crocket fuel\u201d embedded in the tax plan. Mr. Trump intuitively understands just how much attitudes and expectations can shape economic decisions.With a businessman in the White House, Mr. Trump argues that companies, large and small, have a renewed faith in the economy. And the corporate tax cut, combined with the rollback in regulation, will prompt waves of new investment and hiring, as middle-class Americans liberally spend the extra money in their pockets.\u201cWe\u2019re going to easily see 4 percent growth next year,\u201d the National Economic Council director, Gary D. Cohn, said. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, declared the tax plan would generate enough growth to more than pay for its $1.5 trillion cost.But those pronouncements are at odds with estimates from the former employer of both men, Goldman Sachs. The bank projected that the tax bill will add just three-tenths of 1 percent of growth in the next two years, before its impact peters out.The firm\u2019s annual growth estimate of 2.5 percent for 2018 matched the one issued this week by the nation\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, while the latest median Wall Street forecast hovered close by. And in 2019, growth is expected to drop to 1.8 percent, Alec Phillips, chief United States political economist for Goldman, said Wednesday after the Senate vote.\u201cWe note that the effect in 2020 and beyond looks minimal and could actually be slightly negative,\u201d the company said in a recent published summary.Such projections are unlikely to deter Mr. Trump and Republican leaders from declaring success next year. Lower taxes and extra incentives to invest in 2018 are almost certain to encourage consumers to spend and businesses to expand.Reduced rates mean most Americans will start taking home more money right away. Roughly three-quarters of taxpayers are expected to get a cut next year, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.Employers may offer other sweeteners, even if they were not specifically spurred by the tax plan. AT&T announced Wednesday that it was giving more than 200,000 domestic employees a $1,000 bonus when the tax bill is signed. Fifth Third Bancorp, based in Cincinnati, also promised a $1,000 bonus and said it would raise the company\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour.The legislation would cut taxes for corporations. American taxpayers, in large part, would also get cuts, though most of the changes affecting them would expire after 2025.At the same time, the anticipated cut in the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and other business perks are lifting the stock market to new heights. In an earnings call this week, Alan B. Graf Jr., FedEx\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company planned to use part of its tax windfall to fatten dividends.But like a shot of adrenaline, that initial burst of economic activity is likely to fade.Some provisions of the bill were intended to be sharp and short. Next year, for example, businesses will be able to borrow money and deduct the cost of those loans at the current rate of 35 percent. But later on, when they reap the profits, they will pay a tax rate of only 21 percent. That could end up causing firms to simply shift the timing of investments they would have made regardless of a change in the tax code.\u201cThe really hard question a year from now is going to be is how much of the miniboom we see is just an acceleration of stuff that was going to happen anyway or additional investment that is really going to spur the economy,\u201d said Mihir A. Desai, a professor of finance at Harvard Business School.Tax cuts can provide an added incentive to invest. But as most chief executives acknowledge, they are generally not the crucial factor.Investment decisions are much more closely linked to demand for goods and services or technological advancement. As it is, manufacturers are not making full use of the capacity in their existing facilities.Mr. Graf of FedEx held out the possibility of more spending on capital investment and hiring next year. But he noted that the economy as a whole would first have to \u201cincrease materially.\u201dOver time, most of the broad-based tax cuts will disappear. Although the richest sliver of Americans will continue to get a break, most people who earn less than $100,000 will see their taxes rise, which could slow the economy\u2019s primary engine, consumer spending.Either way, the deficit will continue to balloon. Over the last decade alone, the deficit has more than tripled. So far, the interest needed to cover that enormous loan has remained relatively small because interest rates have been at historically low levels.But those costs are expected to soar. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to slowly but surely raise the benchmark interest rate.Some economists support such deficit spending during recessions, but they worry that offering stimulants when the economy is on fairly steady ground can backfire. Although employers have resisted raising salaries by much, they continue to complain about the tightness of the labor market. The jobless rate has dipped to 4.1 percent while job openings have remained at record high levels.The pattern of short-term promise followed by disappointment is one that other presidents have experienced. President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 both passed tax cuts that delivered temporary bumps to the economy followed by slowdowns and rising deficits.\u201cThe clear consensus among independent economists is that the impact of the tax cuts on growth is nowhere close to what the administration is talking about,\u201d said Mr. Desai of Harvard. Whatever growth does occur, he added, will be \u201ccounteracted by the fiscal irresponsibility of the bill.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He called it \u201cDealBook.\u201dWhat follows is a lightly edited Q. and A. about the origins \u2014 and the future \u2014 of DealBook, which relaunched in November._____We\u2019re expanding our mandate to become a smartly curated, one-stop shop for all the day\u2019s key business and policy news and analysis in real time.The business world is now inextricably linked with policy \u2014 in Washington, in Brussels, in Beijing \u2014 in a way that it has never been before. Corporate C.E.O.s and investors increasingly spend as much time in D.C. as they do on Wall Street. Business has become politics. And politics is business.That\u2019s why we\u2019re relaunching DealBook with a renewed focus on the intersection of these crosscurrents, leveraging the entire reporting staff of The New York Times for our deeply loyal reader base of influential business and policy leaders and an expanding global audience.We\u2019re going to be touching on everything from lobbying to technology to taxes to automation\u2019s impact on jobs to the business community\u2019s approach to climate change.Our goal is to bring readers unique insights and exclusive behind-the-scenes details about the day\u2019s most important headlines. And of course, we will continue to cover the world of deal making and finance.It was 2001. The Times had just asked me to move back from London, where I had been covering mergers in Europe for the paper, to New York to take over the merger beat here.As I went around meeting people on Wall Street, it occurred to me that many of them were spending as much of the day as I did trying to piece together various news reports, to stay up-to-date. I figured there could be value in curating a daily report that put all of the news together from all sorts of news sources, and in prioritizing the news in a way that made sense for this audience.Back then, the idea of linking to a competitor, whether it be The Wall Street Journal or The Financial Times, was considered treasonous. Blogging was in its infancy. And the real insight was to send the report by email every morning, putting it at the top of everyone\u2019s inbox when they woke up.Back then, by the way, we used to get requests to send the newsletter by fax!Over time, as our readership increased from a couple hundred to over 300,000, DealBook moved from being put together by me in my pajamas at home at 5 in the morning, supported by a small team, to a larger and larger team. We started our website in 2006 and began doing much more original reporting and offering analysis throughout the day. In 2010, we grew even bigger.Along the way, we added an annual conference, a daily page in the newspaper, two annual special sections and more.Michael Schmidt, a star in our Washington bureau, did some writing for us early on in his career \u2014 as did Thomas Kaplan, who now covers Congress and was once on loan to us as a summer intern. Michael J. de la Merced, our most prolific DealBook writer and a mainstay of the report, started working with us all the way back in 2006.The Times was pretty early in developing email newsletters. However, many were just automated lists of headlines. It was the addition of truly original writing and reporting that really elevated The Times\u2019s newsletters in recent years.Readers have gravitated to email newsletters \u2014 they\u2019re the best way to cut through the overwhelming nature of everything online.For me, I have always been driven by trying to figure out what the reader wants \u2014 and what they need.Whenever I finish an interview for a story, I often ask this series of questions: \u201cWhat do you read? What\u2019s wrong with it? What\u2019s missing? What do you wish you had that you don\u2019t have?\u201dEverything that I\u2019ve ever built has come from trying to fulfill the answers to those questions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Heritage Foundation Names New President After Turmoil Under DeMint", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that has influenced Republican White Houses and shaped conservative policy since the 1970s, named a new president on Tuesday who has deep ties to the party\u2019s social conservative and evangelical Christian wing as it moved to steady itself after a year of internal turmoil.If Mr. DeMint\u2019s appointment in 2013 was a sign that Heritage was embracing the grass-roots energy that had proved so disruptive to the Republican Party, naming Ms. James was an acknowledgment that many inside the organization believe Heritage had strayed from its mission of acting as the intellectual and policy guide star for conservatives.Like other institutions that had grown comfortable in their roles as fixtures of the political establishment, Heritage has struggled to find a meaningful role for itself in President Trump\u2019s Washington. Some inside the group complained that it had little influence in shaping debates on Capitol Hill that conservatives should have been far better prepared for \u2014 like the struggle over repealing the Affordable Care Act.And a few of Heritage\u2019s largest donors and board members like Rebekah Mercer, whose family helped finance Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, agitated for change, arguing that the group was squandering its opportunity to lead at a time when Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House.Inside the organization, people viewed Ms. James as a safe choice who, while unlikely to resolve the tensions over Heritage\u2019s direction, would not make them any worse.Ms. James has been a member of Heritage\u2019s board of trustees for over a decade and is close to the interim president, Edwin J. Feulner, a founder of the organization. Until recently, she had been leading the search committee for a new president.\u201cI am confident that under her leadership Heritage will remain committed to conservative principles and to expanding the conservative movement in a positive, inclusive way,\u201d Mr. Feulner said on TuesdayAs a black woman, Ms. James has been an anomaly in the conservative movement, which is dominated by white men. When she spoke to Heritage employees on Tuesday morning, she told a story from her youth in Virginia and how she walked the halls in an integrating school only to be kicked, called names and stuck with pins. \u201cIt turned me into a fighter,\u201d she said.Addressing the direction of the organization under her leadership, she assured people that she would not carry out any drastic changes.In conservative circles, Ms. James was always seen as more of a behind-the-scenes player than as someone who sought the spotlight. But her work has spanned the movement and beyond. Outside government, she worked for the National Right to Life Committee and the Family Research Council and was dean of the school of government at Regent University, a Christian school founded by Pat Robertson.George W. Bush picked Ms. James to lead the Office of Personnel Management, the government\u2019s human resources arm. There she oversaw the enforcement of policies that were championed as part of Mr. Bush\u2019s faith-based initiatives, including offering federal employees a Catholic health plan that specifically excludes payment for contraceptives, abortion, sterilization and fertility treatment.Ms. James held smaller roles in the first Bush and Reagan administrations. Anti-abortion activism has been one of her most personal causes. In 1996, Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign selected her as the secretary of the Republican National Convention, a job given to her because she was passed over as the chairwoman of the subcommittee that dealt with the party platform\u2019s abortion plank. The Dole campaign said at the time that it wanted someone with more moderate views on the issue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bunny Mellon\u2019s Central Park Aerie Lists for $8.9 Million", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExclusive8 PhotosMrs. Mellon\u2019s 2,100-square-foot aerie on the 28th floor of Essex House, an Art Deco hotel and condo tower facing Central Park, is expected to list for $8.9 million. The three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath apartment carries monthly common charges of $9,465; taxes are $2,010 a month.Among her many properties, which include d homes in Antigua, Paris and a more than 2,000-acre estate in Upperville, Va., the New York condo was low on the list. She bought it primarily for business appointments and social gatherings when she visited the city, said Alex Forger, her attorney and executor of her will.She bought two adjacent units for $5.9 million in 2000, according to public records, and combined them into a unified space with a wall of windows overlooking the span of Central Park.Like many of Mrs. Mellon\u2019s purchases, it is both lavish and understated, consciously so. Besides the titan-of-industry view, there are no gilded accents or eye-catching fixtures. The walls are painted white \u2014 to be fair, five shades of it, the designer said \u2014 and the herringbone floors are well worn. There is recessed lighting in the nine-foot ceilings and painted cabinets on either end of the living room, now filled with reams of estate paperwork.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in one of her properties, there\u2019s this sort of serenity,\u201d Ms. Gordon added. \u201cIt\u2019s about as non-Donald Trump as you can imagine.\u201dNot that Mrs. Mellon was frugal. She wore Givenchy, even when working in her garden. She spent millions amassing an eclectic collection of art that included paintings by Mark Rothko, fine jewelry and whimsical objets d\u2019art. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have one porcelain cabbage \u2014 she had 30 of them,\u201d Ms. Gordon said.Mrs. Mellon, who was married to the art collector and philanthropist Paul Mellon until his death in 1999, was born into wealth. She was given her nickname by her nurse, and was known ever after to friends and heads of state as Bunny. As the heir to the Listerine mouthwash fortune (her father made \u201chalitosis\u201d a household word), she belonged to an elite class that included her close friend Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. It was at the Kennedys\u2019 request that Mrs. Mellon, a lifelong horticulture enthusiast, was asked to redesign the White House Rose Garden.Her spending has also courted controversy. She gave more than $3 million to the 2008 presidential campaign of John Edwards, some of which, unbeknown to her, was used to help cover up the former senator\u2019s extramarital affair that ultimately derailed his career. Mr. Forger, her attorney, said she held three fund-raisers for Mr. Edwards in this apartment.\u201cShe viewed him as being in the John Kennedy mode,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she knew Kennedy well.\u201dEven after she was interviewed by the F.B.I. in the subsequent campaign-finance violation trial, she never denounced Mr. Edwards, and she stayed in touch with him until her last days, Ms. Gordon said, noting that Mrs. Mellon even kept a photo of Mr. Edwards by her bedside.This is one of the last properties from Mrs. Mellon\u2019s portfolio to be listed for sale, Mr. Forger said. The proceeds will benefit the Gerard B. Lambert Foundation, in memory of Mrs. Mellon\u2019s father, which funds projects like the creation of gardens for children\u2019s hospitals.Stanley Hancock and George Fesser of Spire Group have the listing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hunting Taliban and Islamic State Fighters, From 20,000 Feet", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byABOARD A B-52, over Eastern Afghanistan \u2014 Flying at more than 20,000 feet, the hulking long-range bomber circled ominously above a militant-infested swath of Afghan territory near the rugged border with Pakistan, hunting for Taliban or Islamic State fighters who could threaten friendly troops nearby.During the Obama administration, American commanders were barred from carrying out offensive airstrikes against the Taliban. Attacks had to be defensive, aimed at protecting Afghan forces on the ground, conditions that commanders complained tied their hands and led to a stalemate. Now the gloves are off, and American warplanes have already dropped more than 3,900 bombs and missiles against targets in Afghanistan this year, three times as many as last year.American airstrikes and Afghan ground raids over the past month have so far destroyed 25 drug labs in southern Afghanistan, wiping out $16 million in Taliban proceeds and throwing the group\u2019s regional narcotics operations into financial disarray, according to military officials and Drug Enforcement Administration estimates.General Nicholson said the campaign would last for months, as the Taliban operates 400 to 500 labs across the country to sustain the group\u2019s $200 million-a-year opium trade. The drug money accounts for at least 60 percent of the Taliban\u2019s income, and goes to buy weapons, recruit and pay fighters and conduct operations.With the war in Afghanistan now in its 17th year, President Trump\u2019s strategy aims to drive the Taliban to a negotiated settlement. It seeks not only to squeeze the group\u2019s opium revenues, but also to increase Afghan army offensives backed by American air power and to hold elections to enhance the Afghan government\u2019s legitimacy.\u201cThe Taliban have three choices: reconcile, face irrelevance or die,\u201d General Nicholson said.Afghanistan specialists say they have heard such boasts before, and the war is still being fought. They also voiced doubts about the hit-them-in-the-pocketbook plan.Other critics said the sharp increase in airstrikes will backfire, inevitably causing more civilian casualties and the accompanying political blowback, despite the military\u2019s best efforts to mitigate that risk.Targeting specialists at the military\u2019s air command center in Qatar say they assembled the list of drug facilities that directly finance Taliban insurgents battling the government by examining hundreds of hours of aerial surveillance and poring over intelligence reports. Airstrikes have been carried out at night when fewer people are near the targets.\u201cIt was a very deliberate process,\u201d said Capt. Ryan Pretty, an Army artillery officer who is deputy chief of the team overseeing the bombing campaign\u2019s effects.Watching and eavesdropping on the scurrying around by drug lab operators whose depots were not hit in the first wave offered important insights for planners drawing up the next set of strikes, helping them map out local Taliban networks.\u201cThese strikes and the aftermath taught us a lot about the complexity of the Taliban\u2019s narcotics operations,\u201d said Navy Lt. William Conway, a former prosecutor in Chicago who is now a lead intelligence officer for Afghanistan at the command center in Qatar.Central to both the antidrug and troop-protection operations are the B-52\u2019s. They are the latest chapter in the storied bomber\u2019s history over the past six decades, from its carpet-bombing missions in the Vietnam and 1991 Persian Gulf wars, to its strategic role as part of the country\u2019s nuclear deterrent. In January, B-52\u2019s will deploy from Louisiana to Guam for duty in the Pacific, including near North Korea.Of the roughly 750 B-52\u2019s originally built, the Air Force is still flying about 75 of the sweptwing, eight-engine H-model planes. The aircraft I flew on, nicknamed Night Train, was built in 1961, making it nearly twice as old as any of its five crew members from the 69th Bomb Squadron out of Minot Air Base, N.D.Our mission began before 5 a.m. at the squadron headquarters at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, where the crew received a series of intelligence, safety and mission briefings. Following bomber tradition, the crew then sprayed on cologne (a very pungent \u201cExtreme Liberty\u201d for this mission).In the pre-dawn darkness, a bus ferried the crew to its jet, its engines running, bombs hanging off its massive wings. Crew members clambered up a metal ladder into the fuselage. The two weapons officers \u2014 Soar, 30, from Pittsburgh, and Will, 28, from Arcadia, Calif. \u2014 sat in front of glowing screens in the cramped, windowless offensive operations compartment.Up another metal ladder was the cockpit and a separate cramped, windowless space for the electronic warfare officer \u2014 Poppa, 28, from San Diego. The mission commander, Rage, 29, from Minden, Neb., and his co-pilot, Bravo, 26, from Hillsborough, N.J., ducked down an aisle and shoehorned themselves into their seats in the cockpit, while strapped into oxygen masks, flight suits, flight vests and ejection seats with parachutes. I sat in an instructor pilot seat behind Rage.The crew members asked to be identified only by their call signs or first names for security reasons. It is a young crew, with only one member, Soar, having previously deployed overseas. One of a dozen crews in the squadron, this was their 23rd mission to Afghanistan or Iraq and Syria since arriving in September.At 5:41 a.m., with the reddish dawn seeping across the horizon, the B-52 lumbered down the runway and roared off on the 3 and a half-hour flight to southern Nangahar Province in eastern Afghanistan, where Taliban and Islamic State fighters are battling with Afghan army troops for control.Once there, with jaw-dropping views of 16,000-foot, snow-capped peaks out the tiny cockpit windows, the crew received instructions from Special Operations forces working with Afghan troops on the ground to use their high-powered camera sensors to spy on several buildings in a village compound, and look for any \u201cnefarious\u201d activity.In this case, the B-52 was acting as an airborne cavalry, ready to rush to the aid of friendly forces with a formidable arsenal that included about two dozen 2,000-pound and 500-pound laser-guided bombs \u2014 more than 10 tons of destruction in all.Inside the B-52, affectionately known as a Buff (as in \u201cBig, Ugly, Fat,\u201d followed by an expletive), the noise was deafening. Crew members wore headphones and talked over microphones. Thirteen hours is a long time in a very confined space, and the crew has tricks to stay alert, including energy drinks and lots of caffeine. An eclectic mix of heavy metal, rock, country and rap music blared through their headphones.For six hours, the B-52 flew tightly banked routes to give Soar the best view of his potential targets. Black-and-white images flickered across his screen: A man chopping wood. A woman doing laundry. Suddenly, he spotted something suspicious: a man pulling a long cylindrical object out from under a tarp. Was it just a long piece of wood or pipe, or was it a surface-to-air missile?Taking no chances, Rage and Bravo veered the plane out of missile range, and called for an armed Reaper drone nearby to take a closer look. After nearly an hour and some delays, the B-52 needed to turn back to base without resolving the minor mystery.No bombs were dropped that day, as has been the case on about a quarter of the crew\u2019s so-called overwatch missions to protect Afghan troops. \u201cBut the good guys got home safely,\u201d said Rage.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Met Opera Reels as Fourth Man Accuses James Levine of Sexual Abuse", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Metropolitan Opera reeled from the suspension of its longtime conductor James Levine over sexual misconduct accusations, a fourth man came forward Monday saying that Mr. Levine had sexually abused him decades ago, when the man was a student.Met officials scrambled to deal with the cascade of accusations, emailing donors to assure them that the Met will be taking \u201call appropriate actions\u201d \u2014 even as the opera house came under sharp criticism for not investigating Mr. Levine after learning in 2016 of a police inquiry into a report of sexual abuse against him.The Ravinia Festival also announced Monday night that it had \u201csevered all ties\u201d with Mr. Levine, its former music director, who had planned to begin a five-year term as conductor laureate in the summer of 2018. \u201cWe are deeply troubled and saddened by the allegations and sympathize with everyone who has been hurt,\u201d the festival said in a statement.The man who made the new accusations Monday, Albin Ifsich, said he had been abused by Mr. Levine beginning in 1968, when Mr. Ifsich was 20 and attending the Meadow Brook School of Music, a summer program in Michigan where Mr. Levine was a rising star on the faculty. He said that the abuse continued for several years after he joined a tight-knit clique of young musicians who followed Mr. Levine in Cleveland and later New York.Mr. Ifsich \u2014 who went on to have a long career as a violinist in the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra \u2014 recalled visiting Mr. Levine\u2019s dorm room one night to discuss problems the student was having with his bow arm. \u201cAnd then he says, \u2018If we\u2019re going to work on your violin I have to understand you sexually,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ifsich said. The abuse began with Mr. Levine exposing himself and engaging in masturbation.A representative for Mr. Levine declined to comment Monday night on Mr. Ifsich\u2019s account.The accusations against Mr. Levine led the Met to suspend him on Sunday night while it opened an investigation into his behavior, and to cancel his upcoming appearances, including in a high-stakes new production of Puccini\u2019s \u201cTosca\u201d on New Year\u2019s Eve.News of his suspension jolted the opera world, where Mr. Levine is considered one of the finest conductors ever, and raised questions about what was known by the Met and other institutions that employed him over the years.In the email to Met donors, Ann Ziff, the chairwoman of the Met\u2019s board of directors, and Judith-Ann Corrente, its president and chief executive officer, wrote that they had been \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the reports about Mr. Levine. A recipient of the email shared it with The Times on Monday night.\u201cTogether with general manager Peter Gelb, we are committed to a complete investigation of the allegations against Mr. Levine, and we would like to assure you and all of the Met\u2019s loyal donors that the company will be taking all appropriate actions,\u201d the two Met officials wrote in the email. \u201cWe also want to assure you that we will never lose focus on our artistic mission to continue to deliver performances of the highest artistic level to our audience.\u201dSome opera lovers and others took to social media to question whether the Met knew about troubling behavior by Mr. Levine and why Mr. Gelb and other leaders did not investigate him before now, given disturbing rumors about his private life that had long circulated in music circles.Mr. Gelb, in an interview, dismissed rumors circulating online that the Met had reached settlements in the past with the families of abuse victims as untrue.\u201cSince I\u2019ve been at the Met there has not been a single instance of somebody coming forward to make a complaint, ever, about Levine in recent Met history,\u201d Mr. Gelb said. \u201cAnd if you talk to the previous general managers about their watches, they say the same.\u201d\u201cThere have been no complaints and no settlements, and this has been verified by the Met\u2019s finance office, our development office,\u201d he said.Mr. Gelb was contacted in October 2016 by a detective from the Lake Forest, Ill., police department who asked him about an official complaint filed by Ashok Pai, the man who accused Mr. Levine of abusing him as teenager in the mid-1980s. Mr. Gelb said Mr. Levine had denied the accusation, and the Met had decided to await the outcome of the police investigation before taking action. The Met began its own investigation this weekend when news of the police report was made public, and it learned that there could be other accusations coming.The news shook the opera house Monday. The musicians of the Met\u2019s orchestra met during a break in their rehearsal of Mozart\u2019s \u201cLe Nozze di Figaro\u201d to discuss \u2014 and try to make sense of \u2014 the accusations against Mr. Levine, whom many revered. They also applauded the courage of, and expressed sympathy for, the men who came forward with accusations that Mr. Levine had abused them, said Jessica Phillips, a clarinet player who leads the orchestra committee.\u201cI think the general feeling is of anguish,\u201d Ms. Phillips said.After Mr. Levine\u2019s suspension, two important unions at the Met \u2014 Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, which represents its orchestra, and the American Guild of Musical Artists, which represents its choristers, soloists, stage managers, directors and dancers \u2013 issued statements that pointedly noted the Met\u2019s obligation to provide a safe workplace.Mr. Gelb spent much of the weekend dealing with the fallout from the accusations \u2014 holding an emergency meeting of its executive committee by telephone on Sunday to discuss its decision to suspend Mr. Levine and working to find conductors to take over his canceled engagements.He also said that the Met was fielding calls and emails from people who said that they wanted to share information about Mr. Levine.\u201cIn general, I think people are stunned and concerned, but at the same time this company has a very strong foundation that runs very deep,\u201d Mr. Gelb said. \u201cAs important as Jim has been as part of the company\u2019s fabric, he did step down as music director two seasons ago, and the company has already imagined life without him.\u201dSeveral Met board members and prominent donors, reached on Monday, declined to discuss Mr. Levine or the pressures facing the Met.On Monday, the Juilliard School announced that the accusations against Mr. Levine had led it to seek a replacement for him at a concert in February that he had been scheduled to conduct of the Juilliard Orchestra and the Met\u2019s Lindemann Young Artist Development Program.Robin Pogrebin and James B.

{"Headline": "Two Marines, Taking Semper Fi to Another Level", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsThe night before Ashley Iorio left her family home in North Stonington, Conn., for her plebe year at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., her high school boyfriend ended their relationship.\u201cThis was a pre-emptive strike, it knocked her for a loop,\u201d said her mother, Beth Iorio, a retired special agent for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (N.C.I.S.).Despite being an excellent student with strong leadership skills and a lifelong desire to serve her country, Ashley Iorio had a tough time battling the pain of the romantic split and her homesickness during that summer of 2012. \u201cAshley had never been away from home for more than a few days,\u201d her mother said.Ms. Iorio frequently called her family in tears. But she also tried to stay focused on Annapolis life, which helped her meet fellow midshipmen. \u201cI was inspired to have a military career because members of my family have served,\u201d said Ms. Iorio, whose father, Robert Iorio, was a Marine captain before joining N.C.I.S., where he met her mother.During her first year at the academy, Ms. Iorio said, she \u201cgot tight with people in my class but didn\u2019t date anyone seriously.\u201dAll that would change, however, after meeting and falling in love with a midshipman named David Sands, the son of a Navy lieutenant and helicopter pilot. The couple married last month in North Carolina in a ceremony that included a military-style salute and many of their academy classmates.Theirs was a whirlwind romance, filled later on with long separations. Ms. Iorio and Mr. Sands met in June 2013 while attending \u201cYoungster Cruise,\u201d a four-week summer training event aboard the U.S.S. San Diego in San Diego, where they experienced what it was like to be enlisted.\u201cI had returned from shopping when David was leaving the ship to go into town, so we just shook hands,\u201d said Ms. Iorio, who graduated from the Naval Academy in 2016 with a degree in economics, and is now a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps, and a productions officer in the disbursing office at Camp Pendleton, Calif.A few days after their initial meeting, they became reacquainted at a group gathering in downtown San Diego\u2019s Gaslamp Quarter. Mr. Sands, who was recruited from Dallas for the crew team, couldn\u2019t remember Ms. Iorio\u2019s name but thought she was cute.\u201cWhile everyone was drinking and hanging out that night, Ashley and I kind of stuck together,\u201d said Mr. Sands, who graduated from the Naval Academy in 2016 with a degree in international relations and is a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps training to be a pilot in Corpus Christi, Tex.The following weekend, he took her to the San Diego Zoo. They talked about their career goals, their desire to give back to their country and their love for family. \u201cI thought David was nice and easygoing,\u201d Ms. Iorio, now 23, said. \u201cHe made me feel great by asking questions and seemed genuinely interested in me.\u201dMr. Sands, also 23, said she was \u201cmature and centered,\u201d different from other women he had dated. \u201cShe was easy to engage in deep conversation,\u201d he said.During the hours they weren\u2019t training, Ms. Iorio and Mr. Sands enjoyed dates on the beach and in restaurants. They discussed the many things they had in common: growing up regaled with military stories by family members (they have uncles and brothers in the military); mutual competitiveness; and love for sports, travel and hiking in national parks.\u201cWe were having so much fun, it seemed like we were on vacation,\u201d Ms. Iorio said.There were also differences. Mr. Sands and his four siblings were home-schooled for religious reasons. He also liked to party with his pals, and was determined to become a pilot. Ms. Iorio, with one brother, was interested in a finance career and focused on school and activities. Her parents said that she was \u201cborn driven and never had a rebellious period.\u201dRomance developed quickly. \u201cTheir relationship was a whirlwind from the beginning,\u201d said Jon Cabarrus, an Annapolis roommate and a groomsman. \u201cThey liked to act goofy, always laughing together. David raved about her at the end of that summer.\u201dBut they didn\u2019t become exclusive during their month off when each went home to be with family. While they talked and texted, there was no discussion about a permanent relationship because Mr. Sands had to know if their feelings could withstand the separation, and then endure the military training and tough classes in Annapolis.\u201cI kept up with Ashley but didn\u2019t want to commit,\u201d said Mr. Sands, adding that he was aware that she was eager for the relationship to take the next step.After a few weeks of studying together and hanging out in Annapolis, it didn\u2019t take long for Mr. Sands to change his mind. On Sept. 13, 2013, as they walked along the Chesapeake Bay, he asked for exclusivity. \u201cI could see we were able to take the fun we had in San Diego and carry it to the academy,\u201d Mr. Sands said. \u201cWe fell in love early as she pushed me to be a better person.\u201dYet having a romantic relationship at a military academy was a challenge.After their plebe year, midshipmen are allowed to date as long as they are in different companies. (He was in the 27th; she was in the 11th.) \u201cYou can\u2019t show any affection while in uniform or on the academy yard, \u201d Mr. Sands said. \u201cBut when we wore civilian clothes, I was allowed to kiss her and hold her hand in public.\u201dWhen they wanted to be together on weekdays, they could go to the other\u2019s room to do homework, watch TV or listen to music as long as the door remained open. \u201cIt was not unusual to be a couple at the academy, and we socialized with others,\u201d Ms. Iorio said. \u201cBut we had to work hard to carve out time for each other because of our grueling schedules.\u201dShe was involved in her company\u2019s leadership roles running daily operations, and he was a varsity rower. With almost every hour scheduled, they still made time for the relationship, if only for a few minutes a day.When Ms. Iorio took Mr. Sands home to spend time with her parents, he was greeted warmly and treated like one of the family. \u201cDavid split wood, walked the dogs in the snow and played in the snow,\u201d her father said. \u201cWe could see how each brings out the best in the other.\u201dHis mother, Ronda Sands, agreed: \u201cAshley has been a calming influence on David. They were always good together, supporting the other during difficult times at the Naval Academy.\u201dThis included personal struggles, like their religious differences. Mr. Sands was raised Presbyterian in a strict Christian home, while Ms. Iorio was raised Roman Catholic in a more relaxed environment. After much discussion and repeated visits to both churches, Ms. Iorio agreed to become Presbyterian for the sake of raising a family.Career discussions also created stress. They weren\u2019t sure whether to go into the Navy or Marines after graduation. Being in the same branch of service would be the best option for their relationship, but Mr. Sands had a dream to fly, while Ms. Iorio wanted a ground career in financial management, which would keep them apart.\u201cWe decided on the Marines knowing we would not be stationed together for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cDavid encouraged me to choose the career I wanted, and I was happy for him to follow his dream of becoming a pilot in Marine Corps Aviation.\u201dThey wrote letters, but it was the beginning of the toughest test of their love. Mr. Sands is now in Texas and Ms. Iorio in California, and there are days when they can\u2019t text or talk. \u201cIt has been hard,\u201d Mr. Sands said. \u201cI am physical, I like to hug, and she isn\u2019t here.\u201dMr. Sands proposed on Dec. 21, 2016, while the couple vacationed in the Virgin Islands, shortly after Ms. Iorio completed her duties in Quantico.While walking along a coral stone beach, they saw the words, \u201cI Love You\u201d coincidentally spelled out on the sand by someone else. Excited and nervous, Mr. Sands set up a tripod, turned on a video recorder and dropped to one knee. \u201cBefore David had time to propose, I said, \u2018Yes!\u2019 \u201d Ms. Iorio said.On Veterans Day, one of Mr. Sands\u2019s uncles, Stan Newton, an ordained Christian Missionary Alliance minister and Naval Academy graduate, officiated before 108 guests on the covered fourth-floor terrace of the Grand Bohemian Hotel in Asheville, N.C., the city where Ms. Iorio\u2019s parents live.Before military classmates, friends and family, Ms. Iorio, wearing an ivory strapless gown from the Blush by Hayley Paige collection, walked down the aisle with her father.Mr. Newton explained the true meaning of love during the ceremony: \u201cReal love means real care and sacrifice for each other more than for yourself.\u201dAfter repeating their vows, Mr. Sands gave Ms. Iorio a long kiss before they exited to applause and the recessional music, \u201cOn Top of the World,\u201d by Imagine Dragons.\u201cAshley and David are in tune with each other\u2019s emotions and mind-set, and their future holds an adventure,\u201d said Rebecca Cabrey, the maid of honor. \u201cAs they work through challenges together, it will only make their relationship more resilient, stronger with each obstacle that life might put in their way.\u201dThe first being that they will begin married life apart, she still in California and he in Texas.\u201cI want a big family,\u201d he said, \u201cbut she wants to wait until we are physically living together which is another 1\u00bd years or more.\u201dThey have separate incomes but hope to begin financial planning together and doing more as a couple even while living separately. \u201cI want to wash his clothes, cook our food and be girlie and feminine, but I can\u2019t being so far away,\u201d Ms. Iorio said. \u201cWe have always discussed our problems and moved forward. I will deploy to the Middle East this spring and glad it\u2019s happening now before we live together. I know we will withstand this period because I am marrying my best friend.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Investigators Scrutinize Another Presidential Candidate: Jill Stein", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate investigators are scrutinizing links between Jill Stein, the Green Party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee, and Russia\u2019s campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, searching for evidence of possible conspiracy.Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Monday that the committee was \u201cjust starting\u201d to look at Ms. Stein\u2019s campaign along with another campaign, which he declined to name, as it continues its investigation of the Trump campaign. Mr. Burr has previously suggested the committee is looking at aspects of the Clinton campaign.Democrats have seethed for more than a year at Ms. Stein, whose tens of thousands of votes in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania either exceeded or nearly matched Donald J. Trump\u2019s margins of victory in those states, which delivered him the White House. At least in certain quarters, they greeted news of the queries enthusiastically.Jesse Ferguson, a former Clinton campaign spokesman, said Americans ought to know if a presidential nominee, no matter how minor, had become a Russian asset or was simply boosted in an effort to chip away Democratic votes from Mrs. Clinton.\u201cRussian operatives were not promoting Jill Stein because they thought she would win,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cThey were promoting her because they thought it would hurt Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump.\u201d\u201cWe strongly support legitimate inquiry into any illegal activity in our elections \u2014 including quid pro quo deals, money laundering, corruption and violation of campaign finance laws,\u201d Ms. Stein said. \u201cAt the same time, we caution against the politicization, sensationalism and collapse of journalistic standards that has plagued media coverage of the investigation.\u201dThe Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s request to the Stein campaign was first reported by Buzzfeed News.Senate investigators are interested in unraveling what was behind the apparent closeness between Ms. Stein, a Harvard-educated doctor and perennial Green Party candidate, and Russia.Ms. Stein traveled to Moscow in 2015 for a dinner celebrating the tenth anniversary of RT, the state-run news organization that American intelligence agencies have concluded was being used to spread propaganda during the presidential campaign.Photographs from the event show Ms. Stein sitting at a table with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other prominent Russian government officials. Sitting across from her was another American, Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who has now entered a plea agreement with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian election interference.A year later, RT hosted the Green Party\u2019s presidential debate, and showered attention on Ms. Stein\u2019s campaign.In her statement, Ms. Stein said she attended the 2015 dinner at her own expense in hopes of \u201creaching an international audience and Russian officials with a message of Middle East peace, diplomacy, and cooperation against the urgent threat of climate change.\u201dAt least in part, her support of WikiLeaks is consistent with the Green Party\u2019s advocacy for transparency and its criticism of the hegemony of the country\u2019s two major political parties. But American intelligence agencies have said that in publishing the emails, the anti-secrecy group was acting as a conduit for the Kremlin.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, would not comment directly on the committee\u2019s interest in Ms. Stein, but pointed out that several of the interactions appeared to be consequential.\u201cI will point out though that Ms. Stein was at the infamous dinner that included General Flynn and Vladimir Putin, and we do know that she has very complimentary things to say about Julian Assange, who certainly was being used by the Russians to take some of the hacked information and release it into our political system,\u201d he said.The disclosure that the committee is looking closely at Ms. Stein\u2019s campaign is the latest indication that the Senate committee is still expanding its investigation as it nears the one-year mark. It stands in stark contrast to the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, the two other congressional bodies investigating aspects of Russia\u2019s interference campaign.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bitcoin Hasn\u2019t Replaced Cash, but Investors Don\u2019t Care", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Bitcoin first entered the public consciousness a few years back, a handful of large companies like Dell and Expedia announced that they would begin accepting the virtual currency. But there weren\u2019t many takers.These investors aren\u2019t using their tokens to buy computers or to book trips. Instead, they are hoarding Bitcoins as if it were virtual gold, a new way to store money outside the control of any government or company.\u201cI\u2019ve always been skeptical of directly competing with and replacing existing forms of payment,\u201d said Steve Lee, a longtime Google employee from San Francisco who is investing in virtual currencies. \u201cToday what Bitcoin is excellent at, and has mostly solved, is being your own bank.\u201dThe argument about what Bitcoin does well and not so well can seem like a semantic debate for computer nerds, with little relevance to the outside world.But disagreements within the Bitcoin community are being watched closely by central bankers and financial industry executives. The titans of finance are monitoring Bitcoin\u2019s successes and failures as they experiment with its technological concepts, like the ledger for recording virtual currency transactions, known as the blockchain.Many large institutions have said they hope to integrate blockchain technology into their designs for the world\u2019s future financial infrastructure, and those designs are likely to be influenced by what is learned from Bitcoin.Mr. Lee and others hope Bitcoin can be used for payments someday, but he thinks that will most likely come from software that is built on top of Bitcoin, not the Bitcoin network itself.Not everyone agrees with Mr. Lee\u2019s position. Many entrepreneurs and academics think virtual currencies will gain traction only if they are easy and cheap to send around. The disagreement has given rise to a host of Bitcoin competitors \u2014 including a separate virtual currency known as Bitcoin Cash.But the community that has developed around the original Bitcoin has increasingly been united around a vision that is focused on its goldlike qualities, rather than its ability to compete with PayPal or Western Union.\u201cThe reason people own Bitcoin is because it\u2019s a great store of value, possibly the greatest that has ever existed,\u201d said Jimmy Song, a developer who has contributed to the Bitcoin software. \u201cYou can send money to Africa in 10 minutes, but that\u2019s not the main reason people buy it.\u201dThe Bitcoin software created a decentralized network of computers that anyone with internet access could join, making it easy to send Bitcoins between addresses. And Bitcoin first gained public notice because of its use as anonymous digital cash on black-market websites like the Silk Road.But the number of people using Bitcoin to buy things was always small compared with the number of speculators buying it because of its scarcity. This was something the original software behind Bitcoin had also encouraged, by setting a limit of 21 million on the number of Bitcoins that would ever be released.The increasing value of Bitcoin made it even less attractive as a way to pay for things. Most people don\u2019t want to pay now with a dollar that could be worth twice as much next week.There are also limits on the Bitcoin system\u2019s capacity. A rule written into the Bitcoin software had established that the network could process only around five transactions per second \u2014 compared with the 25,000 transactions handled by Visa each second.This bottleneck led to a fight between people looking to use Bitcoin for different purposes. Many early followers believed the system could expand to handle more transactions without sacrificing its status as a virtual commodity. This camp proposed a change to the Bitcoin rules that would have doubled the capacity of the system in November.But Mr. Lee and other investors and programmers worried that quickly expanding the Bitcoin network would threaten Bitcoin\u2019s independence.\u201cTo be a global money, you can\u2019t have one bank or one country controlling the money, or even a handful of countries or banks,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIf decentralization is jeopardized, most things fall apart with Bitcoin.\u201dDecentralization is a result of Bitcoin\u2019s unusual design, which allows users to keep and monitor the records of every single Bitcoin transaction, without any central authority.If the number of transactions quickly increased, many Bitcoin aficionados believed, only large companies would be able to keep the records. What\u2019s more, they believed the design of Bitcoin wasn\u2019t well suited to competing with PayPal and Visa, because every transaction has to be recorded on thousands of computers around the world.\u201cAnyone who looked at Bitcoin and saw \u2018cheap payments\u2019 likely doesn\u2019t have much background in computer science,\u201d said Ben Davenport, a co-founder of the virtual currency start-up BitGo and an opponent of doubling the network.\u201cIf people can\u2019t engage in commerce, it\u2019s hard to imagine why they\u2019d want to store their money in Bitcoin in the first place,\u201d Mr. Pair said.Mr. Pair believes it is irresponsible to suggest that a virtual currency that has been around for less than a decade could pose a credible challenge to gold.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The Winklevoss Twins\u2019 unorthodox path to fame and Bitcoin fortune\u2022 There is a paucity of women in corporate America\u2019s c-suites.\u2022 Not every analyst is in love with Apple\u2019s stock price.\u2022 A four-year-old Bitcoin investment fund has posted a 25,004 percent lifetime return.\u2022 Apollo\u2019s low-priced deal to buy Qdoba.Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss made a risky bet five years ago: They took $65-million settlement with Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and loaded up on Bitcoin.That wager has paid off. Their Bitcoin stockpile was worth around $1.3 billion on Tuesday. The question now is whether their bitcoin fortune will prove fleeting.\u2022 They took their settlement with Mr. Zuckerberg in Facebook shares. The value of their stake grew to $300 million when Facebook went public in 2012.\u2022 They began buying Bitcoin in late 2012 when the price of an individual coin was below $10.\u2022 They have collected an additional $350 million or so of other virtual currencies, most of it in the Bitcoin alternative called Ethereum.\u2022 The brothers are also majority owners of the virtual currency exchange they founded, Gemini, which likely takes their joint holdings to a value well over $2 billion, or enough to make them each of them billionaires.And that\u2019s getting worse. Women hold only 23 percent of senior executive posts with a title that includes the word chief, down from 24 percent in 2016, according to an analysis by Korn Ferry of the top 1,000 American companies by revenue.Here is Breakingviews\u2019s take:A detailed breakdown presents an even bleaker picture. Women make up just 6 percent of the blue-chip group\u2019s chief executive officers, and 11 percent of its chief financial officers. Parity comes, perhaps predictably, in that most social of C-level jobs, chief human resource officers, where females hold 55 percent of positions.The overall decline is even more glaring in the wake of the #metoo movement afflicting media, technology, entertainment and political circles. More women in the higher echelons of the corporate ranks could help change a culture that turns a blind eye to, if not condones, bad behavior.The financial industry might be a test case. The sector outranked all others in the analysis with nearly 30 percent of C-suite jobs held by women. That\u2019s a better track record than more female-friendly industries like retail and consumer at 24 percent, yet even in finance women are largely kept out of the most senior roles. Only 5 percent of the industry\u2019s CEOs and 8 percent of its CFOs are female, among the lowest levels in the survey.What catalyst will propel Apple\u2019s market value above $1 trillion?

In a report, the analyst lowered his rating on Apple\u2019s stock to neutral. Mr. Kvaal wrote:\u201cWe argue that the stock\u2019s gains for the iPhone X supercycle are in the late innings. We believe unit growth, if not quite [Average Selling Price] growth, is well anticipated by consensus and a historically full multiple.\u201dApple\u2019s stock has gained 55 percent this year and is up nearly 10 percent since it unveiled the iPhone X.\u201cBefore today, two cuts to neutral or the equivalent in June were the last ones, according to data collected by Bloomberg. One of those firms has since upgraded the shares. Analysts are still overwhelmingly positive on the stock, which has been the largest contributor to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s gains this year, with 36 firms rating it a buy, eight advising hold and 0 sell recommendations.\u201d\u2014 Stephen Grocer\u201cWhile Tuesday\u2019s findings won\u2019t lead to fines, they pave the way for Germany to order changes in the way Facebook does business when it issues a final decision as early as summer 2018. If upheld in European Union court, this new line of attack could eventually expand the boundaries of competition law across the bloc to encompass questions of online privacy.\u201cGermany\u2019s case turns privacy into a competition issue by arguing that Facebook is the only major social network in Germany, with more than 90% market share, leaving users no choice but to accept its take-it-or-leave-it terms of service\u2014which include consent for the collection of third-party data.\u201dThe investigation is the most recent example of European authorities going after big American tech companies. Here are a few:So far European regulators have been more aggressive than the counterparts in the United States. But the increasing size and power of these tech giants are raising concerns. Facebook, Google, and Twitter have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers this year over the manipulation of social media during the 2016 election by Russian operatives.At a hearing on Russia\u2019s involvement in the election this fall, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California told the executives of the three companies: \u201cYou have to be the ones to do something about this.

Research your options \u2014 but avoid \u201cmaximizing,\u201d or exhaustively considering every possibility in search of the perfect. \u201cFocus on what\u2019s good enough for you,\u201d Summerville says.Research suggests that around age 7, humans develop an ability for what\u2019s called counterfactual thinking, the capacity to imagine what might have been. In one study, Americans list romance as a top source of regret, followed by family, education, career and finance. Social regrets \u2014 wishing you\u2019d married someone else, for instance \u2014 tend to be more intense than nonsocial ones. People identify regret as the second most common emotional state, after love. Don\u2019t worry too much about missteps: Regrets of action (quitting a job, say) are generally stronger at first but fade more quickly than regrets of inaction (staying in a career you dislike), which persist and can become a sort of passive wistfulness.Imagine regret as the psychological version of physical pain, drawing attention to something inside that\u2019s off or in need of healing. \u201cRegret is a signal that you\u2019re learning from your mistakes,\u201d Summerville says. If you wish you were more communicative about your emotions with an ex-lover, for example, let that feeling steer you to more openness in future relationships. Consider seeking help from a therapist if you experience what Summerville calls \u201cruminative regret,\u201d the negative thoughts that arise repeatedly, unbidden, alongside anxiety and depression. \u201cPoking at a wound in that way is not going to make it better,\u201d she says.Give voice to regret. Studies indicate that the effort to communicate the emotion is driven by a desire for closeness with others. Preliminary data from what Summerville calls her Regret Lab suggests that people hearing about regret do feel closer to those divulging it. \u201cIf you have regrets about the things you haven\u2019t done well in your relationships,\u201d she says, \u201cthis may be a good time to tell people that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How We Know It Was Climate Change", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSTANFORD, Calif. \u2014 This was a year of devastating weather, including historic hurricanes and wildfires here in the United States. Did climate change play a role? Increasingly, scientists are able to answer that question \u2014 and increasingly, the answer is yes.The word \u201ccontribute\u201d is key. This doesn\u2019t mean that without global warming, there wouldn\u2019t have been a hurricane. Rather, the question is whether changes in the climate raised the odds of producing extreme conditions.It is therefore critical to examine all of the contributing factors. In the case of Hurricane Harvey, these include the warm ocean that provided energy for the storm; the elevated sea level on top of which the storm surge occurred; the atmospheric pressure pattern that contributed to the storm\u2019s stalling over the coast; and the atmospheric water vapor that provided moisture for the record-setting precipitation.In examining these factors, scientists are deeply skeptical: We start with the assumption that each condition arose by chance, and then require a very heavy burden of proof to reject that assumption (analogous to the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard in criminal cases).The first step is to ask whether historical changes have been observed in any of the factors. For example, ocean temperatures have increased in recent decades. Applying the same statistical techniques used in engineering, medicine and finance, we can analyze whether those increases have changed the odds of achieving this year\u2019s warm temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.So, what role did climate change play in Hurricane Harvey? There is already evidence that global warming influenced its precipitation. My collaborators and I are applying our framework to test the other factors. We don\u2019t have a full answer yet but we expect one in the coming months.There is now ample evidence that global warming has influenced extremes in the United States and around the world through such factors as temperature, atmospheric moisture and sea level. This doesn\u2019t mean that every event has a human fingerprint. But it does mean that we can expect more years like this one, when our old expectations no longer apply.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Gift to Women", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the day before the Alabama election, I found myself explaining that I needed to get to work despite the bombing at my subway station because there were women coming in to talk about having been sexually assaulted by the president.Really, we live in interesting times.The bombing \u2014 in which no one was seriously hurt but the bomber \u2014 has already faded from the memory of New York\u2019s hardened mass transit riders. But the rest of the story is reverberating. We\u2019re in the middle of a women\u2019s uprising that really does feel like a new wave, maybe the one that could actually get the country within shouting distance of power equality.Think about it. This week Roy Moore got skunked in Alabama, thanks in great part to female voters who went for the Democratic candidate instead. Then the U.S. Senate got ready for another woman member \u2014 Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith is going to replace Al Franken, who is resigning in the sexual harassment scandal.We have a revolt against sexual harassment that\u2019s running through the political, entertainment, restaurant and communications worlds. And we\u2019re finally trying to focus on the Donald Trump sleaziness sagas that the nation didn\u2019t deal with in 2016. Trump is really behind everything \u2014 his election jarred and frightened women so much that there was nothing to do but rebel and try to change the world.\u201cI think it\u2019s very much because of President Trump,\u201d said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \u201cFor me the Women\u2019s March was still the most extraordinary political moment of my lifetime.\u201d Gillibrand is a leader of the antiharassment campaign in Congress. This week, as some of the women who had stories about Trump\u2019s own hands-on history were talking to the media, she called on the president to resign.Trump responded \u2014 as only he can \u2014 with a Twitter attack, calling Gillibrand a political \u201clightweight\u201d who used to come to him \u201cbegging\u201d for campaign contributions, \u201cand would do anything for them.\u201d\u201cI think it was intended to be a sexist smear, and it was intended to silence me and every woman who challenges him,\u201d Gillibrand said in a phone interview.The White House retorted that only a person whose mind was \u201cin the gutter\u201d would think the president was talking about anything but the way political fund-raising means \u201cspecial interests control our government.\u201dWhat do you think, people? Perhaps we could just do a calculation on how much time Trump has spent in his public life discussing girl-grabbing versus campaign finance reform.Also, no one in Washington seems to have missed the fact that when the president tweeted, Gillibrand was at a congressional Bible study meeting.It\u2019s for sure that when Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton it triggered a visceral response in masses of American women, and that trauma may be turning into a political uprising more powerful than the Tea Party. Women voters delivered Alabama for Democrat Doug Jones \u2014 57 percent came down on his side. The critical mass actually came from the African-American community, where women vote more faithfully than men, and virtually all of them went for Jones. (Hard to know what triggered their outpouring \u2014 Roy Moore\u2019s creepy sexual history or his enthusiasm for the good old days of strong families and slavery.)\u201cI see black women as the heart of the Democratic Party,\u201d said Gillibrand.We truly could be seeing a new wave of feminist reform. The United States has had moments when it looked as if women were finally taking their rightful place in the public world. But things had a way of stalling. After suffrage wars, politicians were worried about pleasing their new female constituents. But they then concluded that women were going to pretty much vote like their male relatives, and lost interest. The \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d in 1992 added four more U.S. senators to the pair of women who were already there. But now, in the 21st century, the Senate still has only 21.There could be a lot more if this revolution continues. And while we have no earthly idea who the Democratic presidential candidate will be in 2020, it\u2019s likely that a bunch of women are going to be in the mix \u2014 Gillibrand probably among them.Think about it. The only Democratic woman who\u2019s ever been a top-of-the-pack presidential contender was Hillary Clinton, a former first lady. And I can remember being around when it was a big deal that Margaret Chase Smith got her name put into nomination at the Republican convention after a campaign dominated by dissection of her muffin recipe.It\u2019s not necessarily bad when the times get interesting.Nicholas Kristof is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Trump in the White House, the Family Business Takes It Down a Notch", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCLEVELAND, Miss. \u2014 Storage trailers, an idle dump truck and portable toilets surround the hotel construction site. A sign announces \u201copening fall 2017,\u201d but residents say they haven\u2019t seen significant activity for months.It does not look like much, but the unfinished development in this small Mississippi Delta town stands as the only major new deal by the Trump family business since President Trump took office in January.When the president turned over daily operations of the Trump Organization to his eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., they spoke excitedly about picking up where their father left off.But the crawl toward completing the hotel here reflects how difficult it has been for the company to expand its footprint with Mr. Trump in the White House. The Trump Organization has taken on a distinctly un-Trump-like feel this year: Its ambition for new development is subdued, and the signature showmanship for announcing deals is largely absent.Six months before his election, President Trump told The New York Times that his business had about 120 deals in the works worldwide. The company had just undergone a decade of significant growth, opening five-star hotels in Chicago, Las Vegas and Washington, and snatching up golf courses across the country. It had also signed marketing deals that attached the Trump name to luxury towers in global destinations like Istanbul, Manila and Panama City.Today, the pipeline of potential deals sits at about 30, all in the United States, according to the company.In an interview, Eric Trump said the company decided to focus primarily on its existing properties, which consist of 16 golf courses, a winery, seven stand-alone hotels and a portfolio of commercial real estate properties.As a private, family-run business, the Trump Organization need not answer to shareholders, he said, so it had the freedom to slow new development. That also means the company does not have to disclose how well, or not well, it is performing financially, nor are the identities of partners in the pipeline publicly known.\u201cWe have the best properties in the world; they\u2019re doing extraordinarily well,\u201d he said, without providing details on the company\u2019s financial performance. \u201cAnd if we have to take a break for an eight-year period of time or a four-year period, then it is what it is.\u201dEric Trump said his father\u2019s presidency had complicated the company\u2019s ability to start new deals. The company pledged not to pursue new foreign ventures, and it is vetting potential domestic deals to avoid controversy, retaining Bobby Burchfield, a Washington lawyer, to protect the Trumps from doing business with partners that might have conflicts of interest or checkered pasts.Eric Trump, who has effectively assumed the role as the leading executive at the company, is also a much more cautious businessman than his father, people who work with the Trumps say.\u201cDonald is very aggressive, and Donald pushed it while he was active \u2014 and they don\u2019t have Donald now,\u201d said Phil Ruffin, a billionaire casino owner who partnered with the Trumps on the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas. \u201cThe boys are doing as well as anybody could. I haven\u2019t seen any difference, except they\u2019re not really doing anything new.\u201dThe difference in management styles partly reflects Eric Trump\u2019s sensitivity to criticism of the company now that his father is in the White House. There is also the criminal investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller III, who may ultimately scrutinize aspects of the family business before he finishes his inquiry.Since the sons took control of the company, the biggest new initiative has been the rollout of two domestic hotel brands, Scion Hotels and Resorts, a four-star line, and American Idea Hotels, a budget-friendly chain. The company recently posted websites for both chains.But the Trumps have announced only one Scion business partner, the developers of the hotel here in Cleveland, a city of 12,000 about a two-hour drive from Memphis. The Trumps and their partners have delayed the project as they revised the construction plans.This week, the partners applied for a new permit at Cleveland\u2019s community development office, an indication that they were close to getting started again, said Brett Moorman, the co-director of the office, who has been fielding questions from the community about the status of the project.\u201cEverywhere I go, whether in church or in public, someone says, \u2018What\u2019s going on with that hotel over there?\u2019 I say, \u2018Your guess is as good as mine,\u2019\u201d Mr. Moorman said in an interview at his office last week.In a statement, the Trumps\u2019 partner, Chawla Hotels, said construction \u201cshould recommence after the holidays\u201d and were expecting the hotel to open in 2018.Local officials said they were eager to see the project finished to provide hotel rooms for visitors to these attractions.\u201cWe were looking forward to the doors opening up in 2017,\u201d said Willie Simmons, a Democrat and Mississippi state senator who owns a local soul food restaurant, the Senator\u2019s Place.While Mississippi overwhelmingly favored President Trump in last year\u2019s presidential election, the Delta leans Democratic. But politics has not been a major issue with the new hotel. Jay Burchfield, a self-described moderate, who owns the Lennys Subs franchise across the street from the future Scion, said the hotel was needed.\u201cI don\u2019t care whether it is Democrat or Republican \u2014 it is a hotel,\u201d he said.The Trump Organization plan is to negotiate licensing deals with hotel owners or developers and convert existing hotels to the Trump brands or build new ones. The upfront capital would be invested by its new business partners. In the case of the Scion hotels, the Trump Organization would manage the hotels.Their late father, V.K., an Indian immigrant, had received advice from Donald Trump decades ago, which helped jump-start the family business. During the presidential campaign, Suresh Chawla wrote a letter that appeared in several local newspapers about his father\u2019s experience, which triggered a series of encounters with the Trumps that culminated with the Chawlas going into business with them.The Chawlas were already building what was originally to be named the Lyric Hotel and Spa, the anchor of a real estate development, which included restaurants and entertainment space, called the West End District. They originally planned to open the Lyric this fall.With the Trump deal, the project took on the name Scion West End. The Chawlas said they spent the past few months working with the Trump Organization to rework the design plans, including relocating the lobby to another building on the property that has not yet been built. (They are planning a total of nine buildings.)\u201cIt has been a fascinating experience,\u201d the Chawlas said in response to written questions. The Trump Organization, they said, \u201cis incredibly adept at taking ideas and helping us expand our knowledge base. The team has expertise in every area imaginable that a developer would want to tap into.\u201dThe deal with the Chawlas cleared the Trump Organization\u2019s vetting process, but other deals have had more trouble.Bobby Burchfield, the Washington lawyer who serves as the company\u2019s outside ethics adviser, scrutinizes the Trumps\u2019 potential hotel partners, as well as transactions that involve a government agency and certain other business arrangements worth more than $2.5 million, among other things. In large part, his task is to verify that the terms are at market rate and that potential partners, and their sources of financing, are appropriate. Mr. Burchfield has said he will not approve deals that will otherwise \u201cembarrass or diminish\u201d the office of the presidency.The Trumps have also been cautious about sending potential deals to Mr. Burchfield until all of the lenders and investors are lined up, the people briefed on the matter said. The same caution has put off public announcements of possible deals.\u201cMaking sure every \u201ci\u2019 is dotted and every \u2018t\u2019 is crossed and everything is perfect \u2014 does that kill deals? One hundred percent,\u201d Eric Trump said. \u201cIs it the right thing to do when your father is commander in chief, 100 percent it is. Will we have to do it the day he is out of office? No we won\u2019t.\u201dThe Trump Organization pledged before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration that it would not negotiate new overseas deals during his presidency, but it has proceeded with previously negotiated licensed developments in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Dubai and elsewhere, projects that Eric Trump noted are of a much bigger scale than the Mississippi hotel.In the United States, some hotel properties have soared since the election. The Trump International Hotel in Washington, a magnet for Republican officials and lobbyists, turned a nearly $2 million profit in the first four months of this year, records show. The company\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas is also raking in money, Mr. Ruffin said.Over all, the Trump Organization\u2019s business portfolio brought in at least $597 million in revenue during his 2016 campaign and the first few months of his presidency, down about 3 percent from the prior period, according to the president\u2019s most recent financial disclosure released in June.Further uptown in New York, the Trump Organization just opened two retail stores at Trump Tower, one selling Ivanka Trump\u2019s handbags and jewelry and the other selling items featuring the Trump family logo.\u201cVisit our brand new flagship store,\u201d the sign in the Trump Tower lobby says, \u201cfor Trump apparel, accessories and more!\u201dSteve Eder reported from Cleveland, Miss.

As Republicans seek to bolster American competitiveness and spur economic growth, the bill also includes tax cuts for individuals that are set to expire after 2025 to make the bill comply with budget rules.\u201cThis is a big week,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a longtime Trump supporter. \u201cA wide range of people are starting to say, \u2018I like him, the tweets may irritate me, but something\u2019s happened.\u2019 Clearly this was the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance \u2014 this bill at this moment just before Christmas.\u201dIt is not clear whether Mr. Trump is going to sign the bill before the end of the year. Republicans need to work with Democrats to avert automatic spending cuts that could be set off as a result of the tax bill adding to the deficit. They need support from Democrats to avoid these spending cuts, and if they wait until next year, it will buy them extra time to reach such a deal. Republicans in Congress were struggling to reach an agreement that would keep the government funded into January and avoid a shutdown.At the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump presided over a grand celebration on the South Portico, flanked by Republican lawmakers and members of his cabinet in a show of unity. A Marine Band played Christmas carols while the president and his party soaked up a moment long in coming.This simple calculator describes a range of tax scenarios under the Republican tax plan. Find households like yours in five steps or fewer.\u201cThis will indeed be a very big day, when people look back at our country. It\u2019s a whole different attitude, a whole different way,\u201d Mr. Trump said, congratulating the lawmakers behind him. \u201cThey have been working on this for years, years and years. And I just want to turn around and I want to thank them all. They are very, very special people.\u201dThe lawmakers \u2014 many of whom face re-election next year \u2014 eagerly returned the favor as the president brought several of them to the lectern, where they offered a common refrain: paeans to Mr. Trump, his legislative victory and his presidency.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said Mr. Trump might end up being one of the country\u2019s greatest presidents. Members of Congress who have at times been on the receiving end of brutal Twitter posts made by the president, including Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, returned the president\u2019s praise in kind.\u201cThis has been a year of extraordinary accomplishment for the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, as the president grinned broadly behind him.But though Mr. Trump listed a series of accomplishments during his first year in office, he confronts a challenge in the new year of persuading more Americans to get behind him.The tax victory was a rare moment of legislative success for a president who has struggled to govern in a city that he derided as \u201ca swamp.\u201d He has repeatedly used Twitter, his favorite means of communication, to demean and belittle members of both parties, undermining Republican leaders and generating intense opposition from Democrats.On Wednesday, he struck a different tone, posting on Twitter to praise Mr. McConnell for shepherding the tax bill through the bitterly divided chamber.The tax bill that passed includes the elimination of the Obama-era requirement that people have health insurance, handing Mr. Trump and Republicans a talking point when they confront constituents who expected full repeal of the health care law. Speaking to reporters before a cabinet meeting Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump bragged about getting rid of the health care mandate, saying that it amounted to a full repeal of Mr. Obama\u2019s signature law.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to bring it up,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI told people specifically, \u2018Be quiet with the fake news media because I don\u2019t want them talking too much about it.\u2019\u201dWhether that proves to be a political victory for Mr. Trump and Republicans is unclear. Many of his core supporters will appreciate the move. But the president\u2019s eager declaration that \u201cObamacare has been repealed\u201d also means that he will be held responsible if premiums rise or people struggle to secure health insurance.The tax overhaul also provides a break to owners of pass-through businesses, whose profits are taxed through the individual code, and lowers the top individual rate to 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent. It nearly doubles the standard deduction and doubles the child tax credit and the size of inheritances shielded from estate taxation.It also opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling.Republican lawmakers said they believed the public\u2019s opinions about the tax overhaul would improve as more people began paying lower taxes next year. If they are right, the party could benefit just as lawmakers face voters in the fall.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who spent most of his almost 20 years in Congress pushing for an overhaul of the tax code, said he was \u201cexcited\u201d about making good on a core part of the Republican Party\u2019s orthodoxy.\u201cWe are going to launch next year this fantastic tax reform so that the American people can see how we can truly reach our economic growth and our economic potential,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.In remarks before the cabinet meeting, Vice President Mike Pence offered the kind of effusive praise that Mr. Trump is unlikely to receive very often, even after the tax bill victory.\u201cI want to thank you, Mr. President,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cI want to thank you for speaking on behalf of and fighting every day for the forgotten men and women of America. Because of your determination, because of your leadership, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more, and we are making America great again.\u201dFor the president, passage of the tax bill could be even more important \u2014 depending on how people come to view the legislation. As a candidate, Mr. Trump pitched himself as a champion of working Americans whose interests had been forgotten or ignored by a political establishment that cared little about their fortunes.\u201cTrumpism, in the end, as a domestic policy, comes down to jobs,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cAs a baseline of the conversation, he has to produce a better economy for anything else he is doing to make sense.\u201dThomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Woman\u2019s Voice for Women at the U.N. Agency for Reproductive Rights", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 When Dr. Natalia Kanem visited a mobile maternal clinic in Syria\u2019s war-ravaged city of Homs this year, she was struck by one patient\u2019s cause of anxiety. It was not pregnancy.Dr. Kanem, 62, an Ivy League-educated physician and epidemiologist from Panama who has spent three decades working on public health issues in some of the world\u2019s most deprived places, said the Homs anecdote helped to illustrate how the United Nations Population Fund, an agency known as UNFPA, does far more than its name might suggest.The fund has helped prevent millions of unwanted pregnancies and has sharply reduced maternal deaths in childbirth. It is a major advocate for women\u2019s reproductive health.But the fund\u2019s work also can extend in positive ways into other aspects of a woman\u2019s life, Dr. Kanem said. Its mobile maternal health clinics, for example, are partly meant to give women safe spaces where they can relax and ask questions about anything, she said, including \u201cthings that are happening to their husbands and families.\u201dDr. Kanem, who was promoted from deputy to executive director of the population fund in October, is among the highest-ranking women at the United Nations and the first Latin American to head the agency.Speaking with a mix of enthusiasm and what she called a wonkish love of science and precision, Dr. Kanem said the UNFPA\u2019s family planning was liberating millions of women to become educated and productive members of the work force, a profound shift that many developing countries are only now beginning to appreciate for its economic benefits.Her ascent at the UNFPA has come against the backdrop of heightened global attention to gender abuse issues. Publicity has swelled over sexualized violence against women in conflict zones like Myanmar and South Sudan. Sexually abusive men have been exposed in politics, industry and entertainment \u2014 some of it tied to what President Trump\u2019s critics regard as his sexist behavior and attitudes toward women.\u201cI feel there is a historical moment happening,\u201d Dr. Kanem said, \u201cwhere voices are much louder this year, than, say, in the past three, four, five years, on women\u2019s reproductive health, reproductive rights \u2014 there are a confluence of things.\u201dShe said her job is punctuated by constant struggles, in what clearly remains a male-dominated society, revolving around a woman\u2019s right to choose when or whether to have children.That right was built into the fund\u2019s mandate more than 20 years ago but cannot be taken for granted, Dr. Kanem said during an interview in her New York office, a few blocks from the United Nations headquarters.\u201cI think the mandate is continually questioned,\u201d Dr. Kanem said. \u201cI think that is why the gender factor is really important to understand. It is a gendered world, and right now, adolescent girls and women in many communities around the world really do not have a say in what happens to them.\u201dThe administration\u2019s decision surprised Dr. Kanem, she said, partly because the United States had concluded in 2015 that the fund was doing exemplary work in China and did not engage in coercive birth control.\u201cIt is the opposite of what we do,\u201d Dr. Kanem said of the accusation. \u201cWe make the point repeatedly, and I\u2019m repeating now, because we do not wish to have this mistaken impression.\u201d\u201cThe determination was made based on China\u2019s family planning policies,\u201d said Catherine Glenn Foster, president and chief executive of the group. \u201cIt\u2019s about the partnership. I think the broader goal is we don\u2019t want that kind of activity happening at all.\u201dThe abrupt termination of money from the United States, one of the UNFPA\u2019s original founders nearly 50 years ago, suddenly left Dr. Kanem and her colleagues scrambling to fill a nearly $70 million hole in their budget.\u201cWe serve all member states, some are funders, some are not,\u201d Dr. Kanem said, choosing her words diplomatically. \u201cSo yes, we overcome whatever awkwardness there may be, because we see that we all share the same ultimate goal.\u201d\u201cUNFPA will have to confront not only the impact of direct cuts to its funding by the U.S. government, but an overall environment where sexual and reproductive health care is under attack,\u201d said Nisha Varia, advocacy director for women\u2019s rights at Human Rights Watch. \u201cUNFPA\u2019s work will be more critical than ever, but it will have fewer resources.\u201dFriends and diplomats describe Dr. Kanem as an extraordinary listener who will go out of her way to make strangers feel comfortable and understand other points of view.Though Panamanian by birth, Dr. Kanem\u2019s ancestry is African. She spent many years living and working in Nigeria and Tanzania, and named her son after Nelson Mandela. Describing herself as Afro-Latina, she showed a visitor cellphone photos of Bolivians of African descent.\u201cI\u2019m proud to personify the diversity that\u2019s in Latin America,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are surprised that I\u2019m from Panama.\u201d Many Latin Americans of African descent, she said, were \u201cvery excited that I\u2019m taking up the tenure.\u201dDr. Kanem said she first became interested in women\u2019s reproductive health when she took a bus and train as a Harvard undergraduate in 1975 to an international women\u2019s conference in Mexico City. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t know that this was going to happen then,\u201d she said.She completed her medical education at Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Washington.By some estimates, Dr. Kanem said, every dollar invested in adolescent reproductive health can yield between $6 and $20 in economic benefits. The result has been an increased focus in Africa on the importance of family planning and education for girls, which Dr. Kanem called \u201ca big win for us.\u201dStill, she coupled her optimism about the fund\u2019s successes with caution.\u201cEvery time that the discussion on women\u2019s reproductive rights and health comes up, there\u2019s always danger that there will be pushback,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s always danger that we have to explain ourselves. We have to show the evidence that projects the rights of women and girls, who really may not be sitting around the table but we are representing them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Harassment Tally", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThree members of Congress have resigned over sexual harassment this week.

{"Headline": "Bid to Oust Peru\u2019s President Falls Short in Congress", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by`Mr. Kuczynski, who took office in July 2016, delivered an emotional plea to Congress earlier in the day, calling the claims against him \u201cweak\u201d and saying the impeachment proceedings were being used for political gain.\u201cCongress members, do not join this strategy, do not let yourselves become confused,\u201d Mr. Kuczynski, 79, said. \u201cThose who accuse me will not let their condemnation be subjected to corroboration, to a debate, to due process.\u201dGuido Lombardi, who was among the president\u2019s defenders in Congress, called the proceedings \u201crushed\u201d and said lawmakers had manufactured a political crisis. But his critics zeroed in on Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s statements during the congressional inquiry. \u201cThe problem of lying is not only the lack of ethics of lying,\u201d Victor Andr\u00e9s Bela\u00fande said, \u201cbut the cover-up of improper acts that have enriched him.\u201dThe president eventually acknowledged that his firm, the Miami-based Westfield Capital, had received money from Odebrecht, but he said that the transaction did not violate laws and that it was not a bribe for preferential treatment. His company was being run by a business partner at the time, and Mr. Kuczynski said the firm had provided only consulting services to Odebrecht.Some in Peru\u2019s Congress had argued that Mr. Kuczynski should be held accountable for receiving the funds, and voted last week to begin impeachment proceedings. The vote was introduced by the left-wing party Frente Amplio, which described Mr. Kuczynski as having \u201cdemeaned the presidency.\u201dDuring his testimony on Thursday, Mr. Kuczynski said he would be open to an investigation into his finances, but he urged members of Congress to vote against his removal, warning that the country would not benefit from a hasty decision.\u201cThe people of a nation do not forget or forgive,\u201d Mr. Kuczynski said.His attorney, Alberto Borea, appeared alongside him and offered his own defense of the embattled leader during nearly two hours of testimony. \u201cNot to impeach does not mean not to investigate,\u201d Mr. Borea said. \u201cThe president puts himself at the disposal of the Public Ministry.\u201dA two-thirds majority \u2014 or 87 of 130 votes \u2014 was needed to remove Mr. Kuczynski. After his testimony, Mr. Kuczynski left the chambers and lawmakers debated his future over several hours. Lawmakers finally voted 78 to 19 in favor of the motion, with a number either abstaining or not present.Mr. Kuczynski, who was given just days to formulate a defense after the impeachment proceedings were announced, maintained that the consulting services that Westfield Capital provided to Odebrecht did not give Odebrecht a competitive advantage in any dealings.The president recently acknowledged being paid $380,000 in dividends by Westfield Capital between 2004 and 2007. He was prime minister of Peru from August 2005 to July 2006, and was economy and finance minister from February 2004 to August 2005.At the time, his company was being managed by a business partner, Gerardo Sep\u00falveda, a Chilean. Mr. Kuczynski maintained that he did not personally approve any contracts with Odebrecht during that time, and the contracts involved no unlawful negotiations.The opposition argued that he broke rules on conflict of interest during his time in public office, both as prime minister and as economy and finance minister.Mr. Kuczynski gave a televised statement on Wednesday evening. With his two vice presidents standing at his side, Mr. Kuczynski said that neither would accept the presidency if he was removed.\u201cI confess that I have not been sufficiently organized, but I am not corrupt,\u201d Mr. Kuczynski said in the televised address. \u201cI apologize with clarity in my mind and heartbreak if I did not explain my professional conduct.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Microsoft\u2019s highest closing value in 1999, when translated into today\u2019s dollars, was roughly $901 billion.Apple\u2019s value has been rising for quite some time. Earlier in this decade, Apple passed Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company in the contemporary stock market.To put its current size in context, Apple is worth more than the entire G.D.P. of Turkey.But Apple\u2019s dominance is not just a question of inflation. Using another metric \u2014 Apple\u2019s weight in the current stock market \u2014 IBM and AT&T, in their halcyon days, were far more dominant than Apple is today.No surprise: When the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, Apple is the largest company on the list by a large margin, followed by Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Microsoft. In this list, all three hit their high point in November. Apple has been moving above and below its pinnacle since then, and its value was just above $895 billion at the close of trading Wednesday.The list is basically split between the hot markets of the last 25 years: the current one, which started in March 2009, and the stock market surge associated with the dot-com era and its aftermath. General Electric was in fourth place over all, based on its $594 billion market cap in August 2000.

That would have been enough to place it in third place, without taking inflation into account.But over extended periods, the compounding effects of inflation are powerful. That $647 billion translates into a nearly 40 percent increase in value in November 2017 dollars. It has probably gained slightly more since November, because inflation has remained positive.General Electric has been shrinking lately as it restructures. But in inflation-adjusted terms, its August 2000 market cap is still growing and it moved up one spot on the list, to third place. Cisco and Intel moved into fourth and fifth place, based on their soaring shares during the dot-com boom.Even more than the first list, the inflation-adjusted ranking provides a reminder of the stock market highs during these two exuberant periods \u2014 the dot-com era in 1999 and 2000, and the bull market that is still underway.Seven of the all-time biggest companies reached their peaks in October or November, the most current data in this ranking, and 12 of the companies did so from late 1999 to early 2001.Exxon Mobil is the only company to have achieved a top-20 market cap unaided by the momentum of one of these rising stock market eras. In inflation-adjusted terms, Exxon\u2019s peak occurred in July 2007, several months before its pinnacle in nominal 2007 dollars.Share of the total market since 1980 NO.

Using this metric, Apple in late 2017 does not tower over the rest of the stock market as much as many other companies did in previous eras.In fact, although Apple\u2019s market cap is far higher today than it was five years ago, Apple shares represented a larger share of the total stock market in September 2012 than they do now.The Apple of 2017 does not show up at all in either of the two Top 20 lists that Mr. Poukchanski produced, one starting in 1980 and one going all the way back to 1925.In December 1985, IBM\u2019s shares constituted 4.4 percent of the entire stock market, a higher percentage than any other company since 1980.That is a very high figure, given the enormous expanse of the universe covered by the Center for Research database, which included 6,225 stocks for December 1985. (By contrast, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has, as you might imagine, 500 stocks; the Dow Jones industrial average has 30.)In November, Apple\u2019s shares constituted only 2.5 percent of the overall stock market.

In March 1928, General Motors accounted for 8 percent of the stock market. And in 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8 percent of the market of that day.One explanation for the outsize status of these companies in earlier times is that the stock market itself was much smaller: 6,715 listings in November compared with only 704 in May 1932 and 584 in March 1928. It was easier to be a big fish in those smaller ponds.That said, at the end of 1985, when IBM\u2019s market cap was far larger than any other company\u2019s, there were 6,225 publicly traded stocks in the market, nearly as many as today. So the size of the stock market isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation:  Companies like IBM and AT&T simply were more dominant than Apple is now.For example, the old AT&T was so big that Standard & Poor\u2019s excluded it from a predecessor to the S.&P. 500-stock index \u201cbecause S.&P. did not want to let the performance of such a large firm dominate the index,\u201d as Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in his book, \u201cStocks for the Long Run.\u201dConsidered a monopoly, the old AT&T was forcibly broken up in 1984. (A descendent of the company is embroiled in antitrust issues of its own, arising from its proposed merger with Time Warner).But a 1935 law during President Roosevelt\u2019s administration called for the abolition of such holding companies. After a lengthy court fight, U.G.I. transformed itself into a much smaller entity. On the list of the most dominant companies, it is an artifact of a bygone era.These questions may seem strange today, and those who are so inclined may celebrate as Apple sets new stock market records. But it is worth recalling that other companies played monumental roles in the stock market, until their day was done.Notes: All data as of Nov. 30, 2017.

{"Headline": "As Harassment Accusations Multiply, a Question: Who Stays and Who Goes?", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat was in October. Last Friday, Representative Blake Farenthold, another Republican, was unmasked as the lawmaker who used $84,000 in taxpayer funds to secretly settle a lurid sexual harassment case, but Mr. Ryan has been silent on his future.As accusations of sexual improprieties swirl around Capitol Hill, lawmakers are struggling with how to respond to each charge, whether one case can be deemed less serious than another, and what role politics can and should play in determining a member\u2019s future. Mr. Kihuen appears expendable, even though he had just wrested a seat from a Republican in the politically critical swing state of Nevada.Mr. Farenthold, of Texas, appears safe, at least for the moment, despite bipartisan condemnations of the use of taxpayer money to settle secret suits. He pledged on Monday to repay the $84,000 to the taxpayers, and to \u201ctake a leadership role in reforming an obviously broken system.\u201dDemocrats, especially in the House, say tolerance is breaking down along party lines \u2014 and their party is far less tolerant.\u201cWe can\u2019t have a double standard,\u201d said Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, referring to Mr. Farenthold. \u201cHe settled for $84,000; it\u2019s a lot of money, that\u2019s not for nothing. I think he should step down according to the same standards that Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan set for John Conyers.\u201dRepresentative Gregg Harper, Republican of Mississippi and the chairman of the committee, called the review \u201clong overdue.\u201dRepresentative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee, says a cultural shift \u2014 as much as a legal one \u2014 is in order.\u201cIt used to be that lobbyists were showering gifts upon members of Congress, and we just banned it, and it radically changed the culture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe simply have to radically change the culture of sexual harassment.\u201dRank-and-file lawmakers in both parties agree there should be a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy toward members found guilty of sexual harassment. But in interviews, lawmakers seemed to wrestle with the correct response to individual cases; many said they did not know enough to judge. As prominent men in other professions \u2014 notably news media and the entertainment industry \u2014 are quickly forced out of their jobs when accused of improprieties, there is growing pressure on Congressional leaders to hold lawmakers to the same strict standard.\u201cWe are all struggling to know what to do,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. \u201cThese are all elected officials; they don\u2019t work for anybody other than the people that voted for them, and you want to be careful not to disenfranchise the voters.\u201dEmily Martin, the general counsel for the National Women\u2019s Law Center, says there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and added that it is important to distinguish between gradations of improper behavior. That could be one reason Mr. Franken has avoided calls to step down, while Mr. Conyers and Mr. Kihuen have not.Some members of the Congressional Black Caucus see bias in the way Mr. Conyers, a founding member of the group, has been treated compared with Mr. Franken. But Mr. Conyers is accused of demanding sex from an employee, then firing her for refusing \u2014 a clear case of workplace sexual harassment. Mr. Franken is accused of groping women mainly as he posed for photographs, and of forcibly kissing a woman before he was a senator.\u201cI do think it\u2019s important to recognize that there are degrees of severity,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cA zero-tolerance, one-size-fits-all policy sounds really attractive. But it is in the end potentially harmful to say that we are going to ignore differences in situations that are in fact very different.\u201dDetails of the $84,000 settlement emerged Friday as part of an extensive review of sexual harassment and discrimination in congressional offices being conducted by the Committee on House Administration.A spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, AshLee Strong, said in a statement on Friday that the speaker had addressed the matter with the congressman, and had \u201cmade clear any report of sexual harassment is deeply troubling, and those who feel mistreated or violated deserve to have their stories taken seriously.\u201d The statement did not address Mr. Farenthold\u2019s future.But several Republican lawmakers, including Representative Peter T. King of New York and Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chairwoman of the House Republican conference, seemed uneasy when asked if Mr. Farenthold should resign.\u201cI would want to see more details, but to me, it\u2019s difficult to stay in Congress with something that serious, but I don\u2019t want to prejudge it,\u201d Mr. King said, adding, \u201cI would say the burden is on him to prove he should stay.\u201dMs. McMorris Rodgers addressed the question tersely. With raised eyebrows and a wan smile, she said simply: \u201cI will be speaking with him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Since 2016, it has cut about 25 percent of the archdiocesan staff, and about 25 percent of expenses. The executive director of the archdiocese, Jerry Dimitriou, who oversaw the shrine project, resigned in September. Both the chairman of the finance committee and the director of finance were replaced, the archdiocese said.In an effort to bring greater accountability and transparency, a chief financial officer was hired, and a new treasurer, Michael Psaros, told the archdiocesan council this October that the crisis had been caused by \"a deficiency in proper internal controls.\u201dA spokesman said that the investigation would find whether donations earmarked for the St. Nicholas Shrine were among those raided for general expenses. But internally, it has already been acknowledged.Some members of the church have called for the archbishop to be removed.Steve Stratakos, a commercial real estate appraiser based in Illinois, said his charitable organization, the Pan-Icarian Brotherhood, had been approached for donations for the shrine but declined. Without greater transparency, he said, there is no way to know whether the project was being managed appropriately.\u201cThe feeling out there among the rank-and-file now is that this project was used as a cash cow for the archdiocese, which has been hemorrhaging money for years now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt outraged me. You have that beautiful site down there at the Trade Center, and that thing might sit there like a rotted tooth for the next five years.\u201dThe archdiocese said in an email that it was hopeful that construction would resume as early as the spring. It added that design work and the construction of skylights and parts of the marble and glass-fused curtain-wall and lighting system that will ultimately allow the church to glow at night were continuing off-site.Archdiocesan officials said they believed that once the investigation was complete, trust would be restored and the project would move forward with transparency and accountability.\u201cThe Archdiocese remains committed to the rebuilding of Saint Nicholas and we are confident that our fund-raising efforts to support this important project and ministry will be successful,\u201d His Grace Bishop Andonios, chancellor of the archdiocese, said in a statement last week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Pushes to Avoid Government Shutdown, but the Path Is Tricky", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans are moving toward passing a two-week stopgap measure to avoid a looming government shutdown, but the path in the coming weeks is treacherous, with obstacles on both sides of the aisle as lawmakers push their own priorities, some unrelated to government spending.With government funding set to expire at the end of Friday, Republicans are aiming to buy more time so they can negotiate over a long-term spending package. The task is complicated by a feud between President Trump and Democrats, whose votes Republicans need to secure passage, and measures on the politically fraught issues of immigration and the Affordable Care Act.Republicans\u2019 stopgap spending measure would extend government funding through Dec. 22. On Sunday, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, tried to play down fears about a coming crisis.Now, the president is in direct conflict with \u201cChuck and Nancy,\u201d as he has called them, at a time when Democrats have substantial leverage. Democrats can block the stopgap spending measure in the Senate, and Democratic votes could also be needed to get the measure through the House if enough Republicans rebel against it. Any long-term spending package would also need Democratic votes.Citing the power that Democrats hold under Senate rules, Representative Trent Franks, Republican of Arizona, complained last week that his party was being forced, despite having majorities in both houses, to \u201cproduce basically a Democrat document.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an untenable, unworkable thing, and it\u2019s a hell of a way to run a railroad,\u201d he said.The stopgap spending measure would provide more time for negotiations between the two parties over raising strict spending caps that were imposed in 2011 as they try to work toward a long-term spending deal for the 2018 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.In a deal to raise the limits, defense hawks want a sizable increase in military spending. But Democrats are pushing to ensure that nondefense spending is increased by the same amount as military spending. Once congressional leaders reach a deal on raising the caps, a long-term spending package can be negotiated. Lawmakers could pass another stopgap spending measure later in December to keep the government open until that long-term package is ready to be voted on.\u201cWe want to keep government open,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said last week. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are about.\u201d But she emphasized the need to provide an acceptable increase in nondefense spending as part of a deal to raise the spending caps, citing issues like providing funding to address the opioid epidemic.Complicating matters further are divisive issues being dealt with on Capitol Hill beyond financing the government. Republicans are closing in on sending their tax overhaul to Mr. Trump, a feat that would represent their first major legislative accomplishment of his presidency, and they hope to finish that work by Christmas.But it remains unclear what other legislation those measures would be attached to, and how such a move would be received by House Republicans who have criticized the subsidies as a bailout for insurers. Lawmakers also need to provide funds for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, whose funding expired at the end of September.Then there is the issue of immigration. Democrats want to secure a deal to protect young unauthorized immigrants put at risk by Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that shields them from deportation.Another Republican holdout on the tax bill, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, said in announcing his support for the tax overhaul that he had obtained a commitment from Senate leaders and the Trump administration to work with him to enact protections for DACA recipients.The spending negotiations provide Democrats with leverage for reaching a deal on that issue. But Republican leaders want to address it separately.To force the issue, Democrats could draw a line and withhold their support for a measure to fund the government. But Mr. McConnell warned against that approach on Sunday, noting that Mr. Trump had given Congress until March to find a solution on DACA.\u201cI don\u2019t think that Democrats would be very smart to say they want to shut down the government over a nonemergency that we can address anytime between now and March,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very untenable position.\u201dDemocrats are quick to point out which party is in control of the government.\u201cEveryone knows Republicans are in charge,\u201d said Matt House, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer. \u201cIf the government shuts down, it\u2019ll be on their back.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And no wonder: The baker\u2019s position that no law can force him to lend his \u201cart\u201d to a use to which he objects \u2014 celebrating a same-sex wedding \u2014 would, if accepted, invite a flood of \u201cI would prefer not to\u201d opt-outs from anti-discrimination laws meant to apply to all.At issue are requirements that a 2015 California law imposes on \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers,\u201d described in the legislative record as places that \u201cpose as full-service women\u2019s health clinics, but aim to discourage and prevent women from seeking abortions\u201d through \u201cintentionally deceptive advertising and counseling practices.\u201dThese centers exist all over the country, and in many states are more numerous than actual abortion clinics. Women find their way to them by looking up \u201cabortion\u201d in the telephone book or by responding to ads on mass transit (\u201cPregnant? Need help?\u201d). California has some 200 of them, most, like those that sued the state in this case, run by organizations with religious-based opposition to abortion.The main plaintiff, known as Nifla for short, is a Virginia-based national organization that describes its mission as to \u201cempower the choice for life.\u201d It operates 111 pregnancy centers in California alone, of which most are licensed medical clinics and the rest are unlicensed offices that provide self-administered pregnancy tests, referrals to doctors for prenatal care, and free baby supplies such as diapers.California\u2019s Reproductive Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care and Transparency Act, known as the FACT Act, has separate requirements for the medical clinics and the unlicensed offices. The licensed clinics have to provide a notice informing patients that \u201cCalifornia has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive services (including all F.D.A.-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care and abortion for eligible women.\u201d (Translation: if you were enticed here under false pretenses, the state is ready to help you get what you want.)The required notice, which includes a phone number to call, must be posted in the waiting room or shown to patients when they come in. Unlicensed nonmedical offices must post a different notice: \u201cThis facility is not licensed as a medical facility by the State of California and has no licensed medical provider who provides or directly supervises the provision of services.\u201dWhat could be wrong with that? As First Amendment doctrine has evolved recently, plenty. Just as Masterpiece Cakeshop isn\u2019t an easy case but should be (in my opinion, if someone wants to be able to pick and choose his customers, he should bake for his friends in his own kitchen and stop calling himself a business), the Nifla case is likely to prove harder than the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit acknowledged in October 2016 when it denied the pregnancy centers\u2019 request for an injunction to block the law from taking effect.In agreeing last month to hear Nifla\u2019s appeal, brought by the religious-right powerhouse Alliance Defending Freedom, the justices simplified the case somewhat. Nifla had argued that the law violated not only its First Amendment right not to be compelled to convey an unwanted official message, but also its right to the free exercise of religion. The Supreme Court agreed to address only the speech issue.In denying the injunction, the Ninth Circuit said the law satisfied California\u2019s \u201csubstantial interest in the health of its citizens, including ensuring that its citizens have access to and adequate information about constitutionally protected medical services like abortion.\u201d In a brief that unsuccessfully urged the Supreme Court not to hear the appeal, California\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, explained the policy behind the law: More than half of the 700,000 pregnancies in the state every year are unintended. Many pregnant women can\u2019t afford medical care and are unaware that California\u2019s Medi-Cal program offers a full range of state-financed options that include prenatal care, delivery and pediatric coverage or, if a woman chooses it, abortion. Mr. Becerra said the Legislature had concluded that delay and confusion in the absence of the information the required notices provide were not in a pregnant woman\u2019s interest, no matter what path she eventually chose.And five years ago, after the federal appeals court in Washington struck down a Food and Drug Administration requirement for cigarette packaging to contain graphic images of the health wreckage caused by smoking (\u201ccompelled speech,\u201d the tobacco industry cried), the Obama administration decided that an appeal to the Supreme Court would be hopeless and didn\u2019t bother to file one.Regulating the speech that takes place in doctors\u2019 offices is an issue that cuts both ways in the abortion context. Unable to prevent women from having abortions, anti-abortion politicians have done their best to constrain and regulate doctors, in some states even requiring doctors to recite to their abortion patients a state-mandated script that contains such falsehoods as a warning that abortion places women at a higher risk for suicide.The Trump administration has not yet entered this case, but it would be very surprising if it stayed away. Matthew Bowman, who argued for Nifla in the Ninth Circuit as senior counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, where he ran its Life Litigation Project, is now a senior lawyer in the Department of Health and Human Services, where he played a lead role in dismantling the Obama administration\u2019s contraception mandate on employer-provided health insurance. In the topsy-turvy world in which we\u2019re living, there will be something fitting about this truth-challenged administration arguing to the Supreme Court that a law requiring the truth is unconstitutional.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Asia\u2019s Fattest Country, Nutritionists Take Money From Food Giants", "Date": "2017-12-23", "News": "When the food industry funds nutritionists, critics say it subverts science to preserve its market.Supported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Over the past three decades this increasingly prosperous nation has become the fattest country in Asia, with nearly half the adult population now overweight or obese. Several years ago, Dr. Tee E Siong, Malaysia\u2019s leading nutrition expert, decided to act, organizing a far-reaching study of local diets and lifestyle habits.The research, conducted by scientists from the Nutrition Society of Malaysia, which Dr. Tee heads, has produced several articles for peer-reviewed academic journals. But scientists weren\u2019t the only ones vetting the material. One of the reviewers was Nestl\u00e9, the world\u2019s largest food company, which financed the research.The research exemplified a practice that began in the West and has moved, along with rising obesity rates, to developing countries: deep financial partnerships between the world\u2019s largest food companies and nutrition scientists, policymakers and academic societies.Similar relationships have ignited a growing outcry in the United States and Europe, and a veritable civil war in the field between those who take food industry funding and those who argue that the money manipulates science and misleads policymakers and consumers. But in developing countries, where government research funding is scarce and there is less resistance to the practice, companies are doubling down in their efforts.Few examples of close ties between industry and science are as striking as those held by Dr. Tee, 70, a relationship that has deepened in recent years.\u201cHe\u2019s a God in the region,\u201d said Barry M. Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina. \u201cBut at the same time, he\u2019s very linked to industry.\u201dWhen corporate money influences nutrition science, Dr. Popkin said, the evidence of what is healthy for people \u201cgets obscured, gets confounded.\u201dIn addition to Nestl\u00e9, Dr. Tee\u2019s work has been funded by Kellogg\u2019s, PepsiCo and Tate & Lyle, one of the world\u2019s biggest makers of high-fructose corn syrup, among others. He said scientists need cooperation and financial support from companies, who can supply much-needed resources.He noted that traditional Malaysian cuisine \u2014 curries and other sugar-laden street foods \u2014 are key contributors to obesity but said that working with street vendors and mom-and-pop companies to make their food healthier is difficult. Working with multinational companies is easier and more productive, he said.Dr. Tee said he has used his position in the government to push for important steps to regulate companies, including a 2003 rule that required food companies to put nutritional information \u2014 the levels of fat, sugars and protein \u2014 on their packaging.\u201cWe were one of the first countries in Asia to do it,\u201d he said.Nestl\u00e9 said it is important for the company to collaborate in efforts to improve nutrition around the globe.\u201cNestl\u00e9 believes that public health issues can only be addressed by a broad multi-stakeholder approach and that we can play a catalyst role,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.Nestl\u00e9 reads papers before publication as part of a written agreement between the company and Dr. Tee\u2019s Nutrition Society. The company said its review of the article on the breakfast study and other research was intended \u201cto ensure that the methodology was scientifically correct.\u201dThe statement said: \u201cWe approach our research transparently and apply strict standards to ensure project integrity until the publication of the study.\u201dDr. Tee recently wandered with a reporter through brightly lit supermarket aisles in a suburb of the Malaysian capital. The shelves were packed with products now found across the globe: instant noodles, spaghetti sauce, soda and rows of sugary cereals, including Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Stars, which is 28 percent sugar and has a bright red circle on the bottom right of the box that says \u201cSelected Healthier Choice Malaysia Ministry of Health.\u201d\u201cWe have to stop blaming the multinationals,\u201d Dr. Tee said. The real problem, he continued, isn\u2019t the type of food people eat, but how much of it, and their lifestyle.\u201cMalaysians are always eating. They don\u2019t exercise,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t need to go the gym. You need to walk outside. It\u2019s free. Get off your chair and move!\u201dDapper and soft-spoken, Dr. Tee, who has a doctorate in food science from the Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, bounces around the globe attending and organizing conferences. In 2002, he started a consulting business, TES NutriHealth, whose clients are small food companies. At the same time he sits on seven government committees and was chairman of the committee on nutrition and health claims until 2011.In 2014, he created the Southeast Asian Public Health Nutrition Network, or SEA-PHN, with nutrition leaders from Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam. Much of the network\u2019s funding comes from Danone, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo and other large food companies, whose logos are displayed prominently on the SEA-PHN website and its annual reports. Dr. Tee says nearly all of the group\u2019s funding comes from corporate sponsorship and fees for attending conferences.The food companies are not only sponsors of the network, but also \u201cassociate members\u201d who plan and participate in its activities, including the financing of scientific papers and launching nutrition education programs in schools throughout Southeast Asia.One girl in the video explains: \u201cI eat cereal with milk for breakfast because it gives me energy and I don\u2019t feel sleepy in class.\u201dTwo of Malaysia\u2019s top health officials recently sat down at the health ministry\u2019s offices to discuss obesity and Dr. Tee\u2019s role in the country\u2019s response to it.\u201cI really admire him,\u201d said Zalma Abdul Razak, the head of nutrition at the ministry. \u201cNobody can replace him as the president of the Nutrition Society of Malaysia.\u201dAccording to their annual accounting reports, the nutrition society has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from industry, including at least $188,000 from Nestl\u00e9 and Cereal Partners Worldwide \u2014 a joint venture between Nestl\u00e9 and General Mills \u2014 for the breakfast study. It has also received at least $44,000 directly from Nestl\u00e9 for other projects and collaborations; about $11,000 from the dairy industry; $10,000 from the artificial sweetener company Ajinomoto, which makes aspartame; and at least $40,000 from Philips Avent, the baby and consumer products company, for projects related to infant and maternal nutrition.PepsiCo and Tate & Lyle, the corn syrup producer, have sponsored the nutrition society\u2019s annual conference as well as Dr. Tee\u2019s Southeast Asia Public Health Network, but the companies declined to say how much money they contribute.The ethos of corporate partnership runs through a number of health initiatives in Malaysia. A Health Ministry committee teamed up with the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers, which includes representatives of major food companies, to develop a labeling system for the public. The labels tells consumers which packaged foods are a \u201chealthier choice\u201d than others in the same category.Among the products that obtained the label were children\u2019s sugar cereals and Gatorade Quiet Storm, which has 16 grams of sugar per serving (roughly four teaspoons) and is given a grade of D-minus for its nutritional content by \u201cFooducate,\u201d an app that grades the health of various foods and won a surgeon general\u2019s award.The Malaysian health minister S. Subramaniam said the government\u2019s job was not to be a watchdog over big food companies.\u201cIt\u2019s more cooperation,\u201d he said.But some nutritionists say Malaysia\u2019s dietary guidelines, which Dr. Tee helped craft, are not as tough on sugar as they might otherwise be. They tell people to load up on grains and cereals, and to limit fat to less than 20 to 30 percent of daily calories, a recommendation that was removed from dietary guidelines in the United States in 2015 after evidence emerged that low-fat diets don\u2019t curb obesity and may contribute to it.Corporate funding of nutrition science in Malaysia has weakened the case against sugar and processed foods, said Rohana Abdul Jalil, a Harvard-trained diet expert based in the rural state of Kelantan, where obesity is as high as in the biggest cities.\u201cThere\u2019s never been an explicit, aggressive campaign against sugar,\u201d she said.She works in Kota Bharu, the state\u2019s capital, where vendors set up food stalls outside schools, dosing out cups of soda from big plastic bottles and hawking chocolates and puffed corn and rice snacks flavored with squid, shrimp and cheese.Dr. Rohana runs an obesity awareness class and was surprised to learn that many who attended it were not aware of the dangers of excess sugar consumption.\u201cI knew that sugar caused diabetes but I didn\u2019t realize it caused obesity,\u201d said Wan Maznah binti Hamzah, an employee in the public works department, adding she has now cut down sharply on cakes, ice cream and other sweets.Elyza Ismail, who lives in a house beside rice paddies and has a business selling plus-sized clothes, said before she attended the class, she did not know that Milo, the Nestl\u00e9 breakfast drink, contained so much sugar.\u201cI had this idea of Milo as healthy and strong,\u201d Ms. Elyza said, repeating an advertising slogan that has echoed in the ears of Malaysians for years.Dr. Rohana, who doesn\u2019t take research money from companies, is promoting a back to basics approach: whole grain rice and other natural foods that are native to Malaysia.She criticized the research papers that came out of the nutrition society\u2019s breakfast study. In addition to the paper that linked drinking malted beverages with more exercise and less screen time, Dr. Tee and his colleagues published a study that pointed to breakfast cereals, which are not part of the traditional Malaysian diet, as an \u201cimportant source of nutrients,\u201d although the study also pointed to high sugar levels in the cereals.Dr. David Ludwig, a Harvard nutrition expert, described the study on breakfast beverages as \u201cwildly overstated.\u201d\u201cThere is no reason supplemental nutrients need to come in the form of a sugary beverage, especially for low-income populations at risk of obesity,\u201d he said.Malaysian researchers involved in the breakfast study say in one instance Nestl\u00e9 requested a reference to their Healthy Kids Program, which the researchers agreed to. But Dr. Tee says he has final say over the research.For his part, Dr. Tee said the obesity risk in Malaysia would be worse without companies\u2019 help, and he couldn\u2019t accomplish his goals without their support.\u201cThere are some people who say that we should not accept money for projects, for research studies. I\u2019m aware of that,\u201d Dr. Tee said. \u201cI have two choices: Either I don\u2019t do anything or I work with companies.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of an application that grades various foods in terms of their health value. It is Fooducate, not Food Educate.Advertisement"}

And we are getting very close to the point where some children will also be victims.\u201dVirginia sent letters last week to parents of 68,000 children warning them that CHIP coverage would end on Jan. 31 unless Congress took action.Congress has known since April 2015 that funds for the popular children\u2019s insurance program \u2014 created and sustained for two decades with bipartisan support \u2014 would expire this year at the end of September. The Senate Finance Committee approved a five-year extension of funding for the program in early October, but did not specify how to pay for it \u2014 and Republicans insist that it must be paid for.The House passed a bill to provide five years of funds in early November, but those funds would come from public health programs set up under the Affordable Care Act and an increase in premiums for affluent Medicare beneficiaries, provisions that are unacceptable to most Democrats. House Republicans plan to send those same provisions to the Senate again this week as part of a stopgap spending bill, knowing they will be killed.Meantime, the Alabama Department of Public Health posted a notice on its website this week saying that it would freeze enrollment in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program on Jan. 1 and would not renew any coverage after that date.\u201cIf Congress does not act soon, coverage for children now enrolled in CHIP will end on Feb. 1,\u201d Cathy Caldwell, the director of the Alabama program, said Tuesday in an interview.Colorado and Connecticut, among other states, have sent letters informing families that their children may soon lose CHIP coverage.\u201cCongress has not acted to continue the funding, so we must plan to end the CHIP program on Jan. 31,\u201d said the letters from the Connecticut Department of Social Services.To parents of sick children, the gamesmanship in Washington was incomprehensible, especially as Congress was working to pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut with little worry over its cost to the Treasury.\u201cI am here to call on the Senate to do the right thing and invest in our nation\u2019s true future, invest in the children, to save CHIP and to save children\u2019s lives,\u201d said Sonja Reynolds, who came to the Capitol from Pleasant Grove, Utah.She has five children on CHIP, including two with Crohn\u2019s disease, a chronic condition. Every eight weeks, she takes the two with Crohn\u2019s to a hospital for infusions of Remicade, an expensive biologic drug. Without CHIP, she said, she could not afford the treatments.With federal funding not yet renewed, most states will soon run out of money for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.Amy Jo Hutchison came to Washington with her daughters, 10 and 13, from Wheeling, W.Va. As an infant, her older daughter was blind in one eye, and CHIP helps pay for regular visits to a pediatric ophthalmologist, Ms. Hutchison said.De\u2019Andrea Choice of Tyler, Tex., said CHIP had been \u201ca blessing to me and my son.\u201d Her son is 15, regularly needs to visit medical specialists and takes several medications for a condition known as fecal incontinence or encopresis.\u201cWithout CHIP,\u201d she said, \u201cI would not have been able to afford his doctor visits, and his medicine would have been difficult for me to purchase.Angelique Smith came from Lakewood, Colo., with her 5-year-old son, Malachi, hoping to persuade lawmakers to provide funds for the continuation of CHIP.Parents and children conveyed their message to Congress on Tuesday, the 80th day since federal CHIP funds expired.No spending bill can clear the Senate without Democratic votes, so the minority party does have leverage, but Democrats also have other priorities in negotiations over the spending bill. They seek protections for young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. They want to be sure that any increase in military spending is matched by an increase in domestic spending.Senators from both parties, including the majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, may try to attach a bipartisan bill to stabilize health insurance markets and hold down insurance premiums. That proposal faces fierce resistance from conservative House Republicans who see it as propping up Obamacare.And some Democrats, especially the 10 up for re-election next year in states won by President Trump, fear that a government shutdown would harm their political futures.Republicans and Democrats blame each other for the stalemate over CHIP.Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, told parents on Tuesday that he could not explain Congress\u2019s failure to fund the program.\u201cSome members of Congress are obsessed about getting the tax bill done,\u201d Mr. Casey said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been waiting for this, some of them, their whole lives. They think it\u2019s the most important thing in the world. But, my God, if you can spend months and weeks making sure that the corporate tax rate is just where it needs to be, so that you can satisfy corporate leaders, if you can tinker with that, and have tax breaks for the superrich, if you can work that hard, why is it so hard to get a bipartisan children\u2019s health insurance bill done?\u201dSenator Angus King, independent of Maine, offered a possible answer: \u201cMaybe it is because none of our kids are in this program. I venture to say that if the children of the members of the Senate were in the CHIP program, we would have met that deadline\u201d of Sept. 30.While Congress squabbles, state officials are sounding the alarm. A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 16 states expect to exhaust their federal CHIP funds by the end of January, with 21 additional states saying they would run out by the end of March.The Trump administration has reshuffled money to help states with the most urgent needs. But in so doing, it exacerbates the financial problems that other states will soon face because Congress has not provided any new funds.Republican governors, including Greg Abbott of Texas and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, have joined Democrats in urgent appeals to Congress, without much success.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Tax Cuts Would Lift Some Industries More Than Others", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe disparities illustrate the difficulty in tailoring tax cuts for two of the blue-collar industries that Mr. Trump frequently promises to invigorate through economic policy changes. That\u2019s in part because both mining and manufacturing companies already benefit from relatively low effective tax rates among Americans companies.The findings come from economists at the Penn Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania, who projected how the final tax bill would change the average effective tax rates of a variety of industries over time.The legislation is expected to be put to a vote in the House as early as Tuesday and in the Senate on Wednesday. It would reduce the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, from the current top rate of 35 percent, and make a host of other changes to the way businesses are taxed.Other analysts, particularly Wall Street firms, have begun estimating how specific industries would fare under the tax plan in the years ahead. On Monday, Goldman Sachs researchers said they expect the corporate cut in the tax bill to increase earnings-per-share by 13 percent on average for America\u2019s largest banks, with Wells Fargo standing to gain the most from the change.The Penn Wharton economists found that it would reduce the average effective tax rate across industries to 9 percent next year, down from 21 percent under current law.The cuts would boost some industries far more than others, in part because some sectors, like financial firms, pay higher effective tax rates than others, like manufacturing. Average effective rates are the tax rates that industries actually pay on profits after accounting for deductions and other tax breaks, as opposed to the statutory rate, which is set under law.The study found that real estate firms would see a 16-point reduction in their effective rates next year, and financial firms would see a 12-point reduction. Mining companies would see a cut of just under 9 points. Manufacturers\u2019 rate would fall by less than 7 points.\u201cSome industries see smaller gains because they already benefit from so much preferential tax treatment,\u201d said Alexander Arnon, a researcher with the Penn Wharton Budget Model. \u201cManufacturing and natural resource extraction already have low effective tax rates under current law, and so there isn\u2019t much room for them to fall further.\u201dThe analysis projects that the bill will save financial firms $250 billion on corporate taxes over the next decade, a 35 percent cut from what otherwise would have been a $715 billion tax liability.It projects manufacturers will save nearly the same amount, $261 billion. But that amounts to only a 22 percent cut, because that industry is larger than finance, and would have otherwise faced a $1.2 trillion liability over that time.Financial firms start with a higher effective rate, and in the first few years would see a larger rate cut. In later years, though, manufacturers in particular fall prey to a pair of provisions phased in by Republicans.One is the ability to immediately deduct the full cost of some capital investments, like heavy equipment and factories, which expires after five years. The other is a provision that effectively reduces the annual value of a tax credit for investments in research and development, which manufacturers utilize heavily.Manufacturing lobbyists say they are bullish on the tax bill and plan to fight Congress in later years to ensure neither of those provisions take effect down the road.\u201cOur members are very happy about the tax bill as it\u2019s written,\u201d said Chad Moutray, the association\u2019s chief economist. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t see that level of optimism if they didn\u2019t think this was something that\u2019s going to benefit them.\u201dManufacturers currently enjoy one of the lowest effective tax rates of any industry, and they would continue to if the bill becomes law. Penn Wharton projects that manufacturers\u2019 effective rate would drop from 17.5 percent to 10.9 percent in 2018. But that number would rebound to 15.8 percent in 2027 if the law remains as written.No other major industry would see its rate savings shrink so drastically. But, under the legislation, every industry would see its gains erode over time. The average effective tax rate across industries, the Penn Wharton researchers calculated, would fall by 12 percent in 2018 compared to current law.By 2027, that cut would shrink to less than 5 percent.Jim Tankersley reported from Washington and Ben Casselman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Panel Rejects Trump's Nominee to Lead Export-Import Bank", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Two Republican senators broke with their party on Tuesday to block President Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Export-Import Bank, a setback for the White House that reflects deep divisions in the Republican Party over the role that the government should play in steering the United States economy toward prosperity.The nominee, Scott Garrett, a former representative and a Republican from New Jersey who had wanted to see the government\u2019s export credit agency shuttered, was rejected by the Senate Banking Committee in a 13-to-10 vote, the first by the committee against a Trump administration nominee.The clash over the bank, which provides loan guarantees to foreign buyers of American-made products, reflects a split in the Republican Party between purist conservatives who view any government involvement in the economy as a violation of the free market and more business-oriented Republicans who see a role for the federal government as an advocacy arm in the global economy.The Trump administration has tried, sometimes unsuccessfully, to straddle this divide. Mr. Trump has vacillated between opposing the Export-Import Bank as an example of crony capitalism and supporting it as a tool to reduce the nation\u2019s trade deficit.Mr. Garrett reflected that uncertainty. Like some of the Trump administration\u2019s more controversial cabinet appointments, he had previously called for abolishing the institution that he would have led. Once nominated, he tried to assure senators that he had had a change of heart. But business and manufacturing groups that benefit from the Export-Import Bank feared that, as the agency\u2019s leader, Mr. Garrett might act to undermine it from within.The Export-Import Bank has offered government-backed loan guarantees to overseas customers wishing to buy products manufactured in the United States since the Depression. Some of its biggest customers are General Electric, Boeing and Caterpillar, whose equipment can be out of reach to some foreign customers without loan guarantees that help them secure credit with private banks.But the agency \u2014 once backed by large majorities in both parties \u2014 has become something of a litmus test for hard-line conservatives versus establishment Republicans. Hard-line conservative outside groups like Heritage Action and the Club for Growth have demanded the agency\u2019s closing. Business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have tried to revive it.As a candidate, Mr. Trump described the bank as a kind of corporate welfare. But in his first few months in office, the president appeared to have been persuaded that the bank\u2019s mission dovetailed with his own goal of using the might of the government to help lift manufacturing and exports. He also appeared to have been persuaded by the bank\u2019s supporters, who point out that the agency makes enough money to more than pay for itself and that other countries have far larger export credit agencies.\u201cSo instinctively, you would say it\u2019s a ridiculous thing, but actually, it\u2019s a very good thing and it actually makes money,\u201d the president said.The vote on Tuesday was the first time that the Senate Banking Committee had scuttled a Trump administration nominee. The Republican senators Tim Scott of South Carolina and Michael Rounds of South Dakota joined 11 Democrats to reject the nomination.\u201cI believe he\u2019s a principled man who simply believes in the abolishment of the bank,\u201d Mr. Rounds said of Mr. Garrett. \u201cI think that strong desire on his part to see it abolished as an example of crony capitalism would not have worked in the operation of the bank.\u201dMr. Scott, whose state hosts a huge manufacturing plant for Boeing, the bank\u2019s biggest customer, said: \u201cMy belief is that we need to both reform the Export-Import Bank and ensure it continues to function as an important tool for American businesses large and small. Given Mr. Garrett\u2019s long history opposing the Ex-Im Bank, I believe it would be hard for him to accomplish both of those goals.\u201dMr. Garrett had been an outspoken critic of the bank, making him a curious choice to lead it.In 2015, Mr. Garrett called the bank \u201ca fund for corporate welfare\u201d and accused it of embodying \u201cthe corruption of the free enterprise system.\u201dSince his nomination, Mr. Garrett had expressed a newfound respect for the agency, but his conversion was not convincing to a majority of the Banking Committee.\u201cMr. Garrett was a leader of the effort to slam shut the doors of America\u2019s export financing bank, and he can\u2019t hide his contempt for Ex-Im,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the committee. \u201cHis testimony expressed no regret for his work to close the bank.\u201dThe demise of Mr. Garrett\u2019s nomination presents the White House with a choice on where to go.The White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration was \u201ccertainly disappointed,\u201d but added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with the committee on a path forward that hasn\u2019t been determined.\u201dThe Senate Banking Committee voted on Tuesday to advance four other Trump administration nominees who would serve on Ex-Im\u2019s board. If at least two of those nominees are approved in the Senate, the agency will have enough personnel to function normally.But some senators could move to block those nominations in the coming months. In November, Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, a critic of the bank, said that he would do \u201ceverything I can to prevent Ex-Im from getting a quorum\u201d if Mr. Garrett was not approved.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico Graft Inquiry Deepens With Arrest of a Presidential Ally", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHIHUAHUA, Mexico \u2014 A former deputy in President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s party has been arrested as part of an investigation into the illegal use of public money to fuel his party\u2019s campaigns in Mexican elections last year, state officials announced on Wednesday.The former deputy, Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez, is one of several allies of Mexico\u2019s president suspected of taking part in an embezzlement scheme to propel his party\u2019s chances at a time of deep dissatisfaction with the government, according to former officials connected to the scheme and hundreds of pages of documents reviewed by The New York Times.The arrest of Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez, a veteran figure who helped control the finances of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is part of a widening inquiry into the enormous corruption that occurred under the previous governor of the state of Chihuahua. The governor was a close friend of Mexico\u2019s president and a rising star in the party before he fled to the United States to avoid corruption charges.The case against him has already ensnared more than a dozen former state officials, some of whom are now cooperating with the authorities.But the investigation is spreading and threatens to reach the highest ranks of government, according to testimony from the former state officials and financial records obtained by The Times.Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez is being investigated in connection with what former state officials call a nationwide plan to funnel tens of millions of dollars in public money to help the party\u2019s candidates in gubernatorial elections in 2016.The money was sent to states with friendly governors in the party, who then created a trail of government contracts with fake companies that ultimately sent the money back for use in campaigns, according to the testimony and records.At the time, top officials in the PRI were worried about losing the state elections in June 2016. The former state officials say the pattern of embezzling money to finance elections occurred in several states where the PRI was frightened of losing control.The documents reviewed by The Times focus largely on the embezzlement scheme in Chihuahua. According to the records, millions of dollars were transferred in January 2016 from the federal government to the state for the purpose of education.The funds were then shuffled and diverted to four companies used to embezzle money \u2014 businesses that the nation\u2019s tax auditor has blacklisted as front companies, according to the government contracts reviewed by The Times.Those companies, supposedly hired by the state of Chihuahua to provide educational services, received around $14 million in their accounts, according to the contracts and the bank records showing that the money had been received.But the companies provided no such services, according to affidavits from current education officials in the state. Instead, the money was turned into cash and returned to the PRI to be used for election campaigns, according to the former state officials connected to the scheme.One of them, Ricardo Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, the former minister of education in Chihuahua, described the plot in a sentencing document. He is serving a four-year prison sentence.Not all of the money went to politicking, however.About $230,000 was deposited directly into a business account operated by Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez, the former PRI deputy, according to bank records and witness testimony.The governor of Chihuahua announced the arrest on Twitter on Wednesday evening, describing it as a \u201cjoint operation with the federal and state police.\u201d The governor said that Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez had been charged with embezzlement.The federal Finance Ministry denied that any illicit payments had been made, contending that the nation\u2019s budget system had been \u201cstrengthened with strict controls\u201d on multiple fronts \u201cto guarantee\u201d accountability in the use of public resources.But the trail of payments outlined in the documents suggest a tie between the embezzlement scheme and the party at a national level.Contracts and bank records show that millions of dollars went to some of the same phony companies, or companies connected to them, in the states of Sonora and Durango. Bank records also show hundreds of thousands of dollars in deposits to some of the companies by the state of Colima. And in their testimony, the former state officials connected to the scheme said it was carried out in the states of Veracruz and Tamaulipas.State officials in Veracruz did not respond to repeated requests for comment. And the current governor of Tamaulipas, an opposition politician who won his seat during the 2016 elections, said a review by his employees found no contracts with the four main fake companies.It is still unclear who else may have taken part in the scheme.In the sentencing document, Mr. Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, the state education minister who has already been convicted, is quoted as saying that both Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez and Chihuahua\u2019s former governor, C\u00e9sar Duarte, told him that the money had been sent from the federal government to finance the party\u2019s election campaigns. He said they told him the same plan had been carried out in several states.Mr. Duarte has fled to the United States, where he is avoiding federal and state corruption charges, including allegations that he stole more than $300 million while in charge of the state.Mr. Duarte\u2019s daughter is an American citizen, and according to legal documents reviewed by The Times, the former governor applied for a green card.Mr. Duarte is believed to be living in Texas and New Mexico. Attempts to reach Mr. Duarte by phone and through visits to 10 properties in and around El Paso that are believed to belong to him were unsuccessful.The head of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s party at the time of the campaign finance scheme, Manlio Fabio Beltrones, has long been allied with the president and his family.Mr. Beltrones is also named in the sentencing document. Mr. Y\u00e1\u00f1ez said he was told by the former governor that Mr. Beltrones had hatched the plan. Attempts to reach Mr. Beltrones on Wednesday were unsuccessful.In the document, Mr. Y\u00e1\u00f1ez said that he met with Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez, the former PRI deputy, and other officials at the party\u2019s headquarters in Mexico City. At that point, the PRI had already lost the election and the mind-set of the participants switched to damage control.The campaign cases are part of a wide-ranging investigation underway in Chihuahua, where the new governor, Javier Corral, has assigned his attorney general to delve into corruption.The leeway that prosecutors have been granted by Mr. Corral is rare in Mexico, where investigations are seldom begun and, if permitted, rarely reach higher than low-level functionaries.Over months, prosecutors have slowly worked their way through a roster of former officials who served under the previous governor, Mr. Duarte, pressuring them to cooperate.In January 2016, the state of Chihuahua was facing financial headwinds and needed help making payroll. Jamie Herrera, the former state finance minister under Mr. Duarte, needed nearly $16 million to ease the financial strain.Two days later, in a seven-page contract, the federal Finance Ministry granted the request. According to the governor\u2019s office, a two-day turnaround for such a large request was staggeringly fast.But the reason for the transfer, according to the former state officials, was a hoax. In reality, they said, Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez, the former PRI deputy, had called officials in Chihuahua to have them to ask for the money from federal officials, the testimony shows.The operation, the state officials explained, was a complex, tried-and-true way to embezzle funds. The officials were given the names of four companies that would supposedly provide educational services for the state \u2014 front companies from which party operatives could siphon the money.One company received about $5.2 million for selling the state human resources software.Three other companies were paid millions for training and educational services, according to the contracts reviewed by The Times.According to contracting specialists, the amounts paid by the state were astronomically high for the services they provided.The payments moved swiftly. By the end of February, contracts had been drafted and signed by the state officials, and by April the checks were cut to each of the companies.Of the roughly $15.8 million sent to the state by the federal government, the party only asked that $14.4 million of it be returned to it, according to the testimony from state officials. The rest, they said, could be spent as officials in the state saw fit.From each of the companies, the money was then transferred to dozens of other companies, several of which also appear on the national tax authorities\u2019 blacklist of front companies, according to the documents.From there, it disappeared. The only clue as to where it went lies with the testimony of the two former state officials, who were told by party officials that the money was turned into cash spent on campaign financing.J.

{"Headline": "Republicans, Closing In on Final Tax Bill, Aim for a Vote Next Week", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican lawmakers, scrambling to reach agreement on a final tax bill that they hope to pass next week, are coalescing around a plan that would slightly raise the proposed corporate tax rate, lower the top rate on the richest Americans and scale back the existing mortgage interest deduction.In a frenzy of last-minute negotiations, Republicans drew closer to agreement on nudging the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, up from the 20 percent in the bills that passed the House and Senate but still lower than the current 35 percent corporate rate, according to a lawmaker and a person briefed on the discussions.They are also considering lowering the top individual tax rate to 37 percent, from the current top rate of 39.6 percent, to assuage concerns from some wealthy taxpayers who fear that their tax bills could rise under the current legislation, which eliminates a host of individual tax breaks.Another closely watched change centers on the ability to deduct the interest on mortgage debt. Lawmakers are discussing limiting the deduction to mortgage debt of up to $750,000 for newly purchased homes, a higher cap than the $500,000 limit in the House-passed bill but lower than the $1 million limit that currently exists and remains in the Senate-passed bill, according to Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana.The negotiations come as lawmakers in the House and Senate seek to align their tax bills, which differ in significant ways and must be reconciled to ensure enough Republican support to pass along party lines.Under Senate rules, the final bill can add no more than $1.5 trillion to federal budget deficits over a decade, a restriction that has led to a frantic game of budget chess as lawmakers look for ways to pay for the changes they are considering. Lowering the top individual tax rate to 37 percent, for instance, will result in less tax revenue for the Treasury Department. Raising the corporate tax rate to 21 percent will help bring in a bit more money to help lawmakers stay in that $1.5 trillion box.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said that House and Senate negotiators were making progress in their effort to agree on a final tax bill and that a deal could be reached shortly.\u201cWe don\u2019t have it right this minute, but we\u2019re getting closer,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said shortly before lunchtime. \u201cWe\u2019ve Ping-Ponged a number of offers and counteroffers back and forth.\u201dIn a sign of how difficult it is to build consensus for such a fast-moving bill, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said on Tuesday that she did not like the idea of lowering the top individual rate, which is currently 38.5 percent in the Senate bill and 39.6 percent in the House version.Republicans have resolved the differences between the two versions of their tax bill.\u201cI don\u2019t think lowering the top rate is a good idea,\u201d Ms. Collins said, explaining that she preferred the House version that did not lower the top tax rate. \u201cI had hoped that the House position, the original House position, would prevail.\u201dHowever, Ms. Collins, who negotiated several changes to the final version of the Senate tax bill in exchange for her vote, would not say whether the adjustment to the top rate was a deal breaker.\u201cI\u2019m going to wait and look at the entire conference report and what all of the provisions are,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cThere are a lot of rumors flying around.\u201dThe bipartisan conference committee is scheduled to hold its one public meeting on Wednesday afternoon. While that meeting will give Republicans and Democrats a final chance to publicly debate the merits of a $1.5 trillion tax cut, it is not expected to alter the trajectory of the bill or its details.A spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee stressed late Tuesday afternoon that negotiations were still continuing, but many lobbyists said they expected the discussions to be complete before the public meeting on Wednesday begins.Also on Wednesday, President Trump plans to deliver at the White House what administration officials called a \u201cclosing argument\u201d for the tax bill. And in an expression of optimism about the bill\u2019s fate, Speaker Paul D. Ryan tweeted a poem on Tuesday titled \u201c\u2019Twas the Night Before Taxmas.\u201dHouse and Senate Republicans have been working behind closed doors to hash out the final details of the tax plan, and they hope to hold a vote next week. Republican leaders want to complete a consensus bill in the next few days, and release its text on Friday. If all goes according to plan, the Senate could take the bill up on Monday and the House could follow on Tuesday or Wednesday.On Tuesday, speculation on the Capitol swirled over which measures in the House and Senate tax bills would survive, be tweaked or be cut. Vice President Mike Pence huddled with Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means committee, and joined Senate Republicans for lunch to discuss the remaining details of the tax plan.The big sticking points that remain include whether to scrap or keep the corporate alternative minimum tax and the estate tax for individuals, and how low to set the corporate tax rate.\u201cCertainly the president indicated he would be willing to go up a bit, and there\u2019s been some other concerns,\u201d Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, said of raising the corporate tax rate to pay for other fixes in the bill. \u201cEverything\u2019s a little bit in flux.\u201dAmong the most politically sensitive issues lingering is how to treat the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, which is capped at $10,000 in property taxes in the House and Senate bills. Lawmakers have been working through possible compromises that would let people continue to deduct a certain amount of property or income taxes, but Republicans still run the risk of raising taxes on broad portions of middle-income constituents. Scaling back the SALT deduction appears to be a risk some are willing to take.\u201cWill there be some outliers who pay more in taxes? Yes,\u201d Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said on Tuesday on CNBC. \u201cThere are some people who will pay more because they live in very high-tax jurisdictions.\u201dHowever, Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, called on members of the conference committee to rethink eliminating the state and local tax deduction as they craft a final bill.\u201cAmong the plan\u2019s deficiencies is the elimination of the state and local tax deduction (SALT), which since the advent of our federal income tax has prevented the double taxation of Americans\u2019 income and allowed states to operate as laboratories of experiment as our founders intended,\u201d Mr. Issa wrote in a letter to the committee members and congressional leaders.This week, several independent \u201cdynamic\u201d scores of the tax bills, which include the potential revenue-raising effects of economic growth, found that the proposed legislation would still add at least $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade.While many tax experts criticized the report as unrealistic, Mr. Ryan praised the Treasury analysis on Tuesday.\u201cI think that estimate makes a lot of sense,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, arguing that the economic models used by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation were less reflective of reality.Democrats and progressives have been assailing Republicans for recklessly adding to the debt and giving big tax breaks to the rich.\u201cI would hope my Republican colleagues are taking a look at how the American people feel about this disastrous tax bill,\u201d said Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, referring to polling that shows the tax bill as unpopular among the general public. \u201cI hope that they understand that is not what the American people want.\u201dJim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Brexit Looms, Paris Tries a Business Makeover", "Date": "2017-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The phone rings a lot at Paris Region Entreprises, a one-stop shop for companies deciding whether to move employees to the City of Light. Typically, callers ask about visas and minutiae of employment law. But not long ago, an executive from Japan called with a stumper: Where, he asked, are the dancing clubs?\u201cIt was a certain kind of club that nobody here had ever heard of,\u201d said Robin Rivaton, the organization\u2019s chief executive. \u201cKind of a social club for executives and their wives. One of the guys here called around and found one in the western part of Paris.\u201dThere\u2019s a sense of urgency behind these changes. Hundreds of financial companies may need to relocate thousands of London-based workers before Britain leaves the European Union by the end of March 2019, the withdrawal known as Brexit. Otherwise, these companies could lose their financial passporting rights, which grants them privileged access to the 27 countries that will remain in the European Union.Paris is vying against Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg in a pageant that is not primarily about beauty. What is prized most in boardrooms is an array of business-friendly laws, regulations and culture \u2014 the sort of warm welcome that Paris once defiantly refused to offer.\u201cWhen you grow up in France, none of the heroes you learn about are entrepreneurs,\u201d said Brigitte Granville, a professor of economics at Queen Mary University of London, who was raised in France. \u201cWhen someone gets rich in France, people immediately ask, \u2018What did he do to make this money? He must be a nasty person.\u2019\u201dThe origins of this attitude are usually traced to the French Revolution, which, Ms. Granville explained, elevated equality to a kind of religion. When Fran\u00e7ois Hollande announced during his presidential campaign in 2012 that \u201cMy enemy is the world of finance,\u201d he was summing up a fairly common sentiment.Now, a new crop of French leaders, most notably the free market-supporting president, Emmanuel Macron, are vigorously trying to shed this anticapitalist reputation. During his campaign, he visited London, home to as many as 400,000 French expatriates, urging them to return to France and \u201cinnovate.\u201d And since his election, the government has started a highly aggressive campaign to poach jobs from London.It began the same day that the Brexit vote results were announced, on June 24 of last year. That afternoon, Paris Region Entreprises splashed banner ads on dozens of websites (\u201cChoose Paris Region\u201d was a not very catchy slogan). A few weeks later, 4,000 letters were mailed to companies around the globe.By that October, officials with a business district in Paris had posted cheeky billboards in London\u2019s airports and train stations, quipping, \u201cTired of the Fog, Try the Frogs!\u201d Then came schmoozing and briefings. In February of this year, a delegation of French leaders in politics and business met with more than 80 executives on the 37 floor of the Shard, a landmark building in the center of London.The French government also appointed Christian Noyer, a former Bank of France governor, to be the country\u2019s Brexit point man. A born diplomat, he cannot be baited into belittling the competition, beyond calling Frankfurt \u201csmall and provincial,\u201d hastening to add, \u201csome people may like that.\u201dHe rarely promotes what is most celebrated about Paris, like its gorgeous streetscapes and stellar restaurants, but he believes they will factor, at least a little, into some companies\u2019 relocation decisions.A company can send staff members to any city they want, Mr. Noyer said, during a brief interview in the lobby of a London hotel. \u201cBut if they have a competitor who is going to a nicer place, the best staff might, if they are offered a job in a better city, leave after a few months.\u201dLocal politicians have predicted that 10,000 Brexit-related jobs will eventually move here, creating another 10,000 indirect jobs. Whether the city will come close to that figure is unclear, but a handful of announcements suggest that Paris is at least in the game.HSBC said this summer that it might move 1,000 employees to Paris from London. In September, Bank of America was in talks to lease office space not far from the Arc de Triomphe, with plans to initially move 300 employees there.\u201cThe idea that companies won\u2019t settle in France because of high taxes is a false argument, that they tell us to pass policies that are difficult to justify in the eyes of the population,\u201d said Alexandre Derigny a spokesman for the General Confederation of Labour, a group of trade unions.France\u2019s economic makeover has inspired some derision outside of the country, too. It has the faint smell of desperation to people like Nicolas Mackel, the chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, a public-private partnership that promotes the country as a business hub. He is proud to say that the grand duchy has not resorted to the tactics deployed in Paris.\u201cYou\u2019ll accuse me of bashing the French,\u201d he said over tea recently, \u201cbut earlier this year, they announced that they would have regulators who speak English. We didn\u2019t need to do that because our regulators already speak English and always have.\u201dFor France, English-speaking government officials would be little more than a promising start. The country has so many bewildering layers of regulations that its system is known, unaffectionately, as mille-feuille, a reference to a densely layered pastry.Some attempts to address this problem are happening behind closed doors. One of those doors is on the fourth floor of the French Finance Ministry, an immense Brutalist building that is home to thousands of civil servants and acres of standard-issue offices.A room here was recently renovated to look like the brainstorming space of a start-up. The Bercy Lab \u2014 \u201cBercy\u201d is the nickname of the ministry \u2014 has sleek furniture and whiteboards, along with a few touches that seem a bit goofy. A sign on the entrance door reads, in French, \u201cOn your mark, get ready, innovate!\u201dSince the lab opened in October, executives have been conferring with members of Parliament on drafting a wide-ranging law to improve the business environment, expected to pass next year. Among the participants is Eric Kayser, founder of the Maison Kayser chain of bakeries. As mundane as such face-to-face discussions might sound, they are a first.\u201cIt\u2019s really useful,\u201d says Alice Zagury, president of the Family, a firm that invests in European start-ups and another Bercy Lab participant. \u201cAnd it\u2019s what we need to do in France \u2014 to participate, to feel responsible, and not to believe that the government will fix everything.\u201dBut the ministry also offers a public reminder of one of Paris\u2019s enduring draws: great food. Ten chefs cook here every weekday in a 5,400-square-foot kitchen under the direction of Bruno Gricourt, who once worked at Michelin-starred restaurants. Executives who visit for Brexit-connected discussions, and stay for a meal, feast on Mr. Gricourt\u2019s menu \u2014 which changes daily.\u201cGrilled scallops with an emulsion of pumpkin and fresh hazelnuts,\u201d he said, describing an appetizer he had made that day. \u201cA very simple preparation that respects the ingredients.\u201dIt could take years for France to truly alter its image, if it is able to at all. But in addition to the commitments already made by several banks, there are small signs of a payoff.In a mid-November Twitter post, Goldman Sachs\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, praised the French government\u2019s commitment to economic changes, describing them as \u201cfirst steps.\u201d\u201cStruck by the positive energy here in Paris,\u201d he wrote. And just to underscore what his audience already knew, he added, \u201cAnd the food\u2019s good too!\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name and surname of the chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance. He is Nicolas Mackel, not Nicholas Mackal. The article also misstated where the Shard building is located. It is in the center of London, but not specifically in the financial district.Eloise Stark contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Q&A: Holiday Charitable Giving and Taxes", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementIn recent days, you\u2019ve asked us many excellent questions about charitable giving, especially as it relates to the new tax laws.Now, to your questions.How can I come up with a plan for charitable giving? How much should I donate each year?Mr. Singer, a philosopher and professor of bioethics at Princeton, tries to calculate what financially comfortable individuals would need to give to do their \u201cfair share\u201d \u2014 that is, how much these individuals would need to donate to ensure that the world\u2019s poorest citizens had a chance at a decent life.On the other side, he wanted to be sure the sums would be big enough to make a large dent in extreme poverty. He came up with a graduated scale, which resembles progressive income tax rates. He suggests that those who earn $105,000 to $148,000 annually contribute 5 percent of their gross income each year, for instance, while individuals or families earning $148,001 to $383,000 would donate 5 percent of the first $148,000 and then 10 percent of the next $235,000. Will the new tax plan take effect Jan. 1, 2018? Are there any concerns that it's being implemented so quickly?Most of the provisions in the tax plan will take effect at the start of the new year \u2014 and many of them expire after seven years.The legislation did move through Congress quickly, which left many taxpayers scratching their heads and wondering how much deep thinking went into writing the bill \u2014 and whether it could have any unintended consequences. Only time will tell.I see articles about what people\u2019s average annual individual contributions are by income, but I still don't understand how much one should give to maximize the tax benefits as related to your income. We think we're giving a lot, but it all seems relative. How does one figure it out?How is the new tax bill going to affect charitable donations to 501(c)(3) organizations? I work for a nonprofit in California and we have not been able to figure out what to tell our donors.The new tax bill does indeed impact charitable donation strategies, for you and your donors. For more, see the answer to our next question.If the new tax plans pass in Congress, what will that do to the deductibility of charitable donations? Given that fewer taxpayers will itemize if the plan passes, are charities worried that giving will decrease?According to the Tax Policy Center, more than 46 million filers would be expected to itemize in 2018 under current law, but it estimates that the number would drop to less than 20 million. \u201cThe main reasons people give are personal \u2014 they want to give back to society, they are motivated by their faith, and it's simply part of American values and culture,\u201d Steve Taylor, United Way Worldwide\u2019s senior vice president and counsel for public policy, said in an email. \u201cHowever, there is consensus among academics and economists that the tax incentive allows people to give more than they would otherwise give.\u201dAnd that\u2019s why charities are nervous. Who will people favor if they do cut back their contributions some? We are about to find out.Is the Qualified Charitable distribution for people 70\u00bd and older renewed each year by Congress? If so, does that mean this option may not be available in 2018 if Congress does not renew the act?A few readers asked questions about qualified charitable distributions.  Please read the answer to our next question for more details.For persons turning 70\u00bd in 2018 and becoming subject to mandatory individual retirement account withdrawals, does the tax bill alter the treatment of funds withdrawn from an I.R.A. and donated directly to charity? Under current law such funds are not deemed to be included in the taxpayer's income when withdrawn from an I.R.A. but also not deducted as a charitable contribution \u2014 the transaction is treated as a wash.These rules were made permanent at the end of 2015, according to Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird Private Wealth Management, so you don\u2019t have to worry about year-to-year changes.Is there a reliable, comprehensive source where we can verify whether an organization qualifies as a charity to which donations are tax-deductible? Sometimes I doubt a claim of such. Especially when the website does not offer reassurances.Should the charitably minded accelerate 2018 gifts into 2017? Seems that a donor-advised fund is a good way to do this, especially with appreciated securities.Donors are certainly considering this option, as nonprofit organization weigh the potential effects of the tax code changes. See the answer to our next question for a fuller discussion.I serve on the board of a 501(c)(3) alumni group \u2014 we've just launched our annual appeal \u2014 should we encourage alumni to give before the end of the calendar year so they don't risk not being able to benefit from making a charitable donation? Many thanks.Now that fewer people will be itemizing their tax returns, many financial advisers are working with clients to come up with ways to get the most bang for their charitable buck this year. That includes using donor-advised funds, which we mentioned up above (with a link there to an article that explains them in detail).Is there a way to use funds from a 403(b) retirement account as a charitable contribution? Could some of the retirement account funds be placed in an I.R.A. for that purpose, making the required minimum distribution at age 70 from the I.R.A.?Qualified Charitable Distributions (Q.C.D.) can only be made from an I.R.A. You could do a rollover from a 403(b) to an I.R.A. in order to have your assets in an I.R.A. and do the Q.C.D., but the rollover must happen in the prior year if you want any of the Q.C.D. to satisfy your required minimum distribution, according to Scott Dauenhauer, a certified financial planner with Meridian Wealth Management. Before doing the rollover, be careful that you are not missing out on any guarantee or investment option that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have access to outside of the 403(b) and make sure you\u2019re not paying something called \u201csurrender charges\u201d on your money in the 403(b) if you do a rollover. Also, keep in mind that any distribution has to go directly to the charity. Advertisement"}

But Republicans will almost surely need Democratic votes to pass such legislation, and the antagonism between President Trump and Democrats in Congress is so great that no one can be sure of the outcome.\u201cIt crushes me to think we\u2019re in an environment where kids\u2019 health is up for debate \u2014 that this somehow got tossed into the wrangling,\u201d said Dr. Todd Wolynn, a pediatrician in Pittsburgh and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cThere are kids on protocols and regimens and treatment plans, and their families have got to try to figure out, what are we going to do?\u201dHere in Delaware, health officials anticipate running out of money for CHIP at the end of January if Congress does not act.\u201cI\u2019ve been around a while and I\u2019ve never seen a program that is this popular, and that goes across the aisle,\u201d said Stephen Groff, director of the state\u2019s Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance. \u201cTo be having this discussion, that we may be in a funding crisis, is beyond belief.\u201dMembers of both parties in the House and the Senate agree that Congress should provide money for CHIP for five years, through 2022. But they disagree over how to pay for it.In early November, the House passed a bill to extend the CHIP program. But most Democrats voted against it because the legislation would have cut funds for other public health programs and ended insurance coverage for several hundred thousand people who had failed to pay their share of premiums for insurance purchased under the Affordable Care Act.In the Senate, senior members of the Finance Committee say they have been making progress toward a bipartisan deal on CHIP, but they have been preoccupied for several weeks with their tax bill. The committee approved a five-year extension of funding for the program in early October, but did not specify a way to pay for the measure.As Congress dithered, Minnesota received an emergency infusion of federal funds to continue CHIP for October and November, but is expected to be the first state to run out of federal money for the program. Emily Piper, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, said the state would use its own funds to fill the gap temporarily.\u201cI don\u2019t think Washington is working the way anyone in the country expects it to work right now,\u201d she said. \u201cA dysfunctional Washington has real consequences for people.\u201dOregon, which expects to exhaust its federal CHIP funds this month, will also use state funds to continue coverage, said Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat. \u201cAs Congress rebuffs its responsibilities, it is up to us, Oregonians, to stand up for our children,\u201d she said.Colorado was the first state to send warning letters to families with CHIP coverage. \u201cWe felt it was important that folks covered by CHIP understand what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Marc Williams, a spokesman for the state Department of Health Care Policy and Financing.\u201cIt gets very, very complicated once the state sends those letters out and starts walking down that road,\u201d said Laura Guerra-Cardus, deputy director of the Children\u2019s Defense Fund-Texas. \u201cIt can really affect trust in the program. So many families still don\u2019t realize this is coming, and the few I\u2019ve informed, they go immediately into a state of alarm.\u201dRepresentative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is responsible for the program, said last week that \u201cwe need to get CHIP done\u201d because \u201cstates are in a real mess right now.\u201dDemocrats said Congress should have provided money for CHIP months ago, but that Republicans had placed a higher priority on dismantling the Affordable Care Act and cutting taxes.\u201cBecause Congress failed to do its job \u2014 a bunch of elected officials who have insurance paid by taxpayers failed to do their job \u2014 children here in America are about to be kicked off of their health insurance,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, insisted: \u201cWe\u2019re going to get CHIP through. There is no question about that.\u201dMr. Hatch led efforts to create the program in collaboration with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, in 1997. \u201cNobody believes in the CHIP program more than I,\u201d Mr. Hatch said on the Senate floor last week. \u201cI invented it.\u201dDoctors at the Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, here in Wilmington, were continuing to see CHIP patients last week at the flagship of a system that treats 15,000 children with CHIP coverage each year. Dr. Jonathan Miller, chief of the system\u2019s Division of General Pediatrics, said many receive therapy for developmental delays and treatment for chronic conditions like asthma and obesity.\u201cIt provides specialized care for children that\u2019s more comprehensive than a lot of private coverage,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is really designed with adults in mind.\u201d\u201cIt makes it so much easier for me to actually take good care of my children,\u201d said Ms. Haughton. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a rocky last few years, but at least I can take them to the doctor without having to be like, \u2018Their fever isn\u2019t 105 so I guess I\u2019d better skip it.\u2019\u201dOlivia Carrow, who had brought her 2-year-old to the children\u2019s hospital here to test for an infection, said her other three children were newly uninsured and she had heard they might qualify for CHIP. The 2-year-old, William, qualifies for Medicaid because of a serious condition that causes his trachea to collapse.The rest of the family had insurance through Ms. Carrow\u2019s job as a nurse, but lost it after she cut back her hours this fall. She and her husband started a chicken farm this year and delayed exploring other coverage options, she said, partly because of the protracted fight in Congress over proposals to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201cNot knowing how things are going to go \u2014 I feel that way about health coverage in general,\u201d Ms. Carrow said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me, but it gets very sad.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sessions Says to Courts: Go Ahead, Jail People Because They\u2019re Poor", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe Justice Department helped shine a light on the harms of fine and fees when it investigated Ferguson, Mo., three years ago after the killing of the teenager Michael Brown by a police officer. As one of the lawyers on that case, I saw firsthand the damage that the city had wrought on its black community.Ferguson used its criminal justice system as a for-profit enterprise, extracting millions from its poorest citizens. Internal emails revealed the head of finance directing policing strategy to maximize revenue rather than ensure public safety. Officers told us they were pressured to issue as many tickets as possible.Even the local judge was in on it, imposing penalties of $302 for jaywalking and $531 for allowing weeds to grow in one\u2019s yard. He issued arrest warrants for residents who fell behind on payments \u2014 including a 67-year-old woman who had been fined for a trash-removal violation \u2014 without inquiring whether they even had the ability to pay the exorbitant amounts. The arrests resulted in new charges, more fees and the suspension of driver\u2019s licenses. These burdens fell disproportionately on African-Americans.At the time of our investigation, over 16,000 people had outstanding arrest warrants from Ferguson, a city of 21,000. Untold numbers found themselves perpetually in debt to the city and periodically confined to its jail.In 2015, the Justice Department convened judges, legislators, advocates and affected people to discuss this problem and devise solutions. Participants repeatedly asked the Justice Department to clarify the legal rules that govern the enforcement of financial penalties and to support widespread reform.And so we did. Relying on Supreme Court precedent from over 30 years ago, the 2016 guidance set out basic constitutional requirements: Do not imprison a person for nonpayment without first asking whether he or she can pay. Consider alternatives like community service. Do not condition access to a court hearing on payment of all outstanding debt.Viewed in that light, the true intent of Mr. Sessions\u2019s decision comes into focus. Sessions pulled 25 guidance documents last week. Sixteen of those involved civil rights protections \u2014 including 10 related to the Americans With Disabilities Act and one on the special harms that unlawful fine and fee practices can have for young people. Withdrawing these documents is consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s hostility to civil rights in a host of other areas: abandoning oversight of police departments, reinterpreting anti-discrimination statutes to deny protection to L.G.B.T. individuals and switching sides in key voting rights cases.The push to abolish debtors\u2019 prisons will continue, as community advocates and local officials press on. It would be preferable, of course, for the federal government to fulfill its role as a leading protector of basic constitutional rights. Unfortunately, Mr. Sessions has made clear that under his leadership it will not.Advertisement"}

How Much Can It Grow?", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a city goes through an economic surge and disposable wealth accumulates, the international art market is generally sure to follow. It happened in cities like Dubai, Hong Kong and London. Will it happen in Dublin?\u201cThe art weekend is the antithesis of an art fair,\u201d added Mr. Kavanagh, who, like many gallerists, says he has mixed feelings about the international art fair treadmill. \u201cBut do we have enough galleries to make it work?\u201dMr. Kavanagh was showing the Nature of Drifting, an exhibition of 16 works by the Berlin-based artist Ulrich Vogl, who turned 3-D maps into visual metaphors for the geopolitical issues of our time. In one work, \u201cThe Land Beyond the Sea,\u201d Ireland is modeled in relief, adrift in the whiteness of the gallery wall.Mr. Kavanagh estimated that there were fewer than 10 serious collectors of international contemporary art in Ireland. By the end of the gallery weekend, his show had made one confirmed sale at 800 euros, or about $950.This year\u2019s edition of Gallery Weekend Berlin featured 47 commercial dealers.

{"Headline": "Global Regulators Agree on Rules to Prevent Financial Crises", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe world took a significant step toward averting future financial meltdowns Thursday, just as the United States under President Trump begins relaxing constraints on risky behavior by banks.The rules are the capstone of years of grindingly detailed work by the so-called Basel Committee. Known as Basel III, the rules require banks to reduce their dependence on borrowed money so they are less susceptible to losses from bad loans, market turmoil or other problems.\u201cIt\u2019s a great day,\u201d Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference.But he acknowledged that the agreement was not perfect.\u201cThis is a compromise,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. The rules will make the banking system more resilient, he added, but \u201cnothing is crisis proof.\u201dThe negotiators were unable, for example, to reach agreement on a way to address one of the root causes of the government debt crisis that nearly destroyed the eurozone a few years ago.And agreement on the new rules is just an interim step. The countries that took part in the negotiations pledged to incorporate the rules into national legislation. Some, including the European Union, have a spotty record of doing so. In any case, the latest rules would not take effect until 2022.\u201cWe will be in better shape when this is implemented,\u201d said Stefan Ingves, who is chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and governor of Sveriges Riksbank, the Swedish central bank. \u201cAt the same time,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s impossible to know what\u2019s in store for the future.\u201dAfter the 2008 crisis, the United States was ahead of Europe in forcing banks to improve their ability to absorb losses. United States banks may benefit because their European competitors will now be compelled to adhere to higher standards.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a big difference for U.S. banks,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cIt makes a big difference for some European banks.\u201d He said, for example, that the rules would require European banks that specialized in mortgage lending to hold more capital.Mr. V\u00e9ron said the agreement \u201cshows that there is a piece of international regulatory cooperation that makes progress under Trump.\u201d\u201cThe global infrastructure for addressing common problems is not completely broken,\u201d he added.Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, said in a statement Thursday that the rules \u201cwill help level the playing field for U.S. firms and businesses operating internationally.\u201dOne of the main lessons of the last financial crisis was that many banks that appeared healthy on paper were acutely vulnerable to disruptions in the flow of money among financial institutions. That was what happened in the atmosphere of fear and mistrust that prevailed after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank in September 2008.Banks stopped lending to one another, the international financial system seized up, and many lenders quickly ran dangerously low on cash, requiring taxpayer bailouts to survive.The Basel III rules require banks to hold more capital \u2014 another way of saying that they must rely less on borrowed money, so that they can absorb losses without collapsing. The regulations also require banks to show they have enough liquid assets to survive a cash crunch.Most of those rules were negotiated years ago, and many have already gone into force.The last chapter in the negotiations, which concluded Thursday, revolved around the way that banks calculate the risks of different kinds of business. The riskier an asset, the more capital a bank is required to hold.The previous rules gave banks substantial discretion to determine, for example, how risky a commercial real estate loan, home mortgage or business loan might be and how much capital would be required. The compromise approved Thursday sets limits on banks\u2019 leeway without entirely eliminating it.But the negotiators were unable to agree on rules that would have reduced banks\u2019 vulnerability to their holdings of government bonds, a cause of the eurozone debt crisis.Many banks in countries like Greece, Spain and Italy hold large portfolios of their own government\u2019s debt. In 2010, severe declines in the value of Greek, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese government bonds threatened those countries\u2019 banks, creating a so-called doom loop.Wounded by the bond losses, the banks stopped lending to consumers and businesses. The economy tanked, government tax receipts plunged, and the government got into even more trouble.But most of the countries represented in the negotiations opposed rules that would have discouraged banks from investing in government debt and would have made it harder to finance public borrowing.\u201cAt this juncture, it was not possible to get to a consensus on this particular issue,\u201d Mr. Ingves said. \u201cThings stay the way they are.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congress Approves Two-Week Stopgap Measure to Keep Government Funded", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congress approved a two-week stopgap measure on Thursday that will avoid a government shutdown this weekend, pushing until just before Christmas a broader possible showdown over spending priorities, immigration and health care.The measure, which the House and Senate passed in quick succession, would fund the government through Dec. 22. President Trump is expected to sign it.\u201cAlong with enacting historic tax reform, we\u2019ll be working together in the next two weeks to find a long-term solution to our funding needs while maintaining fiscal discipline,\u201d said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.The approval came as congressional leaders from both parties met with Mr. Trump at the White House to talk about the thicket of issues facing lawmakers as the end of the year approaches.In negotiations this month, Democrats plan to press to shield from deportation undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has pledged to support the passage of bipartisan legislation intended to stabilize health insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act.Lawmakers also want to provide tens of billions of dollars in response to this year\u2019s hurricanes and wildfires, and they need to provide funds for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, whose financing lapsed at the end of September.All of these issues loom as Republicans move ahead with their effort to pass an ambitious rewrite of the tax code, which would amount to their first major legislative achievement of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.This time, in brief remarks from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump and the Democratic leaders struck a hopeful tone.\u201cWe\u2019re all here as a very friendly, well-unified group,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u201cWe\u2019re here in the spirit of \u2018let\u2019s get it done,\u2019\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader in the Senate.\u201cWe are here to make progress,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader in the House, pointing to issues like health insurance for children, opioids and helping veterans.Afterward, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, characterized the session as constructive, as did congressional leaders from both parties.Government funding is set to expire at the end of Friday, and the stopgap measure would provide more time for negotiations between Republicans and Democrats on overall spending levels for the 2018 fiscal year.Party leaders are in talks to raise strict spending caps that were imposed in 2011, with the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress particularly eager to raise the limit on military spending. Democrats are insisting that the limit on nondefense spending be increased by the same amount.After a deal is reached, the two parties can negotiate a long-term spending package.\u201cThe reality is that we\u2019re running into a deadline this week, and this resolution is our best and only option at this time,\u201d said Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.\u201cThis bill kicks the can down the road for two weeks just so Republicans can continue focusing on the greatest tax scam in history,\u201d said Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California.Given the calendar and the amount of time needed to complete a broad spending package, another stopgap spending measure will be needed just before Christmas, setting up another possibility of a shutdown.That legislation could wind up including other items, such as immigration and health care measures.Democrats are determined to secure a deal to protect young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers after Mr. Trump decided to end the program that shields them from deportation, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.Republican leaders have displayed less urgency to agree on legislation, noting that Mr. Trump had given Congress until March to find a solution.Ms. Sanders said that at the White House meeting on Thursday, Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell \u201cstressed that negotiations on immigration should be held separately on a different track, and not as part of the government funding bill.\u201dBut Democrats want to use the negotiations this month to reach an agreement on the issue, and they have the power to block a spending measure in the Senate. Democratic votes could also be needed to pass a spending measure in the House if enough Republicans break ranks.Some Republicans share the Democrats\u2019 sense of urgency, as well. In a letter to Mr. Ryan this week, more than 30 House Republicans expressed support for passing a legislative solution on DACA by the year\u2019s end.\u201cReaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients before the holidays is the right thing to do,\u201d they wrote.Hours before the vote on the stopgap measure on Thursday, Ms. Pelosi held back from threatening to shut down the government over the issue, telling reporters, \u201cDemocrats are not willing to shut government down.\u201dBut she also made clear that she wished to see a swift resolution. \u201cWe will not leave here without a DACA fix,\u201d she said.Michael D.

{"Headline": "Hunt Elephants to Save Them? Some Countries See No Other Choice", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States Fish and Wildlife Service last month moved to allow hunters to bring home trophies from elephants killed in Zimbabwe and Zambia. Safe to say, few conservationists saw it coming.In a 39-page report, the agency cited Zimbabwe\u2019s progress in creating a sound management plan for its 82,000 elephants and evidence that hunting revenue is in fact reinvested into conservation. Well-managed trophy hunting \u201cwould not have an adverse effect on the species, but can further efforts to conserve the species in the wild,\u201d the agency concluded.The announcement, which would have turned back an elephant-trophy prohibition instituted during the Obama administration, was met with praise from pro-hunting groups, like the National Rifle Association and Safari Club International, and criticism from animal-rights advocates on all sides of the political spectrum.Unexpectedly, President Trump intervened on Twitter, saying that the trophy decision would be delayed \u201cuntil such time as I review all conservation facts.\u201d Two days later, the president referred to trophy hunting as a \u201chorror show\u201d and cast doubts on its effectiveness for helping conservation of elephants and other species. An updated decision, the president added, was still pending.Whether the proceeds from big-game hunting should be used to protect threatened and endangered species is a difficult question to answer. In some areas, including in Namibia and Zimbabwe, the strategy has helped revive wildlife populations. In others, including Tanzania, hunting has fed corruption and decimated species.Many conservationists \u201chave been bullied into silence\u201d on the subject of hunting, said Michael \u2019t Sas-Rolfes, a research fellow at Oxford University who studies wildlife trade.Yet many experts also believe that the proceeds from hunting are all that prevents many poor communities from turning against local wildlife.\u201cWhile the noise in the press is all about morals and entitled white men killing innocent animals to hang obnoxiously on their wall \u2014 all of which I agree with \u2014 this actually has very little to do with pragmatic conservation,\u201d said Brian Child, an ecologist at the University of Florida.\u201cLike everything else in life, it\u2019s all about the money \u2014 money to combat illegal wildlife trade, and money to prevent the much more serious problem of wildlife\u2019s replacement by the cow or the plow.\u201dCritics of big-game hunting seldom offer viable alternatives for the communities that rely on these funds to protect wildlife, Dr. Child said. Nor do the countries that issue trophy bans typically provide financial assistance sufficient to make up for the shortfall when hunting income goes away.Hunters pay $65,000 to $140,000 to hunt lions in Zimbabwe, for example; an elephant hunt can run $36,000 to $70,000. (The price would be higher were it not for the American trophy ban.)\u201cZimbabwe is on its knees because of economic downturn, yet the international community expects our poor country to look after elephants and lions when we can\u2019t even feed our nation,\u201d said Victor Muposhi, a zoologist at Chinhoyi University of Technology in Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe.\u201cNo one is coming to the table to say, \u2018Yes, we want you to stop this hunting, but here is a budget and an alternative plan you can follow instead.\u2019\u201dCalls for blanket bans, Dr. Muposhi continued, overlook the benefits that well-managed hunting programs can bring and gloss over the complexities of the industry and of conservation itself.\u201cI think one of the real problems in this whole debate is that people are looking for generalizations about trophy hunting, and there just are none,\u201d said Rosie Cooney, chair of the sustainable use and livelihoods specialist group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\u201cThere\u2019s great examples and terrible examples and ones we don\u2019t have a clue about \u2014 and everything in between.\u201dThose looking for the terrible examples will find no shortage of them.Benefits from those hunts usually did not reach those on the ground. The Maasai people in Tanzania\u2019s Serengeti region have repeatedly reported eviction from their lands by a luxury hunting and safari company operating with a special \u201cPresidential permit,\u201d Dr. Packer noted.The precise impacts of sport hunting in Tanzania have been almost impossible to measure, he pointed out, because independent scientists are frequently prevented from conducting research.\u201cThe African safari hunting industry is a business, and businesses don\u2019t want people interfering with their bottom line,\u201d Dr. Packer said. \u201cThe lack of transparency is a key problem.\u201dThe trophy hunting business \u201cbecomes very commercialized, and the profits are captured by elites,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can also end up with trophy hunting serving as a cover for trafficking.\u201dBut in places where hunting is strictly regulated and corruption is minimal, it can be an integral tool for conservation, Dr. Felbab-Brown added. Ideally, science-based quotas and age and gender limits ensure that wildlife populations are not decimated, while funds are channeled back to communities acting as custodians.Even where this conservation strategy seems to work, however, some critics question the contradiction inherent in hunting threatened and endangered species.\u201cAny trophy hunting of an endangered species is by definition unsustainable, as it cannot sufficiently contribute to the survival of the species to justify removing individuals from the population,\u201d said Elly Pepper, a deputy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.Most legal trophy hunting for elephants occurs in southern Africa, in countries like Namibia and South Africa. The region accounts for nearly 40 percent of the continent\u2019s 415,000 elephants, according to data presented last week at a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in Geneva.Relatively speaking, legal elephant hunting casualties in those five countries is minuscule, ranging from 0.01 to 0.23 percent of their respective populations in 2015.Casualties from hunting \u201care really low, but they provide crucial benefits for rural communities and conservation,\u201d said Marco Pani, a wildlife management consultant who has studied Zimbabwe\u2019s elephant population.In a recent survey of elephants in Zimbabwe\u2019s hunting-dependent areas, Mr. Pani found that the country could lose a quarter of its elephant population should hunting be completely halted.If managed well, Dr. Cooney said, hunting finances landholders and communities, providing a crucial incentive for people not only to tolerate potentially dangerous wildlife but to protect it.In Zimbabwe\u2019s Campfire communities \u2014 which are equivalent in size to the country\u2019s strictly protected national parks, but reliant on trophy hunting \u2014 elephants destroyed over 17,000 acres of crops from 2010 to 2015. Along with other animals, elephants have killed 139 community members since 2010.Lions, likewise, killed four people in Mozambique in 2016, not to mention 220 cows. Tolerance for wildlife quickly wanes if animals cease to bring benefits \u2014 a growing threat in Zimbabwe, Dr. Muposhi said.Elephant hunts are still legal there, but leaving behind the animal\u2019s tusks is a deal-breaker for most big-game enthusiasts. After the 2014 trophy ban, 108 of 189 American hunters canceled their trips.The Campfire program\u2019s annual income dropped to $1.7 million from $2.2 million; private landowners reported similar losses. Zimbabwe\u2019s Parks and Wildlife Management Authority derives about 20 percent of its funding from hunting fees, over half of which traditionally comes from American hunters.\u201cAll of Zimbabwe\u2019s hunting areas are surrounded by communities who are hungry for agricultural land,\u201d Dr. Muposhi said. \u201cIf people see that elephants and lions no longer have value, they\u2019ll kill all the animals and let their cattle use the land currently set aside for wildlife.\u201dSome argue that photographic tourism can make up for these losses, but Dr. Muposhi disagrees.Before the trophy suspension, hunters were undeterred by Zimbabwe\u2019s political turmoil. But tourism over all suffered a decade-long decline.Hunters also tend to relish the chance to spend three weeks or more in rugged wilderness lacking in roads, cellphone service and treated water. Tourists on photographic safaris, on the other hand, \u201care soft people,\u201d Dr. Muposhi said.\u201cThey expect to sleep in a nice bed in a nice lodge where there\u2019s no mosquitoes and there\u2019s electricity and pure water.\u201dThat\u2019s why transforming hunting areas into destinations that appeal to conventional tourists often requires prohibitively expensive investment in infrastructure and marketing.Communities in Botswana are now struggling with such a transition. In 2013, President Ian Khama issued a national hunting moratorium, accompanied by an order to convert hunting operations \u2014 many located in featureless, remote areas \u2014 into photographic safaris.Hunting operators also stopped maintaining artificial water holes for wildlife, so elephants, lions, leopards and other species moved into riverbank areas where crops are grown, leading to an uptick in killings.\u201cWe don\u2019t know the number of predators now being indiscriminately killed by farmers and villagers, but we do know it\u2019s much higher than the hunting quota ever allocated,\u201d said Debbie Peake, a longtime advocate of hunting and conservation in Botswana.Although no credible figures exist for how much trophy hunting brings to the continent overall, critics often write off hunting\u2019s contribution in comparison to traditional tourism.\u201cThere is an enormous wildlife watching industry in Africa, while trophy hunters are in the low thousands,\u201d said Wayne Pacelle, president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States.\u201cTrophy hunting generates money, yes, but the number of dollars is so small compared with wildlife watching that it just doesn\u2019t compare.\u201dBut in parts of Botswana and elsewhere, big-game hunting can make or break conservation efforts.\u201cThe macro argument about however many millions hunting brings into the country misses the point,\u201d Mr. \u2019t Sas-Rolfes said. \u201cWhat is relevant is what would happen at the micro level if you removed hunting.\u201d\u201cMy sense is the damage would be quite significant,\u201d he added.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the wrong thing right now,\u201d said Dan Ashe, president of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and former director of the Fish and Wildlife Service.\u201cTrophy hunting is not the issue. We should be focused on wildlife trafficking and the broader plight of elephants.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harvey Weinstein Is My Monster Too", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "For years, he was my monster.This fall, I was approached by reporters, through different sources, including my dear friend Ashley Judd, to speak about an episode in my life that, although painful, I thought I had made peace with.I had brainwashed myself into thinking that it was over and that I had survived; I hid from the responsibility to speak out with the excuse that enough people were already involved in shining a light on my monster. I didn\u2019t consider my voice important, nor did I think it would make a difference.When so many women came forward to describe what Harvey had done to them, I had to confront my cowardice and humbly accept that my story, as important as it was to me, was nothing but a drop in an ocean of sorrow and confusion. I felt that by now nobody would care about my pain \u2014 maybe this was an effect of the many times I was told, especially by Harvey, that I was nobody.We are finally becoming conscious of a vice that has been socially accepted and has insulted and humiliated millions of girls like me, for in every woman there is a girl. I am inspired by those who had the courage to speak out, especially in a society that elected a president who has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than a dozen women and whom we have all heard make a statement about how a man in power can do anything he wants to women.Well, not anymore.In the 14 years that I stumbled from schoolgirl to Mexican soap star to an extra in a few American films to catching a couple of lucky breaks in \u201cDesperado\u201d and \u201cFools Rush In,\u201d Harvey Weinstein had become the wizard of a new wave of cinema that took original content into the mainstream. At the same time, it was unimaginable for a Mexican actress to aspire to a place in Hollywood. And even though I had proven them wrong, I was still a nobody.One of the forces that gave me the determination to pursue my career was the story of Frida Kahlo, who in the golden age of the Mexican muralists would do small intimate paintings that everybody looked down on. She had the courage to express herself while disregarding skepticism. My greatest ambition was to tell her story. It became my mission to portray the life of this extraordinary artist and to show my native Mexico in a way that combated stereotypes.The Weinstein empire, which was then Miramax, had become synonymous with quality, sophistication and risk taking \u2014 a haven for artists who were complex and defiant. It was everything that Frida was to me and everything I aspired to be.I had started a journey to produce the film with a different company, but I fought to get it back to take it to Harvey.I knew him a little bit through my relationship with the director Robert Rodriguez and the producer Elizabeth Avellan, who was then his wife, with whom I had done several films and who had taken me under their wing. All I knew of Harvey at the time was that he had a remarkable intellect, he was a loyal friend and a family man.Knowing what I know now, I wonder if it wasn\u2019t my friendship with them \u2014 and Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney \u2014 that saved me from being raped.The deal we made initially was that Harvey would pay for the rights of work I had already developed. As an actress, I would be paid the minimum Screen Actors Guild scale plus 10 percent. As a producer, I would receive a credit that would not yet be defined, but no payment, which was not that rare for a female producer in the \u201990s. He also demanded a signed deal for me to do several other films with Miramax, which I thought would cement my status as a leading lady.Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.I did not care about the money; I was so excited to work with him and that company. In my na\u00efvet\u00e9, I thought my dream had come true. He had validated the last 14 years of my life. He had taken a chance on me \u2014 a nobody. He had said yes.Little did I know it would become my turn to say no.No to opening the door to him at all hours of the night, hotel after hotel, location after location, where he would show up unexpectedly, including one location where I was doing a movie he wasn\u2019t even involved with.No to me taking a shower with him.No to letting him watch me take a shower.No to letting him give me a massage.No to letting a naked friend of his give me a massage.No to letting him give me oral sex.No to my getting naked with another woman.No, no, no, no, no \u2026And with every refusal came Harvey\u2019s Machiavellian rage.I don\u2019t think he hated anything more than the word \u201cno.\u201d The absurdity of his demands went from getting a furious call in the middle of the night asking me to fire my agent for a fight he was having with him about a different movie with a different client to physically dragging me out of the opening gala of the Venice Film Festival, which was in honor of \u201cFrida,\u201d so I could hang out at his private party with him and some women I thought were models but I was told later were high-priced prostitutes.The range of his persuasion tactics went from sweet-talking me to that one time when, in an attack of fury, he said the terrifying words, \u201cI will kill you, don\u2019t think I can\u2019t.\u201dWhen he was finally convinced that I was not going to earn the movie the way he had expected, he told me he had offered my role and my script with my years of research to another actress.In his eyes, I was not an artist. I wasn\u2019t even a person. I was a thing: not a nobody, but a body.At that point, I had to resort to using lawyers, not by pursuing a sexual harassment case, but by claiming \u201cbad faith,\u201d as I had worked so hard on a movie that he was not intending to make or sell back to me. I tried to get it out of his company.He claimed that my name as an actress was not big enough and that I was incompetent as a producer, but to clear himself legally, as I understood it, he gave me a list of impossible tasks with a tight deadline:1. Get a rewrite of the script, with no additional payment.2. Raise $10 million to finance the film.3. Attach an A-list director.4. Cast four of the smaller roles with prominent actors.The latest news and insights on the sexual harassment and misconduct scandals roiling society.Much to everyone\u2019s amazement, not least my own, I delivered, thanks to a phalanx of angels who came to my rescue, including Edward Norton, who beautifully rewrote the script several times and appallingly never got credit, and my friend Margaret Perenchio, a first-time producer, who put up the money. The brilliant Julie Taymor agreed to direct, and from then on she became my rock. For the other roles, I recruited my friends Antonio Banderas, Edward Norton and my dear Ashley Judd. To this day, I don\u2019t know how I convinced Geoffrey Rush, whom I barely knew at the time.Now Harvey Weinstein was not only rejected but also about to do a movie he did not want to do.Ironically, once we started filming, the sexual harassment stopped but the rage escalated. We paid the price for standing up to him nearly every day of shooting. Once, in an interview he said Julie and I were the biggest ball busters he had ever encountered, which we took as a compliment.Halfway through shooting, Harvey turned up on set and complained about Frida\u2019s \u201cunibrow.\u201d He insisted that I eliminate the limp and berated my performance. Then he asked everyone in the room to step out except for me. He told me that the only thing I had going for me was my sex appeal and that there was none of that in this movie. So he told me he was going to shut down the film because no one would want to see me in that role.It was soul crushing because, I confess, lost in the fog of a sort of Stockholm syndrome, I wanted him to see me as an artist: not only as a capable actress but also as somebody who could identify a compelling story and had the vision to tell it in an original way.I was hoping he would acknowledge me as a producer, who on top of delivering his list of demands shepherded the script and obtained the permits to use the paintings. I had negotiated with the Mexican government, and with whomever I had to, to get locations that had never been given to anyone in the past \u2014 including Frida Kahlo\u2019s houses and the murals of Kahlo\u2019s husband, Diego Rivera, among others.But all of this seemed to have no value. The only thing he noticed was that I was not sexy in the movie. He made me doubt if I was any good as an actress, but he never succeeded in making me think that the film was not worth making.He offered me one option to continue. He would let me finish the film if I agreed to do a sex scene with another woman. And he demanded full-frontal nudity.He had been constantly asking for more skin, for more sex. Once before, Julie Taymor got him to settle for a tango ending in a kiss instead of the lovemaking scene he wanted us to shoot between the character Tina Modotti, played by Ashley Judd, and Frida.But this time, it was clear to me he would never let me finish this movie without him having his fantasy one way or another. There was no room for negotiation.I had to say yes. By now so many years of my life had gone into this film. We were about five weeks into shooting, and I had convinced so many talented people to participate. How could I let their magnificent work go to waste?I had asked for so many favors, I felt an immense pressure to deliver and a deep sense of gratitude for all those who did believe in me and followed me into this madness. So I agreed to do the senseless scene.I arrived on the set the day we were to shoot the scene that I believed would save the movie. And for the first and last time in my career, I had a nervous breakdown: My body began to shake uncontrollably, my breath was short and I began to cry and cry, unable to stop, as if I were throwing up tears.Since those around me had no knowledge of my history of Harvey, they were very surprised by my struggle that morning. It was not because I would be naked with another woman. It was because I would be naked with her for Harvey Weinstein. But I could not tell them then.My mind understood that I had to do it, but my body wouldn\u2019t stop crying and convulsing. At that point, I started throwing up while a set frozen still waited to shoot. I had to take a tranquilizer, which eventually stopped the crying but made the vomiting worse. As you can imagine, this was not sexy, but it was the only way I could get through the scene.By the time the filming of the movie was over, I was so emotionally distraught that I had to distance myself during the postproduction.When Harvey saw the cut film, he said it was not good enough for a theatrical release and that he would send it straight to video.This time Julie had to fight him without me and got him to agree to release the film in one movie theater in New York if we tested it to an audience and we scored at least an 80.Less than 10 percent of films achieve that score on a first screening.I didn\u2019t go to the test. I anxiously awaited to receive the news. The film scored 85.And again, I heard Harvey raged. In the lobby of a theater after the screening, he screamed at Julie. He balled up one of the scorecards and threw it at her. It bounced off her nose. Her partner, the film\u2019s composer Elliot Goldenthal, stepped in, and Harvey physically threatened him.Once he calmed down, I found the strength to call Harvey to ask him also to open the movie in a theater in Los Angeles, which made a total of two theaters. And without much ado, he gave me that. I have to say sometimes he was kind, fun and witty \u2014 and that was part of the problem: You just never knew which Harvey you were going to get.Months later, in October 2002, this film, about my hero and inspiration \u2014 this Mexican artist who never truly got acknowledged in her time with her limp and her unibrow, this film that Harvey never wanted to do, gave him a box office success that no one could have predicted, and despite his lack of support, added six Academy Award nominations to his collection, including best actress.Even though \u201cFrida\u201d eventually won him two Oscars, I still didn\u2019t see any joy. He never offered me a starring role in a movie again. The films that I was obliged to do under my original deal with Miramax were all minor supporting roles.Years later, when I ran into him at an event, he pulled me aside and told me he had stopped smoking and he had had a heart attack. He said he\u2019d fallen in love and married Georgina Chapman, and that he was a changed man. Finally, he said to me: \u201cYou did well with \u2018Frida\u2019; we did a beautiful movie.\u201dI believed him. Harvey would never know how much those words meant to me. He also would never know how much he hurt me. I never showed Harvey how terrified I was of him. When I saw him socially, I\u2019d smile and try to remember the good things about him, telling myself that I went to war and I won.But why do so many of us, as female artists, have to go to war to tell our stories when we have so much to offer? Why do we have to fight tooth and nail to maintain our dignity?I think it is because we, as women, have been devalued artistically to an indecent state, to the point where the film industry stopped making an effort to find out what female audiences wanted to see and what stories we wanted to tell.Until there is equality in our industry, with men and women having the same value in every aspect of it, our community will continue to be a fertile ground for predators.I am grateful for everyone who is listening to our experiences. I hope that adding my voice to the chorus of those who are finally speaking out will shed light on why it is so difficult, and why so many of us have waited so long. Men sexually harassed because they could. Women are talking today because, in this new era, we finally can.Oct. 6, 2017Salma Hayek (@salmahayek) is an actor and producer.Produced by Jessia Ma, developed by Danny DebeliusAdvertisement"}

Despite rapid strides among developing economies like China and India, which have been closing the income gap with the world\u2019s richer nations, growing inequality within almost every country will drive a further concentration of income around the globe.Nowhere has the distribution of the pie become more equitable. In China, 15 percent of the income growth since 1980 flowed to the richest 1 percent of Chinese while 13 percent flowed to the bottom half. Even in egalitarian, social-democratic Europe, 1-percenters got 18 percent of the growth in the period. The bottom half got 14 percent. And among the more unequal regions of the world \u2014 the United States, say, or Russia \u2014 income disparities are reaching levels not before seen in modern history: The bottom half of Americans captured only 3 percent of total growth since 1980. The income of the bottom half of Russians actually shrank.And yet, a careful examination of the data suggests there is nothing inevitable about untrammelled inequality. Take China and India, developing countries of billion-plus populations playing catch-up to pull themselves out of poverty. Incomes have become much more concentrated in both. But China\u2019s economic strategy has delivered much more growth at a lower cost in terms of economic disparity. Comparing Europe with the United States and Canada offers similar contrasts.Share of national income%30U.S. and CanadaAfrica25BOTTOM 50%20.2%19.9%201512.6%12.1%10TOP 1%5\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916%30ChinaEurope2519.9%2014.8%1513.9%12.5%105\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916Share of national income30%United Statesand CanadaIndiaEuropeChina25BOTTOM 50PERCENT21.7%20.2%19.9%2014.8%1514.9%13.9%12.6%12.5%10TOP 1PERCENT5\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916Share of national income%30ChinaUnited States and CanadaEuropeIndia2521.7%BOTTOM 50PERCENT20.2%19.9%2014.8%1514.9%13.9%12.6%12.5%10TOP 1PERCENT5\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916Policy, it turns out, matters. More aggressive redistribution through taxes and transfers has spared Europe from the acute disparities that Americans have grown used to.

Policy choices \u2014 about taxes and education, employment rules and finance regulations \u2014 will play a big role in shaping how countries around the world distribute the spoils of growth in the future. But the most powerful force driving the distribution of income on a worldwide scale will be raw economic growth: if economic catch-up by developing nations shrinks the income gap between rich and poor countries faster than inequality increases inside each country, the global disparity of income will narrow.The question is, how fast can developing countries grow in the future? The answer, unfortunately, is not fast enough. If China\u2019s furious economic growth over the last couple of decades was not enough to bring about a more equitable distribution of income on a global scale, it seems hard to imagine the kind of economic miracle that could shrink the worldwide income gap.Share of population within income groups in:1990100%90United Statesand CanadaAfrica8070Share of population60ChinaRussiaEurope5040MiddleEast30Other Asia20LatinAmericaIndia10011020304050607080909999.999.9999.999Global income groupsHigher income(percentiles)Top 1 percent2016100%United Statesand Canada90Africa80LatinAmerica70Share of populationEurope60Russia50MiddleEast40China3020Other AsiaIndia10011020304050607080909999.999.9999.999Global income groupsHigher income(percentiles)Top 1 percentShare of population within income groups in:1990100%100%9090AfricaUnited Statesand Canada80807070Share ofpopulation6060ChinaRussiaEurope50504040MiddleEast(Withineachglobalincomegroup)3030Other Asia2020LatinAmericaIndia10100011020304050607080909999.999.9999.999Higher incomeBottom 50 percentTop 1 percentGlobal income percentiles2016100%100%9090United Statesand CanadaAfrica8080LatinAmerica7070Share ofpopulation6060EuropeRussia5050MiddleEast4040China(Withineachglobalincomegroup)30302020IndiaOther Asia10100011020304050607080909999.999.9999.999Higher incomeBottom 50 percentTop 1 percentGlobal income percentilesChina\u2019s economic miracle was an unprecedented feat: in one generation, an unproductive communist nation of farmers transformed itself into a manufacturing export colossus, a giant of capitalism. Since 1980, its share of the world\u2019s income has grown to 19 percent from 3 percent. Its income per person has grown almost 15 times as fast as that of the United States and Canada, and almost 19 times as fast as that of the European Union \u2014 to 90 percent of the world average, from 15 percent. Once at the bottom of the world\u2019s income distribution, Chinese are now much more broadly represented across the spectrum of the world\u2019s income.China\u2019s rising income was pretty much the only force pushing for a more equitable share of the spoils of growth, holding world inequality down even as the incomes of the world\u2019s biggest earners surged ahead and workers in the industrialized world mostly got stuck. And yet it wasn\u2019t enough.As China has become richer and its growth has slowed, its impact on how the world\u2019s income pie is sliced is likely to be mixed: Once the income of the average Chinese exceeds the world average, China's fast growth will start adding to inequality, rather than mitigating it. And it seems implausible that India and sub-Saharan Africa, today at the bottom of the world\u2019s income distribution, will experience anything in the coming three decades like what China experienced in the last three.+240%+220Income growth1980 to 2016+200+180Real income growthper adultby percentileworldwide+160+140+120+100+80+60+40+2001020304050607080909999.999.99Higher incomeBottom 50percent99.999Global incomepercentilesTop 1percent+240%Income growth1980 to 2016+220+200Real income growth per adultby percentile worldwide+180Top 1 percentcaptured 27 percentof total growthBottom 50 percentcaptured 12 percentof total growth+160+140+120+100+80+60+40+2001020304050607080909999.999.9999.999Higher incomeBottom 50 percentGlobal income percentilesTop 1 percent+240%+220Income growth1980 to 2016+200Real income growth per adultby percentile worldwide+180Top 1 percent captured27 percent of total growthBottom 50 percent captured12 percent of total growth+160+140+120+100+80+60+40+2001020304050607080909999.999.9999.999Higher incomeBottom 50 percentGlobal income percentilesTop 1 percentWill poor countries make sufficient progress relative to their rich peers to bring more balance to the distribution of global income?

Say countries decide to push vigorously back against inequality \u2014 as vigorously as the European Union pushed in the 36 years after 1980. In that case, the world\u2019s income gap would even shrink a little: by 2050, the bottom half would get 13 percent of the pie; the share of the top 1 percent would shrink to 19 percent of the world\u2019s income.What we probably don\u2019t want the world to do is follow the trajectory of inequality in the United States. If it were to do that, by 2050 the few at the top of the pyramid would be drawing 28 percent of global income. The bottom half would get only about 6 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "James O\u2019Keefe, Practitioner of the Sting, Has an Ally in Trump", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Days after Donald J. Trump launched his presidential campaign in June 2015, James O\u2019Keefe, the conservative disrupter famous for trying to use secret recordings to embarrass liberals and journalists, visited Trump Tower and gave Mr. Trump a preview of his latest hidden camera video intended to undermine Hillary Clinton.In fact, the elite conservative donor class has always mostly kept its distance \u2014 at least publicly \u2014 from Project Veritas. The primary funding vehicles steered by the billionaire conservative brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, for instance, have refused entreaties from Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s allies to support his groups, said people familiar with the requests.Megadonors interested in watchdogging the media have instead gravitated to more cautious groups like Mr. Bozell\u2019s Media Research Center. It has raised $87 million over the last half-dozen years \u2014 five times more than Project Veritas during that span, according to tax filings. The Media Research Center regularly collects six- and seven-figure checks from some of the right\u2019s leading donors, including the families of the New York hedge fund trader Robert Mercer and the Amway co-founder Richard DeVos.It is not possible to comprehensively assess Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s sources of funding, since the Veritas groups are registered under sections of the tax code that do not require public disclosure of donors. But sporadic disclosures and interviews paint a picture of a support base including mostly libertarian or anti-establishment donors, as well as so-called donor-advised funds that allow philanthropists to donate without fingerprints to nonprofits.\u201cPeople should be challenged to make sure that they\u2019re doing things right, but not to the point of deception or of defaming,\u201d said the California agribusiness entrepreneur Chris Rufer, who has donated thousands of dollars from his personal and foundation accounts to Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s group.Privately, though, he seemed bothered by the backlash. He wrote a personal letter to Mr. Bozell, a longtime critic, \u201casking him to clarify his intentions.\u201d Mr. Bozell said he responded \u201cI\u2019m all in favor of undercover journalism to expose fraud, corruption and the like,\u201d but added, \u201cThat\u2019s not what you did this time. You presented a fraudulent accusation and tried to get The Washington Post to fall for it.\u201dIn an interview this week, Mr. O\u2019Keefe said his goal was not to get The Post to run an inaccurate story, but rather \u201cto get a meeting, to gain access, to expose their political bias and agenda in that meeting. Nothing more.\u201dBut Mr. O\u2019Keefe insisted that there had been no negative effect among his donors and that \u201cthis type of thing has not made them queasy.\u201d He claimed that since the botched sting was exposed, donors motivated by distrust of the media have contributed upward of $1 million to Project Veritas.\u201cThey realize that this is an existential fight, and that we are over the target, and it propels them to support us even more,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Keefe said.Rebecca Walter Dunn, whose family and its libertarian-leaning foundation have donated at least $110,000 to Project Veritas, according to tax filings, said the group does \u201can exceptional job of holding the media and other institutions accountable. For that reason, we will continue to support his work.\u201d Asked about the Post sting, she said, \u201cOur focus should not be on the methods or techniques that Project Veritas employs, but rather on the truths or deceptions that they expose.\u201dIt would not be the first time that supporters of Mr. O\u2019Keefe, 33, have stuck with him after an embarrassing setback.And he has Mr. Trump.Mr. O\u2019Keefe declined to elaborate on his relationship with the president, except to say that he details their interactions in a coming book called \u201cAmerican Pravda: My Fight for Truth in the Era of Fake News.\u201d The White House also declined to comment.According to Sam Nunberg, a former adviser to Mr. Trump, the men first met in 2013, when Mr. Trump, who was then working to cultivate relationships with conservatives, summoned Mr. O\u2019Keefe to Trump Tower.Mr. Trump praised his undercover sting videos and resilience, said he was \u201ca good-looking guy\u201d and offered to stay in touch, said Mr. Nunberg, who arranged the meeting. \u201cHe was genuinely impressed that James built this whole operation by himself.\u201dRecalling that briefing, Mr. O\u2019Keefe said, \u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s serving the Veritas mission, it\u2019s serving the Veritas vision.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s just a vision to bring information straight to the people \u2014 bypassing and circumventing the mainstream media \u2014 in that we have something in common.\u201dKitty Bennett and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Investigates Lafarge Executives for Terrorist Financing", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The former chief executive of LafargeHolcim, the world\u2019s largest cement maker, and five other top officials are being formally investigated as part of a government inquiry into whether the company helped finance the Islamic State militant group and other armed factions while operating a factory in Syria.The expanding investigation underscores the difficulty of doing business in war-torn regions, a challenge faced by companies around the world, especially those in the energy and industrial sectors.Lafarge, a sprawling French multinational with operations in 80 countries, has said that its employees were motivated to keep the Syrian plant running by a \u201ccan-do\u201d approach. But critics have accused the company of trying to maintain profitability and a presence there, despite the growing danger to its employees.Investigators questioned Eric Olsen, the former chief executive, on Thursday, a day after he was taken into police custody. They are trying to determine whether he and other company managers placed the lives of workers at the cement factory, in northern Syria, in danger during a civil war.Police raided the Lafarge headquarters in Paris and an office in Brussels last month, seizing computers and seeking other information related to the case.Lafarge began producing cement for the Syrian market in 2010 after investing more than 600 million euros, or $708 million at current exchange rates, to refurbish a factory in Jalabiyeh, a town near the Turkish border. The plant had created hundreds of jobs for local residents, generated thousands of tons of cement every day and supported other businesses nearby.But the security situation in Syria began to deteriorate in 2011 as a civil war broke out after protests against Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government. Multinational companies began to pull out of Syria one by one, except for Lafarge.In the two years that followed, the area near the factory was occupied by a succession of armed groups, including the Al Qaeda affiliate in Syria, the Al Nusra Front. In April 2013, ISIS infiltrated Syria and began advancing across the territory.In 2012, Lafarge\u2019s local managers started using intermediaries to pay the armed groups to ease the passage of employees and suppliers, the company\u2019s internal inquiry found. Lafarge has said it saw little choice if it wanted to keep its operations running, and sought to avoid direct contact with the groups to minimize potential risks that could arise with the Syrian government or other militants.\u201cVery simply, chaos reigned and it was the task of local management to ensure that the intermediaries did whatever was necessary to secure its supply chain and the free movement of its employees,\u201d the company said in its statement.As part of their investigation, French judges are also examining charges brought by a French organization, Sherpa, on behalf of 11 employees. They claim the company endangered their lives by placing them in a high-risk situation as the Islamic State advanced.Two other former executives from Lafarge\u2019s Paris headquarters were placed under investigation this week: Bruno Lafont, the company\u2019s chief executive from 2007 to 2015, and Christian Herrault, the former director general, who was responsible for Lafarge\u2019s operations in Syria and other countries.Last week, three former managers of Lafarge\u2019s Syrian operations were placed under formal investigation over questions about funds paid to factions that controlled the area where the cement plant was located. Those being investigated include Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Jolibois, the plant\u2019s director from 2014 to 2016; Bruno Pescheux, who oversaw the plant from 2009 to 2014; and Jean-Claude Veillard, Lafarge\u2019s former security director based in Paris.The case is expected to take months, if not years, to conclude.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Afghan President Under Fire as Critics Chafe at Overdue Vote", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Over the past year, as Afghanistan\u2019s strained power-sharing government struggled in the face of intense criticism, Western officials repeatedly stepped in to urge patience.American and European diplomats shuttled to the blast-wall-protected villas of the country\u2019s political elite, asking them to give President Ashraf Ghani some space to keep pursuing the reforms that had rankled so many. In return, Mr. Ghani would finally deliver parliamentary elections (already delayed by two years) before the next presidential vote.But the year is closing with little progress toward the elections, still scheduled for next July, although now almost certain not to occur then. Mr. Ghani\u2019s critics \u2014 and there are more than ever \u2014 are losing patience, turning to public demonstrations, issuing ultimatums or threats, and joining in calls for a nationwide, traditional referendum on his authority.The Afghan president, in return, has reacted in ways that many Western officials see as panicked. He has ordered sudden corruption investigations against critics, barred government employees from joining demonstrations and been accused of grounding the flight of a powerful northern governor to keep him from joining an opposition meeting.One fear is that the rising factional animosity could lead to open mutiny \u2014 in the middle of a raging war against the Taliban and Islamic State loyalists \u2014 against a government that Western officials have gone all out to hold together.Mohammed Umer Daudzai, a former interior minister who is now part of one of the larger opposition groups, said the lack of progress on elections was a symptom of a broader problem: the government\u2019s shrinking political base.\u201cWhen he started as president, his political base was formed by 54 political groups that were meeting on a weekly basis to support the president. I doubt if three of the 54 are left with him,\u201d Mr. Daudzai said. \u201cThey have lost their political base, they have lost their political credibility, and that\u2019s very bad because this country is built on political consensus.\u201dMany Western diplomats in Kabul are frustrated by Mr. Ghani\u2019s lack of progress on elections, with some even beginning to question whether he ever intended to hold them. But they are divided about how ominous the situation is.So far, the political opposition is really a host of smaller ones: a wide range of coalitions made up of former warlords, former government ministers and members of Parliament united by little more than what they see as Mr. Ghani\u2019s political mismanagement and his inability to deliver elections.Some other groups are very critical of Mr. Ghani but have agreed to show restraint as long as he delivers elections and electoral reforms. In recent weeks, many of those groups have said that they do not believe Mr. Ghani is serious about holding the vote next year, raising the possibility that they could join Mr. Karzai\u2019s move for a loya jirga.Some of Mr. Ghani\u2019s aides lament that their technocratic leader has struggled to balance the demands of keeping political constituencies at his side while prioritizing his reform agenda. He is often occupied for hours leading meetings on issues that a subordinate could have handled.Other advisers say that the president is determined to make elections happen, but that he is a victim of deep political divisions, undermined at every turn by a Parliament that has stalled his legislation and cabinet choices.\u201cThe president knows it has taken a longer time on the elections,\u201d said Nader Nadery, a senior adviser to Mr. Ghani. \u201cWhen he has tried to use his convening powers to move election issues, he is told the perception is he is too close to the process and he is interfering. When he has backed off and let the process do its work, they say he doesn\u2019t have the political will to hold elections.\u201dFor American officials, the pressure mounting on Mr. Ghani has been particularly awkward: Some of their closest Afghan allies over the years, still essential to the military campaign, are rallying against a political leadership in Kabul that is perceived to be protected by the Americans. (Mr. Ghani shares half of the cabinet posts with his coalition partner, Abdullah Abdullah, who has the title chief executive. Yet the president is at the receiving end of most of the pressure.)The largest recent rally against Mr. Ghani was organized in Kandahar Province on Dec. 2. The invitation list included more than 70 members of Parliament, former governors and cabinet ministers, and some local elders. Many in the front row had been vocal supporters of Mr. Ghani, helping elect him to office.A spokesman for General Nicholson, Navy Capt. Tom Gresback, would not comment on the nature of his \u201cmany engagements across Afghanistan,\u201d but said that the commander encourages Afghan police and military leaders to remain apolitical.One of the key participants there was supposed to be Atta Mohammed Noor, a former warlord who remains at the helm of Balkh Province, a prosperous area in the north, despite Mr. Ghani\u2019s attempts to oust him. As Mr. Noor and dozens of other northern leadership figures prepared to fly to Kandahar, their plane was refused permission to take off.\u201cThe leadership of the government did not give us permission to go to Kandahar,\u201d Mr. Noor said. \u201cThis is an unlawful, unethical and inhumane action. I hope they come to their senses.\u201dIn Kandahar, the rally was delayed for a second time in the hopes that Mr. Noor would make it.\u201cWe are giving this government a clear warning: that if Mr. Noor is not given permission to fly within 12 hours, the consequence will be very bad,\u201d said Humayoon Humayoon, the deputy speaker of Parliament and one of the rally leaders who used to strongly support Mr. Ghani. \u201cThis the death of democracy, for which we have given a lot of sacrifices. We cannot live in the presence of a dictator president.\u201dWhen the rally finally happened, without Mr. Noor, it turned out to be smaller than billed.Mr. Ghani\u2019s advisers have seized on that, insisting that threats of mobilization against the president are mostly bluffing. They see much of the political opposition as the old patronage networks halting Mr. Ghani\u2019s reform efforts to protect their own fortunes.Opposition leaders say that is precisely the kind of black-and-white thinking that has left the government struggling politically.Particularly important is the issue of a new voter list. Millions more voting cards are in circulation than the country\u2019s number of eligible voters. Cards have been issued in the names of Tom Cruise, Bruce Lee, Arnold (Schwarzenegger, known here by his first name alone) and, by some accounts, Britney Spears.Abdullah Ahmadzai, a former chief electoral officer of the election commission, said votes repeatedly unearthed some of Afghanistan\u2019s deepest social and political fracture lines, every time requiring heavy-handed Western intervention to find a way out. Yet there has been little success in working to ensure that the next election is less of a threat to stability.\u201cYou can\u2019t keep all the ambiguities there every time and still expect fair elections,\u201d Mr. Ahmadzai said.Jawad Sukhanyar, Fahim Abed and Fatima Faizie contributed reporting from Kabul, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frustrated U.S. Might Withhold $255 Million in Aid From Pakistan", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Americans demanded access to the man, but Pakistani officials rejected those requests, the latest disagreement in the increasingly dysfunctional relationship between the countries. Now, the Trump administration is strongly considering whether to withhold $255 million in aid that it had delayed sending to Islamabad, according to American officials, as a show of dissatisfaction with Pakistan\u2019s broader intransigence toward confronting the terrorist networks that operate there.The administration\u2019s internal debate over whether to deny Pakistan the money is a test of whether President Trump will deliver on his threat to punish Islamabad for failing to cooperate on counterterrorism operations. Relations between the United States and Pakistan, long vital for both, have chilled steadily since the president declared over the summer that Pakistan \u201cgives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence and terror.\u201dThe officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sensitive discussions, did not detail what conditions Pakistan would have to meet to receive the aid. It was not clear how the United States found out about the militant\u2019s arrest, but an American drone had been monitoring the kidnappers as they moved deeper into Pakistan.Pakistan, however, has few friends in Mr. Trump\u2019s National Security Council. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, served in Afghanistan, where he saw firsthand how Pakistan meddled in its neighbor\u2019s affairs. Lisa Curtis, the council\u2019s senior director for South and Central Asia, brought critical views about Pakistan from her previous post at the conservative Heritage Foundation.Such a step would be more punitive than withholding the $255 million in State Department assistance known as Foreign Military Financing, Mr. Haqqani said in an interview, because it would deprive Pakistan of access to military equipment. He said Pakistani officials were bracing for some kind of aid cutoff.Pakistan\u2019s military, he said, still views its accommodation of the Haqqani network as in its security interest. To overcome that, the Trump administration would have to pursue other, more punishing measures, either by imposing targeted sanctions on the government or removing it from the list of non-NATO allies.\u201cPakistan can withstand a cutoff in American aid,\u201d Mr. Haqqani said. \u201cIt would have to be followed by something else to make Pakistan believe that Mr. Trump means business.\u201dA State Department official said Pakistan\u2019s actions will ultimately determine the course of \u201csecurity assistance in the future.\u201d The official said conversations with Pakistan are continuing and declined to provide further comment.The Pakistani government did not respond to a message seeking comment.After Ms. Coleman, Mr. Boyle and their children were freed, the Pakistani military made no mention of the captured Haqqani operative. Instead, the military released a statement saying the operation\u2019s \u201csuccess underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan\u2019s continued commitment towards fighting this menace through cooperation between two forces against a common enemy.\u201dMr. Trump said it was \u201ca positive moment for our country\u2019s relationship with Pakistan.\u201dAnother American, Paul Overby, vanished in 2014 in Afghanistan. Mr. Overby was trying to interview the leader of the Haqqani network when he disappeared.Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the Pentagon\u2019s Central Command, which oversees Pakistan and Afghanistan, declined to provide any details on the Haqqani operative who was seized other than to say he was \u201cprobably pretty important\u201d and that any militants involved in hostage-taking were \u201csignificant.\u201dGeneral Votel would not say whether the Trump administration is considering withholding aid from Pakistan to prod Islamabad to improve its counterterrorism cooperation.\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to talk to Pakistan about this, and not try to communicate with them through public messaging,\u201d General Votel said in an interview.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The young Bobby Cannavale used to come to the city from Jersey with just enough money for the bus and maybe 10 extra bucks for a slice and a soda, and audition and audition and audition.\u201cI always wanted to make a living as an actor living in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cA New York actor. What\u2019s better than that?\u201dHe offered a tour of his new pile, a three-story 19th-century house in brownstone Brooklyn, which he and Ms. Byrne renovated and then moved into in the final moments of her pregnancy.In the early days, untrained (aside from church-group productions as a child), it was slow. \u201cI did so many acting jobs for nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in a play that opened on Christmas Eve above a police precinct on 54th Street. Three people showed up. One of them was an agent. It was my first agent.\u201dIn person he is gentle and accommodating \u2014 did I want a coffee? Something to eat? \u2014 not the tough he\u2019s often called to play. He settled onto a pink couch (the color scheme is, in the main, green and pink) in his living room to talk. \u201cI don\u2019t mind pink,\u201d he said. \u201cI can handle a pink couch.\u201dBut in his work, Mr. Cannavale has a boiling intensity his hangdog jowls and puppyish eyes belie. He was raised on the greats, worshiping Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in their primes. (His current co-stars: Mr. Pacino, Mr. De Niro.) He has a sly way of becoming the best part of whatever he\u2019s in, however good or bad it may be.\u201cThe thing that\u2019s so infectious about Bobby \u2014 you see it in his work and you see it in his life \u2014 is wherever he is is the best place ever,\u201d said the director and screenwriter Tom McCarthy (\u201cSpotlight\u201d), who wrote Mr. Cannavale\u2019s breakthrough film role in \u201cThe Station Agent\u201d for him. It allows him to elevate even what ought to be throwaway roles \u2014 Will\u2019s thick boyfriend in \u201cWill & Grace\u201d (Emmy No. 1), say \u2014 into something more.\u201cHe\u2019s entirely un-self-conscious,\u201d said Olivia Wilde, who played his wife on \u201cVinyl.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never trying to look cool, which holds back a surprising amount of people, I find. He\u2019s never trying to maintain some sense of control. He gives in completely. It allows the scenes to become really thrilling. You don\u2019t know where he\u2019s going to take it. He doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019s just very present.\u201dMaybe because his gift is his presence, he is even more at home, and more alive, on stage. He was a trembling tour de force in \u201cThe _______ With the Hat\u201d in 2011 (the full title is unprintable here), him and Chris Rock together on a Broadway stage. It led to his Emmy-winning role on \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d with Mr. Scorsese.\u201cHe\u2019s ferocious,\u201d said Ethan Hawke, a friend since they appeared together in \u201cHurlyburly\u201d in 2005. \u201cIt\u2019s a great combination when somebody is wildly intelligent with a wicked intellect who also works from their gut. He\u2019s just all in, wherever you find him.\u201dThis month, he is a hard-boiled \u201cHard Copy\u201d producer in \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d trailing Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly through their tabloid travesties. He is a glowering supervillain in \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,\u201d facing off with Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart for ownership of a mystical jewel. He is the voice of an animated bull in \u201cFerdinand.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m on the studio president\u2019s list: \u2018The movie\u2019s going to star Cannavale,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening.\u201dWith film and television, the ancillary calculus that drives projects forward \u2014 what does your name mean in foreign markets? Will your casting secure financing? \u2014 doesn\u2019t favor him. The variables that govern every element of its making don\u2019t interest Mr. Cannavale. And, unlike with a play, he has no sense of how good or bad it may be until it\u2019s out.\u201cIf I did, maybe \u2018Vinyl\u2019 would still be on the air,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I told you I wasn\u2019t really disappointed by that decision. It didn\u2019t hit me for a few months, and then it hit, and it hit hard.\u201dHe sighed.\u201cThis game is baseball,\u201d he said, leaning back on the couch. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to bat a thousand. We all have things that missed. You never know. You keep trying and trying. The best hitters are .300 hitters, right?\u201dAfter \u201cVinyl,\u201d he went to Sydney, Australia, to spend time with Ms. Byrne, who was performing there, and Rocco. (The two have been together since 2012.) He licked his wounds. Then came the call for \u201cThe Hairy Ape,\u201d and he threw himself into it and it brought him back from the brink.\u201cIt allowed me to feel like I was part of something again,\u201d Mr. Cannavale said. \u201cI felt like it was contributing to the culture. They don\u2019t all feel like that. Sometimes it\u2019s \u2018Snakes on a Plane.\u2019\u201dMr. Cannavale has also found himself navigating the tsunami of sexual harassment and abuse claims embroiling the entertainment industry.\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything until everybody else did. I think it was an extremely brave thing for her to do.\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to be quiet about this anymore. People can stand up and have their power, take back their lives. I support Jenny.\u201dThe widespread revelations of sexual misconduct dominating the news have changed the entire conversation for him and those in his orbit. \u201cIt is something that we have never really sat and talked about socially,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now I am. I feel so stupid. I\u2019m reading these accounts and really rethinking my behavior, my silence and all those things \u2014 it\u2019s a good thing, but it comes with a lot of regret.\u201dBack at the house, the baby had begun to cry. The next day, Mr. Cannavale would cook Thanksgiving dinner for the four of them; Jake, also an actor and now a sometime co-star, was elsewhere. Then they\u2019d head to Los Angeles, where Mr. Cannavale will soon begin shooting \u201cHomecoming,\u201d a new Amazon drama by Sam Esmail, the creator of \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d with Julia Roberts.The prospect of escaping the cold of the New York winter was appealing, but Mr. Cannavale has always preferred to live here, not in Los Angeles \u201cThe big business, Hollywood? I don\u2019t really work in that business,\u201d he said. \u201cI peripherally work in it, but I\u2019m not involved in it the way some people are.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 98.His son William said the cause was complications of a fall.But taking Betio proved far more difficult than the campaign\u2019s military planners had expected. Low tides, for one thing, made it nearly impossible for the boats to get to the beach to let Marines disembark.Mr. Cooper\u2019s boat, which made several runs ferrying Marines of the Second Division from ships offshore, became, like others, stranded on a coral reef. Marines were forced to wade ashore, making them easy targets for Japanese gunners, who were prepared for the assault.The American forces took the island in 76 hours, but the toll was brutal: About 1,000 Marines died, and 2,296 were wounded. The New York Times wrote, \u201cRiddled corpses form a ghastly fringe along the narrow white beaches where men of the Second Marine Division died for every foot of sand.\u201dTarawa was the first of six Pacific battles, including Iwo Jima, that Mr. Cooper participated in. But it was the one that never left him.Tarawa continued to anger him for years and caused nightmares; in one, he said, he dreamed he was falling deep underwater before encountering a young boy sitting on a submerged Sherman tank.His return to Tarawa for the documentary in 2008 brought back a flood of memories as he walked the beach where he had carried Marines into ferocious Japanese crossfire.\u201cI smell the stench of those bodies rotting in the sun,\u201d he said. \u201cIt still comes back to me.\u201dLeon Cooper was born on Oct. 23, 1919, in Chicago. His father, William Sr., owned gas stations and was later a bookkeeper. His mother, the former Rachel Rossman, was a homemaker who became a saleswoman at Lane Bryant after ulcers made her husband too ill to continue working. To help his once-prosperous family make ends meet, Leon became a caddy and his brother William Jr. a prizefighter.Mr. Cooper enlisted in the wartime Navy after graduating from the University of Illinois with a degree in government, finance and accounting.\u201cGarbage lay everywhere on what to me was hallowed ground, where I saw so many of my countrymen killed or wounded by Japanese,\u201d he said in the Armchair General interview.Revisiting his past kindled Mr. Cooper\u2019s late-in-life activism, which suited his gregarious, blunt-spoken and profane personality.Disgusted by the conditions on the beach, he began contacting members of Congress to authorize funding to clean it up, a campaign that has not yet succeeded.Steven Barber, the director of \u201cReturn to Tarawa,\u201d said in an interview that Mr. Cooper had trouble persuading some members of Congress to take him seriously. In an attempt to lobby Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, he said, \u201cLeon was beating on her door screaming, `Throw some alms to the poor!\u2019 \u201dMr. Cooper made a stronger impact after \u201cReturn to Tarawa\u201d was televised. It showed him, dismayed but relentless, walking the beach and spotting old gun emplacements and other artifacts of the battle; talking to local government officials of the Republic of Kiribati, of which Tarawa is part, and meeting people who had uncovered Marine remains.\u201cYou look down in the ground,\u201d he said in the film, \u201cand you see the mortal remains of somebody \u2014 Japanese or American.\u201dIn 2015, after 39 sets of remains were recovered, Mr. Cooper said the scope of his quest had expanded to all service members still missing in action in the Pacific Theater.In addition to his son William, he is survived by his daughters, Katie and Jeanie Cooper; two other sons, Peter and Lee; and six grandchildren. His wife, the former Alberta Brown, died in 1994.Mr. Cooper believed that the Battle of Tarawa had been poorly planned and should never have been fought.\u201cThree days of savagery taught the Japanese how to kill more Americans,\u201d he said in the documentary, \u201cand taught us to do more stupid things.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Sought to Undercut an Unfavorable Analysis of the Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A Republican requirement that Congress consider the full cost of major legislation threatened to derail the party\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax rewrite last week. So lawmakers went on the offensive to discredit the agency performing the analysis.In 2015, Republicans changed the budget rules in Congress so that official scorekeepers would be required to analyze the potential economic impact of major legislation when determining how it would affect federal revenues.Public statements and messaging documents obtained by The New York Times show a concerted push by Republican lawmakers to discredit a nonpartisan agency they had long praised. Party leaders circulated two pages of \u201cresponse points\u201d that declared \u201cthe substance, timing and growth assumptions of J.C.T.\u2019s \u2018dynamic\u2019 score are suspect.\u201d Among their arguments was that the joint committee was using \u201cconsistently wrong\u201d growth models to assess the effect the tax cuts would have on hiring, wages and investment.The Republican response points go after revenue analyses by the committee and by the Congressional Budget Office, which scores other legislation, saying their findings \u201ccan be off to the tune of more than $1.5 trillion over ten years.\u201dThe swift backlash helped defuse concerns about the deficit impact long enough for the bill to pass by a vote of 51 to 49. Some deficit hawks in the Senate caucus were sufficiently concerned about the report on Thursday night to delay the tax vote by a day, but the only Republican lawmaker to vote no was Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, whose last-minute efforts to cut the size of the package or otherwise offset the deficit impact were unsuccessful.Instead, Senate Republicans questioned the timing of the analysis\u2019 release on Thursday, and a spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee released a statement saying the findings are \u201ccurious and deserve further scrutiny.\u201dRepublicans say the committee\u2019s model underestimates how workers will respond to lower taxes and how private investment affects growth. They also say the model assumes that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates faster than Republican lawmakers expect, which would make borrowing more expensive and could slow economic growth.That sentiment was repeated over and over, before and after the vote. \u201cWe think they lowballed it,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip, told reporters on Thursday. On Sunday, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said on CNN that \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt that the J.C.T. has been consistently underestimating the activity in our economy.\u201dIn the final hours before and after the bill passed, party leaders insisted that the tax plan would produce enough economic growth to pay for themselves with additional tax revenue from growing businesses and higher-paid workers. \u201cI\u2019m totally confident this is a revenue-neutral bill,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told reporters early Saturday morning after the vote, adding that he believed the bill would actually be a \u201crevenue producer.\u201dThe attack on the joint committee and its analysis is a change from the praise Republicans have long heaped on the body, which is staffed with economists and other career bureaucrats who analyze legislation in depth.At stake in the debate is more than the reputation of the economic analysts whose lifeblood is understanding the vagaries and intersections of the federal budget and tax code.If Republicans are wrong and the joint committee is correct, the tax bill will add to an already worsening fiscal forecast in the United States. The federal government is already running an annual deficit of nearly $700 billion. The amount of federal debt has surpassed $20 trillion, and it is projected to grow by another $10 trillion over the next decade as government safety net spending rises because of retiring baby boomers and increasing health care costs.The joint committee did find that the tax bill would rev up economic growth but, like other studies, it would not be enough to offset the loss of tax revenue. The analysis found growth from the tax cuts would offset $458 billion in lost revenue, but $51 billion of that would be eaten up by additional interest costs on money the United States would need to borrow to pay for the plan. That would leave just $407 billion to offset a nearly $1.5 trillion tax cut, the committee found.Both the Penn model and the Tax Policy Center\u2019s model found the Senate version would increase deficits by more than $1 trillion after accounting for growth; the Penn model in particular produced a near-identical score to the joint committee\u2019s. The Tax Foundation did not complete an analysis of the Senate bill as amended in committee, when senators made several large changes to the bill including sunsetting its tax cuts for individuals in 2025.Until Thursday, though, Republicans could dismiss those findings by pointing to the lack of analysis from the joint committee. The House bill was passed two weeks after it was introduced, before the committee could issue a so-called dynamic score of the bill, one that estimates the legislation\u2019s cost in light of its effect on the economy. When the Senate analysis was finally released, Republicans, who pushed the bill through Congress at such lightning-fast speed that the final bill had handwritten changes in the margins, questioned the timing.\u201cHow is it,\u201d they wrote in their response points, \u201cthat J.C.T. found the time to produce and make public its macroeconomic analysis of the Senate bill, when it has yet to produce the same analysis of the House bill that passed weeks ago.\u201dIn a November 28 email shared with The New York Times, the committee\u2019s chief of staff, Thomas A. Barthold, said the committee had suspended its work on the House bill dynamic score in hopes of producing an analysis of the Senate bill before a final vote.Looking at the calendar, Mr. Barthold wrote, \u201cI made the decision to have my macro colleagues devote their time to producing a macroeconomic estimate of the Finance bill in time for the Finance Committee\u2019s report (in this we failed) or in time for the Senate\u2019s debate on the legislation. My colleagues and I reasoned that we could then return to complete work on H.R. 1\u201d \u2014 the House bill \u2014 \u201cand with good fortune have the two analyses available for a potential conference.\u201dThe blowback came, in part, from lingering anger over unfavorable analyses of Republican health care plans by the budget office earlier this year, according to a Republican Senate aide. A finding that contradicted their philosophical belief that tax cuts will generate significant growth and revenues inflamed their suspicions.Instead, they found comfort in ballpark estimates offered by some conservative economists, that the tax bill could increase the size of the economy by as much as 4 percent over a decade, or 0.4 percent a year. Mr. Smetters, of Penn, said that number is actually much higher \u2014 that the economy would need to grow by at least an additional 0.57 percent a year for tax cuts to pay for themselves.Not even the most optimistic analysis of the Senate bill projected it would unleash anywhere close to that rate of additional growth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corporate America\u2019s Gender Gap: Few Women in the C-Suite", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe C-suite is corporate America\u2019s big sex scandal. Women hold fewer than a quarter of senior executive titles, new research finds. The tsunami of harassment expos\u00e9s makes the paucity of women in leading positions even more egregious.Women hold only 23 percent of senior executive posts with a title that includes the word chief, according to an analysis by Korn Ferry of the top 1,000 United States companies by revenue. That\u2019s a small drop from 24 percent in 2016.A detailed breakdown presents an even bleaker picture. Women make up just 6 percent of the blue-chip group\u2019s chief executive officers, and 11 percent of its chief financial officers. Parity comes, perhaps predictably, in that most social of C-level jobs, chief human resource officers, where women hold 55 percent of positions.The overall decline is even more glaring in the wake of the #metoo movement afflicting media, technology, entertainment and political circles. More women in the higher echelons of the corporate ranks could help change a culture that turns a blind eye to, if not condones, bad behavior.The financial industry might be a test case. The sector outranked all others in the analysis with nearly 30 percent of C-suite jobs held by women. That\u2019s a better track record than more female-friendly industries like retail and consumer at 24 percent, yet even in finance women are largely kept out of the most senior roles. Only 5 percent of the industry\u2019s chief executives and 8 percent of its chief financial officers are female, among the lowest levels in the survey.For decades, banks and trading floors were hostile territory for women. High-profile cases in the 1980s and 1990s brought by whistle-blowers against firms like the former Smith Barney shed light on misconduct that forced Wall Street to put in place stricter protocols and enact better inclusion policies.It\u2019s notable that men in finance have been largely absent \u2014 so far \u2014 from the recent wave of sex scandals. Maybe that\u2019s a sign of progress. But without change at the top, it\u2019s hard to see how the broader situation in corporate America will improve.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurogroup, Looking Past Period of Crisis, Picks New Leader From Portugal", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Portuguese economist will be the new leader of the group that manages crises for the eurozone, a sign that the region\u2019s officials may be ready to leave behind an era during which the euro often appeared to be on the brink of collapse.The Eurogroup\u2019s importance grew substantially during Mr. Dijsselbloem\u2019s tenure. The group became the venue for eurozone members to debate how to help nations like Cyprus address bank-system failures, a looming Greek default on government debt, and severe economic downturns across the region.It is unlikely that Mr. Centeno, 50, could have been elected as Eurogroup president a few years ago. At that point, Portugal was in the midst of a deep economic crisis and there were doubts about whether the country could pay its debts and remain in the eurozone. There were bitter fights within the Eurogroup about how much aid to provide to the crisis countries and how much pain they should be made to endure.The eurozone has recovered strongly since then. Every country in the bloc is growing, and there is no longer talk of the common currency disintegrating. There is, however, general agreement that eurozone countries must do more to prevent crises, for example by creating a permanent fund akin to the International Monetary Fund that could be used to help stricken members.Mr. Centeno will be responsible for leading the Eurogroup as it grapples with those issues.He earned a doctorate in economics from Harvard in 2000 and has focused his academic research on the functioning of labor markets. Before becoming finance minister, he was deputy head of the research department at the Banco de Portugal, the country\u2019s central bank.\u201cCenteno is the anti-Sch\u00e4uble among Europe\u2019s finance ministers,\u201d Sven Giegold, a member of the European Parliament from the Green Party, said in a statement Monday. Mr. Giegold, who is German, said that Mr. Centeno, in his role as Portugal\u2019s finance minister, had resisted pressure to cut pensions and had argued that austerity was not the right way to help a country in crisis.At a news conference in Brussels on Monday, Mr. Centeno, who will assume the new post in January, deflected a question about his views on austerity. He said he planned to manage by consensus. \u201cThis is the only way that Europe has advanced in the past and the only way it will advance in the future,\u201d he said.His predecessor, Mr. Dijsselbloem, was never as reviled in Greece as Mr. Sch\u00e4uble. Still, Greeks viewed Mr. Dijsselbloem as an agent of Germany; for that reason, he was neither trusted by, nor popular with, Greeks.Alexis Tsipras, the left-wing politician who is Greece\u2019s prime minister, called Mr. Centeno\u2019s election \u201cvery promising.\u201d In an interview with the Portuguese newspaper Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias, Mr. Tsipras said he hoped that Mr. Centeno would make the Eurogroup\u2019s deliberations more transparent.\u201cAt the Eurogroup, decisions were made without minutes being taken, without us knowing details about what was discussed,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said. \u201cIn the end the decision was what the German finance minister, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, wanted to do.\u201dMr. Centeno hinted he would push for more openness. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to build a eurozone that is resilient,\u201d he said, \u201cand responds to the ultimate stakeholders, who are European citizens.\u201dGreece was again on the agenda at the Eurogroup meeting Monday. The finance ministers endorsed measures designed to reduce Greece\u2019s vulnerability to rising interest rates.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Some States Are Helping First-Time Home Buyers", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserEfforts to help potential first-time home buyers save for down payments using special tax-favored accounts have been gaining traction in state legislatures.Three states passed legislation this year authorizing the accounts: Iowa, Minnesota and Mississippi. Three other states had previously approved them: Colorado, Montana and Virginia.Down payment accounts may be helpful, said Adriann Murawski, state and local government affairs representative with the National Association of Realtors, because rising home prices have made it harder for buyers to come up with the money for them. The association and its state counterparts have actively promoted legislation creating the accounts as a way to help spur home buying.A recent report from the Urban Institute found that 53 percent of renters said that they couldn\u2019t afford the down payment to buy a home.Mississippi is generous, allowing a tax benefit for both contributions and gains on the money. Potential home buyers can set aside up to $5,000 each year for couples, and $2,500 for individuals.Some states limit the deduction to buyers who have never owned a home, while others offer it to those who haven\u2019t owned one in the past three years, a nod to potential buyers who may have lost a home in the Great Recession.States typically cap the total amount that can be saved and impose penalties if funds are used for purposes other than a down payment. Most focus on basic savings accounts, but some states allow funds to be held in brokerage or investment accounts.Ms. Murawski said the association hoped that more states will consider authorizing the accounts next year, including Alabama, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, and Pennsylvania.Earlier this year, the New York Legislature passed a measure authorizing tax-favored down payment accounts. But the bill, called NY First Home, awaits action by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, according to the New York State Association of Realtors. The measure would allow state income tax deductions of $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for couples saving for their first home. If signed into law, the accounts would probably be available beginning in tax year 2019, said Michael Kelly, the association\u2019s director of government affairs.But federal legislation to establish such accounts, with contributions that may be deducted on federal income tax returns, hasn\u2019t advanced far in Congress. Lawmakers are currently focused on finalizing major tax legislation that, among other things, may scale back the long-popular home mortgage interest deduction.Here are some questions and answers about saving for a down payment:How much of a down payment do I need to buy a home?Are there programs offering down payment assistance?Where can I get information about down payments and the home buying process?Advertisement"}

The potential of the attorney general\u2019s office for troublemaking and generating national headlines was redefined in the early 2000s by Eliot Spitzer. Mr. Schneiderman is a less combative man who was often the target of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter wrath amid a three-year civil investigation into Trump University. In the end, Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office extracted a $25 million settlement in the case.Nonetheless, Mr. Schneiderman is seen by some as a possible backstop should the president exercise his pardon power to help those who might become ensnared in the investigation of possible Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election being led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. Federal pardons do not apply to violations of state law.In the interview, Mr. Schneiderman would say little about his potential role as a criminal prosecutor in relation to the Trump administration, except that he hoped it would not come to that. Earlier this year, Mr. Schneiderman began a criminal inquiry focused on allegations of money laundering by Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman. But his office stood down, at least temporarily, out of deference to the special counsel\u2019s inquiry; the offices did not work together, his staff said.\u201cI have a lot of respect for the work the special counsel\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve put together a terrific team.\u201dHe added: \u201cJust watching it from the outside, like everybody else, it seems like they\u2019re doing a very thorough and serious job. I hope there\u2019s not going to be any effort to derail them or shut them down.\u201cIf that happens, we\u2019ll do \u2014 as I think would be a genuine sentiment around the country \u2014 we\u2019ll do whatever we can do to see that justice is done. But I hope we don\u2019t have to face a problem like that.\u201dRegarding Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s myriad legal filings, the White House referred questions to the Justice Department.\u201cThe federal court system is not a substitute for the legislative process,\u201d said Devin M. O\u2019Malley, a spokesman there. \u201cThe Department of Justice will continue to defend the president\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority to issue executive orders aimed at securing our borders, protecting U.S. workers, promoting free speech and religious liberty, among many other lawful actions.\u201dMr. Schneiderman also says \u201cit\u2019s better to have opponents and not enemies,\u201d a statement that would seem to run counter to Trump doctrine.After Mr. Trump became president, Mr. Schneiderman was not expecting him to become \u201cpresidential.\u201d\u201cBefore Lyin\u2019 Ted and Little Marco, I had my nickname,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said, though Mr. Trump never appeared to settle on a single epithet. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any reason to believe he would change.\u201dThe day after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, Mr. Schneiderman convened his staff in Manhattan and began the process of reorienting the mission of the office.\u201cThe election was so traumatizing that my first step was to try and, essentially, pick everyone up off the canvas,\u201d he said. \u201cI had people who were too depressed to go into work.\u201dHis staff soon began compiling something of a virtual war room, a Trump database to track federal actions and plan their responses. In some areas, Mr. Schneiderman said, they were \u201cfilling in\u201d as the federal government rolled back enforcement of civil rights protections, wage rules and consumer protections.\u201cThen there\u2019s the second category where they\u2019re actually doing something to try and hurt New Yorkers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not filling in, it\u2019s more like fighting back. A galvanizing experience for that was the first travel ban.\u201d\u201cI did anticipate that the administration was going to be aggressively regressive,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said, adding: \u201cI did not anticipate the volume that he was going to start pumping out so quickly. These guys were generating lots of trouble very quickly.\u201dThat has led to a tighter relationship among Democratic attorneys general. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a stronger or smarter ally,\u201d Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, said of Mr. Schneiderman in a statement. He has also stayed in touch with Mr. Spitzer, who said in an interview that \u201cEric has done a good job\u201d and \"stepped into a chasm where today\u2019s ideological divisions create a lot of room for litigation.\u201dBut the Trump administration remains a central focus.\u201cI was a little worried after the first few weeks about burnout,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said, but he added that lawyers in his office have resisted being moved off topics taking on the administration and felt that they were making a difference.\u201cOn the one hand, it feels like this year has been a hundred years long,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other, it feels like it shot by.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Espionage Bills in Australia Stir Fears of Anti-Chinese Backlash", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 When Craig Chung, an up-and-coming Sydney city councilor, meets with former officials from the United States, neither the media nor his constituents seem to care.But for events with fellow ethnic Chinese, he errs on the side of caution. He researches the people involved. He sidesteps certain photographs and publicly declares whom he talks to and why \u2014 all to ensure he doesn\u2019t end up accused of associating with someone tied to the Chinese Communist Party.\u201cThere is this fear that we may work closely with somebody who is accused of being an agent of another government,\u201d said Mr. Chung, 49, a fourth-generation Chinese-Australian. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position now where people are running scared.\u201dAustralia has been thrown into turmoil over allegations that China is trying to buy its politicians and sway its elections, charges that have led to increased scrutiny of the rising superpower\u2019s efforts to influence Australia \u2014 and fears that a campaign to stamp out Chinese influence risks becoming a McCarthy-esque witch hunt.The Chinese government has been using proxies in Australia for years to polish its image and press for its priorities, including reunification with Taiwan and sovereignty over the South China Sea. These efforts have intensified under President Xi Jinping, who seems to view Australia \u2014 which has benefited greatly from trade with China \u2014 as a laboratory for efforts to sway opinion abroad and increase China\u2019s global influence.But a thunderous backlash has now erupted \u2014 with a public outcry condemning anyone accused of links to Chinese influence, and a series of new bills that would strengthen espionage laws, outlaw foreign political donations and criminalize efforts to interfere in Australian democracy.Critics of the legislation, including human rights groups, worry that it, and the intensity of anti-China sentiment, will squash legitimate debate and unfairly target Australia\u2019s large and diverse ethnic Chinese community.The resulting influence, both economic and cultural, is a delicate subject. China is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, whose voracious consumption of Australian iron ore, coal and other exports has lifted Australia\u2019s economy.\u201cWe don\u2019t really know how to think about China because it\u2019s not an ally but it\u2019s not an enemy,\u201d said Mr. White, who is now a professor at Australian National University. \u201cWe are really facing something that is new in our national experience.\u201dMany of Australia\u2019s institutions have yet to catch up.Given the furor over Chinese political influence, many Chinese-Australians fear that the new espionage and foreign influence laws could further isolate them.As an ethnic minority, some Chinese-Australians see an identity associated with a stronger China as a path to more respect. Others have family and business ties in China that make them afraid to express dissent with Beijing.But Australia\u2019s Chinese community has roots reaching back more than a century, and its growing numbers include people from Taiwan, Hong Kong and elsewhere, not just mainland China.Many are quick to gush about Australian life. But they also demand to know why Chinese-Australians are so absent from board rooms and the media, and why simply buying an apartment is somehow viewed as suspicious.The new legislation was drawn from the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of global threats, said George Brandis, the attorney general until being named high commissioner to the United Kingdom in a cabinet reshuffle this week. Mr. Brandis also said it was American-inspired, reflecting the lessons from the 2016 presidential election in the United States and the evidence of Russian attempts to meddle in the outcome.This includes criminalizing actions that fall short of outright espionage but that are deemed to interfere with an \u201cAustralian democratic or political right or duty.\u201d\u201cOne of the striking features of the American system is its vagueness or the highly generic way in which political interference is defined,\u201d Mr. Brandis said. \u201cUnder the Australian scheme there is a very specific description of what constitutes foreign interference.\u201dMany Chinese-Australians with firsthand knowledge of Beijing\u2019s heavy hand have welcomed the bill.Chinese influence also became a focal point of the recent race for an open seat in Parliament from a heavily Chinese area of Sydney, with the Liberal candidate, John Alexander, a former professional tennis player, surviving accusations that the government was whipping up anti-China sentiment to win the seat, preserving Prime Minister Turnbull\u2019s majority.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing play out there are the somewhat toxic politics of national security, which have swamped countries around the West since 9/11,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThere is a grave danger of us overreacting.\u201dJacqueline Williams contributed reporting from Canberra, Australia, and Christopher Buckley from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tiny Vermont Town Is a Big Cradle of Olympians", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook ExcerptThe road to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, runs through Norwich, a hilly and wooded family-oriented farming community tucked between Interstates 89 and 91 in rural Vermont. With a main street lined with white clapboard colonial buildings and a landmark steepled church, Norwich could be a set designer\u2019s rendering of a tiny New England village.Yet despite its apparent ordinariness, Norwich is home to a probabilities puzzle for the statistics students at Dartmouth College, less than two miles away as the hermit thrush flies.The town\u2019s outsize success in Olympic sports has much to do with the way it rears its children, helping them succeed without causing burnout or compromising their future happiness. The town\u2019s Olympic pipeline, perhaps incongruously, is a product of a collective mind-set that the Olympics are not the pinnacle of an athlete\u2019s life but merely a fun stop on the way to achieving other longer-lasting dreams.Norwich is not representative of the country as a whole. It is overwhelmingly white and mostly affluent. With its population of professors and doctors, Norwich has the demographic \u2014 the wealth and the driven personalities \u2014 to be at the vanguard of the helicopter-parenting movement. And yet the town has largely opted out of the athletic and academic arms races being waged elsewhere, and almost by accident, has created a culture that seems to serve as the perfect incubator for developing the ideal Olympic athlete. Norwich parents do not turn their offspring into miners panning for an Olympic medal, a college scholarship or a professional career, though many do find such golden opportunities.Instead the town has managed to help its athletes be not only purposeful, but also happy in their post-sports lives.I was reminded of how much the Norwich model matters when I returned home from covering the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro. Several of my friends told me they hadn\u2019t bothered watching the competition. They were over the Olympics as must-see TV and were talking about the event as if it were a reality show they had once enjoyed immensely but now found fraudulent.So many unsympathetic characters! So many farcical story lines! How could they root for athletes with cartoonish muscles who were likely to win medals only to later fail tests for performance-enhancing drugs? They expressed a nostalgic longing for the star swimmers and runners of their youth, who seemed more accessible and personable and less greedy and entitled. The consensus was that the Olympic movement was buckling under the weight of its excesses.Holland, Wheating, Kearney and the other Norwich Olympians went for broke in their sports but didn\u2019t get rich \u2014 and they didn\u2019t much care. The sports enriched their lives, and that was what drove them.Norwich is a place with deep agrarian roots, and that still shows. The town was founded in 1761 as a farming community. While farmers were eventually replaced by doctors, academicians and other white-collar workers employed by nearby Dartmouth College and its hospital, Norwich remained true to the tenets set forth by the original homesteaders \u2014 hardworking people who did not manipulate their crops to make them turn out a certain way or try to accelerate the growth of their animals by injecting them with chemicals. Instead, Norwich\u2019s residents have simply made judicious use of the resources on offer.For the most part, the Olympians of Norwich did not sacrifice their childhoods by specializing in one pursuit to hasten their progress. They grew up changing activities with the seasons. The sports that offer the greatest exposure in America, and therefore the greatest potential for fame and fortune, are not the sports that typically capture the imaginations of Vermonters, who are known for their fiercely independent, contrarian personalities. The chain of homegrown Olympians includes no figure skaters, perhaps the most glamorous of the winter athletes. Instead, Norwich is brimming with ski jumpers and freestyle skiers throwing caution to the wind and pushing the boundaries of risk and reward.The Olympic athletes from the town don\u2019t seem in any hurry to leave. With few exceptions, when their competitive careers are over they unpack their bags and stay put, because they want their offspring to enjoy childhoods similar to their own. They join family businesses or hang their own shingles and serve as instructors on the side. By staying, they become living monuments for the younger generations, who grow so accustomed to seeing Olympians in their midst that they consider the Olympics almost a rite of passage.Norwich is not tightly tethered to technology. Cellular and internet connectivity remains spotty, which helps explain why many of the townspeople I talked to carried flip phones in their purses or pockets. Why buy a smartphone when its bells and whistles are effectively silenced by hills and forests? The townspeople have their favorite chat rooms and social platforms, but these are physical spaces \u2014 in the aisles of the general store, at the gym or the downstairs meeting room in Tracy Hall, in the shops along Main Street.Norwich does have a time-warp feel to it that extends beyond its potholed information superhighway. The town\u2019s de facto chamber of commerce is the family-owned general store, Dan & Whit\u2019s, whose slogan could double as the town motto: \u201cIf We Don\u2019t Have It, You Don\u2019t Need It.\u201d The gathering spot has been the site of at least three weddings, with Dan Fraser, who runs the store, officiating at a makeshift altar between the narrow aisles of flannel shirts and work pants. The store\u2019s currency is trust, with groceries added to a running tab that is paid off at the end of each month. For the town\u2019s poorest residents, the 6 percent who live below the poverty line, their debt, more often than not, is quietly forgiven.Norwich is also generous in helping neighbors who are less well off. It is the kind of place where a man dies and leaves his estate to the town with the condition that his money be used to ensure that no child endures a winter without a new pair of mittens. People contribute money for scholarships for drawing, painting, photography and writing classes. Or they volunteer to flood the town green during the winter so that elementary school children can skate before and after school.Kearney, the town\u2019s first Olympic champion, probably would not have won a gold medal in the women\u2019s moguls at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics if not for a benefactor she never met \u2014 the relative of a Norwich resident \u2014 who provided financial assistance to help her bridge the sizable difference between expenses for regional events and for national-level competition. When Kearney, not yet a teenager, had outgrown the local racing scene, her parents sat her down and explained that they could not afford to send her to races anywhere that required flights and hotel stays. If she wanted to continue, she was going to have to find sponsors. They left her to figure out the details.Kearney considered herself blessed to grow up in a town where those with more gladly helped those with less. \u201cYou don\u2019t find people using the town\u2019s resources but not giving back,\u201d Kearney said.All her main benefactor asked in return for his financial assistance was that she provide him with a detailed annual budget showing how she had spent the money \u2014 a great lesson in both accountability and the value of a dollar \u2014 and with copies of her report cards.Years later, Kearney\u2019s mother would read a novel in which parents take out a second mortgage to finance the Olympic aspirations of their gymnast daughter. I\u2019ve known parents who have gone to those lengths, but Kearney\u2019s mother considered the work of fiction far-fetched. She couldn\u2019t imagine risking the family\u2019s financial well-being to support a child\u2019s sports dreams. \u201cWho would do that?\u201d she said.Every Wednesday during the winter, the elementary school in Norwich lets out early to facilitate family skiing. Children can ski alongside their parents or receive free instruction from Olympians. A mother of three told me that it is hard to steer her children away from the ski slopes when they have the opportunity to learn from the best.Those hump days were the next best thing to snow days for Kearney. While her sport is increasingly populated by burnt-out gymnasts and divers who trade one obsession for another, Kearney embodied Norwich\u2019s adherence to nature\u2019s rhythms. She changed sports with the seasons. So did Tim Tetreault, a three-time Olympian in Nordic combined, whose decision not to attend high school at a specialized sports academy paved the way for a record feat in his senior year at Hanover High School in 1988.Tetreault teamed with a dozen of his classmates to break the Guinness world record for marathon leapfrogging, logging 888 miles over eight days of continuous jumping in alternating shifts. Years later, when Tetreault included the achievement on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, he said prospective employers were more inquisitive about his role in the leapfrogging world record than about his three Olympics.As a town, Norwich bucks the Darwinian view of youth sports that normalizes eliminating opportunities for all but the most skilled players. Even now in Norwich, recreational teams don\u2019t make cuts, affording every youngster the chance to participate in different sports. Having spent my journalism career observing the antics of win-at-all-costs coaches while wedged in the bleachers alongside parents micromanaging their children\u2019s play, I was not prepared for my first recreational league soccer game on the town\u2019s fields at Huntley Meadow. I was talking to a couple when their son scored two goals in quick succession. After his second score, the coach motioned the boy over to the sideline and told him it was time to take a breather. He substituted another player for the boy, and neither parent challenged the decision. They continued talking to me as if the substitution was perfectly normal.Norwich has a deep aversion to pushing its children too hard too soon. The public high school limits the number of Advanced Placement courses. The speed limit on the main road through town is 25 miles per hour, and a furor erupted on the community\u2019s internet message board when speed bumps were installed on one road near the hiking trails to foster the safe coexistence of cars, joggers, dog walkers and bicycle riders. Underlying the argument against the speed bumps was the belief that any commuter who found the posted speed limit too restrictive was perhaps better off living somewhere faster paced.Norwich\u2019s steadfast encouragement provides the perfect platform for the kind of risk taking that launches innovators like Pearce and Kearney into the great unknown. When Kearney joined the Ford Sayre Ski School in the second grade, her parents filled out an application that asked for the best word to describe her skiing style. The choices were \u201ccautious,\u201d \u201caverage\u201d and \u201caggressive.\u201d They marked the \u201caggressive\u201d box.Kearney was one of those highly competitive athletes with a kind of compulsively motivated personality that is classically associated with champions. She might have become another victim of maladaptive perfectionism if not for Norwich townspeople\u2019s efforts to slacken the pressure when she got wound up and to provide a soft landing after the inevitable failures.In 2014, Kearney was favored to become the first back-to-back winner in women\u2019s moguls. After she earned the bronze instead, the townspeople could plainly see how crestfallen she was. So they got together and organized a homecoming party for her, the theme of which was captured in a homemade felt banner that read, \u201cHannah Kearney, Norwich\u2019s Hero, 2-time Olympic medalist, Making Us Proud the World Over.\u201dNorwich restored my flagging faith in Olympic sports. By 2014, as I muddled through the mess that was the Sochi Olympics, with its displaced citizenry, disappearing dogs, dilapidated accommodations and distressing price tag, my emotional tether to the competition was fraying. It was my ninth trip to the Olympics \u2014 10th, if you count the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles, where I volunteered as a hostess \u2014 and it was hard not to feel as if I were witnessing a grande dame\u2019s last, gasping breaths. The Sochi Olympics rolled up a record tab of $51 billion and required a large army of police to secure. Russia gave the world an Olympics characterized by human-rights violations and a systemic doping program by the host country.Where were the Olympians who were in it for the joy? I found them in Norwich, which seems to possess an old-fashioned tonic, replicable anywhere there is a communitarian spirit, to cure what ails contemporary sports. Like their farmer forebears with their crops, the parents of Norwich learned through trial and error the best methods of nourishing athletes who go on to productive and meaningful adulthoods as entrepreneurs, businesspeople, healers, coaches \u2014 and volunteers on the side. In a town where no one is a castoff, everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\u201cIn Norwich,\u201d said the runner, Wheating, \u201cit\u2019s not survival of the fittest, it\u2019s survival of all of us.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this book excerpt reversed the identifications of the runners shown in one image. Andrew Wheating of Norwich, Vt., is on the right, and Yusuf Saad Kamel is on the left.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Catalan Separatists Want Independence. Who Else?", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Separatist politicians in Catalonia have been pushing for independence from Spain. After three months of political turmoil, new Catalan elections are scheduled for Dec. 21.Of the 276 regions, some are pressing for independence or much greater autonomy.CATALONIA, SpainCatalonia\u2019s push for autonomy in the 1930s was one of the reasons behind the Spanish Civil War, and the resulting Franco dictatorship crushed many civil liberties, suppressing the Catalan language. After Franco\u2019s death in 1975, Spain\u2019s return to democracy was enshrined in a new Constitution, which created a decentralized but not formally federal state.In 2006, a new statute of Catalan autonomy, which had been drafted by a Socialist-led regional government, was approved in a regional referendum, as well by Catalan and Spanish lawmakers. The statute might have forestalled the current crisis over yet more extreme independence demands, but it was rejected in part by Spain\u2019s constitutional court in 2010, after Spain\u2019s conservative Popular Party had campaigned fiercely against it.During the financial crisis, the regional government in wealthy Catalonia pushed unsuccessfully for a better tax deal with the national authorities. In September 2015, a coalition of separatist parties won a majority of the seats in the Catalan Parliament, but they did so with only 48 percent of the votes in regional elections.BASQUE COUNTRY, Spain and FranceThe Basques have their own history, culture and language. Although the region straddles France and Spain, aspirations for greater autonomy have been almost exclusively limited to the population on Spanish soil.In recent years, mainstream Basque politicians have made some efforts to gain more autonomy. In 2004, the Basque regional Parliament approved a plan for a new statute of autonomy, which Spanish lawmakers rejected.SCOTLAND, United KingdomFLANDERS, BelgiumFlanders, known for its medieval cities and its World War I battlefields, is one of three regions in the federation of Belgium, but is home to the majority of the country\u2019s 11 million inhabitants, and produces about half its GDP. Flemish people speak Dutch, whereas Walloons \u2014 residents of the second largest region, Wallonia \u2014 speak French and some German.Flanders has existed as a political entity since the Middle Ages, encompassing the territory around the cities of Ghent, Bruges and Ypres, but never achieved full sovereignty. Belgium itself, founded in 1830, is a relatively young country in Europe. The Flemish independence movement emerged in the late 19th century and gained momentum after World War II. From 1970 onward, the region progressively obtained autonomy, following six constitutional revisions that transformed Belgium from a unitary country into a federation.CORSICA, FranceThe mountainous Mediterranean island of Corsica is one of France\u2019s 18 regions. Its inhabitants make up 0.5 percent of France\u2019s population of 67 million. The island\u2019s main economic activities are tourism and subsistence-oriented local commerce.Because Corsica is close to Italy, Italian culture has historically had a strong influence on the island, reflected in the local tongue, Corsican.Corsican nationalism emerged after World War I and grew into a movement demanding more autonomy and even independence. Since the 1970s, there have been flare-ups of political violence in Corsica, including bombings and assassinations carried out by groups supporting the independence movement. The French state has always opposed full independence, but over the past decades, it has granted greater autonomy to Corsica than to any other region and invested strongly in its infrastructure.LOMBARDY, ItalyWith more than 10 million inhabitants, Lombardy is the most populous of Italy\u2019s 20 regions, and its capital, Milan, is the country\u2019s financial and fashion center.Italy\u2019s 1948 Constitution gave five regions \u2014 Valle d\u2019Aosta, Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, Sardinia, Sicily and Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol \u2014 broader powers in areas including finance and administration. But regions in the north still have active separatist movements. Since 2013, Lombardy has been governed by members of the Lega Nord, a party founded in 1991 through the federation of several hybrid separatist movements, including the local Lega Lombarda.An early incarnation of the party envisioned the creation \u2014 and secession \u2014 of a state known as Padania, which included northern regions as well as Umbria, Tuscany and the Marches. The party has since abandoned its separatist longings to pursue a broader support base, and in October it dropped the \u201cNord\u201d from its name.VENETO, ItalyVeneto separatists still mourn the decline of the Most Serene Republic of Venice, a sovereign state in northeastern Italy that held sway for around 1,100 years before it fell to foreign forces in 1797. The Veneto has its own widely spoken language, Venetian.The regional council last year also sought to have the \u201cVenetian people\u201d recognized as a minority, but the national government challenged that measure earlier this year. Numerous movements in the region \u2014 broadly known as Venetists \u2014 still aspire to significantly greater autonomy, if not independence. Some are longstanding parties like the Liga Veneta, which helped found the Lega Nord. Since 2010, the region has been governed by the Northern League.In some cases, Veneto separatists have clashed with the law. A group of separatists who occupied the Campanile in St. Mark\u2019s Square in 1997 was sentenced to prison. Members of the National Liberation Movement of the Venetian People who attended a 2009 protest march in camouflage were accused by the police of being a paramilitary group. In 2014, a group of separatists was briefly arrested on terrorism charges.Here are two recent examples, one violent and one peaceful.Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Shampoo Economy", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorI recently gave an update on America\u2019s economic policy, such as it is, to a group of bankers. I expected a great deal of interest in the Republican tax plan, but instead, they wanted to talk about how costly it was for them to comply with the rules introduced by the Dodd-Frank reform bill.While sympathizing with their plight \u2014 the cost of regulatory compliance has clearly risen over the last decade \u2014 I asked them to recall the last financial crisis, a set of catastrophic, deep-recession-inducing events that motivated the creation of Dodd-Frank in the first place.A few heads nodded. There was some mumbling about irresponsible home buyers.Add to this anecdote the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to undermine the consumer protection agency created by Dodd-Frank, along with similar congressional actions I suspect you haven\u2019t heard about (I\u2019ll fix that in a moment), and the person this brings to mind is the economist Hyman Minsky.Perhaps because Minsky, who died in 1996, was both an economics professor and a banker, he understood something other economists assumed away: recurring cycles of financial instability. After a crisis, like the bursting of the housing bubble and its ensuing damage to all the banks involved in mortgage lending (or derivatives of such loans, or insurers of such derivatives \u2014 Minsky thought about all this), the financial sector and policymakers are duly chastened. They recognize that risk was systemically underpriced, and they\u2019re even willing to countenance some guardrails against reckless banking and damaging speculation.Then, a few years into the next expansion, as the memory of the crisis fades, lenders start getting their risk back on. As Minsky observed, this phase is characterized by increasingly exotic and complicated financial tools that disguise the extent of leverage being doled out to borrowers who are far from creditworthy. The next thing you know, you\u2019re inflating the next bubble, which feeds itself until it suddenly pops \u2014 a point known as the Minsky moment, when risk-seeking flips to risk-aversion.At the same time, fiscal space to support the economy during the next downturn has been diminished by the deficit-financed tax cut. Moreover, President Trump has announced that one of his administration\u2019s next priorities is \u201cwelfare reform,\u201d code for hacking away at the safety net, Social Security and Medicare.Simply put, the Republicans\u2019 agenda is to deregulate, transfer tax revenues from the Treasury to their donors and shrink government. In year nine of our aging economic expansion, the timing of this agenda is coinciding with the point in the Minsky cycle where risk aversion has flipped to underpriced risk taking amid an aggressive attack on the measures put in place after the last crisis to meet just this moment.Unless we quickly regain our memories of what happened at the last Minsky moment, this can only end badly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Duterte Threatens to Dethrone the Jeepney as King of Filipino Roads", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byManila JournalMANILA \u2014 In Alvin Ocampo\u2019s 18-year-old jeepney, the dashboard is held together with yards of peeling electrical tape. The only concession to Manila\u2019s stifling heat is a fan screwed to the ceiling. And unless you count the padlocked metal grate in place of the driver\u2019s-side door that Mr. Ocampo installed after a gang of glue-sniffing teenagers robbed him of a fistful of pesos, the vehicle has no safety features to speak of.Nevertheless, on a recent Friday afternoon in December, scores of passengers climbed aboard Mr. Ocampo\u2019s jeepney, one of thousands of locally produced passenger trucks that are icons of Manila\u2019s traffic-clogged and pollution-choked streets.Sitting knee-to-knee, 20 passengers squeezed along the vinyl benches that run the length of the vehicle. Women clutched purses on their laps, and a few riders held handkerchiefs over their noses to keep from breathing the acrid air streaming through the open windows.For decades, the jeepney, patterned after World War II-era American jeeps and painted in brash designs, has been the most widely used mode of transportation in the country, earning the nickname \u201cking of the road.\u201dBut the jeepney\u2019s place on Filipino roads and in the culture is under attack, said Mr. Ocampo, 38, \u201cbecause of what Duterte is doing.\u201dPresident Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to phase out traditional jeepneys, a move that would pit the populist president against the working poor, who ride and drive them every day.Mr. Duterte, who has made infrastructure development one of the primary goals of his administration, cited the capital\u2019s poor air quality and horrendous traffic as the impetus for the policy.According to a survey by the traffic app Waze, Manila has the \u201cworst traffic on earth,\u201d and commuting just a few miles can take hours.Some critics also contend that jeepneys, which typically lack seatbelts, are not safe. Twenty people, including three children, were killed on Monday in the northern Philippines when the jeepney in which they were riding to a Christmas Mass collided head-on with a larger bus.Mr. Duterte\u2019s proposal was met in October with two days of strikes by jeepney drivers that resulted in schools\u2019 canceling classes and government offices\u2019 suspending work.The drivers say removing jeepneys from the road would deprive them of their livelihoods, and shut down small businesses.\u201cYou\u2019re poor?\u201d Mr. Duterte asked in a speech mocking the drivers during the protests. \u201cSon of a bitch, suffer hardship and hunger. I don\u2019t care.\u201dThe Department of Transportation has ordered modern replacements for the jeepney, fitted with padded seats, side opening doors, air-conditioning and electric engines.The new vehicles, which look more like traditional buses than jeepneys, are intended to reduce pollution, improve comfort and safety, and make public transportation more accessible for the elderly and people with disabilities.At a busy intersection in Manila, Yana Padilla, 24, an administrative assistant who commutes to her office two hours each way by jeepney, said she would miss the classic vehicle because it\u2019s \u201cthe mark of the Philippines.\u201d Nevertheless, she said, she is ready for a better ride.Updating the jeepney alone will not improve traffic, but the government\u2019s program also aims to organize routes better as part of a larger effort to improve public transportation in Manila.Not everyone is convinced. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe it is really a modernization plan,\u201d George San Mateo, president of the jeepney drivers advocacy group Piston, said of Mr. Duterte\u2019s proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s a marketing program for the vehicles they are forcing the small operators to buy.\u201dOriginally Mr. Duterte threatened to remove the jeepneys as early as Jan. 1, but the Transportation Department has backed off from that deadline. Recently, it offered a slower phaseout of older jeepneys and financing plans for drivers and owners who are likely to lose their vehicles.Critics argue that the financing the government plans to provide will fall short of what drivers will need to buy new jeepneys.A jeepney currently costs about 500,000 pesos, or $9,900, but the prototype vehicles are expected to range in cost from 1.2 million to 1.6 million pesos (about $24,000 to $31,000).According to a study by Senator Grace Poe, chairwoman of the Committee on Public Services, the new vehicles could cost as much as 2.1 million pesos each with interest, an amount that far exceeds the 80,000 pesos the government plans to allocate for financial aid. The proposed budget, Ms. Poe warned, will be enough to modernize only 25,000 of the country\u2019s 234,000 jeepneys.Mr. San Mateo said the costs would force small business owners and drivers into debt or drive them out, and open the door for large corporations to take over the industry.Rather than requiring small business owners to buy new vehicles, Mr. San Mateo said owners want money to be directed toward updating existing jeepneys, and the government to support a national industry for making the autos.Edison Lao, manager of Armak Motors, a jeepney manufacturer founded by his father 39 years ago, said the jeepney \u201csymbolizes the ingenuity of the Filipino.\u201dOver the years, Mr. Lao has improved little on the jeepney\u2019s classic design. Aside from the engine, which is acquired secondhand from Japanese trucks, the Armak jeepney, like most jeepneys in the Philippines, is produced locally, by hand. In Mr. Lao\u2019s workshop there are welders, steel polishers, fender specialists and tailors sewing vinyl seats and roof padding.\u201cThe people who build jeepneys are really experienced craftsmen,\u201d Mr. Lao said.Victorino Capuno, 52, has worked at Armak Motors as a painter for 30 years. In the 1980s, he said, the autos were hand-painted with religious scenes in the style of the Sistine Chapel. Nowadays, airbrushed paintings of Italian sports cars are popular.Mr. Capuno said he had painted more than a thousand depictions of the Virgin Mary, as well as cargo ships, teams of horses, neon eagles, cartoon characters and mottos like \u201cA Dream Fulfilled\u201d and \u201cBasta Sexy Libre\u201d \u2014 free rides for the sexy.\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t appreciate these kinds of stories,\u201d Mr. Lao said, adding that without support from the government, the jeepney would not survive for another generation.While working-class jeepney drivers are seen as a bloc that largely supported Mr. Duterte, his approach to addressing problems within the industry is breeding resentment.Susan Gordo, 50, an owner of two jeepneys, said Mr. Duterte \u201chas shown that he\u2019s not genuinely for the poor.\u201dAlvin Barnachea, 40, who works as a \u201cbarker,\u201d ushering passengers onto jeepneys, said that he supported the modernization program because it would decrease pollution, but that the government should help the drivers and owners.\u201cDuterte doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. Barnachea said. \u201cHe wants to make things better, never mind the people who will take a hit. That\u2019s how Duterte\u2019s mind works.\u201dOne day in December, Mr. Ocampo, the driver, steered his jeepney through markets, busy avenues and residential neighborhoods. He reached behind his seat to collect passenger fares as he blasted \u201cMy Valentine,\u201d a country-pop song, played from his cellphone\u2019s speaker.\u201cIt\u2019s so soothing every time I hear a love song,\u201d Mr. Ocampo yelled, barely audible over the rumble of his diesel engine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Fed Rate Increase Affects Your Mortgage, Car Loan and Credit Card Bill", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, the fifth increase since the financial crisis, will probably reach beyond Wall Street and into most American homes.Anyone with a credit card will see a small but instant shock to their interest rate, followed by borrowers with student and auto loans and, eventually, mortgage holders.The psychological effect of the increase, the third of 2017, may be dulled as consumers grow conditioned to the such moves.Ethan S. Harris, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, cautioned in a note to investors that \u201cthere is no such thing as a painless Fed hiking cycle.\u201dUnlike homeowners and other borrowers, cardholders are immediately affected by an increase. Card rates are based on a bank\u2019s prime rate, which is usually set at 300 basis points, or three percentage points, above the high end of the Fed\u2019s benchmark. Cardholders pay a premium above the prime rate that is determined largely by their creditworthiness.That final rate tends to be variable, allowing banks to make adjustments when their own borrowing costs increase. This could cause payments to balloon, because credit cards tend to compound interest, requiring consumers to pay interest on their base balance and on the accrued interest.Consumer groups suggest that debtors who cannot pay off their monthly credit card balances transfer the debt onto a card that does not charge interest for several months, and then clear the amount owed before the card switches to a variable rate.Home loans usually come with 15- to 30-year terms, a far longer timeline than the short-term borrowing affected by the federal funds rate.So mortgage rates, which have hovered below 4 percent for much of 2017, are less sensitive to incremental rate increases than to changes in the yield of the 10 year U.S. Treasury note, which stayed low this year even as the Fed rate ticked up.Fixed rates on 30-year mortgages largely track the Treasury movements. From June 2004 to June 2006, when the Fed raised the federal funds rate 17 times, mortgage rates followed a similar pattern.Homeowners are not entirely shielded from the impact of a Fed rate increase. Whenever the central bank makes borrowing costlier for commercial banks, those institutions have an incentive to pass those costs on to customers.The most vulnerable borrowers are those either seeking a new mortgage or already holding one with an adjustable rate. Lenders have begun gradually pushing up rates, partly in anticipation of future Fed increases.If mortgage rates increase, Americans may be less inclined to buy homes. Lighter demand could mean lower home prices. Homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages may hold off on refinancing, leading to less loan activity and trouble for workers in the industry.Students who already have a fixed-rate government loan will not see a change, but the interest rates on private variable-rate loans will probably rise because of the Fed\u2019s action. Those who anticipate borrowing for college in the near future may see an uptick in rates.Federal loans are tied to the rate on the 10-year Treasury note, which accounts for future shifts in the Fed benchmark rate. The government adjusts its loan rates each July.Private lenders can be expected to raise variable rates on personal loans, but the shift for most existing borrowers will not happen until the date specified in their master promissory note.\u201cWhen there\u2019s a hike in the rate, you\u2019ll typically see a hike throughout the whole private lending world as well,\u201d said Ashley Norwood, a consumer and regulatory adviser with American Student Assistance, a nonprofit group assisting student borrowers. \u201cIn normal years, the increases aren\u2019t significant enough to be alarming \u2014 an extra $2,000 over the course of a 20-year, $30,000 loan isn\u2019t making or breaking you usually.\u201dBut repeated rate increases, she said, could cause \u201cheartburn,\u201d especially for vulnerable borrowers with lower credit scores.Similar forces are at work for car owners, although the impact is far more muted than it is for credit card and student loan holders. Monthly payments on new auto loans might be just a few dollars more than for existing debtors.Eight in 10 new car sales are financed through a dealer, bank affiliated with an automaker or lease, said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds. Automakers and dealers are accustomed to dangling hefty incentives that they sweeten during downturns and the holidays.Although 17.2 million new cars are projected to be sold in 2017, dealers have experienced a drop-off since last year, Ms. Caldwell said. Dealers have sizable inventory of current-year models to offload before 2018 and might temporarily ignore the effect of the Fed increase.\u201cWhen sales are going down, there\u2019s more pressure for automakers and dealers to keep market share,\u201d Ms. Caldwell said. \u201cWhen things are very competitive, they\u2019re more willing to eat the cost by offering low-interest-rate financing even if they have to pay more for their loans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Built-In Instability of the G.O.P.\u2019s Tax Bill", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsRepublicans are on the verge of achieving their decades-long goal: an overhaul of the tax code. But the system they have built will not last.The plan\u2019s instability is partly a result of the process Republican Party leaders chose to make it happen. Reconciliation, which allows escape from the Senate filibuster, means that Republicans did not have to reach across the aisle. Not a single Democrat supported the legislation.The deficit-increasing bill that resulted tilts heavily toward the very rich, financing tax cuts on the backs of future generations. These policies not only face the risk of being undone by a future Democratic majority, but also could indeed prove to be so lopsided as to alienate the more centrist of Republicans. Worse, Republicans now aim to take advantage of the instability they\u2019ve created by cutting so-called entitlements like Medicare down the line, burdening the poor and the middle class.Republicans have chosen a deep, permanent rate cut for corporations while providing only modest and temporary relief for individuals. Most of the provisions benefiting individuals will expire in 2025, which creates uncertainty for taxpayers and sets up undesirable conflicts in the future as people fight to keep them.This uncertainty means that the 21 percent corporate rate may not last either. Faced with the specter of a higher rate in the future amid a tumultuous political environment, corporations may continue to search for lower tax rates abroad and limit their investment here in the interim.In an attempt to rein in the deficit, Congress had to reverse the 1981 cuts and raise taxes a year later and then again in 1983 and 1984. A similar fate awaits the current bill when this legislation also does not end up paying for itself.Republicans could have chosen to work with Democrats to enact more lasting, balanced and thoughtful changes to the tax system. They didn\u2019t, and now they will have to live with the consequences. Their victory on taxes is likely to prove fleeting. If so, maybe then they will be ready for real reform.Rebecca M.

The United States Soccer Federation named eight candidates to succeed outgoing president Sunil Gulati on Wednesday afternoon. All submitted the three required letters of nomination, and passed background checks, even Hope Solo, who has been a part of a federal employment complaint against the federation and has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. The only publicly-announced candidate who failed to secure the letters of nomination was Paul Lapointe, an amateur league manager who mostly drew attention for feuding with soccer reporters on Twitter.One of the eight candidates will be chosen at U.S. Soccer\u2019s annual meeting in February, in Orlando, Fla. The roughly 550 voters are representatives of the youth, adult, pro and athletes councils, as well as board members, life members and a fan representative.Here are the candidates. A lawyer from Boston who has held a number of positions in a long (and low profile) career in the game, Gans was the first candidate to announce a challenge to Gulati, declaring that he was running long before the men\u2019s team\u2019s failure to qualify for the World Cup brought challengers out of the woodwork. That early planting of his flag ought to count for something, but the increasingly crowded field has made it hard for Gans to stand out.

His brand is as a recent former player, but he lacks much in the way of executive or coaching experience.An attorney and former player in Israel, Winograd is the least well-known candidate in the bunch.

The late-1890s house is among a dwindling number of grand mansions that lined one of this port city\u2019s most prestigious thoroughfares. It is near several universities and a quick stroll from the 185-acre Point Pleasant Park.The home, on about a third of an acre, has 7,659 square feet of space and a 3,000-square-foot finished basement, for a total of nine bedrooms and five full and one half bathrooms. Just behind the structure, and included in the sale, is a 1,100-square-foot carriage house, with two more bedrooms, a full bath and a deck that holds a small aboveground pool.The house also has a rich history, said Ethan Michaels of Bryant Realty Atlantic, which has the listing. It was designed by J.C. Dumaresq, a noted Canadian architect at the turn of the last century, and built for the owner of an insurance company and his wife. It had several other owners before becoming vacant in the late 1930s and, at one time, was a boardinghouse.The current owner, whose family had purchased the home in 1974, undertook a major restoration and renovation several years ago, adding, among other things, modern conveniences and outdoor decks, Mr. Michaels said. He noted that many original architectural details remain, like the oak floors, crystal glass windows, crown moldings and intricate wood detail throughout. \u201cIt\u2019s a traditional house with a modern flair,\u201d Mr. Michaels said.A small vestibule opens to a central foyer with 12-foot ceilings and a working fireplace, one of seven. Off the foyer, on one side of the house, is a mudroom with built-ins, a media room and a large kitchen with a breakfast bar and Miele and Thermador appliances. On the other side of the main floor are the formal living and dining rooms and a family room, all of which open to a deck.A laundry room and four bedrooms are on the second floor, including the master suite, which has an en-suite bath, a walk-in closet and access to a patio.On the third floor is a guest suite, with four more bedrooms, a galley kitchen and a living room. Another bedroom, small kitchen, recreation room and office are in the basement.This house is about a mile from downtown Halifax, as well as Dalhousie University and St. Mary\u2019s University, two of several colleges in the area. Halifax Stanfield International Airport is about a half-hour drive.MARKET OVERVIEWHalifax\u2019s housing market has remained fairly stable over the last few years, reflecting a steady local economy.Right now, Mr. Rutledge said, \u201cWe\u2019re busy. The market has been strong, though we\u2019re moving into our winter slowdown.\u201dThe market is also experiencing somewhat of a construction boom, agents said, with many new rental units going up around the downtown periphery.Home prices in the city range from around 150,000 Canadian dollars, or about $120,000 for a small one-bedroom apartment in an older building downtown to nearly 5 million Canadian dollars, or $4 million, for a large home at the south end of the Halifax peninsula. Homes in the South End district typically start at around 650,000 Canadian, or around $510,000.WHO BUYS IN HALIFAXThe market has seen a number of Canadian buyers from higher-priced areas in western Canada and Toronto lately.\u201cThey\u2019re cashing in and selling homes there for considerably more money and looking for a smaller city and quieter lifestyle,\u201d Mr. Rutledge said.Halifax also has plenty of foreign buyers, many of whom are seeking vacation or retirement homes, as well as places for their children to live while attending college.

{"Headline": "After Fall of ISIS, Iraq\u2019s Second-Largest City Picks Up the Pieces", "Date": "2017-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMosul JournalMOSUL, Iraq \u2014 In the heat of the late summer sun, weeks after the end of one of the largest urban battles since World War II, a high school principal trekked from his home in east Mosul to the west bank of the Tigris River to confront the ruins of his life\u2019s work.Bordering Mosul\u2019s Old City, his stately Ottoman-era school, where generations of Iraqi political and military leaders studied, lay in ruin. Two campus buildings had been leveled by American coalition airstrikes during the battle against the Islamic State. Century-old stone walls were scarred from shrapnel. The once-gleaming computer lab, library and theater, which in 2014 presented a student production of \u201cMacbeth,\u201d were burned by retreating Islamic State fighters.The scale of devastation at the place he hoped to mold Iraq\u2019s next generation of leaders drew a flutter of despair from the principal, Muthana Saleh. But then he harnessed the traits that residents of Mosul are famous for: ingenuity and industriousness. This month, thanks in part of volunteers and an Iraqi donor, he is planning to restart classes for 450 students.\u201cWe solve problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe find resources. We find a way. It\u2019s the spirit of Mosul.\u201dBut the battle for Mosul lasted nearly nine months, killing thousands of people, displacing nearly a million and leaving entire districts in smoldering heaps of rubble.Around 600,000 people remain displaced, and approximately 60,000 homes are uninhabitable. The city\u2019s business and government sectors are crippled, with at least 20,000 commercial and government buildings destroyed, according to aerial images commissioned by the United Nations.The west side in particular sustained apocalyptic damage. It took six months of grinding street-by-street battles and aerial bombardment to free the area, including the labyrinthine Old City, where the militants made their last stand.\u201cMosul is a tale of two cities,\u201d said Lise Grande, the humanitarian coordinator in Iraq and head of the United Nations Development Program. \u201cIn east Mosul, more than 95 percent of people are home. On the west side, it\u2019s a completely different picture. Yet people are rolling up their sleeves and determined to get their lives back.\u201dSince the summer, the international community has spent about $400 million to help restore electricity, water and medical services, and donor countries, along with the Iraqi government, are struggling to create and finance a comprehensive multibillion-dollar redevelopment plan.In the interim, Muslawis \u2014 as Mosul residents are called \u2014 have mustered their own resources and philanthropic spirit to breathe new life into the city.The highways leading to Mosul are clogged with flatbed trucks bringing in commercial goods and construction materials. On both sides of the river, gleaming rows of washing machines, space heaters and children\u2019s bikes are for sale. Restaurants, especially those with family sections, are doing a roaring business.On Nov. 30, a Mosul nonprofit organized a marathon and shorter foot races for children, an event that drew around 4,000 people.\u201cWe are excited to change the atmosphere of Mosul,\u201d said Feras Khalil, an engineer supervising the reconstruction of Fountain Square, a park along a main commercial street on Mosul\u2019s east side. \u201cWe want to give the opportunity for our neighbors to breathe fresh air after defeating Daesh,\u201d he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.On the east side, the sprawling Mosul University campus hums with activity from the 30,000 students \u2014 men and women \u2014 who are attending classes this fall. Hundreds of students from other parts of Iraq have also re-enrolled, a testament, they say, to their parents\u2019 confidence about security.For centuries, Mosul has been a center of learning. In the Middle Ages, scholars here pioneered surgical techniques and medical instruments still used by contemporary doctors. The university remains highly regarded for its medical and science graduates.During Islamic State rule, however, most classes ground to a halt, both because the group forbade the teaching of what it considered sinful or irrelevant subjects, like art and philosophy, and because professors and students were afraid to venture out of their homes.The campus, like most areas of Mosul, shows scars of conflict. United States coalition airstrikes destroyed four science buildings that the Islamic State had been using as weapons research labs. University administrators say they have no idea how to replace the millions of books from their library, a repository for old manuscripts and research materials, that were burned by the Islamic State, or hundreds of thousands of dollars in science equipment.Yet staff and students have tackled smaller tasks on their own.Professor Intisar Abdel Rada, who has taught accounting for 18 years, helped supervise a group of professors and students who raised money to repair ceilings and electrical wiring in her department\u2019s classrooms, and cleaned and painted lecture halls, work that enabled classes to resume last month. \u201cIt\u2019s like we were dead but have been resuscitated,\u201d she said while rushing between her lectures.A few miles away, at Al Khansaa Pediatric and Maternity Hospital, the director, Dr. Jamal Younis, worked throughout the summer with international aid organizations such as Doctors Without Borders to solve critical needs, like installing generators and incubators to keep the city\u2019s only maternity ward and pediatric surgery theaters operational.He still faces frequent gaps in the daily operating budget \u2014 in October an average of four babies were born at Al Khansaa each day \u2014 but the staff struggled to maintain stocks like surgical gloves and food for patients.For now, his problem solver is Dr. Saad Salih, a surgeon who counts members of Mosul\u2019s wealthiest families as friends.When medicine earmarked for the hospital was stuck in Erbil about 60 miles away, a phone call to a local businessman raised the $500 needed to rent two flatbed trucks to transport the drugs to Mosul. Calls to pharmacy owners have brought in donations of bandages and surgical supplies.Prominent Iraqis outside Mosul have also pitched in. Dr. Salih said a group of British Iraqis had sent funds for hospital supplies. Last week, a man delivered an envelope with $1,200 from a Baghdad-based surgeon who was born in Mosul and wanted to help her hometown.\u201cWe lived through decades where people did not trust each other in Iraq,\u201d Dr. Salih said. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth and a big challenge facing us now. But somehow, now it\u2019s different. People really are motivated to help one another.\u201dAcross the river, in the Old City, the few residents lucky enough to have their homes still standing say they also are invigorated by community spirit.Talal Muhammad, a father of four, has run a small shop in the Old City\u2019s Bab al Bedh district selling dairy goods for 30 years. A Muslawi philanthropist gave him the equivalent of $850 last month to help repair his refrigerators. Those funds helped kick-start a flickering commercial renaissance. Now, amid the rubble, nine shops have reopened.Intisar Mehdi, the matriarch of her 20-member family, said she was the last person to leave the during the fighting this summer and the first to return. She immediately put her four children and 10 grandchildren to work cleaning the ashes and rubble from their house and fix piping to their well.A month ago, she says, her winding lane was quiet and isolated. Now, it\u2019s filled with noise from an army of toddlers and the chatter of housewives exchanging information about developments in the city.About a mile away, at the Sharqiya Secondary School, Mr. Saleh, the principal, is using the challenge of rebuilding as a teachable moment, reflecting the motto that hangs on one of the school\u2019s old stone walls: \u201cThe misfortunes of some can be turned into an advantage for others.\u201dSince August, Mr. Saleh has been fielding calls from dozens of teachers and hundreds of parents pleading to resume classes.He persuaded the police commander responsible for his area to secure the school grounds from bombs and other dangerous material.In October, he organized teachers and administrators in shifts to clear rubble and burned equipment from several buildings. The police commander then put him in touch with a Baghdad-based charity that wanted to donate building equipment.Now, Mr. Saleh says, he will transform his 450 waiting students into a volunteer work force. This week, they plan to install doors and windows in 10 classrooms, enough space to start classes by the end of the year, he says.\u201cNone of us want to lose any more time,\u201d said Ahmed Jassim, 20, who had to delay his senior year of high school during the Islamic State\u2019s occupation. \u201cOur city has major problems that are too huge for us to solve. But this part, we can manage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He told the caller to hold and disappeared into the rear of the store, a stately refuge of red carpet and carved oak book cabinets tucked in the public atrium of the Park Avenue Plaza between 52nd and 53rd Streets.The shop has had a good year, with the British statesman being portrayed in two recent films, \u201cChurchill\u201d and \u201cDarkest Hour,\u201d as well as in the Netflix series, \u201cThe Crown.\u201d The store itself was even featured as a setting recently in the Showtime series \u201cBillions.\u201d But the holiday rush was providing some new challenges for Mr. Singer.Churchill died in 1965 at age 90, leaving an output of more than 40 titles and volumes that have been reprinted in some 8,000 different editions by now.There are also roughly 800 books about Churchill, said Mr. Singer, who added that he\u2019s had a copy of all of them in the store at some point. His inventory ranges from a $10 paperback of \u201cChurchill on Europe\u201d to a 1906 first-edition softcover of \u201cFor Free Trade,\u201d written by the man himself, and stored in a safe at the shop. It goes for a \u201cnegotiable\u201d $185,000, Mr. Singer said.Rare editions of every title Churchill authored can be glimpsed on five shelves locked behind glass doors in the rear of the store: from a first edition of \u201cThe Story of the Malakand Field Force\u201d ($5,500), to a signed volume of one of his final works, \u201cA History of the English Speaking Peoples\u201d ($6,500).The shop has hung on as one of the last independent bookstores in Midtown Manhattan partly because of Mr. Singer\u2019s own Churchillian tenaciousness, and also because the skyscraper\u2019s owners, the Fisher Brothers, have long extended a \u201cfavorable\u201d financial arrangement to Mr. Singer, he said.\u201cThey have a certain affection for the shop,\u201d said Mr. Singer, who, throughout the years, has certainly leveraged the spell that Churchill casts over certain rich and powerful men who admire his resolve and leadership. .For example, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani bought copies of John Lukacs\u2019 \u201cFive Days in London: May, 1940\u201d to lean on, Mr. Singer said.Caspar Weinberger, while serving as secretary of defense under President Ronald Reagan, bought a pile of books and told Mr. Singer to send the bill to the Pentagon, Mr. Singer said.His 2012 book, \u201cChurchill Style: The Art of Being Winston Churchill\u201d is on prominent display in the shop for $25, with signed first editions priced at $50.Mr. Fisher named the shop after Chartwell, Churchill\u2019s country home in Kent, England, but the store wasn\u2019t devoted to Churchill, at first.Mr. Steinberg\u2019s secretary called down to Mr. Singer requesting \u201ca complete set of everything Churchill ever wrote, first edition and bound in leather,\u201d Mr. Singer said.\u201cI asked if he\u2019d like an estimate on that, and she said, \u2018No just do it as soon as possible,\u201d said Mr. Singer, who figured out around this time that perhaps he should streamline his inventory. Mr. Singer spent several years traveling to England. He scoured bookstores and \u201clearned about Churchill on the fly,\u201d he said.Mr. Singer wound up charging Mr. Steinberg $100,000 for the set, half of which was for a rare copy of Churchill\u2019s \u201cMr. Brodrick\u2019s Army.\u201d\u201cHe got a bargain \u2014 it\u2019s worth more now,\u201d said Mr. Singer, who after his first year open, switched to a Churchill theme.Mr. Steinberg kept the set in his 34-room Park Avenue triplex and held on to it for emotional support, Mr. Singer said, even when his losses forced him to sell off many other assets.Mr. Singer reappeared from his office with a Churchill coffee mug, his personal keepsake, grabbed from his desk.\u201cI have one for you,\u201d he told the executive on the phone, a regular customer. \u201cOn the house.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the author of the book, \u201cFive Days in London: May, 1940.\u201d The author was John Lukacs, not Winston Churchill.Advertisement"}

If we\u2019re talking about the securities world of exchanges like the Nasdaq and N.Y.S.E., then yes, it is very much illegal. Don\u2019t do it. But as many of our friends on Twitter pointed out to me, it\u2019s not illegal to trade commodities on inside information, though perhaps it is unethical! And right now, we\u2019re not even fully sure whether Bitcoin is classified as a security or a commodity. What a world.This is obvious to anyone who uses it \u2014 everyone thinks of Uber as a taxi \u2014 but the ruling has a practical effect: it means that Uber cannot use nonprofessional drivers and has to comply with other taxi rules across Europe. And it could affect how other \u201cgig economy\u201d companies \u2014 firms that, like Uber, rely on contractors to service other customers \u2014 operate.Is this a big deal for Uber?Yes, it\u2019s a big deal insofar as it limits a certain type of growth for Uber in Europe, namely the company\u2019s peer-to-peer model, UberX. That basically lets anyone with a working car sign up for Uber, flooding the market with an enormous supply of cars and growing the business immensely. It\u2019s been a boon for Uber in the United States, and the company has hoped to spread that abroad as well.That said, some of Uber\u2019s most successful markets are those in which the company is tightly regulated and treated essentially like a taxi service. In New York, for example, Uber is required to only use drivers who are registered with the Taxi and Limousine Commission \u2014 that is, cab and private drivers \u2014 unlike most of the other cities in the United States. And yet, New York is still a huge market for Uber, where they do quite a bit of business.So does it cripple the business? No, and there are other cities Uber can try to push its UberX option. But it is a bit of a rain on Uber\u2019s money parade.Although to be fair, Jason Bourne is pretty cool. Do you think I could be like him some day?Anyway, it\u2019s a short week.

{"Headline": "A Democratic Chorus Rises in the Senate: \u2018Franken Should Resign\u2019", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Support for Al Franken all but collapsed on Wednesday among his Democratic colleagues in the Senate, with dozens calling for him to resign after a sixth woman said he had made an improper advance on her.\u201cSenator Franken should resign,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Wednesday evening, the latest in an avalanche of statements that began with a half-dozen Democratic women and then snowballed throughout the day. \u201cI consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately.\u201dBy Wednesday evening, there was widespread expectation among senators in the Democratic caucus and aides that Mr. Franken would step down. If he does, he would be the most prominent lawmaker so far to be felled by the swirling allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct sweeping through the Capitol.A freshman Democrat, Representative Ruben Kihuen of Nevada, has faced calls for his resignation since charges emerged Friday that he had repeatedly propositioned his former campaign finance director.Accusations against Mr. Franken include an episode of forcible kissing on a U.S.O. tour before he was elected and several allegations that he groped women as he posed with them for photographs.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, also called on Wednesday for Mr. Franken to leave the Senate.Some have said Democrats are simply too quick to destroy their own, but the party appears intent on holding the high ground as sexual harassment scandals rock politics, entertainment and the news media.\u201cThe Democratic Party will stand up for women and for what is right,\u201d Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday night. \u201cPublic service is a public trust. If you are a candidate for office or an elected official who has engaged in sexual misconduct, you should step aside \u2014 whether you sit in the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate or the Oval Office.\u201dIf Mr. Franken resigns, the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Mark Dayton, could choose his successor from a list of prominent female Democrats, including Lt. Gov. Tina Smith and Attorney General Lori Swanson.That appointee could then run to fill the remainder of Mr. Franken\u2019s term next year, when the Democrats have the political momentum.Mr. Schumer quietly worked through the day to urge Mr. Franken to step aside. According to a person familiar with the conversations, Mr. Schumer called Mr. Franken before any of his fellow senators went public with their resignation calls and later met with Mr. Franken and his wife in Mr. Schumer\u2019s Washington apartment.Ms. Gillibrand was joined by Senators Mazie K. Hirono of Hawaii, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Dianne Feinstein of California, Patty Murray of Washington State, Kamala Harris of California, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Maria Cantwell of Washington State, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who issued statements after talking privately with each other for weeks about what to do about Mr. Franken.Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, added his support, as did Senators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, as well as Mr. Perez of the Democratic National Committee.\u201cIt\u2019s time for him to resign,\u201d Mr. Durbin said. \u201cIt just seemed that the credible charges continued. I thought it might be an isolated incident or two. It seems to be that there was a pattern of conduct.\u201dBy the end of the day, well more than half of the senators who caucus with the Democrats, 35 of 48, and nearly all of the Democratic women in the Senate, had said that Mr. Franken must go. Some who remained silent did so because they serve on the Ethics Committee, which is considering his case.Mr. Franken has apologized for his behavior, but the senators said his admissions are not enough. Ms. Hirono said Wednesday\u2019s outpouring came after much thought.\u201cWe have been in touch with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult because I consider Al a friend. I\u2019ve sat with him in two committees, but that doesn\u2019t excuse his behavior.\u201dShe added: \u201cWe\u2019re at the point where I think that there can be a cultural change in terms of how women are perceived and treated in this country.

{"Headline": "China Scolds Australia Over Its Fears of Foreign Influence", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The Chinese Embassy in Australia accused Australian officials on Wednesday of \u201cmaking irresponsible remarks\u201d and damaging \u201cmutual trust,\u201d a day after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull unveiled a series of proposed laws to curb foreign influence in Australian politics.The new legislation, modeled on American laws that ban foreign campaign donations and require registration of foreign agents, had been widely expected after a drumbeat of stories in the Australian news media about the perceived threat of Chinese interference.It was not the legislation that the Chinese statement directly condemned, but rather the media accounts that prompted it, as well as the public debate around the issue. Both have zeroed in on China as a threat, accusing the country of trying to exert influence through political donations and pressure applied to Chinese students at Australian universities.\u201cWe categorically reject those allegations,\u201d the embassy said in its statement, adding: \u201cChina has no intention to interfere in Australia\u2019s internal affairs or exert influence on its political process through political donations. We urge the Australian side to look at China and China-Australia relations in an objective, fair and rational manner.\u201dThe statement pointed to strong discontent from China\u2019s leaders in Beijing, and it amounted to a warning for Australian politicians against continuing to portray China as an enemy. But experts said the statement might only heighten concerns about China\u2019s influence and damage its already tarnished image in Australia.\u201cOver all there is a sense of overreach by China, and the way this statement is worded will compound that,\u201d said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at Australian National University. \u201cThis statement will be seen as unhelpful and provocative in some circles in Australia.\u201dChina has long treated Australia as a laboratory for soft power experiments, flexing its economic muscle, sending students to study at its universities and creating organizations with close ties to the Communist Party.The proposed new foreign influence laws are one clear result of such concerns. But it is unclear to what extent China is concerned about the laws themselves.One provision would require people working on behalf of another country to register with the Australian government, as is mandated in the United States. Among the other proposals, there are plans to create an offense known as unlawful interference in Australia\u2019s political system, which would include behaviors \u2014 as yet unspecified \u2014 that harm the national interest.Some people who are especially concerned about Chinese interference in Australia have welcomed the proposals as much-needed counterweights.China may see the laws as inevitable, he said.If that is the case, some experts argue, the embassy\u2019s statement Wednesday may in fact be an effort to pressure the Australian news media, and to influence how the media is perceived by the Chinese Australian community.The embassy statement focused intensely on media accounts of \u201cso-called Chinese influence and infiltration,\u201d arguing that they were \u201cmade up out of thin air\u201d and reflected \u201ca typical anti-China hysteria.\u201dIt also argued that Australia\u2019s discussion about China\u2019s role has \u201cunscrupulously vilified the Chinese students as well as the Chinese community in Australia with racial prejudice, which in turn has tarnished Australia\u2019s reputation as a multicultural society.\u201dJohn Fitzgerald, a professor at Swinburne University who spent five years representing the Ford Foundation in China, said the Chinese government seemed to be trying to portray itself as the defender of Chinese Australians against the Australian news media.\u201cThe embassy itself is stirring up concerns within the Chinese Australian community that have no foundation,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald said, adding: \u201cThe media is not attacking the Chinese Australian community. The media is being very specific about Communist Party interference in this country.\u201dSo far, Australian officials have chosen not to escalate the argument. Julie Bishop, Australia\u2019s foreign minister, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the Australian government \u201cenjoys a respectful and constructive relationship with China.\u201dMr. Medcalf said the statement from the Chinese Embassy had one line that could be helpful: \u201cChina has no intention to interfere in Australia\u2019s internal affairs or exert influence on its political process through political donations.\u201d\u201cThat is a statement China will be held to,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope China is serious.\u201dJacqueline Williams contributed reporting from Canberra, Australia.Advertisement"}

Le plus souvent, les appels concernent les visas ou des pr\u00e9cisions sur la loi du travail. Mais r\u00e9cemment, un homme d\u2019affaires du Japon avait une question casse-t\u00eate : o\u00f9, demandait-il, se trouvent les clubs de danse ?\u00ab C\u2019\u00e9tait un genre de club dont personne chez nous n\u2019avait entendu parler \u00bb, se souvient Robin Rivaton, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019organisation. \u00ab Une esp\u00e8ce de club pour les cadres sup\u00e9rieurs et leurs femmes. Un de nos gars s\u2019est mis \u00e0 passer des coups de fil et a fini par en trouver un dans l\u2019ouest de Paris \u00bb.Un sentiment d\u2019urgence pointe sous ces mesures. Des centaines d\u2019entreprises financi\u00e8res devront sans doute muter des employ\u00e9s depuis Londres avant que la Grande Bretagne ne quitte l\u2019Union Europ\u00e9enne, \u00e0 la fin mars 2019, dans le cadre de ce qu\u2019on appelle le Brexit. Ces entreprises risqueraient sinon de perdre leur droit d\u2019op\u00e9rer \u00e0 travers l\u2019Europe, autrement dit un acc\u00e8s privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 aux 27 pays encore membres de l\u2019Union Europ\u00e9enne.Paris rivalise avec Dublin, Francfort et Luxembourg, dans un concours qui ne mesure pas d\u2019abord la beaut\u00e9. Pour s\u00e9duire un conseil d\u2019administration, il faut avant tout pouvoir offrir un environnement l\u00e9gal, r\u00e9glementaire et culturel favorable aux entreprises \u2014 et dans le pass\u00e9, Paris se refusait \u00e0 ce genre d\u2019accueil chaleureux.\u00ab Aucun des h\u00e9ros dont on vous parle quand vous grandissez en France n\u2019est un entrepreneur \u00bb, explique Brigitte Granville, professeur d\u2019\u00e9conomie \u00e0 l\u2019universit\u00e9 Queen Mary de Londres, qui fut \u00e9lev\u00e9e en France. \u00ab Quand quelqu\u2019un s\u2019enrichit en France, les gens se demandent tout de suite \u2018Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019il a fait pour gagner autant ? C\u2019est s\u00fbrement un m\u00e9chant\u2019. \u00bbOn s\u2019accorde \u00e0 faire remonter cette attitude \u00e0 la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise qui, explique Mme Granville, a \u00e9lev\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 au rang de quasi-religion. Quand le pr\u00e9sident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande d\u00e9clara en 2012 que son \u2018v\u00e9ritable adversaire\u2019 \u00e9tait \u2018le monde de la finance\u2019, il ne faisait que r\u00e9sumer un sentiment somme toute assez r\u00e9pandu.Mais aujourd\u2019hui, une nouvelle cohorte de dirigeants, en particulier le pr\u00e9sident libre-\u00e9changiste Emmanuel Macron, entreprend avec vigueur de se d\u00e9faire de cette r\u00e9putation anticapitaliste. En pleine campagne \u00e9lectorale, il s\u2019\u00e9tait rendu \u00e0 Londres pour encourager les expatri\u00e9s fran\u00e7ais, au nombre d\u2019environ 400 000, \u00e0 rentrer en France et \u00e0 \u00ab innover \u00bb. Et depuis son \u00e9lection, le gouvernement s\u2019adonne \u00e0 une campagne tr\u00e8s agressive dont l\u2019objectif est de souffler des emplois \u00e0 Londres.Cette campagne fut lanc\u00e9e le jour de l\u2019annonce des r\u00e9sultats du vote sur le Brexit, le 24 juin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re. Dans l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi, l\u2019agence Paris R\u00e9gion bombardait des dizaines de sites web de bandeaux publicitaires (\u2018Choose Paris Region\u2019 \u2014 Choisissez Paris Region \u2014 pas tr\u00e8s accrocheur comme slogan). Quelques semaines plus tard, 4 000 envois sont partis par la poste vers des entreprises du monde entier.Le gouvernement fran\u00e7ais a \u00e9galement nomm\u00e9 l\u2019ancien dirigeant de la Banque de France Christian Noyer comme r\u00e9f\u00e9rent fran\u00e7ais du Brexit. C\u2019est un diplomate-n\u00e9 \u00e0 qui on ne peut pas faire dire du mal de ses concurrents. Tout au plus qualifie-t-il Francfort de \u00ab petite et provinciale \u00bb, tout en s\u2019empressant d\u2019ajouter que \u00ab il y en a qui aiment \u00e7a \u00bb.S\u2019il fait rarement la promotion de ce que Paris a de plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, ses rues magnifiques et ses excellents restaurants, il pense qu\u2019ils joueront leur part, si petite soit-elle, dans certains choix de relocalisation.Une entreprise peut choisir d\u2019envoyer ses employ\u00e9s o\u00f9 bon lui semble, expliqua M. Noyer au cours d\u2019une br\u00e8ve interview dans le lobby d\u2019un h\u00f4tel londonien. \u00ab Mais si une concurrente choisit une ville plus attractive, ses meilleurs employ\u00e9s pourrait \u00eatre tent\u00e9s de partir au bout de quelques mois pour un poste dans une ville plus agr\u00e9able \u00bb.Des \u00e9lus locaux estiment \u00e0 environ 10 000 le nombre d\u2019emplois qui seront transf\u00e9r\u00e9s de Londres \u00e0 Paris suite au Brexit. Il n\u2019est pas certain que ce chiffre soit atteint, mais certains signes indiquent d\u00e9j\u00e0 que la carte de Paris est dans le jeu.HSBC annon\u00e7a cet \u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pourrait transf\u00e9rer 1 000 postes depuis Londres. En septembre, Bank of America n\u00e9gociait la location de bureaux dans le quartier de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe, dans la perspective d\u2019un premier transfert de 300 employ\u00e9s.\u00ab L\u2019id\u00e9e que ce sont ses imp\u00f4ts \u00e9lev\u00e9s qui d\u00e9tournent les entreprises de la France est un faux argument qu\u2019on nous sert pour faire passer des politiques autrement plus difficiles \u00e0 justifier aux yeux de la population \u00bb, estime Alexandre Derigny, secr\u00e9taire adjoint de la f\u00e9d\u00e9ration finances \u00e0 la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9nerale du Travail.Le relooking \u00e9conomique de la France suscite aussi quelques commentaires moqueurs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Il sentirait la tentative d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e, si l\u2019on en croit Nicolas Mackel, PDG de Luxembourg for Finance, un partenariat public-priv\u00e9. M. Mackel est fier de dire que le grand-duch\u00e9 n\u2019a pas fait appel aux tactiques d\u00e9ploy\u00e9es par Paris.\u00ab Vous m\u2019accuserez de taper sur les Fran\u00e7ais \u00bb, dit-il r\u00e9cemment en prenant le th\u00e9, \u00ab mais cette ann\u00e9e ils ont annonc\u00e9 qu\u2019ils mettraient en place des r\u00e9gulateurs anglophones. Nous, on n\u2019a pas besoin de faire \u00e7a, nos r\u00e9gulateurs sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 anglophones, et depuis toujours \u00bb.La mise en place de fonctionnaires anglophones ne serait qu\u2019un d\u00e9but prometteur pour la France. Le pays poss\u00e8de un nombre si d\u00e9concertant de couches administratives qu\u2019on parle, sans affection, de \u00ab mille-feuille \u00bb, \u00e0 l\u2019image de cette p\u00e2tisserie particuli\u00e8rement dense.Certaines des tentatives pour r\u00e9soudre ce probl\u00e8me sont entreprises \u00e0 huis-clos. L\u2019un de ces huis-clos se situe au quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tage du Minist\u00e8re de l'\u00c9conomie et des Finances \u00e0 Bercy, un immense immeuble de style brutaliste abritant des milliers de fonctionnaires et plusieurs hectares de bureaux standardis\u00e9s.Une pi\u00e8ce a r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 agenc\u00e9e aux airs de salle de brainstorming pour start-ups.

{"Headline": "Santa in Finland, Where Marketing Triumphs Over Geography", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRovaniemi JournalA couple of hundred yards away in a competing venue is Second Santa, whose real name is Kari Eskeli, 65, also a Finn. As soon as Christmas is over, he goes back home to the warmth of the Spanish Canary Islands. \u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he chuckled at the end of a long recent day of receiving supplicants. \u201cHo ho ho.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s Evil Santa, as he calls himself, an outspoken raconteur holding forth in his son\u2019s busy souvenir shop just downstairs from official Santa\u2019s grotto.\u201cThis place is exploding now, it\u2019s really taking off,\u201d said Wolfgang Kassik, an Austrian business consultant with a long gray, all-natural beard, who is married to a Finn. \u201cPersonally, though, I don\u2019t like kids.\u201dThat could be a problem.At this time of year around 20 airliners a day, chartered and scheduled, land here in the capital of Finnish Lapland, disgorging families from scores of countries, and bringing wide-eyed children to a reliably snowy place that is, for youngsters at least, a convincing recreation of the North Pole (which is actually 1,600 miles north), complete with reindeer-drawn sleighs, staff in elfin dress and an official Finnish government \u201cSanta\u2019s post office.\u201dThe dedicated Santa postal code of 96930 attracts half a million letters a year.While no more real than the Santa impersonators\u2019 beards, Rovaniemi\u2019s claim to be the base of the one and only true Santa is nonetheless a triumph of marketing, so much so that the town has trademarked its rubric, \u201cThe Official Hometown of Santa Claus. \u00ae\u201dAnd for those who fret about the growing secularization of Christmas \u2014 with each year more and more X, and less and less Christ \u2014 they need only drop in here to confirm some of their worst fears.Rumor has it there is a cr\u00e8che somewhere in Santa Claus Village, but finding it is a challenge.Despite temperatures in the single digits Fahrenheit \u2014 and nights now 22 hours long \u2014 330,000 people from 180 countries, according to current figures, come to visit Santa, purchase 50 euro ($60) photos with him and patronize the dozens of Christmas trinket shops.Many of the tourists are neither Christians nor even from countries that celebrate Christmas. The largest single group of visitors are Chinese, who typically come without their children because there are no school holidays this time of year in China.That does not stop them from getting in the lines at the Santa grottoes to meet the jolly old Finns who often play the role to the hilt.\u201cWhat\u2019s your real name?\u201d many of the adult visitors ask official Santa, and he has a stock answer.\u201cIt\u2019s Santa Claus.\u201d If they still insist, \u201cYour original name?\u201d then he responds, \u201dOriginally it was Joulupukki.\u201dJoulupukki is the name of Finns\u2019 traditional Santa Claus figure, but therein lies both the rub, and the triumph, of marketing. Literally the name means Yule Goat, and the Finnish character historically was a sort of troll who was used to threaten children who were naughty.Fifty years ago, travel marketers got the idea to attract tourists to remote Lapland and settled on Rovaniemi for its train station and airport. For many years, though, the Santa Claus attraction jostled for visitors with tours to see the Northern Lights or go on reindeer safaris; most of those who came were from countries with a strong Christmas tradition, bringing children along on the ultimate Santa\u2019s Grotto experience.Barry and Leanne Smyth, from Ireland, brought their daughters, Lauren, 9, and Jodie, 4, here last week, after a box of presents arrived at their house early with a note inside from Santy (as they know him in Ireland), inviting the girls to visit him in person. They found a flight to Helsinki, then all four crammed into a compartment with two beds on the overnight train to Rovaniemi, 500 miles to the north.\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep a wink,\u201d Mr. Smyth, an accountant, said. \u201cBut the girls loved it.\u201d The girls thanked Santa for his invitation (the parents exchanged a furtive glance) and asked, as many children do these days, for a slime factory.Tian Zhang was here then, studying for her master\u2019s degree, and would only rarely see another Chinese. She never imagined what would happen next.\u201cXi Jinping became the president and everyone in China says Finland is a lucky land,\u201d she said.Chinese tourism steadily increased, helped by Finnish official visits that marketed Lapland as Santa\u2019s home tundra. \u201cA lot of Chinese now think the North Pole is here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just grew and grew.\u201dIn recent years, Santa tourism has grown so drastically that \u201cit\u2019s like everyone is building a hotel,\u201d Ms. Zhang said. Now an entrepreneur and married to a Finn, she was in charge of one of the new hotels, the first Chinese-financed one. It opened five months ago and is already running at full occupancy, she said.Three 30-year-old women from Macau found it hard to explain why they had come, as they waited for their portraits with Santa to be printed.\u201cI just wanted to say I saw Santa Claus,\u201d Sukie Wong said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for anything.\u201dOne of the women, the Santa confided later, asked him for a boyfriend, which he said was a common request from unmarried Asian women.At the Rovaniemi Lutheran Church where the local pastors Topi Litendahl and Elina Rask-Litendahl work, Christmas Eve services are in several languages, including English, Hebrew and Arabic, just in case any tourists want to stop by. Every year only a couple of dozen do, about the only visible religious aspect to the tourist juggernaut.\u201cThe Santa Claus of tourism and the Christmas of Christian faith, they can coexist quite nicely,\u201d Ms. Rask-Litendahl said.No amount of commercialization can wipe the Christmas wonder from a child\u2019s eyes. For most of the youngsters coming through, Rovaniemi gives them a thoroughly convincing spectacle, from real igloos and ice furniture outside the downtown shopping mall, to tastefully done log-cabin style towers at the Santa village.\u201cGrazie grazie, Babbo Natale,\u201d said Serena Rallo, 6, her eyes misting up and her face beaming as she posed for a picture hugging Second Santa. Her father, Vincenzo, an Italian who lives in Paris, was even more excited. \u201cGentile, gentile,\u201d so kind, he kept telling Mr. Eskeli. \u201cI hope you bring her lots of toys, because she\u2019s really been great this year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Next Crisis for Puerto Rico: A Crush of Foreclosures", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPuerto Rico has had an awful decade \u2014 and it\u2019s about to get worse.First came a brutal 10-year recession and financial crisis that drove businesses from this island and left 44 percent of the population impoverished. Then, in September, Hurricane Maria, a powerful Category 4 storm, shredded buildings, wrecked the electrical power grid and possibly led to more than 1,000 deaths.About one-third of the island\u2019s 425,000 homeowners are behind on their mortgage payments to banks and Wall Street firms that previously bought up distressed mortgages. Tens of thousands have not made payments for months. Some 90,000 borrowers became delinquent as a consequence of Hurricane Maria, according to Black Knight Inc., a data firm formerly known as Black Knight Financial Services.Puerto Rico\u2019s 35 percent foreclosure and delinquency rate is more than double the 14.4 percent national rate during the depths of the housing implosion in January 2010. And there is no prospect of the problem\u2019s solving itself or quickly.\u201cIf there is no income, the people cannot make payments,\u201d said Ricardo Ramos-Gonz\u00e1lez, coordinator of a consumer legal aid clinic at the University of Puerto Rico School of Law. \u201cThousands have lost their jobs, thousands of small business have closed, and thousands more have left the country.\u201dResidents won a reprieve when the federal government imposed a temporary moratorium on foreclosures, which stops banks and investors that bought mortgages at cut-rate prices from evicting delinquent borrowers or starting new foreclosures. Many lenders also have agreed to waive missed payments during the moratorium.But that moratorium is scheduled to expire in early 2018, and lawyers and housing counselors expect that to trigger a surge in foreclosures.\u201cWe will see an avalanche of cases,\u201d said Josue Castellanos-Otero, a lawyer, who said many of his housing clients were focused on getting insurance companies to pay to fix their damaged homes.Repairing the housing market in Puerto Rico will take more than rebuilding storm-damaged homes and the electrical grid. It will involve banks and investors reworking tens of thousands of troubled mortgages and waiving missed payments.The looming housing crisis threatens to upend the social structure on the island and means the aftereffects of the storm will be felt for years to come. It could be particularly painful for the elderly, who often have limited incomes and whose homes tend to be their most valuable assets.Even before the storm, Puerto Rico was mired in a severe housing slump. Home prices over the past decade have fallen by 25 percent, and lenders have foreclosed or filed to foreclose on 60,000 home loans, according to the Puerto Rico state court system. Last year, there were 7,682 court-ordered foreclosures \u2014 a roughly 33 percent increase from 2007. Some 13,000 foreclosure cases are pending, Black Knight estimates.And that is how Wall Street got into the mix.The recent devastation is likely to further depress housing prices. That\u2019s partly because the \u201cmass exodus\u201d of Puerto Ricans going to the continental United States means the demand for housing \u201chas gone down substantially,\u201d said Laurie Goodman, director of the Urban Institute\u2019s Housing Finance Policy Center.If normal patterns held, that would be bad news for the investment firms that gambled on Puerto Rico\u2019s housing market. But normal patterns don\u2019t necessarily apply here, given that some mortgages are guaranteed by a federal insurance fund.Consider Blackstone Group, the big private equity firm. Blackstone owns a company, Finance of America Reverse, that specializes in a type of home loan called a reverse mortgage, which is guaranteed by the federal government.There are 10,000 reverse mortgages in Puerto Rico, and Finance of America controls about 40 percent of the market, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the government insurance fund that guarantees a lender will be repaid on a reverse mortgage.If Finance of America sells a foreclosed home for less than the value of the mortgage, the firm can make a claim to the insurance fund to make up the difference. In that case, taxpayers would be on the hookCourt records show that the Blackstone-controlled company is aggressive in its pursuit of \u2014 and foreclosures on \u2014 borrowers.Since 2015, Finance of America and a predecessor firm have filed 500 foreclosures in federal court.Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez \u201cfeels harassed\u201d after Finance of America initiated a foreclosure case against him for the third time in two years, according to his lawyer, Juan Carlos Cancio-Reichard. He said the first two cases had been dismissed after the lender incorrectly claimed Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez, 73, had not paid for homeowner\u2019s insurance on the property.Now Finance of America has claimed Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez did not pay property taxes on the house \u2014 something the borrower disputes. Mr. Cancio-Reichard said his client had recently gotten the Puerto Rico Treasury Department to certify there were no unpaid taxes on his account. The lawyer is asking Finance of America\u2019s lawyer to voluntarily dismiss the case.\u201cJos\u00e9 thinks they want to get him out of the house,\u201d Mr. Cancio-Reichard said.Sara Sefcovic, a Finance of America spokeswoman, said the firm could not speak about specific cases, but \u201cforeclosure is a last resort for our company.\u201dShe added that the firm is \u201crequired to follow federal guidelines for this program and have virtually no discretion over whether or not to initiate a foreclosure proceeding.\u201dTo file a foreclosure for any reason other than the death of the borrower, a reverse mortgage lender must get approval from an outside mortgage-servicing firm working for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Over the past three years, the department has given more than 1,500 such approvals to reverse mortgage lenders in Puerto Rico.Many offshore lenders like Finance of America file foreclosure lawsuits in federal court in San Juan, where proceedings move much faster than in the island\u2019s territorial courts.It\u2019s not just speed. In federal court, all legal filings are in English. In local court, they are in Spanish. Not being able to read legal filings puts defendants at a disadvantage.\u201cSometimes people don\u2019t show up in federal court because they don\u2019t even know they have been sued,\u201d said Carmen Cosme, a housing counselor.Ms. Sefcovic said Finance of America \u201cwill provide documents for borrowers in Spanish to the extent allowed by H.U.D. and the law.\u201dThe moratorium imposed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development on the more than 117,000 mortgages it insures in Puerto Rico, such as the reverse mortgage on Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez\u2019s home, will expire on March 18. A moratorium on mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is due to expire on Dec. 31, although it is likely to be extended for a few months.Mr. Ramos and other housing counselors said they would like the moratorium extended for a full year, although others argue that would only postpone an inevitable wave of foreclosures.The moratorium doesn\u2019t appear to be airtight. Finance of America Reverse, for instance, filed three foreclosure cases after the moratorium began on Sept. 17.Ms. Sefcovic, the company spokeswoman, said the three cases \u201cwere referred to foreclosure\u201d before the hurricane hit and the moratorium took effect.Others continue to battle Finance of America in court despite the moratorium.Leila Hern\u00e1ndez Umpierre said her parents, both in their 80s, were being sued for a second time by Finance of America. Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez Umpierre, a lawyer, said that her parents, who bought their house in Bayam\u00f3n, P.R., in 1958, had been living without electrical power since the storm hit and that the stress of the looming foreclosure was adding to their anxiety.\u201cMy father and mother don\u2019t have much money, as do many older people in Puerto Rico,\u201d said Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez Umpierre, who spoke on behalf of her parents, Minerva Umpierre Vazquez and Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cMy father doesn\u2019t want to talk to about it. It is very stressful for him.\u201dFinance of America, in court papers, said the foreclosure was warranted because the couple had failed to pay for homeowner\u2019s insurance.But the couple\u2019s lawyer, Jorge A. Fern\u00e1ndez-Reboredo, said there was proof the insurance was paid. When the lender raised a similar claim in a 2015 foreclosure lawsuit, a federal judge dismissed the case, noting that Finance of America\u2019s \u201ccomplaint fails to sufficiently specify grounds on which plaintiff seeks to initiate foreclosure.\u201d\u201cThey are being pretty aggressive,\u201d Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez-Reboredo said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debt Concerns, Once a Core Republican Tenet, Take a Back Seat to Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 In 2009, almost every Republican in Congress opposed a $787 billion stimulus plan in the midst of an economic crisis because they said it would cause a dangerous increase in the federal debt.Nine years later, during one of the longest economic expansions in American history, almost every Republican in Congress \u2014 including Mr. McConnell, now the majority leader \u2014 supports a tax plan that is projected to cause an even larger increase in the federal debt.Republicans got to that extraordinary point by a tangled path. First they argued that the tax cuts would stimulate the economy enough to pay for themselves, only to be confronted on Thursday with a report that said the cuts would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade. That bad news led to last-minute convulsions and a frantic search for more revenue.But in the end, the political imperative to pass what would be the only major piece of legislation of President Trump\u2019s first year, along with a near-religious Republican belief in tax cuts, overrode their previous concerns about fiscal prudence.All but one Republican senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, voted for the bill early Saturday.The House and the Senate still have to reach a final agreement on the details, and Mr. Trump has to sign his name, but the Republican Party now stands on the verge of driving up the national debt after spending much of the last decade promising rectitude and criticizing Democrats for profligacy.Alan Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, and Erskine Bowles, formerly President Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, said the current crop of Republicans are avoiding \u201cnearly all the hard choices.\u201dMr. McConnell has a well-documented history of fretting about the debt.Last year, with Republicans in control of the House and the Senate and about to claim the White House, he reiterated his distaste for debt. \u201cI think this level of national debt is dangerous and unacceptable,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cMy preference on tax reform is that it be revenue neutral.\u201dHe continued in words that now seem particularly striking. \u201cWhat I hope we will clearly avoid, and I\u2019m confident we will, is a trillion-dollar stimulus,\u201d he said. \u201cTake you back to 2009. We borrowed $1 trillion and nobody could find that it did much of anything. So we need to do this carefully and correctly, and the issue of how to pay for it needs to be dealt with responsibly.\u201dHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who shepherded the House\u2019s version of the tax bill \u2014 which also would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade \u2014 has assiduously cultivated a reputation for concern about the federal debt.Senate Republicans\u2019 tax cut would not pay for itself, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.In 2011 he released \u201cThe Path to Prosperity,\u201d a budget plan proposing large spending cuts to balance the books. He said fiscal discipline was unpopular but necessary.\u201cWhat I do know is I can\u2019t look my kids and my constituents in the eyes with my conscience being clear and not know that I didn\u2019t do everything I could to try and fix this problem,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a 2011 interview with CNBC.In 2013, he said the debt \u201cwill weigh down our country like an anchor.\u201dAt the time, the federal debt held by investors equaled 72 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. The Republican tax plan could push that to 85 percent by 2021, Goldman Sachs estimated Wednesday, which would be the highest debt ratio since the immediate aftermath of World War II.\u201cPassing tax reform is the single most important thing that Congress can do to make American companies more competitive,\u201d Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, said last month.A number of prominent Republicans have defiantly insisted that economic forecasters are wrong about the likely cost of the tax cuts. They say the legislation will cause a surge of economic growth that will allow the government to collect just as much money at lower tax rates.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, dismissed the analysis of the economists Congress employs for that purpose, using techniques he has endorsed, as \u201ccurious.\u201dRepublicans also have long distinguished between deficits caused by spending increases and deficits caused by tax cuts. They argue that tax cuts are good for the economy, and that the resulting problem of larger deficits should be addressed by reducing government spending.\u201cYou also have to bring spending under control,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said last week. \u201cAnd not discretionary spending. That isn\u2019t the driver of our debt. The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries.\u201dThe tax cuts, however, would increase the scale of that challenge.\u201cReagan proved that deficits don\u2019t matter,\u201d Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2002. Many Republicans take the view that the George W. Bush administration\u2019s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 proved the same point.But federal borrowing imposes real economic costs, not least the need to make interest payments. It also restricts the funding available to private-sector investors. And experts continue to warn that the United States is on an unsustainable trajectory, particularly because the government has promised benefits to an expanding population of older Americans that will further outstrip tax revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s the type of thing that should keep people awake at night,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the outgoing Federal Reserve chairwoman, told a congressional committee last week.But in Washington, in 2017, such warnings are no longer in vogue.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

He sowed another season\u2019s crop of soybeans on his southern Ohio farm, repaired machinery and raced to get the harvest done amid weeks of punishing rainstorms.But grief has shadowed him at every furrow and turn, he said, still as sharp and raw as when his daughter, Heather Himes, and his son Eugene died several months apart after long struggles with heroin addiction.\u201cThere\u2019s no medicines that can cure this,\u201d Mr. Winemiller, 61, said. \u201cYou just find ways to cope with it and go on with life. There\u2019s no other choice.\u201dHe has tried to balance caring for himself and looking after his sole surviving son, Roger Winemiller Jr., who is battling the addictions that killed his siblings.Now, Roger Jr. drives himself to counseling and to doctor\u2019s appointments. He talks excitedly about becoming a drug counselor himself, and has his eyes trained on Jan. 5 \u2014 his one-year anniversary sober. \u201cPhenomenal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the benchmark.\u201dHe found a temporary job packaging croutons and salad dressings for pre-made meals, but the work comes in unpredictable spurts. He still lives with his father on the family farm, in his childhood bedroom, and they have clashed at times over their shared and separate pain.Mr. Winemiller said he was proud of his son\u2019s progress, but seeing his two other children falter during recovery and slip back into drug use has made him wary and mistrustful. When gas money gets spent quickly, Mr. Winemiller said he found himself prodding his son about where it all went.\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily believe him all the time,\u201d he said.He has tried to address his own grief, but one therapist moved away and another seemed to do little else than listen, he said. He has gone through depressions that seemed to darken and ease almost with the seasons. What some people fail to understand, Mr. Winemiller said, is that even as months pass, the loss and grief are always there.\u201cI miss my kids,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I am very grateful for Roger still being here and still being sober and doing what he\u2019s doing. I\u2019m very blessed. But I just feel so empty.\u201dJack Healy_____Before the sun had risen on a cold December morning, Irvi Cruz stood in his Harlem apartment slicing apples and cucumbers for his 3- and 5-year-old daughters, Ana and Sara, while the girls sat on the couch, spellbound by cartoons.The pressure that prompted their agreement has not let up \u2014 it\u2019s only increased. For years, Mr. Cruz, who is undocumented and has no path toward legal status even through marriage, and Ms. McCormick, his American-born wife, have strained to function as a normal family, despite the fear that one false step could rip them apart. The Trump administration\u2019s unbridled enforcement of immigration laws has intensified the threat, as the authorities scour the country, targeting more people for deportation.But their bargain has also forced the couple to reckon with the parts of their lives that they have decided are worth the risk: The slanted grin that sweeps across Ana\u2019s face each morning when Mr. Cruz tells her that it\u2019s time to go to her Spanish-immersion preschool or the way that Sara swells with excitement to meet her friends at her favorite park.\u201cTaking everything away, it\u2019s hard,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.Caitlin Dickerson_____This month, a judge granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the Keiths and their neighbors, concluding that city leaders could not fine people for code violations as a way to force them to give up their homes. It was a victory for Pleasant Ridge, a battered neighborhood of prefabricated World War II-era homes in this southern Indiana city.\u201cWe won that part, yes,\u201d said Mr. Keith, who is 69 and has lived here for decades.\u201cBut really, things have gotten worse,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found out is that there are quite a few people around here who want Pleasant Ridge gone. We used to feel like we were upstanding citizens and part of the community. Now people look down their noses at us, like you are messing up their city.\u201dSince the fight over Pleasant Ridge began, Ellen Keith, 64, said she had lost clients at the Hair & Such Beauty Salon where she cuts hair. Mr. Keith said the couple had lost friends. Even some of his relatives, he said, seem to think that Charlestown would be better off without Pleasant Ridge, which city officials say draws a disproportionate amount of crime, drugs and animal control nuisances.City officials, who did not return phone messages, have announced they will appeal the court ruling. But even as the debate has played out, Pleasant Ridge has emptied; people sold their homes and moved away.\u201cThe neighborhood really looks sad now,\u201d Ms. Keith said. \u201cThere are lots of boarded-up places. It has done something for the people who are left though. Our little community? We are bonded like glue.\u201dMonica Davey_____Now it was time to get out of Flint, Mich.Mr. Allen had applied to a college in North Carolina, 600 miles away, and received an acceptance letter. He was ready to break out on his own, leaving behind the tainted-water crisis that had plagued life in Flint for years.At 19, Mr. Allen would be far away from so many comforts: his mother, stepfather and siblings on the North Side of the city. The tight circle of friends he had known his whole life. The familiar, if damaged, cocoon of his hometown.Packing up and leaving started to feel impossible.\u201cWhen I really sat down and started thinking about my future, I just didn\u2019t want to struggle on my own,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cThere would have been nobody there to turn to if I needed something.\u201dThis summer, amid a swirl of parties and trips to amusement parks with his friends, Mr. Allen made a new plan. He enrolled at Mott Community College in Flint, ready to study finance and business administration.When college classes began this fall, they were nothing like high school.\u201cAfter graduation, life just hits you right in the face,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t no more your mom waking you up for school. You have to wake yourself up, manage your own life. Everything is just overwhelming.\u201dThe professors had high expectations, far tougher than Mr. Allen was used to. They expected him to arrive in class on time, turn in assignments without delay, keep up with the reading.He struggled at first. But then he fell into a new rhythm of life \u2014 get his college work done, go to church on Sunday, teach dance classes on the weekends.A circle of friends gave him encouragement, group-texting daily and checking in on one another.He is lining up goals for 2018. He wants to start a local nonprofit devoted to the arts, to help Flint kids like himself.The drinking water at his family\u2019s house should be better by now. The city installed new pipes this year at Treveyon\u2019s home, one of the more than 5,000 residences to receive new service lines. The family is still using bottled water, wary of promises from city officials that the water is fine.\u201cI don\u2019t want to see Flint fail,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cI still have hope for Flint. When I get older, I plan on moving, but I\u2019ll always come back and support Flint. Everything about it, all the cracks and the bruises and the messed-up water. It\u2019s home.\u201d Julie BosmanAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans\u2019 Tax Bill Nears the Finish Line", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Lawmakers are expected to be briefed on the consensus deal later on Wednesday, ahead of a final vote next week.\u2022 Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she does not see any reason to delay the votes in light of the Alabama election\u2022 Lower the corporate tax rate to 21 percent;\u2022 Go into effect in 2018;\u2022 Lower the top individual tax rate to 37 percent;\u2022 Eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax;\u2022 Allow individuals to choose whether to deduct up to $10,000 in income, sales or property taxes.See how the changes compare with the versions passed by the House and Senate \u00bbHouse and Senate Republicans tasked with merging the two tax bills have reached agreement on a consensus bill and are expected to put it to a final vote next week. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said on Wednesday that members will be briefed on the details later in the day and said he\u2019s confident it will pass next week.The conference committee that was created to merge the House and Senate tax bills began its one public meeting on Wednesday afternoon and Democrats immediately denounced the gathering as an exercise in trying to make the tax overhaul look transparent.\u201cLet\u2019s understand what\u2019s happening today is a sham,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cNobody ought to mistake this conference for real debate.\u201dSenator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, said the \u201cso-called conference committee,\u201d as he put it, \u201cis a farce.\u201dMembers of the committee assembled for their public session in a basement meeting room in the Capitol, and the partisan skirmishing began right at the outset.Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, asked that the conference committee postpone its work until Doug Jones, the winner of Tuesday\u2019s special election for Senate in Alabama, is sworn into office.The lawmaker presiding over the meeting, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the motion was not allowed.Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, quickly clashed with Mr. Brady over his handling of the meeting, reminding him that the session was not being conducted under \u201cPutin rules.\u201dDemocrats also denounced the substance of the tax overhaul.\u201cThe American people are witnessing a master class in how one political party, relying on secrecy, distortion and brute force, can muscle an unpopular, deficit exploding corporate giveaway to passage,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cThis is the ultimate betrayal of the middle class.\u201dThe gathering will be one of the final times that Democrats will be able to publicly criticize the tax legislation while being face-to-face with the Republicans who are crafting it. Thus far, they have largely assailed the partisan process and argued that the bill benefits the rich and corporations and doesn\u2019t do enough to help the middle class.For Republicans, the public meeting is largely for show, as the final negotiations happened behind closed doors and the major details have already been agreed upon. Republicans are planning to pass the bill along party lines and have so far rebuffed Democrats\u2019 requests to change the bill.The odds remain strong that congressional Republicans will send a consensus tax bill to Mr. Trump, despite Democrats\u2019 upset Senate victory in Alabama on Tuesday.The news that Doug Jones, a Democrat, had defeated Roy Moore, a Republican, in the election immediately sent many liberal activists dreaming of another improbable win: blocking the tax bill.Math and momentum fueled that activist optimism. Once Mr. Jones is seated in the Senate, Republicans\u2019 majority in the chamber will narrow to a single seat. The tax bill passed the Senate on a 51-49 vote, with one Republican, Bob Corker of Tennessee, defecting. The hope among liberals was that Mr. Jones\u2019 victory would give other Republicans pause and delay the process of reconciling the bills.That seems unlikely to happen, however. Lawmakers have agreed on the contours of a final deal and an influential Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, said she saw no reason to wait for Mr. Jones to be seated before voting on the tax bill.Republicans have resolved the differences between the two versions of their tax bill.Those scenarios still appear highly unlikely. Republican leaders are prepared to hold votes early next week on the measure, well before the Alabama results are expected to be certified, making Mr. Jones eligible to be seated. Party leaders remain confident Mr. Trump will sign the bill before Christmas \u2014 most likely before Mr. Jones enters the Senate.The one wrinkle from Tuesday night, for Republicans and the bill, is that the results empower individual senators to demand even more from the leadership for their votes. Ms. Collins and Marco Rubio of Florida have both raised concerns this week about the compromise bill as it is shaping up. Party leaders may be forced to address their concerns or apply more pressure to keep them, and possibly others, in line.But even if Republicans were to defect en masse in the Senate, the tax bill could still sail to Mr. Trump \u2014 if House Republicans were to approve the version that passed the Senate. That version included some apparent drafting errors that have upset business interests, most notably the rate of the corporate alternative minimum tax. But in a worst-case scenario, party leaders could decide that bill is better than no bill at all, and promise to return to fix the provisions later \u2014 an echo of how Democrats proceeded to pass the Affordable Care Act after they lost a similarly stunning Senate special election, in Massachusetts, in 2010.Democrats are mounting a concerted, though likely fruitless, effort to get Republican leadership in the Senate to delay the tax bill vote until Mr. Jones is seated as a senator from Alabama.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to \u201chit pause on his tax bill\u201d after the Democratic candidate won the special election for Senate in Alabama on Tuesday.\u201cIt would be wrong for Senate Republicans to jam through this tax bill without giving the newly elected senator from Alabama the opportunity to cast his vote,\u201d Mr. Schumer said at a news conference at the Capitol on Wednesday morning.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon similarly said the bill should be delayed until Mr. Jones arrives, saying in a tweet \u201cThe people of Alabama have spoken.\u201dMr. Trump hosted Republican lawmakers working on tax legislation for lunch at the White House. Flanked by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, Mr. Trump gave brief remarks on the tax plan.\u201cWe\u2019re very close to getting it done, we\u2019re very close to voting,\u201d he said.The White House on Wednesday released a name of those dining with Mr. Trump, including Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, eight Republican senators and Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.Ahead of the Conference Committee meeting, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee will be joined by House Democratic leaders for a noon \u201cforum\u201d on the Republican tax legislation.House Democrats have invited economists including Mark Zandi, of Moody\u2019s Analytics, and Jason Furman, former chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, to participate.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has come under attack from Democrats for using \u201cfake math\u201d to defend the Republican tax plan, was also invited. He is not expected to attend.Liberal activists are planning to fan across the Capitol on Wednesday to try to flip Republican members of Congress who they think could be persuaded to change their minds on the tax bill.Members of Housing Works, the Center for Popular Democracy, Women\u2019s March, Hedge Clippers, People for Bernie, Strong Economy for All Coalition are planning to stage sit-ins at the offices of Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona.Ady Barkan, a progressive activist with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who confronted Mr. Flake on an airplane last week, is headlining the rally. According to one of its organizers, he is also hoping to have a meeting with Ms. Collins.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What to Get Theresa May for Christmas", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Varoufakis is the former Greek finance minister and his book sets out in excruciating detail the story of the 2015 negotiations between Greece\u2019s government and its creditors. It feels like necessary reading for the Brexit team.In the nine months of negotiations so far, there has been remarkably little give and take. What Britain agreed to last week was largely what Europe had demanded at the beginning.European Union citizens\u2019 rights have been largely protected, with Britain agreeing that its courts will take into account rulings of the European Court of Justice, the European Union\u2019s supreme legal body. The money being paid by Britain for the divorce is less than what some politicians on the Continent were hoping for, but about double what was first offered.On the Irish border, the two sides have agreed that there will be no border with passport and customs checks \u2014 but also that the details will be left to later talks. If there is no mutually agreeable solution, then Britain has promised to maintain \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d with the European Union to ensure that customs checks aren\u2019t necessary, even though Britain will have no say over those regulations. A country that voted for Brexit as a way to \u201ctake back control\u201d will be acceding even more control to the European Union.All this is as Mr. Varoufakis might have predicted. In the wake of the financial crash of 2008, the Greek economy had imploded. The European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (collectively known as the \u201ctroika\u201d), stepped in to provide huge loans, not for spending in Greece, but largely to bail out the banks (many of them German and French) that had so recklessly lent to Greece in the first place. In return, the troika insisted on an eye-watering austerity program, slashing jobs, welfare payments and pensions.Mr. Varoufakis, who led the Greek negotiating team, writes in \u201cAdults in the Room\u201d that rather than negotiate in good faith, the troika employed a number of tactics to ensure that it got its way. The key maneuver was insisting that negotiations be staged in two parts: Greece first had to \u201ccommit to the compromises they wanted and then, much later, we could begin negotiations on debt relief.\u201dIt has been a similar story with the Brexit talks. Britain is dealing not with the troika, but directly with the European Union. The bruising negotiating tactics, however, are much the same.The European Union insisted at the beginning that the negotiations be split into two parts. Only when \u201csufficient progress\u201d had been made on the \u201cdivorce\u201d could talks on future relations begin. Britain\u2019s real interest is in signing a post-Brexit trade deal. London\u2019s desperation to move on, Brussels knew, would lead it to capitulate on the terms of divorce.And that is exactly what happened. With much bluster but little resistance, Britain accepted not only the two-part process, but also most of the European Union\u2019s demands in the first phase.Recognizing this, the European Union is already hemming in Britain\u2019s options for the next phase of the negotiations. It has again demanded that the talks be split in two, the first part to deal with the terms of the transition period \u2014 a period of probably two years starting in March 2019, when Britain formally leaves the European Union, and ending when it fully separates from it \u2014 followed by the terms of trade relations.The issue is not simply European Union intransigence. It is also that of British incompetence. Mr. Davis, the Brexit secretary, recently admitted that he had not commissioned a single study of Brexit\u2019s impact on the economy. Only on Monday did the cabinet finally formally discuss what exactly it wants out of Brexit negotiations. To negotiate with neither detailed information nor a firm vision of the endpoint is akin to playing poker blindfolded.The combination of European Union inflexibility and British incompetence means that however, and whenever, Britain finally exits, it is likely to be on the European Union\u2019s terms. \u201cAdults in the Room\u201d is necessarily a one-sided account from Mr. Varoufakis\u2019s perspective. But it does provide a glimpse of the maneuverings usually shielded from public view. Reading it will change little, but at least it might prepare British ministers for what is to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Removes Chechen Strongman\u2019s Accounts, Raising Policy Questions", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe strongman leader of the Chechen Republic has long been a prolific social media user, filling his accounts with photos of him cuddling his cat, lifting weights or soliciting poems about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.So when Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts, which had four million followers between them, were unexpectedly taken down on Dec. 23, people took notice.A Facebook spokeswoman said that Mr. Kadyrov\u2019s accounts were deactivated because he had just been added to a United States sanctions list and that the company was legally obligated to act.Facebook has been pilloried for allowing the spread of fake news on its platform and its limited response. In this case, it says it\u2019s legally obligated to act because of financial sanctions, a standard that has not been evenly applied and which experts say may not be defensible.\u201cThis sanctions law, which was written for one purpose,\u201d said Jennifer Stisa Granick, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy and Technology project, \u201cis being used to suppress speech with little consideration of the free expression values and the special risks of blocking speech, as opposed to blocking commerce or funds as the sanctions was designed to do. That\u2019s really problematic.\u201dNow, Mr. Kadyrov \u2014 and the Russian government \u2014 want answers from Facebook about its reasoning.In a tweet on Wednesday, Mr. Kadyrov said Facebook had told him that the accounts were deactivated because he had just been put on the sanctions list.\u201cI am not perturbed by this petty U.S. rat race, but here is my question for Facebook and the Ministry of Finance,\u201d Mr. Kadyrov wrote, referring to the United States Treasury Department, the agency behind the sanctions. \u201cWhere is your praised democracy and the right of citizens to receive information? Or do 4 million followers mean nothing?\u201dMr. Kadyrov and four other Russians were added to the sanctions list on Dec. 20 because of alleged human rights abuses and involvement in criminal conspiracies. The sanctions were imposed under the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which allows American authorities to freeze the United States assets of Russian officials considered responsible for human rights abuses. (It also bars them from obtaining visas for the United States.)Mr. Kadyrov used his Instagram account to post a sarcastic video response to the sanctions against him. It showed him sitting on a weight lifting bench in front of a comically heavy stack of weights and mocking the United States government.Mr. Kadyrov was not the only one critical of Facebook\u2019s decision to deactivate his accounts. The Russian government also voiced concern.Facebook, which also owns Instagram, defended its decision to remove the accounts, saying the government\u2019s sanctions against Mr. Kadyrov obligated it to do so.\u201cWe became aware and have now confirmed that the accounts appear to be maintained by or on behalf of parties who appear on the U.S. Specially Designated Nationals List and thus subject to U.S. trade sanctions,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement emailed to The New York Times. \u201cFor this reason, Facebook has a legal obligation to disable these accounts.\u201dMs. Granick, the ACLU attorney, said that raised serious issues. \u201cIt\u2019s not a law that appears to be written or designed to deal with the special situations where it\u2019s lawful or appropriate to repress speech,\u201d she said.The company does not appear to apply this policy to all people sanctioned by the United States. Several other people on sanctions list have active, and even verified, accounts.Facebook did not respond to questions about this discrepancy in removals.After his accounts were removed, Mr. Kadyrov criticized Facebook via the messaging app Telegram the same day.

{"Headline": "The Race to Erase Kevin Spacey", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The sun was setting on Nov. 7, when Christopher Plummer arrived at the Four Seasons Hotel in Manhattan for a secret, hastily arranged meeting.He had intended to be resting in Connecticut after a whirlwind month. But Ridley Scott had flown in from London with an urgent plea: Would Mr. Plummer help expunge the disgraced Kevin Spacey from Mr. Scott\u2019s latest film, one set for theatrical release by Sony in just six weeks?By the next morning, Mr. Plummer had agreed to replace Mr. Spacey as Grandpa Getty.\u201cAt my age, which is enormous, you get worried that your memory won\u2019t hold up,\u201d Mr. Plummer said. \u201cBut this was too damn good to pass up.\u201dAnd so began a race to pull off something never before attempted in Hollywood: revisiting a finished movie, reassembling major members of the cast, refilming crucial scenes, re-editing many sequences, retooling the marketing campaign \u2014 and doing it all at the last possible minute. Mr. Scott and others worked 18-hour days as they rushed to finish in nine days what would typically have taken at least a month.\u201cYou can sit there and let something kill you, or you can take action,\u201d Mr. Scott said in his no-nonsense way. \u201cI took action.\u201dBut \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d presented unique challenges. A trailer was already on heavy rotation in theaters. Awards prognosticators (nudged along by Sony publicists) had also been touting Mr. Spacey\u2019s performance as Oscar worthy.It was decided that \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d which also stars Michelle Williams as the kidnapped boy\u2019s desperate mother and Mark Wahlberg as a Getty family fixer, would arrive on Dec. 22 as planned. (Sony eventually settled on Dec. 25.) \u201cI didn\u2019t think there was any solution,\u201d Mr. Rothman said. \u201cWe would have to muddle through the best we could.\u201dA few days later, two of the film\u2019s producers, Dan Friedkin and Bradley Thomas, unexpectedly arrived at Mr. Rothman\u2019s office. They told him they were determined not to let the wrongdoings of one person damage a film that had been worked on by more than 800 people. And they floated an audacious idea that they had privately discussed with Mr. Scott: What about replacing Mr. Spacey with another actor? Mr. Plummer, perhaps.\u201cThat would theoretically be fantastic,\u201d Mr. Rothman said he responded. \u201cBut I have supervised 450 movies over the course of my career. And what you are saying is impossible. There is not enough time.\u201dBut impossible? Not with the experienced and indefatigable Mr. Scott in the director\u2019s chair, Mr. Friedkin maintained. \u201cTwenty years from now, I want to be able to pull this film off the shelf and be proud of it,\u201d Mr. Friedkin said.This is where the story of \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d becomes about, as Mr. Rothman colorfully put it, \u201ctwo octogenarians kicking absolute ass.\u201dWith Sony\u2019s blessing, Mr. Scott sprang to action, convincing Mr. Plummer to take on the challenge. (Why Mr. Plummer? Mr. Scott had considered him during the initial casting process but went with Mr. Spacey for reasons that included scheduling.) The director said he did not tell Mr. Spacey that he was being replaced because Mr. Spacey had never contacted him to discuss the misconduct allegations.\u201cA phone call would have been nice,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cAt first I was disappointed. Then I was mad.\u201d (He added that nothing in Mr. Spacey\u2019s contract prohibited his replacement; he got paid.) Representatives for Mr. Spacey did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Scott, who called the assertions about Mr. Spacey\u2019s behavior \u201cshocking,\u201d also managed to bring back Mr. Wahlberg and Ms. Williams, both of whom agreed to work through Thanksgiving due to the severe time constraint. Production on \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d resumed on Nov. 20 in London, with the cast and reassembled crew moving to Rome a few days later.The actual kidnapping had taken place in Italy. Operatives in the \u2019Ndrangheta crime syndicate held the teenage Getty hostage for five months, even chaining him to a stake in a cave. At one point, the kidnappers cut off Getty\u2019s ear and mailed it to a Rome newspaper. He was ultimately released for a payment of roughly $3 million.\u201cIt\u2019s almost a grand documentary, a blow-by-blow look at how and why a family \u2014 one blessed with so much wealth \u2014 disintegrates into tragedy,\u201d Mr. Scott said.Since the original scenes had all been filmed on location, no sets needed to be reconstructed, saving a lot of time. Also making the situation more manageable: Mr. Plummer was nearer in age to the character, making it possible to forgo the kind of facial disguise that Mr. Spacey had donned.Long hours may have been their biggest challenge.\u201cI\u2019m kind of like a funny battery that never wears out,\u201d he said.Despite their efforts, \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d faces an uphill battle at the box office.Of course, the publicity generated by Mr. Scott\u2019s race to scrub Mr. Spacey from the movie may prove helpful. The effort has been cheered online in some of the same forums where boycotts were brewing. \u201cMr. Scott is an inspiration!\u201d wrote one commenter on EW.com.And it is possible that Mr. Plummer, an Oscar winner for \u201cBeginners\u201d in 2012, turned in a performance that eclipsed the one given by Mr. Spacey. In a surprise, Golden Globe voters, who saw a not-quite-finished version of \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d last week, nominated Mr. Plummer for best supporting actor and gave nods to Mr. Scott for his directing and Ms. Williams for best actress.\u201cI think it\u2019s a fantastic change,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cKevin\u2019s performance was colder. Christopher has enormous charm \u2014 a twinkle and a smile \u2014 that makes this coldly logical character feel even more dangerous.\u201dWill the original version of \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d ever be released, perhaps on DVD, so that viewers can judge for themselves?Mr. Scott let out a huff. \u201cI doubt it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Partisans, Wielding Money, Begin Seeking to Exploit Harassment Claims", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the #MeToo movement to expose sexual harassment roils the nation\u2019s capital, political partisans are exploiting the moment, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to support accusers who come forward with charges against President Trump and members of Congress, even amid questions about their motivation.\u201cThere is a danger in this environment that unsophisticated individuals who have been abused by powerful people could be exploited by groups seeking partisan advantage, or by lawyers seeking a moment in the limelight,\u201d said Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer who has brought sexual harassment cases against politicians from both parties.The lawyers and operatives behind the most politically charged cases brush off those concerns.\u201cI approach this with a pure heart,\u201d said Jack Burkman, a flamboyant Republican lawyer known for right-wing conspiracy theories who is seeking to represent sexual harassment victims. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it politicized, even though, in a democracy, you see the political weaponization of everything.\u201dAnd a nonprofit group founded by the Democratic activist David Brock, which people familiar with the arrangements say secretly spent $200,000 on an unsuccessful effort to bring forward accusations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Trump before Election Day, is considering creating a fund to encourage victims to bring forward similar claims against Republican politicians.And Mr. Burkman, who has suggested that Russian hit men killed a young Democratic National Committee aide during the 2016 election, emerged in October to offer his services to women accusing Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct. He had never handled a sexual harassment matter before.Those pushing the sexual harassment claims say they are just trying to level a playing field that has long favored powerful men, discouraging their victims from coming forward, and silencing many who do using confidential settlements.\u201cYou got to sweeten the pot a little bit,\u201d Mr. Cernovich said. A lawyer by training, he said he was shocked that the person who gave him the Conyers documents declined his offer to pay for them.But, he said, \u201cif somebody had a settlement like Conyers, I would gladly, gladly pay for that.\u201dMoney could have costs.\u201cIf you\u2019re getting money from someone who has an ax to grind against the person you\u2019re accusing of unlawful activity, that most certainly opens the door to a line of questioning that very well could undermine the veracity of your client\u2019s story,\u201d said Douglas H. Wigdor, a leading New York employment lawyer who has brought a barrage of lawsuits against powerful men and institutions in recent years.\u201cI like to hype things in advance, and this looked pretty good,\u201d Mr. Cernovich said. \u201cI definitely learned a lesson there.\u201dIt is difficult to determine how much money has been raised to fund claims related to sexual harassment, since there are no public disclosure requirements for most such donations. But the solicitations seem likely to fuel skepticism.Ms. Allred said she was not concerned about the motivations of partisans who might fund Ms. Zervos\u2019s case against Mr. Trump.\u201cI have neither the time nor the interest to interview each donor and ask them why they would want to support our client,\u201d she said, \u201cso I have no way to know whether they have a political agenda, or they just think truth matters.\u201dMs. Allred said her fund-raising for the Zervos case had so far yielded \u201cjust under $30,000,\u201d mostly in small donations. The money is being used for expenses like depositions and has not gone to pay legal fees, which already have reached $150,000, said Ms. Allred, who added that neither she nor Ms. Zervos would personally accept any of the money raised.\u201cWe certainly do not see any prospect of being paid by the fund based on the amounts donated to date,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cNevertheless, we will continue to devote ourselves to Ms. Zervos\u2019s case because we believe, as does Ms. Zervos, that truth matters and that President Trump should be held accountable for his words and his actions.\u201dQuestions about the financing and motivations behind sexual harassment charges targeting politicians are not new.Ms. Allred\u2019s daughter, the lawyer Lisa Bloom, seized on the political potency of sexual harassment charges against Mr. Trump not long after he clinched the Republican presidential nomination. She said she reached out to a pro-Clinton \u201csuper PAC\u201d \u2014 though she declined to identify which one \u2014 for money to help her vet a sexual misconduct claim against Mr. Trump.That case collapsed one week before Election Day, but as a result of the attention it generated, several donors reached out to Ms. Bloom \u201casking how they could help,\u201d she said. She told them that she was working with \u201ca few other women\u201d who might \u201cfind the courage to speak out\u201d against Mr. Trump if the donors would provide funds for security, relocation and possibly a \u201csafe house.\u201dIt was not productive. One woman requested $2 million, Ms. Bloom said, then decided not to come forward. Nor did any other women.Ms. Bloom said she refunded most of the cash, keeping only \u201csome funds to pay for our out-of-pocket expenses\u201d accrued while working to vet and prepare cases. She said that she did not receive any legal fees for the work, and that she did not communicate with Mrs. Clinton or her campaign \u201con any of this.\u201d She said she represented only clients whose stories she had corroborated, and disputed the premise that she offered money to coax clients to come forward.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost anything to publicly air allegations,\u201d she said. \u201cSecurity and relocation are expensive and were sorely needed in a case of this magnitude, in a country filled with so much anger, hate and violence.\u201dThe Democrats familiar with the financial arrangements said Ms. Bloom\u2019s firm kept the money from American Bridge, but refunded the money from Ms. Buell.Mr. Brock declined to comment, and representatives from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign said they were unaware of his work with Ms. Bloom.The allegations against Mr. Trump might \u201cresonate more\u201d with voters amid the current national conversation about sexual misconduct, she suggested.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Harlem, a Shelter That Gives Young Men the Tools to Succeed", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Neediest Cases FundCreate, a 50-bed transitional housing program, serves men 18 to 25, many of whom have recently aged out of the foster care system. Its residents are encouraged to study or to work, and to find permanent housing within nine months. The support system has proved invaluable to many.After being in foster care and enduring a tumultuous life with his adoptive family, Rymale Benjamin, 21, came to Create after spending three weeks at the 30th Street Men\u2019s Shelter in Manhattan.\u201cAt first, I looked around and thought someone had invited me to their house,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, This place is nice; it\u2019s in a good area. I was shocked it was a shelter.\u201d\u201cThere were a lot of people coming to our doors who didn\u2019t necessarily have drug problems,\u201d Mr. Perez said recently. \u201cBut they were still homeless and had nowhere to go.\u201dIn 1983, Mr. Perez and Father Taylor expanded their operation, taking over a three-story tenement building across the street from the rehabilitation center. They converted it into a 19-bed shelter for homeless men, the city\u2019s first such community-based and -operated shelter financed with city and state funds, according to a news release at the time.In 1984, Father Taylor and Mr. Perez took over another abandoned four-story building, this one on West 128th Street. Working with a group of architects, Mr. Perez helped design the dormitory space. He wanted the residents to feel at home in their rooms, he said, so each door got its own doorbell.\u201cIt was about being more than \u2018a hot and a cot,\u2019\u201d Mr. Perez said, referring to the standard warm meal and bed. \u201cWe wanted to help transition them into independent living. That\u2019s what we thought was most important.\u201dToday, that shelter is usually at full capacity. Brian Bailey, the director, says he receives five to 10 requests for a bed each day.\u201cThis is the only shelter where I feel like I am home,\u201d said Mr. Konate, who has stayed in two other city shelters. \u201cI leave for work and come back to sleep. And when I\u2019m back, I feel like I\u2019m home.\u201dCreate provides tenants with services like job-skills training, educational support and the opportunity to gain work experience. \u201cWithout that, it\u2019s a revolving door,\u201d Mr. Perez said, \u201cwinding right back to homelessness.\u201dFather Taylor added: \u201cThe program gives people the time and space to recover at their own pace. It\u2019s not rushed.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s plan from February also includes five additional \u201cpurpose-built shelter projects,\u201d which, much like Create, would be tailored to residents\u2019 needs. Today, Create is the only transitional housing program in the city designed specifically for young men.G. Stephanie Ali, the vocation coordinator at Create, says the program provides a unique space to enable young men to gain their footing and transition into a permanent setting. Aspiring painters, novelists, basketball players, engineers, rap artists and producers have passed through the halls over the years, she said.\u201cOftentimes at this age, young men feel they should be doing more,\u201d Ms. Ali said, adding that overwhelming possibilities can hinder residents from focusing on goals. \u201cSo we\u2019re there to help them see the broader scope of what\u2019s out there and get them engaged in education and employment to meet that ultimate goal of housing.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t even describe how much Create and all the wonderful people there have helped me,\u201d Mr. Diallo said recently. \u201cToday, I look back on it as my new start. Moving there was the beginning of my success.\u201dOumar Camara, 19, seeks a similar happy ending. He came to the city from Mali\u2019s capital, Bamako, four years ago. At the time, he had an hour between the end of high school and the start of his full-time cleaning and dishwashing job. Often, he did not return to the room he shared in Harlem until 4 a.m., just a few hours before school began.He moved to Create in March. A burden was lifted when he no longer had to pay $500 a month in rent and utilities, which allowed him to quit his job and focus on school. He is now on track to graduate in June.\u201cNow I want to go to college, get a career and have a better life,\u201d Mr. Camara said, adding that he plans to pursue a degree in structural engineering.On Tuesday, Mr. Camara and Mr. Konate received keys to a two-bedroom apartment in Irvington, N.J.

{"Headline": "Is the Democratic Party Becoming Too Democratic?", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThese recommendations illustrate the types of reforms we often see connected to democracy within parties. But these reforms are actually difficult to define and implement across many states. Part of the reason it\u2019s difficult to make a party internally democratic is that this is the wrong way to think about parties.The concept of democracy within a political party is tricky. As with many other institutions, parties have become more democratically run over time. Important decisions like nominations and platform stances used to be made by bosses and convention delegates; now they\u2019re largely determined by rank-and-file voters in primaries and caucuses. The logic of running things more democratically is that people tend to have more faith in the resulting decisions \u2014 those choices are more legitimate.Like just about any other institution, a party requires legitimacy to operate. It makes many decisions on behalf of its members and operates the complex caucuses, primaries, conventions and other machinery that boil down dozens of candidates into just one nominee. Similarly, it tries to weigh the many wide-ranging views of its members into a coherent platform. For it to do these things and still get roughly half the votes of the American electorate, people have to have some faith that its actions are done in good faith.Part of the problem for parties is our insistence that they be run democratically. That turns out not to be a very realistic concept. Yes, we can hold elections within parties, but party leaders will always have vastly more information about candidates \u2014 their strengths and flaws, their ability to govern and work with Congress, their backing among various interest groups and coalitions \u2014 than voters and caucusgoers do. That information is useful, even vital, to the task of picking a good nominee. As the political scientist E. E. Schattschneider once said, democracy is to be found between the parties, not within them.This also happened in 1924, when Democrats held a famously divisive convention that spanned two weeks and 103 ballots. William Gibbs McAdoo of California fought to a nomination stalemate against Gov. Al Smith of New York, a favorite of the Tammany Hall organization.McAdoo ran a deeply populist campaign aimed at maximizing his apparent democratic legitimacy. He ran in over a dozen primaries, a very rare approach at that time. He held numerous rallies among his supporters and claimed their mandate for leadership, all the while warning about the \u201csinister forces\u201d trying to undermine his nomination.But this argument, however dramatic, wasn\u2019t enough for McAdoo to win nomination. Unable to secure the necessary two-thirds of delegates, he and Smith eventually bowed out and made way for John W. Davis of West Virginia. Democrats divided, and they lost in a rout to Calvin Coolidge that fall.Today, Democrats are undergoing some deep \u2014 and valid \u2014 soul-searching. The unity commission came with no shortage of internal division.But it\u2019s what happens when a party insists on being too democratic and when candidates use democratic appeals as a cudgel to undermine their opponents. Yes, Democrats did well in recent elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere, but those victories papered over very serious rifts that could affect it during the next presidential election cycle.Parties have something of a dual purpose \u2014 they need to win elections but also find a way to channel the different voices within their coalitions. Sometimes those goals mesh well and at other times they\u2019re in tension.The belief that parties should be internally democratic, which has gained wider acceptance over time and, with the reform commission, is likely accelerating, has altered the way parties balance those two objectives. Candidates who lose the nomination can protest on democratic grounds and gain traction in doing so.But there\u2019s a real danger in taking this path. It undermines both the nominee and the party, both immediately and in the long run. And it undermines one of the necessary, if difficult, aspects of democracy: conceding gracefully when you lose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finalists in NASA\u2019s Spacecraft Sweepstakes: A Drone on Titan, and a Comet-Chaser", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWould you like NASA to fly a drone across Saturn\u2019s largest moon, or to send a probe to collect samples from a duck-shaped comet?\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most difficult programs to be selected for,\u201d said James L. Green, director of the planetary science division at NASA. \u201cWe fly only about two of these types of missions per decade.\u201dIn the first proposed mission, Comet Astrobiology Exploration Sample Return, or Caesar, a spacecraft would go to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, previously explored by the European Space Agency\u2019s Rosetta mission, and bring back a small chunk to Earth for closer study.In the second mission, named Dragonfly, a robotic drone would be sent to Titan, Saturn\u2019s largest moon, which has seas of hydrocarbons. The drone would be able to fly from one location to another and to perform detailed explorations of various terrains.\u201cThese are tremendously exciting missions,\u201d Dr. Green said.Each team now will get $4 million and about one year to flesh out its idea. NASA will decide in mid-2019 which one of the two to build. The selected mission is to launch by the end of 2025.For this round of New Frontiers, NASA will spend up to $850 million for the spacecraft, instruments and mission operations. Add in the cost of the rocket to get the spacecraft off the ground, and the total price tag will be about $1 billion.Steven W. Squyres, a professor of physical sciences at Cornell University who leads the Caesar proposal, said his team chose Comet 67P because of the wealth of data collected by the Rosetta mission, which flew alongside the comet from 2014 to 2016.\u201cWe are able to design our mission, design our spacecraft specifically for the conditions that we know to exist there,\u201d Dr. Squyres said. \u201cAnd what that does is just dramatically improve the chances for success for a very difficult activity, which is grabbing a piece of a comet.\u201dComets are believed to contain primitive ingredients from the early solar system that went into the building of the planets.Caesar would scoop up at least 100 grams from the comet, separating the volatiles \u2014 constituents that could evaporate \u2014 from the more solid substances. The spacecraft would then head back to Earth and drop off the sample in a capsule.\u201cThe sample will arrive back on Earth on the 20th of November, 2038,\u201d Dr. Squyres said. \u201cSo mark your calendars, and once it\u2019s been delivered to laboratories worldwide, I think it\u2019s going to produce groundbreaking science for decades to come.\u201dThe Dragonfly mission would follow up on observations made by the Cassini-Huygens mission that concluded in September. The Huygens probe, built by the European Space Agency, landed on Titan in 2005. The Cassini orbiter made many flybys of Titan during its 13 years in orbit around Saturn.Powered by a chunk of plutonium, Dragonfly would take advantage of recent technological advances in flying drones. The craft would spend most of its time making measurements on the ground, but it would be able to fly tens or hundreds of kilometers through Titan\u2019s thick atmosphere to study other geologic terrains, said Elizabeth Turtle, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory who is the principal investigator for Dragonfly.\u201cIn this way, we can evaluate how far prebiotic chemistry has progressed in an environment that we know has the ingredients for life \u2014 for water-based life or potentially even hydrocarbon-based life,\u201d Dr. Turtle said.Other proposals that NASA did not pursue include MoonRise, which would have brought back soil and rock from the moon\u2019s South Pole-Aitken Basin, the scar of a cataclysmic impact more than four billion years ago; and Sprite, a probe that would have parachuted onto Saturn.An earlier version of this story misidentified the affiliation of the principal investigator of the Venus In Situ Composition Investigations proposal.

Beijing is overreaching and starting to burn bridges across the West and in the developing world.This position echoes that of other European leaders who argue Beijing has kept the door closed to foreign investment in too many sectors of its economy while exploiting the openness of European markets and snatching up leading European technology companies over the past few years. Demands are growing that Beijing offer equal treatment to European companies in China.China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, a grandiose trillion-dollar trade and investment strategy to reconnect Eurasia and position China at the center of the global economy, is also facing resistance. While the United States is only now waking up to the threat from Chinese money to its democracy, the developing world has long known the extent to which Beijing is willing to influence politics and societies abroad.Backlash is likely in Sri Lanka as well. After accepting Beijing\u2019s talk of \u201cwin-win development,\u201d and amassing billions in Chinese loans, the Sri Lankan government recently ceded control of the strategic port of Hambantota to Beijing for a 99-year lease in return for debt forgiveness. But few tenants love their landlord, particularly one that is charging you rent to live on your own land. Prominent politicians have already accused the Sri Lankan government of selling the country\u2019s sovereignty to Beijing.It should be no surprise that authoritarian powers are not good at making friends, particularly with democracies, which favor open markets and freedom of speech. If Beijing seeks to calm concerns in the West over its influence in politics and society, it may need to revamp its policy that prioritizes economic gains. Instead, China would be well served to consider its own history of resentment regarding outside intervention, and look to build new cooperation and compromise with the West.Beijing is gradually building warmer relations with Tokyo based on economic and social cooperation. This may offer a path forward for Beijing to overcome its differences with Western democracies, to disengage from political interference, and to refocus on building partnerships that can expand the trade and investment that brought it to the heights of the global economy in the first place.China leaves 2017 with frayed relations across much of the West. If it does not pull back from these intrusions on Western democracies, the overreach will ultimately reduce China\u2019s global power.Luke Patey is a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies and author of \u201cThe New Kings of Crude: China, India, and the Global Struggle for oil in Sudan and South Sudan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Near a Big Win \u2014 but Will It Lift Them Politically?", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBut it remained to be seen whether the result \u2014 a convoluted measure that would cut corporate taxes and have mixed benefits for individual taxpayers \u2014 will spare Republicans from an emerging political backlash that was evident in Democratic election victories around the country last month.Democrats said Republicans were sacrificing their core claim as the party of lower taxes for middle income Americans, while populist voters allied with President Trump may be unimpressed with deep cuts to the corporate tax rate, added protections for multimillion-dollar inheritances and other breaks for the rich.Still, after an epic failure in their efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act and little else of legislative note to show for their control of Congress and the White House, Republicans breathed a sigh of relief after they rounded up enough votes to approve the measure and send the Senate into final tax-cut negotiations with the House.The satisfaction was evident in the wide grin sported on Friday by Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, as he prepared to celebrate on the floor with his colleagues \u2014 a stark reversal from his downcast demeanor when the bill momentarily teetered Thursday evening in a potential replay of the health care fiasco.\u201cThis is about doing what we promised the American people,\u201d said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the head of the Republican Senate campaign organization that will play a major role in selling this tax plan to voters in advance of midterm elections next November.Republican leaders did not see much alternative to meeting the final demands of uncommitted Republican senators since they were under immense pressure to get a win \u2014 any win. They hastily added provisions to appease Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana and offered assurances to Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona on immigration policy to guarantee their votes.Democrats conceded that approval of the legislation \u2014 a sweeping bill that will cut corporate taxes and double the standard deduction \u2014 will prevent the first year of the Trump administration from being a legislative failure. But they believe that Republicans have made a political blunder because the reconfiguration of the tax structure \u2014 particularly new limits on the ability to deduct state and local taxes \u2014 will produce a tax increase for some voters who will be very unhappy when they realize it.That could cost Republicans one of their bedrock principles. To appease party contributors demanding action on taxes, they may give up their mantle as the party of \u201cno new taxes.\u201d\u201cToday may be the first day of a new Republican Party \u2014 one that raises taxes on the middle class,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cThe one thing Republicans always promised the middle class is \u2018we are not going to raise your taxes.\u2019\u201dTop Republicans were hoping that their success on the tax legislation after a difficult struggle would break through to the public and provide evidence to Americans that the Republican-controlled Congress could be effective. They say that the deep cuts in business taxes should spark an economic expansion that will benefit all Americans, though that argument has been disputed by economists and not reflected in past experience.\u201cThis is a signature effort,\u201d said Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, adding: \u201cThis is at least in our view the restoration of an American renaissance and economic opportunity, for kids, grandkids and everybody present.\u201dParty strategists note that the Senate tax bill also includes some other long-sought Republican goals such as opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to energy exploration and elimination of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that most people have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.\u201cConsidering the conventional wisdom that surrounded this Congress eight weeks ago, this is nothing short of a complete and total 180,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former top aide to Mr. McConnell who remains in close contact with him.Democrats say that many voters already see the tax overhaul as heavily tilted toward the affluent, and they promise to drive that point home in the coming months.\u201cI am overwhelmingly hearing from people, what are the Republicans doing? Why are they pushing this big agenda that is going to put our country in trouble?\u201d said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a member of the Democratic leadership. \u201cThey all say it\u2019s such a giveaway to the wealthy and are just really stunned that this is happening.\u201dTax policy can be hard for voters to grasp, as former President Barack Obama learned early in his term. The economic recovery act that he signed into law in 2009 included a number of tax cuts; the biggest one was titled \u201cMaking Work Pay,\u201d and it offered a tax credit of 6.2 percent of earned income, up to $400 for individuals and $800 for couples.But Jason Furman, who advised Mr. Obama on economic policy and is now teaching at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the cut did not register in the American psyche.\u201cOur perception in the White House was that no one had any idea that we had cut their taxes,\u201d he said.Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, pointed to the strong Democratic showing \u2014 including a win in the governor\u2019s race \u2014 in his state in November and said voters are going to be disappointed when they don\u2019t see the benefits of the tax bill.\u201cIn Virginia this past year, you had a Republican candidate that was running on a platform of tax cuts, and you had a Democratic candidate who was running on a platform of health care, and you saw the results,\u201d Mr. Warner said.But Republicans were frantic to do something big legislatively and a tax bill was the obvious policy area where they could come to agreement, even if it didn\u2019t come very easily. The months ahead will determine whether the effort staved off a political debacle or contributed to one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Honduras Declares Curfew as Protests Over Vote Count Continue", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The Honduran government imposed a curfew on Friday and ordered security forces to move against protesters blocking roads and bridges, escalating a political crisis over the disputed count of votes from the presidential election last weekend.The move by the government of President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, who is seeking a second term, prompted fears that he might try to find a way to stay in office even if the final vote count went against him.Despite the government\u2019s announcement, the opposition planned to resume negotiations with the country\u2019s election commission on Saturday aimed at restarting the stalled ballot count and reviewing the results.But the count then stalled until Tuesday afternoon and after it resumed, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez steadily closed the gap and eventually overtook Mr. Nasralla. The shift led to allegations that the commission was counting only those polling places where Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez had won, and was setting aside for special review the tally sheets from areas where he had lost.The commission agreed to count the remaining tally sheets under pressure from international observers. In a sign of how widespread distrust of the electoral commission has become, Honduras\u2019s conservative main business group joined the call for a full count.Unless those demands are met, the opposition alliance said, it would not take part in the last stage of the count. \u201cThat would endorse fraud,\u201d Mr. Pastor wrote in a text message.Protesters blocked roads and bridges for a second day on Friday to demand an impartial count. In some places they burned tires, filling the air with thick, black smoke. There was some looting, and security forces clashed with protesters in several places, leading to injuries.Opposition supporters charged that the violent protesters and looters were infiltrators, deployed to give the government an excuse to use the security forces. Vice President Ricardo Alvarez acknowledged that many of the looters were people \u201ctaking advantage of the situation,\u201d not supporters of the opposition.The political turmoil adds to the problems facing Honduras, where two-thirds of the population lives in poverty. Street gangs and drug traffickers operate freely in parts of the country, and despite a fall in the homicide rate, Honduras is still one of the deadliest countries in the world outside a war zone.Corruption is endemic: Hondurans marched in the streets for weeks in 2015 to protest the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars from the main public health system. High-ranking police officers linked to the assassination of two antidrug officials were removed but have not been investigated.Mr. Zelaya\u2019s move to the left, including a growing closeness to Venezuela, had alarmed the country\u2019s political and business elites. At the time, however, they justified the coup by arguing that Mr. Zelaya had been seeking to get around a constitutional ban on re-election.\u201cThere\u2019s an institutional weakness and a matter of political culture,\u201d said Dan Restrepo, who was an adviser on Latin America at the National Security Council during the Obama administration. \u201cI think the coup was a symptom rather than a cause of it.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s hasn\u2019t been political and national reconciliation within the Honduran political classes,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing another manifestation of that now.\u201dProtests against Mr. Zelaya\u2019s ouster persisted for months, and he ultimately formed Libre, the main party behind the alliance that is supporting Mr. Nasralla.Ultimately it was Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, not Mr. Zelaya, who found a way to lift the ban on re-election. Two years ago, five Supreme Court judges, handpicked by Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, ruled that the prohibition was unconstitutional.Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez had been widely expected to win a second term. His iron-fist policies against crime gave many people a sense that security was improving, and his social programs handed out benefits to the poor.His allies in the media assured favorable coverage during the election campaign, and despite campaign finance restrictions, his ads accounted for almost two-thirds of all campaign publicity, according to a report released this week by election observers from the European Union.But the election results suggest that many voters did not approve of Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s growing control over the government.\u201cThere is a manifestation of displeasure from a large sector of society with the manner in which he has governed,\u201d Mr. Restrepo said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corker Says He Faced \u2018Tough\u2019 Decision in Supporting Republican Tax Bill", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A day before Republicans are expected to begin voting on their $1.5 trillion tax cut, the big question was not whether it would pass but why the lone Republican Senate holdout, Bob Corker of Tennessee, suddenly flipped his position to support a bill he once said was fiscally irresponsible.The theories varied from political to financial. Some suggested Mr. Corker, who has said that he will not seek re-election to the Senate, may be rethinking his political future, while others claimed he was bought off by a late-added provision that would benefit people with large real estate holdings, including him.In an interview on Monday, Mr. Corker dismissed those theories and said he faced a wrenching decision as a Republican lawmaker with deep concerns about the country\u2019s mounting debt and a strong desire to overhaul the tax code. In the end, he said, he put his fiscal principles aside on the assumption that the nation would be better off with the tax cuts than without.\u201cIt\u2019s been really tough, especially because I did think, I really felt like we could have had a bipartisan bill that would have really withstood more fully the test of time,\u201d Mr. Corker said.\u201cI talked to people that I respected. When I came here, I had concerns about deficits, but I also wanted progrowth tax reform to occur, so I had this pull between the two, if you will,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI just felt like this was a once-in-a-generation opportunity and if I looked at myself as the deciding vote, did I feel like our country was better having it in place or not better having it in place?\u201dMr. Corker has been the most vocal about the need to rein in the federal deficit. He voted against the initial Senate bill, the only Republican to do so, after party leaders rejected his request to require automatic tax increases down the road if the overhaul did not generate enough revenue to pay for itself.\u201cMy deficit concerns have not been alleviated,\u201d said Mr. Corker, who lamented that the bill could have been improved with more time.The legislation would cut taxes for corporations. American taxpayers, in large part, would also get cuts, though most of the changes affecting them would expire after 2025.On Friday, Mr. Corker stunned many in Washington when he said he would back the tax bill, which, while imperfect, would still be good for the country.Opponents of the tax plan immediately searched for a motive in the hope that they could alter his vote in the narrowly-held Senate. With just a 52-to-48 majority in the Senate, Republicans have little room for defections given that Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, is receiving medical treatment in his home state and is not expected to return to Washington in time for the vote. On Monday, two additional Republican senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, said they would vote yes.Mr. Corker, who was active in the real estate business in Tennessee before becoming a senator, retains a financial stake in companies that could benefit from the change.Critics of the Republican tax overhaul adopted a new rallying cry to criticize a bill that they say is packed with advantages for the rich: \u201cThe Corker Kickback.\u201dMr. Corker, in the interview, called the accusations \u201ddisheartening\u201d and said that he had not changed anything in the final bill.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to buy me off with,\u201d Mr. Corker said.On Sunday, Mr. Corker sent a letter to Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, asking that he explain how the provision became included in the bill.\u201cBecause this issue has raised concerns, I would ask that you provide an explanation of the evolution of this provision and how it made it into the final conference report,\u201d Mr. Corker wrote. \u201cI think that because of many sensitivities, clarity on this issue is very important and hope that you will respond in an expeditious manner.\u201dMr. Hatch, in a letter issued on Monday morning, defended Mr. Corker and said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by reports that suggested Mr. Corker had played a role in the provision\u2019s addition. He said Mr. Corker had wanted a less generous pass-through exemption than had been included.\u201cI am unaware of any attempt by you or your staff to contact anyone on the conference committee regarding this provision or any related policy matter,\u201d Mr. Hatch wrote. \u201cTo the contrary, virtually all the concerns you had raised in the past about the treatment of pass-through businesses in tax reform were to voice skepticism about the generosity of various proposals under consideration.\u201dIn fact, the Senate bill that Mr. Corker voted against already contained big benefits for the real estate industry. In large part, that is because of a provision cutting taxes for the owners of pass-through entities. Such businesses, like partnerships and limited liability companies, do not pay taxes themselves, but instead pass through their tax liabilities to their owners. Currently, such income is taxed at rates as high as 39.6 percent. But under the Senate bill, much of that income could be taxed at a rate as low as 29.6 percent. The bill limited those tax savings, partly by pegging the lower taxes to the size of a company\u2019s workforce.The final bill released on Friday included a new provision permitting the real estate industry to take advantage of the lower tax rate, tying the savings to the value of their properties \u2014 regardless of their size or their number of employees. Mr. Hatch said he had inserted the provision after discussions with the House and Senate negotiators writing the final bill and a congressional leadership aide pointed out that a version of it was in the House bill.Democrats remain unconvinced, and they have taken to social media to voice their concerns.Others, however, suggested that Mr. Corker\u2019s change of heart was more political than financial and that he did not want to be the lone Senate Republican to vote against his party\u2019s tax bill.In Tennessee, Mr. Corker\u2019s intended vote was welcomed on Monday.\u201cWe\u2019re very happy with his final position,\u201d said Bradley Jackson, the president of Tennessee\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, who had discussions with Mr. Corker and his office in recent weeks.Mr. Corker said his turnaround came after he engaged in deep discussions with business groups in Tennessee and around the country, the Republican leadership in Congress, his Senate colleagues and his wife. He also spent many private moments considering how to vote, meditating over the question on the balcony of the Senate chamber.While Mr. Corker said it was \u201cnot something that\u2019s pleasant\u201d to be the only Senate Republican to oppose the tax bill, his colleagues were generally respectful of his decision and only prodded him gently.In the end, Mr. Corker was convinced that the additional debt that the tax bill would pile on was manageable relative to the country\u2019s $43 trillion balance sheet and that businesses in his home state should have the opportunity for the additional foreign investment and other benefits that he believed the tax cuts would facilitate.He said that he planned to make fiscal restraint a priority next year as Republicans move on to other initiatives like infrastructure and wanted to ensure that any legislation to help rebuild America\u2019s roads and bridges was actually paid, and not financed, through deficit spending. After 2018, when his term expires, Mr. Corker\u2019s future is less clear. But he said he was not ruling out running for office again in some capacity.The final bill was not a \u2018home run,\u2019\u201d Mr. Corker said, noting that he was at peace with his choice.\u201cI feel like it was the right decision. I have no qualms about it,\u201d Mr. Corker said.Jesse Drucker contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Was Wrong About Bitcoin. Here\u2019s Why.", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftSeveral years ago, tech enthusiasts in San Francisco began buzzing about a new and mysterious thing called Bitcoin. There were rumors that the virtual money, invented by a pseudonymous math genius named Satoshi Nakamoto, would revolutionize modern finance and render government-backed currency obsolete. Or maybe it was just a passing fad.What happened? Why did so many people \u2014 myself included \u2014 get Bitcoin so spectacularly wrong? After a couple of weeks of thinking about it, I can point to at least five bad assumptions I made.I assumed that Bitcoin\u2019s future depended on its everyday use.Today, though, hardly anyone is spending Bitcoin on actual goods and services. (Why would you, if the value could jump 40 percent in two days, as it did last week?) And few merchants have gone through the hassle of updating their systems to accept cryptocurrency.As it turns out, while few people want to use Bitcoin as a currency, plenty want to treat it as an investable security, similar to gold or silver, especially while the price keeps rising.I assumed that the blockchain would eclipse Bitcoin itself.One of the earliest predictions among Bitcoin skeptics and boosters alike was that Bitcoin itself would be just a predecessor technology to the real, lasting innovation: the blockchain \u2014 the peer-to-peer ledger system that records cryptocurrency transactions and allows them to operate without a central authority. I agreed, thinking that the blockchain had real promise, but that Bitcoin would ultimately fade away.I assumed that regulators would crack down faster.I assumed that Wall Street would stay away.I assumed that Bitcoin\u2019s extreme volatility would be a turnoff.When Bitcoin\u2019s price was swinging wildly between $100 and $200, sometimes within a few days, I thought to myself, \u201cWho would sign up for such a roller-coaster ride?\u201d I na\u00efvely thought that what people liked about money was its stability, and knowing that $100 today would still be worth $100 tomorrow.But you know what\u2019s more popular than stable monetary instruments? Casinos! People love to gamble, and the spectacular rise of Bitcoin \u2014 especially in the age of social media, which tends to hasten trends and encourage bandwagon behavior \u2014 has encouraged a set of thrill-seeking speculators to bet big on the currency, hoping to make a quick buck and get out before a crash.Real Bitcoin enthusiasts, of course, will say that I\u2019m still missing the point, and that today\u2019s trading mania is just a prelude to an even bigger, more transformational era of cryptocurrency.

Rahm Emanuel, the Democratic mayor of Chicago, made a very different prediction.\u201cAll the companies that thought the last eight years were too over-regulated, in eight years they\u2019re going to be begging for regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot create the Wild West on energy.\u201dThe future of agriculture might be taking shape in Silicon Valley.Agriculture, forestry and changes in land use together produce about 21 percent of global emissions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. With the global population expected to approach 10 billion by 2050, agriculture is a critical part of the climate puzzle.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Both Mr. Emanuel and Edwin M. Lee, the mayor of San Francisco, said climate change was increasingly a municipal issue.Mr. Emanuel said his city was experiencing unusual weather extremes. Just a few years ago a blizzard dumped 24 inches of snow in less than 12 hours \u2014 while last year Chicago saw its driest winter since record-keeping began.Mayors of 80 North American cities will meet in Chicago next week, Mr. Emanuel said, to sign \u201ccustomized, very specific benchmark plans\u201d to help meet former President Barack Obama\u2019s pledge under the Paris agreement to cut domestic emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.Mr. Shellenberger, who described himself as a lifelong Democrat, said he was running as an independent. He declined to say how much money he had raised, and said his sole endorsement so far came from James Hansen, the former director of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies who is a supporter of nuclear energy.\u201cHe\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve asked,\u201d Mr. Shellenberger said.

{"Headline": "William Mayer, Wide-Ranging Composer, Is Dead at 91", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWilliam Mayer, a prolific composer who ranged from orchestral and chamber music to choral works, operas and more, all while displaying a whimsical streak to go along with his serious one, died at his home in Manhattan on Nov. 17, the day before his 92nd birthday.His daughter the journalist Jane Mayer said the cause was heart failure.Mr. Mayer received his first commission in 1952, for \u201cEssay for Brass and Winds,\u201d and was still creating new works in the 21st century. His better-known ones included the opera \u201cA Death in the Family,\u201d first produced in 1983 by the Minnesota Opera Company. His compositions were performed at major halls all over the world and recorded by ensembles of various sizes.Mr. Mayer, though, was not confined to the usual classical music boxes. He once wrote a three-act, six-minute opera, \u201cBrief Candle.\u201dMr. Mayer also had to his credit a number of works for children. Perhaps the best known is \u201cHello, World!,\u201d a musical tour of the world with text by Susan Otto in which voyagers learn how to say \u201cHello\u201d in an assortment of languages. On a 1959 RCA Victor recording by the Little Orchestra Society, the narration was provided by a voice familiar to millions of radio listeners. The reader was Eleanor Roosevelt.At 15 he attended the Taft School in Connecticut, and in 1944 he entered Yale. He finished two semesters before being drafted into the Army, eventually receiving counterintelligence training and serving in American-occupied Japan.After his military service he returned to Yale and graduated in 1948 with a history degree. He then embarked on a different path, enrolling at the Mannes College of Music, where his teachers included the music theorist Felix Salzer and the composer Roger Sessions.Mr. Mayer also experimented with musical-theater-style songs. Some of these were performed more than three decades later in Manhattan at a Merkin Concert Hall celebration of Mr. Mayer\u2019s 60th birthday, prompting John Rockwell to write in The Times, \u201cOne wondered whether Mr. Mayer might not have made an even greater success had he turned in Stephen Sondheim\u2019s direction, way back then.\u201dMr. Mayer\u2018s other piano works included \u201cAbandoned Bells\u201d (1982), of which Piano Quarterly said, \u201cPianists should bless its publication.\u201dHe also wrote numerous works for small, sometimes quirky groupings, like \u201cEnter Ariel\u201d (1980), a piece for piano, clarinet and voice that Mr. Page, in The Times, described as an \u201celoquent, imagistic song cycle.\u201dHis orchestral works included the piano concerto \u201cOctagon,\u201d which was performed at Carnegie Hall in 1971 with Leopold Stowkowski conducting.Some of his works were direct responses to serious times, like \u201cLetters Home,\u201d a setting of letters from servicemen in Vietnam. It was given its premiere at Carnegie Hall in May 1968 as part of a tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who had been assassinated the month before.\u201cThe three children were told to play quietly and not disturb the strange \u2018plunks\u2019 and \u2018plinks\u2019 that could be heard coming from behind the closed door,\u201d she said by email. \u201cHe would emerge only for cups of coffee, and an occasional sandwich.\u201dBesides writing music, Mr. Mayer sometimes wrote about music. In an article in 1975 for The Times, \u201cLive Composers, Dead Audiences,\u201d he pondered the difficulties that the visual, instant-gratification age presented for modern composers, whose works take time and repeated listenings to appreciate.\u201cWith television, we have become dependent on the visual,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut in listening to music, what do we do with our eyes? In TV, everything is there, explicit. Certain shows are doubly explicit: We see a comic routine and canned laughter reminds us it\u2019s funny. But in hearing unfamiliar music, our voyage \u2014 if we make one at all \u2014 is uncharted.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never heard anything like it!\u201d is one.\u201cIt evoked so many emotions!\u201d is another.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mortgage Giants Cut Deal With Treasury to Cover Expected Losses", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage finance giants rescued during the financial crisis, reached a deal with the Treasury Department on Thursday allowing them to keep some of their profits as they brace for losses that will be activated by the tax bill soon to be signed by President Trump.Under the terms of the agreement, each company will be allowed to retain $3 billion from their earnings to serve as a capital cushion against future losses, including a decline in the value of their tax-deferred assets.The arrangement is a change from the 2012 agreement that they reached with the Obama administration requiring that they send most of their profits to the Treasury as a condition for having been rescued by the Bush administration during the financial crisis. Fannie and Freddie required $187 billion of taxpayer aid in the 2008 financial crisis and were placed under government conservatorship as a result.The firms, which buy or guarantee home loans, have been profitable for the last several years but are required to send almost all those profits to the Treasury, leaving the firms with little capital to protect against future losses. The $3 billion capital cushion is intended to help Fannie and Freddie deal with \u201cordinary income fluctuations\u201d which could be exacerbated by the coming corporate tax cut. The drop in the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent is expected to bring steep losses to Fannie and Freddie as they write down the value of their tax-deferred assets.\u201cTreasury\u2019s first duty is to ensure that taxpayers are being protected,\u201d said Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary.Jim Parrott, a housing finance expert at the Urban Institute, said that the deal that was announced on Thursday was intended to minimize the risk of rash decision-making by Congress. He thinks lawmakers would be more likely to make hasty decisions if the companies are seen as taking bailouts.\u201cThey\u2019ve now mitigated the political risk that a draw will trigger nervous action by Congress,\u201d Mr. Parrott said, though he thinks that fear is overblown. \u201cA world in which they are asked to draw or need to draw on the Treasury is a world where a lot of folks on the Hill and elsewhere yell and scream about bailouts.\u201dBut the backlash is already in the air. Republicans swiftly criticized the deal, arguing that taxpayers should not be doing more to prop up the mortgage finance companies.\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed at F.H.F.A. and Treasury\u2019s decision to roll back these vital taxpayer protections,\u201d said Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and a longtime critic of the mortgage giants.Last year, before he was confirmed as Treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin said \u201cit makes no sense that these are owned by the government\u201d and added that Fannie and Freddie would be out of government control \u201creasonably fast.\u201d During his confirmation hearings earlier this year, however, Mr. Mnuchin softened his tone and said that housing finance change was necessary because the status quo was not acceptable.On Thursday, the secretary signaled that with the tax overhaul out of the way he would renew his focus on Fannie and Freddie in 2018.\u201cThe administration looks forward to working with Congress on comprehensive housing finance reform, a top priority in the year ahead,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Advertisement"}

The Cineworld-Regal combination would create a company with more than 9,500 screens in 10 countries.It comes at a time of flux for operators of movie theaters competing in an increasingly saturated marketplace.

{"Headline": "The Last Resort? Canyon Ranch Succumbs to Botox", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENOX, Mass. \u2014 In the freshly renovated dining hall of the Canyon Ranch on a Thursday night this fall, guests at the East Coast outpost of this famous health, fitness and wellness resort scattered at separate tables after a long day of cardio cross-training and Pilates classes, facials, massages, genetics-based nutrition consultations and indoor-swimming pool aerobics.There were two beautiful and tall yoga-pants-clad young women on a getaway with grandmothers in leopard-print leggings. Near them, a middle-aged man and woman toasted each other with decaffeinated herbal tea. Alcohol has never been served at Canyon Ranch because it is considered a distraction from the work of restoring and rejuvenating.But you can now get your face shot full of Botox here.Perhaps the biggest indication of the changes at Canyon Ranch \u2014 a naturalistic if expensive haven created by Mr. Zuckerman to be, as he said in a phone interview, \u201ca fat farm where people would enjoy themselves\u201d \u2014 is the addition of an aesthetics center offering not just Botox but also Juvederm, Voluma and Latisse.\u201cWe\u2019re not adding cosmetic procedures, we\u2019re adding confidence procedures,\u201d Ms. Docherty said at the Lenox location, a Gilded Age mansion that has undergone a $10 million renovation. \u201cOur product is personal, precise and science based.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of boomers who have not taken very good care of themselves,\u201d she said.\u201cSleep is sexy right now, it is totally sexy,\u201d she said.Mr. Zuckerman had been an accountant in New Jersey and moved his pregnant wife and young child in 1958 to the desert town of Tucson, where he became a real estate developer. As he approached his 40th birthday in 1968, a doctor told him that his yo-yo dieting was going to kill him. He needed to lose 30 to 40 pounds for good.He went to Rancho La Puerta in Tecate, Mexico, but was the only male guest there and left after a self-conscious two days.Ten years later, after his father died, Mr. Zuckerman again decided to confront his health. He went to the Oaks at Ojai, in California, and at last began to lose the weight. He returned home thinking about how to focus fully on his new commitment to health and fitness.Two weeks after returning, he and his wife bought a 42-acre dude ranch in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains of Arizona for $714,000. He hired Karma Kientzler, the woman at the Oaks at Ojai who had helped him to find a fitness program (then a somewhat novel concept) feasible for a middle-aged man with a history of asthma.Ms. Kientzler moved with her two young children to Tucson and began to imagine what a day at Canyon Ranch might be like. \u201cI wanted the morning to start out with stretch for men and women, I wanted aquatics, I wanted aerobics,\u201d she said by phone recently, as she readied herself to head to Canyon Ranch, where she still works.The Zuckermans put mirrors up around a clubhouse they owned near the Canyon Ranch property and let Ms. Kientzler use it as a studio to train instructors. \u201cTucson was so small then, I had to go to Phoenix to buy the kind of record player I needed,\u201d she said.\u201cTo be in Tucson and not to hike is to be in Paris and not see the Eiffel Tower,\u201d Ms. Hochman told him.In the 1980s, Mr. Zuckerman decided he wanted to offer yoga but couldn\u2019t find any instructors in town. \u201cThe only place I finally found yoga teachers was west of Tucson, there was a seminary or sanctuary or something,\u201d he said. \u201cThese men and women came to the Ranch in white robes and taught yoga. I got letters and phone calls from guests saying, \u2018Are you turning this place into a cult?\u2019\u201dDestination health spas had been a part of American culture (the Golden Door, Cal-a-Vie), but Canyon Ranch\u2019s focus on a mind-body-spirit approach to weight loss, with exercise and small portions punctuated by indulgences like massage and body treatments, was seized on by high-profile figures, including Richard Simmons and Oprah.In Vail, Colo., a few years after Canyon Ranch opened, Ms. Kientzler met a man named Ron Fletcher, a former Martha Graham dancer who was teaching a strengthening movement program that he had studied for years in New York at the physical therapy studio owned by Joseph and Clara Pilates.Celebrities, upper-middle-class suburbanites and rich vacationers from around the country (and beyond) flocked to Canyon Ranch to jump-start health and weight loss. In 1989, the company opened the outpost in Lenox.Over the next two decades, the company expanded and contracted like some of its clients\u2019 waistlines.One of Ms. Docherty\u2019s big ventures is the development of 19 luxury apartments attached to the Lenox resort, resplendent with white marble and costing in the millions. Eleven units remain on the market.\u201cI think people are waiting to see if Canyon Ranch is going to change,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerman, who was supportive of the project.Many of the concepts Mr. Zuckerman championed have become part of Americans\u2019 everyday lives. Boutique fitness studios and day spas are now in strip malls around the country. Being able to spend extended time in a public setting wearing workout leggings is no longer a special thrill. Whole Foods and other distributors have made organic food and juice bars mainstream.But the loyalty of aging baby boomers is a considerable asset. Ms. Docherty is trying to bring energy and attract new customers to an enterprise that gets more than half of its business (58 percent in Tucson, 55 percent in Lenox) from repeat guests.Nili Cohen, 73, from Fort Lee, N.J., is one of them, first vacationing at the resort in Lenox about 25 years ago. This October she visited for the 110th time.Ms. Cohen likes to start her days at Canyon Ranch on the group walk at 7 a.m., then eats a small breakfast, does a 9 a.m. stretch class and then plays tennis for a few hours. She often caps off the day with a 4 p.m. \u201cmuscle melt massage,\u201d followed by a meditation session and perhaps a facial. She sees on-staff doctors there to monitor her cholesterol.Thus far, she has loved the changes implemented by Ms. Docherty and her team. The food is better, Ms. Cohen said, and the gym equipment is more modern.But she doesn\u2019t like Botox, even as she understands why Canyon Ranch is starting to offer it. \u201cThey have to be with the times,\u201d Ms. Cohen said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For McConnell, Health Care Failure Was a Map to Tax Success", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 For Mitch McConnell and fellow Senate Republicans, the push for a sweeping tax overhaul was never anything like the divisive internal party struggle that prevented repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\u201cAll of my members, from Collins to Cruz, were just more comfortable with this issue,\u201d Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, said in an interview this weekend, referring to the centrist Susan Collins of Maine and the conservative Ted Cruz of Texas. \u201cEverybody really wanted to get to yes. There was a widespread belief that this was just a good thing to do for the country and for us politically.\u201dMr. McConnell said time would tell. \u201cThey are convinced it is good politics to be against it, and we believe it is good politics to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe either get the growth rates or we don\u2019t. In other words, one of these sides is going to be proven wrong.\u201d\u201cWe had endless meetings getting everybody comfortable with the substance,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cThat was a stark contrast with a lot of the meetings we had on health care.\u201dSome senators who would require attention were obvious from the health care debate, including Mr. McCain, Ms. Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. And others, including Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, had raised alarms early on about the deficit.Mr. McConnell consulted regularly with Mr. Trump about the influence he could apply on wavering members or those he should steer clear of, as the case may be.\u201cWe talked about it a lot,\u201d Mr. McConnell said of his dealings with the president. \u201cThere were some members who were in doubt that he was helpful with and some he would not have been helpful with.\u201dMr. Johnson, who complained that the bill shortchanged small businesses, was one who came in for added attention from Mr. Trump, who pointedly urged him by name during a private party meeting last Tuesday not to bring down the bill.Mr. McCain was a special case, given his stature and because he had brought down the health care repeal with his complaints that the Senate hadn\u2019t followed \u201cregular order\u201d in developing and debating the bill. His fellow Republicans took pains to keep him updated on the committee consideration and review of the bill and to make the case that a strong economy contributed to America\u2019s strong posture internationally.The potential holdout senators were able to wring out concessions as leaders scrambled to push the legislation to approval, an outcome Mr. McConnell attributed to their skillfully using their leverage. In the end, only one of them, Mr. Corker, peeled away for the final, 51-to-49 vote.Mr. McConnell acknowledged that some Americans would see their taxes go up under the proposal and said it was impossible to do such a broad overhaul without someone paying more.Despite projections the legislation could cost the government $1.5 trillion, he insisted it ultimately would not add to and might even shrink deficits because of the economic expansion he expects it to generate.\u201cWe are pretty confident this is going to get the country up to a higher growth rate, which will improve wages because demand for employees will go up and improve the government revenues as well, which makes the deficit shrink,\u201d he said.Mr. McConnell expects negotiations between the House and the Senate to resolve differences between their two measures to move quickly and meet a goal of delivering a measure to the president by Christmas.Mr. McConnell said the combination of the tax bill and his record of advancing conservative judicial nominees he sees as changing the federal courts for a generation should put those complaints to bed.\u201cIt would be hard to argue that is not a year of significant accomplishment,\u201d he said.How the Republican plan resonates politically could depend on how quickly any benefits from the tax bill are realized, if there are broad benefits to be had.Democrats held united against the legislation and are gearing up to attack it in the coming months as a reckless giveaway to the rich that was forced through along partisan lines and does little for the middle-class voters Mr. Trump promised would be the chief beneficiaries of his tenure.If the predicted economic gains for businesses and individuals don\u2019t materialize, Republicans could pay a steep price \u2014 a fact not lost on Mr. McConnell, who hopes to see hints of accelerated growth soon.\u201cObviously, they hope none of this happens before November 2018,\u201d Mr. McConnell said of Democrats. \u201cAnd obviously, we hope the signs are there before that.\u201d\u201cWe would love for it to happen sooner rather than later,\u201d Mr. McConnell said with a wry chuckle.For Mr. McConnell and Republicans, the clock is ticking even as they close in on one of their long-sought achievements.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hacking the Tax Plan: Ways to Profit Off the Republican Tax Bill", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nProfessionals call it tax planning. Analysts call them tax games. We\u2019re calling them tax hacks. Every tax bill has little incentives or loopholes that encourage some behaviors and discourage others. The bill that is expected to come up for a final vote next week is no different: It is full of little opportunities to make money \u2014 or at least save some.We\u2019ve put together a list of some of the most interesting and useful tricks, with help from some of the country\u2019s leading experts in law and finance. This isn\u2019t meant to be real tax advice \u2014 for that you\u2019ll need to hire a professional \u2014 but it does shed light on the key features (or holes) in the bill.Many are changes that involve doing something right now, in the final days of 2017. Others would take longer to pull off but could have lasting payoffs, reaching into the next generation.House and Senate negotiators have announced the package of reforms they hope to pass soon, though some details may change. Here are some money-making opportunities in the current legislation, ranked by degree of difficulty.If you\u2019re feeling generous, you\u2019re likely to get a reward if you donate now, under the current tax system. Because of changes to tax rules, most families won't be able to itemize deductions and thus won't get much tax benefit from charitable giving once the new system kicks in. So it is probably better to give now, when you can write it off as part of an itemized tax return.The same logic applies to any other expense that you can currently itemize: The deductions are likely to be worth more to most people this year than in the future. If you can afford to pay some of your mortgage or student loan bills early, including interest \u2014 or pay for big, anticipated medical expenses \u2014 you will probably get a bigger benefit if you do it this year. The downside to these strategies: \u201cYou have to write a check,\u201d said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \u201cThat\u2019s always true in life \u2014 you have to have money to make money.\u201dThe bill creates a tax credit for businesses that offer paid financial leave to new parents \u2014 but only for two years, and only in states that don\u2019t already require such leave to be paid. That means hopeful parents who live in red states may want to consider childbearing in 2018 or 2019.The bill makes big changes to the estate tax that will influence when it would be best to inherit a large fortune, should one be coming your way. Currently, estates worth more than $5.5 million are subject to a 40 percent tax, while smaller ones can be transferred with no tax at all. The bill would double that limit, beginning next year, then roll it back to the current level in 2026. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Weekend at Bernie\u2019s\u2019 Act of December 2017,\u201d said Daniel Hemel, an assistant law professor at the University of Chicago who studies taxes. \u201cAnd the \u2018Throw Momma From the Train\u2019 Act of December 2025.\u201dIf you\u2019re going to move, consider doing it now. Among the many tax credits that would be repealed under the tax bill is one for moving expenses.The tax bill will limit the degree to which people can deduct state and local taxes from their income before calculating federal taxes, starting in the 2018 tax year. That means that, for people who pay high local taxes in such places and itemize on their return, there\u2019s an advantage in shifting as much income into this year as possible. The more you earn before the switch, the more you\u2019ll pay in state income tax, and the more you can discount your federal taxes \u2014 an opportunity that will be more limited next year.There are a few maneuvers that might prove useful. If you work for a company that tends to pay large annual bonuses, like a hedge fund, ask if you can get your bonus before the end of the year. If you have valuable stock you hope to sell in the near future, you may want to do it now.These strategies make sense only in places where local taxes are high, and for taxpayers who are not paying the alternative minimum tax. \u201cIf you were in Florida, it wouldn\u2019t pay to do this,\u201d said Bob Gordon, the president of Twenty-First Securities, a New York-based brokerage and money management firm.Starting next year, the tax law would limit 1031 exchanges to real estate transactions only \u2014  meaning this is a good time to upgrade your jet, if you\u2019re going to do it. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to affect the private jet industry,\u201d Mr. Gordon said, anticipating more transactions this year and fewer in the future.Currently, such tax-free accounts are devised to help parents save money to pay for their children\u2019s college educations. But the tax bill would allow parents to use money from the accounts to pay for up to $10,000 a year in K-12 private education.Mr. Irwin\u2019s company would be joining the ranks of the most common type of business in America: the pass-through. In typical corporations, the company\u2019s profits are taxed twice: once on the company\u2019s income and again on the dividends passed on to its shareholders. But in pass-throughs, the company\u2019s income is essentially \u201cpassed through\u201d to the owner and taxed at whatever tax bracket the owner is in. Most kinds of freelance and consulting businesses operate as pass-throughs. So do companies that are organized as partnerships, like law firms, dental practices and many real estate firms.If you\u2019re really wealthy and earn a lot of money you don\u2019t plan on spending soon, you may want to turn yourself into a different kind of company: a corporation, instead of a pass-through. As a so-called C-corp, your company\u2019s earnings will be subject to the 21 percent corporate tax, a big reduction from the top individual rate, even with the pass-through discount. And, under the bill, corporations are allowed to deduct all state and local taxes, which individuals and pass-throughs can\u2019t. The downside comes if you want to pay those earnings to yourself; they would become subject to a dividends tax.If you think you\u2019ll need the money right away, and earn less than 315,000, a pass-through may be better for you. But if you will never spend the money, you can leave your corporate earnings to your heirs, who won\u2019t have to pay such taxes for cashing out. And if you don\u2019t need much of it for a long time, you can at least avoid paying higher taxes on the savings until you withdraw them. \u201cIf you\u2019re wanting to save a lot of money, you might want to become a C-corp, and if you want to spend it right away, you would want to be a pass-through,\u201d said Lily Batchelder, a law professor at N.Y.U. who has also worked on tax policy in the Senate and for the Obama administration\u2019s National Economic Council.This move comes courtesy of provisions meant to tax certain types of pass-through income for companies that provide professional services, like medical practices and investment firms.Let\u2019s say you own a business that performs a service that tends to pay its partners more than $315,000, like a law firm. Split it in two: one company that owns the capital (the building and copy machines, for example) and a sister company that hires and pays all the lawyers.Then, have the business that owns the capital charge the company that owns the labor a fee for use of the building and machines. Most of the income for the sister company that owns the capital would qualify for the lower pass-through rate, while much of the lawyer services company will have to pay higher taxes.What the plan is exploiting is that under the new tax system, the corporate tax rate would be much lower than other rates. All the transactions, like the tax-free exchanges, are legal under the current system. It\u2019s just that having the huge tax benefit would make playing these tricky games more valuable.The new rules mean that lots of people are going to need advice about how to restructure their finances and their business organizations. \u201cThis isn\u2019t necessarily simplification,\u201d said Ron Dabrowski, a principal in the Washington National Tax practice of KPMG LLP, who has worked on tax policy for the Internal Revenue Service, for the Treasury Department and on Capitol Hill.Mr. Dabrowski noted that the tax bill restructures vast parts of the tax code and layers on new rules at different times: \u201cAs people try to figure out what the law is and what it means, professional services are going to be needed.\u201dThe faster you can set up your accounting or law practice, the better. The highest demand for professional advice is likely to come in the next few years, as people learn the new rules. But the continuing complexity of the tax system means that your career change could pay off in the long term.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once a Long Shot, Democrat Doug Jones Wins Alabama Senate Race", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2014 Doug Jones, a Democratic former prosecutor who mounted a seemingly quixotic Senate campaign in the face of Republican dominance here, defeated his scandal-scarred opponent, Roy S. Moore, after a brutal campaign marked by accusations of sexual abuse and child molestation against the Republican.The upset delivered an unimagined victory for Democrats and shaved Republicans\u2019 unstable Senate majority to a single seat.Amid thunderous applause from his supporters at a downtown hotel, Mr. Jones held up his victory as a message to Washington from voters fed up with political warfare. For once, he said, Alabama had declined to take \u201cthe wrong fork\u201d at a political crossroads.\u201cWe have shown the country the way that we can be unified,\u201d Mr. Jones declared, draping his election in the language of reconciliation and consensus. \u201cThis entire race has been about dignity and respect. This campaign has been about the rule of law.\u201dMr. Trump tweeted his congratulations to Mr. Jones \u201con a hard fought victory.\u201d\u201cThe people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt never ends!\u201dPropelled by a backlash against Mr. Moore, an intensely polarizing former judge who was accused of sexually assaulting young girls, Mr. Jones overcame the state\u2019s daunting demographics and deep cultural conservatism. His campaign targeted African-American voters with a sprawling, muscular turnout operation, and appealed to educated white voters to turn their backs on the Republican Party.Those pleas paid off on Tuesday, as precincts in Birmingham and its suburbs handed Mr. Jones overwhelming margins while he also won convincingly in Huntsville and other urban centers. The abandonment of Mr. Moore by affluent white voters, along with strong support from black voters, proved decisive, allowing Mr. Jones to transcend Alabama\u2019s rigid racial polarization and assemble a winning coalition. And solidifying Mr. Jones\u2019s victory were the Republican-leaning residents who chose to write in the name of a third candidate rather than back one of the two major party nominees. More than 20,000 voters here cast write-in ballots, which amounted to 1.7 percent of the electorate - about the same as Mr. Jones\u2019s overall margin.To progressive voters, Mr. Jones\u2019s victory was a long-awaited rejection of the divisive brand of politics that Alabama has inevitably rewarded even as some of its Southern neighbors were turning to more moderate leaders.At a party for Mr. Jones, Sue Bell Cobb, a former chief judge of the Alabama Supreme Court, said that he had overcome a culture of \u201ctoxic partisanship,\u201d reaching out to Republicans and electrifying restive Democrats.\u201cNever has there been this level of civic engagement,\u201d said Ms. Cobb, who is planning to run for governor next year. \u201cNever has it happened.\u201dShe was drowned out by a raucous cry from her fellow Democrats and clasped her hands to her face as she saw on a huge projection screen that Mr. Jones had pulled ahead. Mayor Randall Woodfin of Birmingham, a newly inaugurated Democrat standing just feet away, beamed as returns from his city helped put Mr. Jones over the top.\u201cIt feels great,\u201d he said with undisguised elation. \u201cIt sends a message not just to America but to the world.\u201dAnalysis of the U.S. Senate election results, both statewide and broken down by key counties and voter groups.On election night, as the results came in from Alabama\u2019s cities and Mr. Moore\u2019s lead evaporated, the mood at the candidate\u2019s election night party in Montgomery darkened. A saxophonist played a slow rendition of \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d and the crowd quieted as the results from The New York Times website posted on a projection screen turned toward Mr. Jones.Taking the stage over an hour after The Associated Press called the race, Mr. Moore refused to concede and instructed a subdued crowd to \u201cwait on God and let this process play out.\u201d\u201cGo home and sleep on it,\u201d he told supporters.The election is a painful setback for Republicans in Washington, who have already struggled to enact policies of any scale and now face even tougher legislative math. Mr. Moore\u2019s success in the Republican primary here, and the subsequent general-election fiasco, may deter mainstream Republicans from seeking office in 2018 and could prompt entrenched incumbents to consider retirement.But there is also a measure of relief for some party leaders that Mr. Moore will not join the chamber, carrying with him a radioactive cloud of scandal. A number of Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, had indicated that Mr. Moore would face an ethics investigation if he were elected, and possibly expulsion from the Senate.Mr. Trump and Republican activists would most likely have opposed such a measure, setting up a potentially drastic, monthslong clash within the Republican Party, now averted thanks to Mr. Jones.Still, that relief comes at a steep price. Before the election in Alabama, Republicans were heavily favored to keep control of the Senate in 2018, when Democrats must defend 25 seats, including 10 in states that Mr. Trump carried in 2016. Just two or three Republican-held seats appear vulnerable, in Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee.But after Mr. Jones is sworn in, Republicans will control only 51 seats, creating a plausible route for Democrats to take over.If the election burst into the national consciousness in early November, with the sex-abuse claims against Mr. Moore, it was an intensifying political migraine for Republican leaders months before then. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pluck Mr. Sessions from the Senate in early 2017 touched off a grim comedy of errors for the party, involving two Alabama governors, a Senate appointment widely seen as tainted by corruption, a rescheduled special election and a botched attempt by national Republican donors to crush dissent in the Republican primary.For all their efforts, party leaders were rewarded with Mr. Moore, whom they grudgingly embraced in the early fall \u2014 just in time for a scandal of unmatched luridness to appear.National Republican officials abandoned Mr. Moore\u2019s campaign. Yet after it appeared that Mr. Moore remained viable, Mr. Trump offered a Thanksgiving week defense of the candidate and urged the people of Alabama to oppose Mr. Jones.Yet the conclusion of the campaign was largely to Mr. Jones\u2019s benefit.Mr. Jones raised $10.2 million in just over a month and a half, and third-party groups augmented his candidacy, helping him finance an extensive voter turnout effort after he had dominated the state\u2019s airwaves for weeks.He raced across Alabama with a handful of out-of-state surrogates and one local celebrity, the basketball star Charles Barkley, in the election\u2019s last days, focusing his attention on cities, college towns and heavily black communities.Mr. Moore, instead of facing questions about accusations of sexual abuse, largely vanished from the campaign in the last week. He returned to Alabama for a rally in the rural, southeast corner of the state on Monday with Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist.But the most memorable comments from the event did not come from Mr. Moore. Rather, they emerged from Mr. Bannon, who mocked the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a University of Alabama graduate, for not attending a more prestigious school; Mr. Moore\u2019s wife, Kayla, who angrily denied charges the couple was anti-Semitic by noting \u201cone of our attorneys is a Jew;\u201d and an Army friend of the candidate, who recalled the two of them being uneasy walking into a Vietnam brothel to find \u201cpretty girls\u201d whom Mr. Moore found too young.Advertisement"}

Reicher, director of the Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford.While some industry groups said they still had concerns about a technical change in the final bill that could negatively affect a key financing tool used for wind and solar projects, they expressed relief that most of the major incentives for renewable energy had survived the negotiations.With only a slim majority in the Senate, Republican leaders could not afford to alienate lawmakers in their own party who favored these clean energy provisions.In the end, lawmakers made significant tweaks to this provision, allowing multinational banks and other investors to use wind and solar credits to offset as much as 80 percent of the minimum tax. But they also made a separate change that could end up applying the minimum-tax provision to a broader set of investors \u2014 a change that caught renewable advocates off guard and could potentially shrink the market for tax-equity financing.\u201cWe\u2019re grateful that Congress eliminated most of the provisions that would have been devastating to the renewable energy sector,\u201d said Gregory Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy. \u201cBut on this one complicated issue, which is important for financing, we have an uncertain result.\u201dIt remains unclear how much of an impact this latest change could have on wind and solar growth.

Not acquisitions.\u2022 Is Broadcom making a jobs promise it can\u2019t fulfill?\u2022 Republicans have a two-seat majority in the Senate.

(So could having a Republican senator who feuds with Mitch McConnell and other G.O.P. leaders.)That point was one of six observations that Goldman\u2019s economic team put out Tuesday. Here are a few others:The answer? Not very, especially for a company with more than $250 billion in cash on its balance sheet and a market value within spitting distance of $1 trillion.Apple has disclosed only 11 acquisitions valued at $4.5 billion in its history, according to Thomson Reuters.To put that into perspective, we asked Thomson Reuters to pull some numbers. (One note on the data below, deal values include completed acquisitions and ones that are currently pending.)\u2022 The most acquisitive company? General Electric, which has made 1,206 acquisitions valued at $311 billion. Of course, G.E. has been around for more than a century, while Apple went public in 1980. So how does Apple compare with other tech companies?\u2022 Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, HP and Intel each have made acquisitions valued at more than $50 billion.\u2022 Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which was founded in 1998, has done 223 deals valued at $29 billion. Facebook? The social media giant, which has been around since 2004, has pulled the trigger on 65 deals with a value of $23 billion.\u2022 Apple, in fact, doesn\u2019t even rank in the top 100 most acquisitive tech companies.More from Andrew\u2019s column:Mr. Tan of Broadcom has boasted that he plans to spend $3 billion \u201cin research and engineering.\u201d Mr. Tan has been given high marks for managing the portfolio of Broadcom assets effectively, but he has never been known for industry-changing innovations.Qualcomm has its own headacheWhile some analysts and investors think Qualcomm might raise its bid for NXP as a way to deter Broadcom \u2014 which doesn\u2019t want the NXP deal to become any more expensive \u2014 Qualcomm says that for now it\u2019s sticking by its $110-a-share offer.Under the terms, Interstate will become the exclusive supplier of car batteries to Advance, one of the biggest auto parts sellers in the United States starting this spring.Interstate believes that the partnership could bolster its sales significantly, while Advance is hoping that a product alliance with a well-regarded parts maker would help stanch a 43 percent drop in its stock price over the past year.From a statement by Scott Miller, Interstate\u2019s C.E.O.:This alliance places us where our professional and retail customers are making purchasing decisions, allowing Advance Auto Parts and independent Carquest stores to serve as convenient, one-stop shops to meet our customers\u2019 needs.The department\u2019s long-awaited study of the Senate Republicans\u2019 proposed overhaul runs to about 489 words in length (including the title and footnotes) and, in the reckoning of even conservative commentators, does not actually detail the legislation\u2019s economic effects.The reaction from analysts\u2022 It\u2019s \u201can odd way to analyze a tax bill,\u201d said Scott Greenberg at the Tax Foundation.\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t believe in magic,\u201d said David Brockway, a staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation during the Reagan administration.The tax flyaroundThat clears the path for Disney to buy the Fox television and movie studios, stakes in the international broadcasters Sky and Star and other significant divisions.

No civil discourse. No cooperation. Misinformation. Mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem.

{"Headline": "Homeowners Have Had It Good. Too Good, Says the Tax Bill.", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, the tax code has been filled with rewards for homeownership. Tax breaks encourage people to get into first homes and to trade up as they get older, building a national mind-set that you\u2019re never quite middle class until you\u2019ve qualified for a mortgage.It amounts to a vast social engineering project that assumes society is better off with owners instead of renters. But the tax bill making its way toward final passage is upending that premise.The bill will increase many homeowners\u2019 monthly housing costs by scaling back deductions that allow them to reduce mortgage interest and property taxes. And by roughly doubling the standard deduction, it reduces the incentive to buy homes by making far fewer homeowners eligible for preferential tax treatment.The Republican plan, in short, is tinkering with subsidies so entrenched in the social fabric that they have become entitlements in all but name.\u201cIt suggests a limit in the federal government\u2019s willingness to subsidize ownership,\u201d said Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard. \u201cIt\u2019s also a reflection of just how expensive housing has become, and how it feels problematic to be using the tax code to support people buying houses that are this expensive or, even worse, to be encouraging housing prices to rise further.\u201dBoth parties have long championed homeownership as a way to help people build wealth and keep neighborhoods more stable. But economists like Mr. Glaeser have been critical of the resulting subsidies.In their view, the government has made homeownership and its financing artificially cheap through the tax code and mortgage backers like Fannie Mae. As a result, people are encouraged to take on more debt than they might otherwise \u2014 to buy bigger homes and second homes, and to plow the equity they accrue into renovations and personal spending.This distorts the economy in a number of ways. For starters, it\u2019s unfair: Since the benefits of these deductions get bigger with larger and more expensive homes, the bulk of the benefits accrue to wealthier homeowners in pricier markets. This alters the landscape by encouraging more single-family homes and suburban sprawl. That, in turn, prompts the government to spend more on roads and infrastructure and makes housing a bigger portion of the economy than it would be in the absence of federal help.Construction, though, is one of the least productive industries. By funneling more of the national debt and savings into construction, the government is hindering sectors, like education and manufacturing, that have a bigger economic payoff.Edward J. Pinto, co-director of the conservative American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Center for Housing Markets and Finance, has described the interest deduction and other homeowner subsidies as a wasteful giveaway that inflates home prices and encourages people to borrow excessively.\u201cMy basic view is if you subsidize something you\u2019ll get more of it, and as a country we\u2019ve been subsidizing debt,\u201d he said.The legislation would cut taxes for corporations. American taxpayers, in large part, would also get cuts, though most of the changes affecting them would expire after 2025.Jeff Neubauer is already thinking more conservatively. Mr. Neubauer, 34, who helps manage his family\u2019s electrical contracting business and lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif., is looking to trade up from his two-bedroom condominium to a larger home in the $800,000-to-$900,000 range. Now, he is worried that the cost of ownership will be much higher and will rather play it safe until the effects of the bill are clearer.\u201cIt makes me want to not spend as much money,\u201d he said.The size of the deduction made it a tempting target for Republicans. To stay within legislative boundaries, the Republicans need to limit the budget consequences of tax cuts largely benefiting corporations and the wealthy. Reducing housing deductions \u2014 benefits that disproportionately flow to homeowners in wealthier Democratic cities \u2014 helps recover some revenues while concentrating the impact on relatively few people, most of whom are unlikely to vote for Republicans.\u201cThe final tax reform bill released punishes homeowners and weakens homeownership,\u201d the California Association of Realtors said in a statement issued on Friday, \u201cand in fact, it looks at homeowners and the housing market as nothing more than a piggy bank.\u201dEarlier versions of the bill prompted real estate agents in Bakersfield, Calif., to protest and chant \u201cSave Homeownership\u201d in front of the local office of Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader. And the provisions affecting homeownership were among the few main sticking points among House Republicans, particularly those from Mr. McCarthy\u2019s state.It is, of course, hard to gauge the long-term ramifications of a tax bill that is flying through Congress in hopes of allowing Republicans and the Trump administration to claim a major legislative victory.That uncertainty is leading to major confusion for home shoppers like Morgan Molnar. Ms. Molnar, a 29-year-old who works in product marketing, lives in the Silicon Valley city of Sunnyvale and is looking for a home costing $1 million to $1.2 million. She and her husband have been approved for a mortgage and were ready to make offers, but are now feeling hesitant.Better to push forward because the Bay Area\u2019s already-low inventory is going to shrink? Or will reduced tax deductions lower prices by reducing the number of people who can afford homes?\u201cYou\u2019re leaning forward but afraid to make that leap because of the situation,\u201d she said.One thing that seems certain is that the lack of inventory already plaguing the housing market will get worse. By allowing homeowners already benefiting from the existing mortgage interest deduction cap to keep it, the bill is likely to encourage people to stay in place a bit longer.The plan could also affect consumer spending. Over the past two decades, homeowners have become accustomed to using steadily rising home prices to periodically refinance their mortgages so that they can take money out of their homes and spend it on everything from renovations to college tuition and vacations.These \u201ccash-out refinancings\u201d were widely abused before the housing crisis \u2014 the proverbial \u201cpeople using their homes as A.T.M.s.\u201d It has been less of a problem since the crisis. Today, some 42 million homeowners have about $5.35 trillion in home equity that they could hypothetically tap into, according to Black Knight, a software and data provider to the mortgage industry. This assumes they don\u2019t borrow more than 80 percent of the value of their home.Whatever happens, it has led to a chaotic end of the year for real estate agents. Kalena Masching, a Silicon Valley agent for Redfin, a real estate brokerage based in Seattle, has one group of clients trying to push sales through before any tax changes take effect. Another group is holding off to see how the loss of homeowner deductions ends up changing the math of buying a home.\u201cThere\u2019s an overwhelming sense of people being upset and a lot of uncertainty, and mostly feeling like it\u2019s not a good thing,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

The plants were worth almost $1,000, the authorities said.Footage from local TV outlets showed the donkeys, in the town of Orai in Uttar Pradesh State, plodding out of a dingy jail in single file with their heads bowed, much like the classic police perp walk.In September, a rare wild bison wandered across from Poland into eastern Germany, where it was spotted near the town of Lebus.Conservationists, who have worked to protect the species, were outraged and the World Wide Fund for Nature in Germany filed a lawsuit against the local official, setting off a state investigation.Advertisement"}

Cuomo signed an executive order suspending provisions in state law that might have blocked some residents from prepaying next year\u2019s property taxes.Mr. Cuomo, a possible presidential contender, said the move was aimed at protecting residents from the \u201cdivisive\u201d Trump administration\u2019s tax law that is an \u201ceconomic dagger targeted for the heart\u201d of New York. It could increase the amount of federal taxes paid by New Yorkers by $14 billion, Mr. Cuomo said during a conference call with reporters.\u201cThis is now red vs. blue. They are using New York, California and the other blue states to finance the tax cuts in red states,\u201d said Mr. Cuomo.He said some people may think the executive order was designed to \u201ccircumvent\u201d the tax bill President Trump just signed.\u201cYou are damned right,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.Andrew Eifler, a product manager for a technology company, and his wife, Miranda Eifler, who have a 15-month-old son, plan to prepay some of the $21,000 in annual property taxes on their home in Tarrytown, a village in Greenburgh.\u201cIt could save us $5,000 or $6,000,\u201d said Mr. Eifler.Suburban residents fear a cap on the deduction will make it harder to do things such as save for college or even sell their homes because the property taxes will no longer be fully deductible. Passage of the tax bill has prompted a mad dash to lock in every bit of savings by prepaying as much of 2018\u2019s property taxes as possible before Jan. 1.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of the future value of my home and it affects the amount we can put away for college,\u201d Mr. Eifler said.In Greenburgh, where the average house is valued at $700,000, 87 percent of residential homeowners pay more than $10,000 in property taxes.In the Nassau County village of Port Washington North, Mayor Bob Weitzner received so many questions about property tax prepayment that he asked his town clerk to contact state officials for guidance.Nicole Kaeding, an economist with the Tax Foundation, called prepayment a \u201cvalid tax planning strategy.\u201d\u201cThe rush is to prepay for this year to get more of a deduction before the cap is in place,\u201d said Ms. Kaeding.Marty Abo, owner of Abo and Company, an accounting firm in Mount Laurel, N.J., has received many queries about prepayment of state and local taxes. (The tax law prohibits prepayment of 2018 state and local income taxes.)Each client is different depending on their income and other factors, but Mr. Abo said everything seems to point to the idea that it makes sense to prepay property taxes.Under guidance issued to the Town of Clarkstown in Rockland County by the New York State Comptroller\u2019s office in 1985 \u2014 the last time state and local tax deductions were at risk \u2014 New York residents are allowed to prepay property taxes if the municipal tax collection agency has been issued a warrant to collect the tax levy.Westchester County collects taxes in April, which means, absent the governor\u2019s action, tax warrants probably would not have been ready in time for residents to prepay 2018 property taxes. The governor\u2019s order allows towns to issue their tax warrants and accept 2018 property tax prepayments through Dec. 31.\u201cI think they realized that people are really furious,\u201d said Mr. Feiner who had been calling for the changes for weeks but was excited about Mr. Cuomo\u2019s executive order. \u201cWe have to act really quickly, and implementation is going to be tough, but I think it will be worth it.\u201dAlphonso David, the governor\u2019s counsel, said the administration wanted to see the final version of the tax bill before deciding what action to take.The Hastings-on-Hudson Democratic Committee also passed a resolution calling for action.\u201cThis tax bill is a direct attack on the most precious aspects of the American system of governance. We have to resist,\u201d said Vanessa H. Merton, the committee chairwoman and a professor at the Pace University law school.Ms. Merton lives in the house her parents bought in 1950 and has seen Hastings-on-Hudson change from a town of factory workers to hipsters and hedge fund managers.\u201cThe reason I live in one of the most expensive places in the world is because I was born there,\u201d said Ms. Merton. \u201cI don\u2019t have it in me to walk away from this house, but it\u2019s getting harder and harder.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Assad Must Go, Erdogan Says, as Syria War Winds Down", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Turkey\u2019s leader denounced President Bashar al-Assad of Syria on Wednesday as a terrorist mass murderer with no place in that country\u2019s postwar future, scrapping a softened approach that Turkish officials had taken toward Mr. Assad in recent years.The statement by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey came as Mr. Assad seemed more confident than ever that he has won the war and will remain Syria\u2019s leader for the foreseeable future. It also came against the backdrop of maneuvering by many powers \u2014 most notably Russia and Iran, Mr. Assad\u2019s most important allies \u2014 to influence the outcome of a devastating conflict that has reshaped Middle East politics.One of the first leaders in the region to condemn Mr. Assad when the conflict began in 2011, Mr. Erdogan had in recent months signaled a willingness to accept Mr. Assad\u2019s political longevity.The Turkish leader\u2019s shift on Wednesday was a reminder of their hostility, coming as Mr. Assad has demonstrated greater swagger over his grip from military gains over the past year, largely with Russia\u2019s help.In a new sign of his confidence, Mr. Assad even allowed a modest medical evacuation of civilians on Wednesday from one of the last rebel enclaves in the country, near Damascus.Mr. Erdogan appeared to be reminding Russia that it cannot dictate Syria\u2019s future alone, especially on issues sensitive to Turkey, most notably those involving Syria\u2019s Kurdish groups, which Turkey sees as enemies.Russia on Tuesday said that representatives of a semiautonomous Kurdish area in northeastern Syria would be allowed to take part in talks that Russia is hosting next month \u2014 an inclusion opposed by Turkey.\u201cAssad, I am saying this loud and clear, is a terrorist who spreads state terrorism,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said at a joint news conference with the Tunisian president, Beji Caid Essebsi, in Tunis. \u201cWould the Syrian people like to see someone like this stay in charge?\u201dIn remarks quoted by Turkish news agencies, Mr. Erdogan also said: \u201cIt is absolutely impossible to move ahead with Assad in Syria. For what? How could we embrace the future with the president of a Syria who killed close to one million of its citizens?\u201dFurious over the insult, Syria\u2019s Foreign Ministry called Mr. Erdogan a terrorist supporter who bore \u201cprime responsibility for the bloodshed in Syria.\u201dRussia and Iran have always backed Mr. Assad, while Turkey supports some Syrian rebel groups. Despite their differences, the three nations have been collaborating on diplomacy aimed at ending the war.All three also have been jockeying for position in the country\u2019s post-conflict future, even as their efforts to end the fighting have proved only partly successful.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s statement appeared to signal more of a tough negotiating stance than a rupture with Russia, which has been enjoying an improved relationship with Turkey, a NATO member. Even as Mr. Erdogan spoke, his government in Ankara was finalizing a $2.5 billion deal to purchase Russian S-400 missile systems.It is possible the Russians welcomed Mr. Erdogan\u2019s tough line toward Mr. Assad, because they want to play a leading role in any peace deal. That means delivering an often recalcitrant Mr. Assad to negotiations.A main issue between Russia and Turkey has involved Syria\u2019s Kurds. Mr. Erdogan has made clear lately that preventing them from maintaining a semiautonomous area bordering Turkey has become a higher priority than toppling Mr. Assad.But Moscow has been eager to include Kurdish groups in peace talks. It has won greater inclusion for them in the United Nations-backed talks in Geneva \u2014 though not through the separate Kurdish delegation that the Kurds wanted \u2014 and now has invited numerous Kurdish representatives to Sochi, the southern Russia resort town where talks that Moscow calls a Syrian \u201cnational dialogue\u201d will supposedly be held in late January.Turkey, by contrast, had hoped that Russia and Iran would use their leverage to ostracize the Kurds and exclude them from those talks.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t worked well,\u201d Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said of Turkey\u2019s effort on the Kurds. Insistence on blunting Kurdish power in Syria, he said, \u201ctakes the limelight in Turkey.\u201dA previous attempt to convene talks in Sochi, in November, failed when Turkey withdrew over objections to Kurdish participation.The planned January meeting has also been widely snubbed by Mr. Assad\u2019s Syrian opponents. Forty rebel groups declared Tuesday that they would not take part.Before the Arab revolts of 2011, relations between Syria and Turkey were neighborly, along a border that stretches more than 500 miles. But six months into the Syrian uprising \u2014 which began with political protests met with a harsh security crackdown \u2014 Mr. Erdogan broke with Mr. Assad, saying he must step down.Mr. Erdogan then went on to finance Syrian rebel groups and later allowed foreign recruits to the Islamic State and other jihadist militant groups to stream through Turkey into Syria.But the Syrian war has taken a toll on Turkey, which is housing more than three million refugees and has suffered deadly attacks by the Islamic State and Kurdish groups.Soon after Russia began its air campaign on behalf of Mr. Assad\u2019s government in 2015, Turkey shot down a Russian warplane. Russia retaliated with sanctions that were devastating for Turkish trade and tourism.Turkey\u2019s antipathy toward the Kurds, oddly, is partly responsible for the reconciliation in Turkish-Russian relations and a Turkish shift away from insistence that Mr. Assad must go.As Russian air power severely weakened Syria\u2019s rebel forces, Turkey was willing to temper its support for them in exchange for Russia\u2019s assent to a Turkish sphere of influence in northern Syria, where Turkey could block Kurdish expansion.The International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria said on Wednesday that after protracted negotiations, it had been able to start medical evacuations from Eastern Ghouta.The enclave has been targeted by Mr. Assad\u2019s forces, and the United Nations has pleaded for his government to allow for the evacuation of around 500 patients, including children with cancer.The Syrian American Medical Society said four patients had been taken to hospitals in Damascus, the first of 29 critical cases approved for medical evacuation, with the remainder to be evacuated over the coming days.Nada Homsi and Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Next Subway Chief Will Mull Closing Lines for Repairs", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 The veteran transit executive from Toronto hired to run New York City\u2019s subway said he was considering a series of aggressive steps to shore up the city\u2019s faltering system, including shutting down lines for long periods of work with the goal of modernizing the system in years, not decades.Andy Byford, the chief executive of the Toronto Transit Commission, also said he would scrutinize how the subway spends money and consider overhauling senior management, and suggested that congestion pricing \u2014 charging fees to drive into the most crowded parts of Manhattan as a way to raise money for transit \u2014 was a worthy idea.But it is Mr. Byford\u2019s openness to shutting down subway lines that is sure to attract attention, and condemnation, in a city where a 24-hour subway system is considered sacrosanct.Mr. Byford stressed that real progress would require hard choices.\u201cThe only way to do that is to get in the tunnels and do the work, and you cannot do that when trains are running, period,\u201d Mr. Byford said in a wide-ranging interview between meetings during his waning days in Toronto. \u201cIf we\u2019re really serious we have to bite the bullet and to a certain extent inconvenience people while we get the work done, but I will hold myself accountable to New Yorkers to say it will be worth the pain.\u201dGov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the subway, minced no words when he met with Mr. Byford after his final job interview \u2014 aging infrastructure, overcrowding, track and signal problems, limited funding and a critical public. \u201cAre you up for that?\u201d Mr. Cuomo asked.To Mr. Byford the message was clear: \u201cThis is no place for wallflowers.\u2019\u2019While Toronto\u2019s system is far smaller, those seeking a guide to what Mr. Byford might do in New York can look to his playbook here \u2014 he shut down the subway on weekends to repair switches and tracks and lay the groundwork for new signals. (In New York, officials already plan a 15-month shutdown of the tunnel that carries the L line between Brooklyn and Manhattan, and a shorter closing \u2014 five days \u2014 is scheduled this month for another tunnel that carries the E and the M lines between Queens and Manhattan.)Mr. Byford also focused on quick wins like cleaning subways, renovating bathrooms, creating rider-friendly signage and pushing train operators to make announcements about delays. He also took on the transit union over contracting out garbage collection and other services and instituting one-person train operations.The system he inherited was rife with problems familiar to New Yorkers \u2014 constant delays, poor maintenance, aging equipment and a dim public image.\u201cFares went up and service did not improve, ticket monitors fell asleep in the booths, there were no announcements when the train stopped in the tunnel and you didn\u2019t know if you were waiting five minutes or 20 minutes for a train,\u201d said Karen Stintz, a former Toronto city councilor who served as chairwoman of the Toronto Transit Commission from 2010 to 2014.In Mr. Byford\u2019s first two weeks, a fare collector was shot during a robbery and Union Station, a busy hub, flooded. An apologetic Mr. Byford appeared often on television promising improvements. \u201cAndy\u2019s visible presence was the single biggest contributor to the public trusting again in the system,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Stintz said. \u201cHe recognized there was a branding challenge.\u201dMr. Byford designed an ambitious five-year plan and was able to produce results on initiatives that had been in disarray, including a subway line extension and a new signaling system on one of Toronto\u2019s four subway lines.\u201cAndy rode in on a white horse and rescued these projects,\u201d said Steve Munro, a longtime Toronto Transit advocate. \u201cHe got to show \u2018I\u2019m in charge and we\u2019re going to fix this.\u2019\u201dThe Toronto Transit Commission was named the 2017 Transit System of the Year by the American Public Transportation Association, citing the system for reducing delays and increasing customer satisfaction.\u201cHe stopped the erosion of public confidence,\u201d said Franz Hartmann, executive director of the Toronto Environmental Alliance. \u201cHe was up against huge structural problems, a lack of funding and politicization on how to expand the T.T.C. Could he have done a better job? Maybe, but you can\u2019t fault him for politicians not willing to spend the money that was required.\u201dSince 2014, train delays have decreased by 6 percent with the greatest decline \u2014 18 percent \u2014 on the subway\u2019s busiest and oldest train line, though complaints about delays rose last year, according to data from the Toronto Transit Commission.Despite the many challenges, Mr. Byford considers becoming president of New York City Transit, which oversees the subway and public buses, a dream job. Any transit professional \u201cworth his salt,\u201d he said, wants to run one of the Big Three transit systems: New York, London or Hong Kong. And for him New York is the Holy Grail. And it is big \u2014 5.7 million daily riders compared with 800,000 in Toronto.On a recent Tuesday, Mr. Byford, clad in a charcoal suit and worn black leather shoes, sat in a makeup chair at a television studio, getting ready for one of three television appearances to discuss his new position.\u201cHair and makeup?\u201d quipped Mr. Byford, who is bald. The staffer chuckled and said, \u201cOnly makeup.\u201dLater, Mr. Byford, who was born in England, reflected on his career: \u201cWho would have thought this spotty kid growing up in Plymouth would have ended up heading New York City Transit?\u201dIt certainly was not his initial plan. After high school, Mr. Byford said he wanted to join the Royal Navy \u2014 Plymouth is home to a naval base and he recalled watching from his window during the Falklands War as battleships sailed out to sea.But transit was in his blood. His grandfather was a bus driver for 40 years and his father worked for London Transport for 12 years.Mr. Byford began his career as a station foreman with the London Underground, where he worked for 14 years and met his wife, Alison. (He proposed to her on a high-speed train in London.) Then he went to work for English railroads before moving to Australia to become second-in-command for the agency that runs public transit in Sydney.\u201cDuring our time in Toronto it was a very volatile political environment,\u201d Ms. Stintz said.Mr. Byford says he is not afraid to speak up to politicians and tell them what needs to be done to better serve riders.But a long-running battle over a transit plan here raised questions about how Mr. Byford will handle New York\u2019s bruising political arena. Mr. Byford was accused, though ultimately cleared by a public auditor, of complaints that the transit agency at the mayor\u2019s behest had massaged information comparing the costs of a subway extension to a light rail line.\u201cThe question for New Yorkers will be can he \u2014 within a highly charged and politicized environment where there are competing visions and interests \u2014 speak truth to power or will he capitulate to pressure that will come from every side?\u201d said Josh Matlow, a Toronto city councilor.Mr. Byford said he had always tried to \u201cgive the right advice\u201d and would do so in New York.He also said he would quickly assess the capability of the senior team and ensure funds \u201care being spent on the right things.\u201d\u201cI want to make sure that people are crystal clear that the status quo is not good enough and that everyone has got to up their game,\u201d he said, adding that riders should expect to see \u201ctangible improvements within a year.\u201dMr. Byford is a familiar face among Toronto subway commuters, many of whom stopped to wish him well. He has never owned a car. He promises to commute by subway in New York, adding that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Manhattan.Mr. Byford has been asked, more than once, if he is sure he is making the right move. After all, he has had \u201ca pretty good run,\u201d he said.\u201cThere is a danger that I don\u2019t succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it will be very hard. I probably won\u2019t have a life, I probably won\u2019t see my wife, but I will be incredibly proud to be walking about that system and doing my damnedest to turn it around.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flynn\u2019s Guilty Plea Looms Over a White House on the Verge of a Tax Cut Success", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoThe fall of Mr. Flynn, who was once so close to Mr. Trump that he was considered a viable prospect to be his vice-presidential running mate, came on a day that should have been a moment of triumph for the president. After months of stymied ambitions on Capitol Hill, the Senate passed his tax cut plan, advancing what, if it ultimately reaches his desk, will be his most far-reaching legislative accomplishment since he took office.In the end, the tax plan may resonate more powerfully with the public than the legal woes of a former presidential aide; at least Mr. Trump\u2019s team hopes so. But for the moment, at least, watching one of their own hauled before a judge dampened any celebration over developments in Congress. It raised uncomfortable questions about what Mr. Flynn might be telling the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. And it could easily distract a president not exactly known for a disciplined political and policymaking operation.\u201cThese kinds of threats to the presidency cast a pall over all other activities in a White House,\u201d said former Representative Vic Fazio, Democrat of California. \u201cIn this administration, it may lead Trump to become more unhinged and even less focused on the pressing issues of the day.\u201dStill, former Representative Mickey Edwards, Republican of Oklahoma, said Mr. Trump\u2019s unconventional political appeal might yet minimize the consequences that other presidents might have endured.\u201cIn any normal White House, and with any normal basis for presidential support, the Flynn story would be crippling,\u201d he said. \u201cThis president\u2019s support base is small but apparently unshakable, and with Republicans in Congress showing a frightening unwillingness to hold this president to account, I don\u2019t expect this development to change the behavior of either Congress or the president.\u201dAnd yet the announcement on Friday still hit the White House like a thunderclap. The president\u2019s legal team had no advance warning. His chief of staff, John F. Kelly, learned about it from television. He called Mr. Trump, who was still in the residence part of the White House, to let him know he would be hearing about a Flynn plea deal soon. The president\u2019s reaction, according to one adviser, was that Mr. Flynn \u201cis in a lot of trouble.\u201dThe president\u2019s optimistic outlook last weekend was fueled by his White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, who has consistently assured him that the investigation by Mr. Mueller would most likely conclude by the end of the year. Mr. Cobb has successfully persuaded Mr. Trump for the most part to curb his combative instincts and work in the parameters of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, turning over requested documents and avoiding incendiary attacks on the prosecutor.He has been so fitful that at one point during his stay in Florida, he told some club members that he was not fretting about whether Senate Republicans would pass his tax proposal because he had \u201ca plan.\u201d If the Senate failed to approve his tax cuts, Mr. Trump told them, he would refuse to sign a new short-term spending bill financing the government, forcing a partial shutdown.Aides insist that Mr. Trump is not consumed with the Russia inquiry more than he has been at other times. Yet he has been leaning on Mr. Cobb, constantly summoning him to the residence and dialing another lawyer on his team, Jay Sekulow, for consultations, people briefed on the discussions said.Mr. Comey\u2019s firing led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller. Not only was the investigation into Mr. Flynn not let go, it now poses an unknown potential threat to Mr. Trump\u2019s White House.Follow Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman on Twitter: @peterbakernyt @maggienyt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the G.O.P. Tax Bill Will Ruin Obamacare", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs part of their giant tax bill, Republicans in Congress are about to eliminate the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate. Their objective is not sensible health care reform but rather insensible arithmetic that could satisfy the byzantine rules governing the Senate\u2019s reconciliation process.The purpose of the mandate is to evenly distribute risk among healthy and unhealthy Americans on the individual insurance market so that costs are shared and no one is left out.Will killing the mandate ruin Obamacare exchanges? No, but it will transform them into an extended form of Medicaid by another name. Americans with subsidized policies will stay in the system, with help from the federal government.Unsubsidized individuals, however, will be driven out of the market, because a repeal of the mandate will cause premiums on exchange plans to skyrocket as healthy people exit. Many of these people will purchase new stripped-down, less expensive policies \u2014 courtesy of a Trump administration executive order \u2014 with the understanding that they can sign up for a more robust exchange policy at the next open enrollment period if they need full coverage in times of illness.About three-quarters of those who buy insurance on the exchanges are subsidized by the federal government to reduce premiums to a specified \u201caffordable\u201d percentage of their income. The loss of the mandate will not affect them. But many healthy, younger enrollees \u2014 who help to make insurance affordable by balancing the risk of sicker older people \u2014 will be driven away by higher premiums, and without the mandate, they would probably opt out \u2014 they typically didn\u2019t want to buy insurance anyway. Unfortunately, their exit will leave a higher average cost for those who are left.Within a year or two of elimination of the mandate, the individual insurance market will resemble the failed pre-Obamacare days when pre-existing conditions and high premiums made access impossible. The difference is that the government will foot a large part of the cost through subsidies. Before the A.C.A., lower-income people who didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid were priced out of the individual market, but with subsidies, they can now purchase lower-cost plans. If the individual mandate is eliminated, it will be middle-income people without subsidies who lose access.The continuing high enrollment this fall supports the idea that most people still see the subsidized insurance offerings on the exchanges as a good deal. As a result, the demand side of this unusual market will stay strong for the subsidized customers.How will the insurance companies react? They will see high demand for subsidized insurance as a tempting market in spite of past and future chaos. The problem for them is that these customers are sicker and less predictable in their needs, which makes it difficult to set a price. This is precisely why the number of insurers this year has dropped so severely. But managing uncertainty is at the core of this business. Any risk is acceptable if the compensation is high enough.Many observers have been critical that only one or two Obamacare insurers offer plans in many counties. But for the remaining insurers, there is a silver lining: monopoly. Without serious competition and with the support of subsidies, insurers can set premiums high enough to cover any contingency and virtually guarantee a good profit. The high quoted premiums on the exchanges signal that insurers are anticipating these changes in the pool. The remaining insurers will not run away. In fact, I expect those who stay will report record profits next year, even without the mandate. By now all those firms with a low tolerance for risk have exited.However, the timing of a mandate repeal is central. Eliminating the individual mandate will make little difference to insurers in 2018 if the mandate expires in 2019. But Congress may decide to eliminate the individual mandate immediately. Then insurers, who priced their plans assuming continuation of the same historical enrollee pool, will lose their shirts as healthier enrollees drop out. Changing the rules halfway through the game is not something insurance company C.E.O.s. can anticipate, but it is their biggest challenge now.A surprising result of eliminating the individual mandate would be an effective expansion of a plan that many Republicans in Congress would like to cut or abolish: Medicaid. Under the evolving Obamacare policies, lower-income enrollees are heavily subsidized by the government, and the plans on the exchanges are largely offered by insurers specialized in Medicaid service to the states.Without the individual mandate, the exchanges will not die but will continue as zombies offering high-cost coverage, fed by the federal government and stumbling around the health system failing to serve their original purpose \u2014 access for all regardless of age, health status or pre-existing conditions.Yet as long as the subsidies continue, health plans will offer their policies on the exchanges with very high premiums. While this may allow access for some who otherwise would be left out, the grand purpose of the A.C.A. \u2014 to allow affordable care for all \u2014 will slip away. Is this any way to do health policy?J. B. Silvers is a professor of health care finance at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After a Chaotic Start, Congress Has Made a Conservative Mark", "Date": "2017-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After a halting start, the Republican-controlled 115th Congress \u2014 sometimes in collaboration with President Trump, often despite him \u2014 has enacted surprisingly far-reaching conservative achievements in its first year, among them a long-promised rewrite of the tax code, oil drilling in the Arctic and a series of lifetime appointments to the judiciary.For the new year, Republican leaders in the House have their sights on decades-old programs for the poor that they say are too easily exploited by those who do not need them. Mr. Trump is expected to move forward with a long-promised program to rebuild roads, bridges and other infrastructure.And Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, is speaking gamely of bipartisanship, especially on legislation to protect young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, whose Obama-era protection from deportation will run out in March.On Jan. 20, the latest stopgap spending measure expires, giving lawmakers from both parties another chance to force resolutions on outstanding immigration and health care measures, along with efforts to raise caps on military and domestic spending. And an $81 billion package of relief for hurricane and wildfire victims that passed the House last week awaits Senate action.\u201cI don\u2019t think most of our Democratic colleagues want to do nothing, and there are areas, I think, where we can get bipartisan agreement,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters on Friday.But all of those plans will play out in an election year that is shaping up as a referendum on Mr. Trump, whose historically low approval ratings could deflate any Republican overtures to Democrats not anxious to boost the president.\u201cHope springs eternal, but they\u2019d have to be a real reversal from the way they\u2019ve operated now,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.It also eliminated tax penalties in the Affordable Care Act intended to force most Americans to have health care. Ending the so-called individual mandate was Republicans\u2019 most direct blow to President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement after a year of misses and ineffectual attacks.At least for now, the tax bill remains highly unpopular, according to opinion polls. Nevertheless, Mr. Trump trumpeted those achievements on Sunday.\u201cWith the new administration coming in, it has been more chaotic and more politicized than I would like to think,\u201d Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said. \u201cBut we do have more accomplishments than I think we\u2019re generally given credit for.\u201dFor Republicans, who never expected Mr. Trump to win the presidency, getting adjusted to life with a former reality TV star in the White House was not easy.\u201cI\u2019d say one of the bigger challenges we dealt with this year is just trying to manage the chaotic nature of the White House, the never-ending tweets, drama and dysfunction,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania.But after a photo finish, Democrats are not calling the 115th Congress \u201cdo-nothing.\u201d Instead they are dwelling on what Republicans did.\u201cIf you ask the top 1 percent how Senate Republicans did this year, they\u2019d give them an A,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cBut if you ask middle-class Americans how the Republican Senate did this year, they\u2019d give them a big fat red F.\u201d\u201cBoth Democrats and Republicans say that infrastructure is crumbling and we need to fix it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the big question remains: Will Democrats put politics aside and actually work with us? They need to meet us halfway.\u201dMr. Ryan has bigger ambitions of taking on some of the government\u2019s biggest programs; Republicans have singled out food stamps, welfare and Medicaid.But after a bruising year, Democrats are leery. Republicans and Democrats had detailed plans to lure corporate profits parked overseas back home, and use some of that revenue to finance an infrastructure push. The new tax law ignored those proposals.\u201cThey used it all to reduce taxes on the wealthiest corporations,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.As for House plans to cut poverty programs, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, scoffed: \u201cIt is just perfect, isn\u2019t it? Tax breaks for the wealthiest people who haven\u2019t punched a time clock in their lives so that we could cut back food stamps for single moms trying to feed hungry kids. Perfect.\u201dThe truth is, even Mr. McConnell acknowledged that 2017 was \u201cpretty partisan.\u201dThe choice to make repealing the Affordable Care Act conservatives\u2019 first legislative effort was generally considered a misstep, said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. And the half measure that Republicans achieved may destabilize insurance markets.\u201cThe good news is we repealed the individual mandate,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cThe bad news is we now own health care, for sure.\u201dBy sheer numbers, Congress was less productive in 2017 than in 2009, the first year of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. In 2009, Mr. Obama signed 125 bills into law, including a huge economic stimulus package, the expansion of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and legislation to regulate tobacco.\u201cOther than the tax bill, this first session of Congress has been a bit of a bust,\u201d said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cAnd that probably means that this Congress is a bust, because first sessions tend to be a little bit more productive than second sessions.\u201d\u201cThis administration and Congress working together probably did more on the deregulatory front than any Congress in modern history,\u201d declared Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma.But Mr. Durbin said that was hardly something to boast about.\u201cIf you\u2019d look at what little we have done this year in the United States Senate compared to when I arrived in this chamber, you\u2019d wonder how we could draw a paycheck,\u201d said Mr. Durbin, who has spent 20 years in the Senate.Some Republicans expressed confidence that even Mr. Trump has learned some lessons from such experiences.\u201cThe president has developed a much greater appreciation for the process than he had a year ago,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. \u201cI personally developed a greater sense of appreciation for the new fresh set of eyes that he brings to this. And if we could put those two things together effectively, next year we will have a pretty good starting point.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Live Theater", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "An award-winning playwright argues that the in-the-moment interplay between actors and audience can help us cope with an increasingly virtual world.Supported byThe living presence of the audience is what strikes me as so singular about the theater, why I love working in the theater so much and why I believe in the particular importance of our beloved form right now.But first, let me say: I am not hopeful about where we are as a nation \u2014 as a species (if I can be so presumptuous). I\u2019m not hopeful, because I am increasingly of the mind that even my hope is being monetized. That which is most enduring, most noble, most human about me \u2014 my urge for something brighter, more vivid, more loving, more alive \u2014 all of this is being used against me.The attention-finance complex has given us devices to which we are tethered by more than compulsion. Our pleasure principle \u2014 long prey to the manipulations of capitalism \u2014 has been turned against us, irretrievably yoked to ends that are not ours, ends we cannot fully comprehend.Transformed into economic subjects, our humanity is being redefined; we are valuable only insofar as our economic behavior can be predicted and monetized. Indeed, the technology has enabled the very movements of our mind to become a steady stream of revenue to someone, somewhere.Somehow we are sold the story that this narrowing of the world into streams of monetized information is actually about liberation. That it represents a new era in human communication. The triumph of democracy. A victory over centralized power. All of these strike me as little more than hopeful memes sold over the very platforms they are intended to legitimize.Indeed, the great fracture begun in earnest more than 30 years ago \u2014 the collapse of a vision of collective well-being \u2014 this fracture has finally been completed. We are little more than data points in a society that isn\u2019t really that anymore. It\u2019s a marketplace, nothing more than the sum of its sold and purchased parts.A bleak vision, yes. And yet, this bleakness must also be something of a defense. My defense against the financed colonization of my desire and, yes, of my hope. A way to defend, to preserve the stirrings of the real hope inside me, what to work for, what to work toward.Which brings me to the other side of the live performance equation \u2014 the actor\u2019s body.A living being before a living audience. Relationship unmediated by the contemporary disembodying screen. Not the appearance of a person, but the reality of one. Not a simulacrum of relationship, but a form of actual relationship.The theater is an art form scaled to the human, and stubbornly so, relying on the absolute necessity of physical audience, a large part of why theater is so difficult to monetize. It only happens when and where it happens. Once it starts, you can\u2019t stop it. It doesn\u2019t exist to be paused or pulled out at the consumer\u2019s whim. It can\u2019t be copied and sold. In a world increasingly lost to virtuality and unreality \u2014 the theater points to an antidote.A living actor before a living audience. The situation of all theater, a situation that can awaken in us a recollection of something more primordial, religious ritual \u2014 the site of our earliest collective negotiations with our tremendous vulnerability to existence. The act of gathering to witness the myths of our alleged origins enacted \u2014 this is the root of the theater\u2019s timeless magic.Because whether we like to admit it or not, we herding social animals are programmed at some very profound level to think and feel as one. To me, this is why the great lie of American individualism \u2014 that my experience is the most important thing, and should be protected and enabled at all costs \u2014 why this thinking is so pernicious. It isn\u2019t really true to what we really are.But the theater is \u2014 in its essence.Indeed, at its best, it\u2019s the experience of us as one mind, one heart, one body. That live performance can synchronize the heartbeats of an audience is no surprise to any of us who ply our trade in the theater. Certainly not to any writer or director or designer who has lived through four weeks of previews trying to get those heartbeats to sync up.This sense of oneness with an audience, of losing all sense of time, of absorption in the travails and triumphs of the living actors \u2014 this is the daily antidote.

And from which so much of my truest hope is mined.Ayad Akhtar is the author of \u201cDisgraced,\u201d which won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and \u201cJunk,\u201d playing on Broadway through Jan. 7.

{"Headline": "The Most Expensive Mile of Subway Track on Earth", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "How excessive staffing, little competition, generous contracts and archaic rules dramatically inflate capital costs for transit in New York.Supported byAn accountant discovered the discrepancy while reviewing the budget for new train platforms under Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan.The budget showed that 900 workers were being paid to dig caverns for the platforms as part of a 3.5-mile tunnel connecting the historic station to the Long Island Rail Road. But the accountant could only identify about 700 jobs that needed to be done, according to three project supervisors. Officials could not find any reason for the other 200 people to be there.\u201cNobody knew what those people were doing, if they were doing anything,\u201d said Michael Horodniceanu, who was then the head of construction at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs transit in New York. The workers were laid off, Mr. Horodniceanu said, but no one figured out how long they had been employed. \u201cAll we knew is they were each being paid about $1,000 every day.\u201dThe discovery, which occurred in 2010 and was not disclosed to the public, illustrates one of the main issues that has helped lead to the increasing delays now tormenting millions of subway riders every day: The leaders entrusted to expand New York\u2019s regional transit network have paid the highest construction costs in the world, spending billions of dollars that could have been used to fix existing subway tunnels, tracks, trains and signals.The estimated cost of the Long Island Rail Road project, known as \u201cEast Side Access,\u201d has ballooned to $12 billion, or nearly $3.5 billion for each new mile of track \u2014 seven times the average elsewhere in the world. The recently completed Second Avenue subway on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side and the 2015 extension of the No. 7 line to Hudson Yards also cost far above average, at $2.5 billion and $1.5 billion per mile, respectively.The Times found that a host of factors have contributed to the transit authority\u2019s exorbitant capital costs.For years, The Times found, public officials have stood by as a small group of politically connected labor unions, construction companies and consulting firms have amassed large profits.Trade unions, which have closely aligned themselves with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and other politicians, have secured deals requiring underground construction work to be staffed by as many as four times more laborers than elsewhere in the world, documents show.Construction companies, which have given millions of dollars in campaign donations in recent years, have increased their projected costs by up to 50 percent when bidding for work from the M.T.A., contractors say.Consulting firms, which have hired away scores of M.T.A. employees, have persuaded the authority to spend an unusual amount on design and management, statistics indicate.Public officials, mired in bureaucracy, have not acted to curb the costs. The M.T.A. has not adopted best practices nor worked to increase competition in contracting, and it almost never punishes vendors for spending too much or taking too long, according to inspector general reports.At the heart of the issue is the obscure way that construction costs are set in New York. Worker wages and labor conditions are determined through negotiations between the unions and the companies, none of whom have any incentive to control costs. The transit authority has made no attempt to intervene to contain the spending.\u201cIt\u2019s sad, really,\u201d said Lok Home, owner of the Robbins Company, which manufactured much of the tunneling equipment used for East Side Access. \u201cBecause if they controlled the costs, they could do twice as many expansion projects and still have more money for maintenance.\u201dAsked about The Times\u2019s findings, union leaders and construction executives insisted that no money had been wasted. They said tunneling was difficult and dangerous work that must be well funded.The M.T.A., for its part, did not dispute the findings.Joseph J. Lhota, who was chairman of the authority in 2012 and returned to the job in June, said he had recently appointed working groups to study costs and the procurement process.\u201cWe recognize this has been a problem. We\u2019re never going to deny history,\u201d Mr. Lhota said. \u201cThis is an issue that needs to be addressed. It needs to be attacked.\u201dNew York\u2019s struggles come as transit construction is booming around the world. At least 150 projects have been initiated since 1990, according to a recent study by Yale University researcher David Schleicher.The approximate average cost of the projects \u2014 both in the U.S. and abroad \u2014 has been less than $500 million per track mile, the study concluded.\u201cThere was one glaring exception,\u201d Mr. Schleicher said. \u201cNew York.\u201dMr. Lhota responded by defending the costs. He said in a letter, \u201cThere are unique challenges that contribute to high construction costs in New York City in general, and for M.T.A. projects in particular.\u201dMr. Lhota listed 10 explanations, including aging utilities, expensive land, high density, strict regulations and large ridership requiring big stations.To evaluate those arguments, The Times brought the list to more than 50 contractors, many of whom had worked in New York as well as in other cities. The Times also interviewed nearly 100 current and former M.T.A. employees, reviewed internal project records, consulted industry price indexes and built a database to compare spending on specific items. And The Times observed construction on site in Paris, which is building a project similar to the Second Avenue subway at one-sixth the cost.The review found evidence for one of the issues cited by the M.T.A.: Because most countries have nationalized health care, projects abroad do not have to fund worker health insurance. That might explain a tenth of the cost differences, contractors said.But the contractors said the other issues cited by the M.T.A. were challenges that all transit systems face. Density is the norm in cities where subway projects occur. Regulations are similar everywhere. All projects use the same equipment at the same prices. Land and other types of construction do not cost dramatically more in New York. Insurance costs more but is only a fraction of the budget. The M.T.A.\u2019s stations have not been bigger (nor deeper) than is typical.\u201cThose sound like cop-outs,\u201d said Rob Muley, an executive at the John Holland engineering firm who has worked in Hong Kong and Singapore and visited the East Side Access project, after hearing Mr. Lhota\u2019s reasons.In Paris, which has famously powerful unions, the review found the lower costs were the result of efficient staffing, fierce vendor competition and scant use of consultants.In some ways, M.T.A. projects have been easier than work elsewhere. East Side Access uses an existing tunnel for nearly half its route. The hard rock under the city also is easy to blast through, and workers do not encounter ancient sites that need to be protected.\u201cThey\u2019re claiming the age of the city is to blame?\u201d asked Andy Mitchell, the former head of Crossrail, a project to build 13 miles of subway under the center of London, a city built 2,000 years ago. \u201cReally?\u201dThe reasons for the M.T.A.\u2019s high costs start with the sheer number of people employed.Mike Roach noticed it immediately upon entering the No. 7 line work site a few years ago. Mr. Roach, a California-based tunneling contractor, was not involved in the project but was invited to see it. He was stunned by how many people were operating the machine churning through soil to create the tunnel.\u201cI actually started counting because I was so surprised, and I counted 25 or 26 people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s three times what I\u2019m used to.\u201dThe staffing of tunnel-boring machines came up repeatedly in interviews with contractors. The so-called T.B.M.s are massive contraptions, weighing over 1,000 tons and stretching up to 500 feet from cutting wheel to thrust system, but they largely run automatically. Other cities typically man the machine with fewer than 10 people.It is not just tunneling machines that are overstaffed, though. A dozen New York unions work on tunnel creation, station erection and system setup. Each negotiates with the construction companies over labor conditions, without the M.T.A.\u2019s involvement. And each has secured rules that contractors say require more workers than necessary.The unions and vendors declined to release the labor deals, but The Times obtained them. Along with interviews with contractors, the documents reveal a dizzying maze of jobs, many of which do not exist on projects elsewhere.There are \u201cnippers\u201d to watch material being moved around and \u201chog house tenders\u201d to supervise the break room. Each crane must have an \u201coiler,\u201d a relic of a time when they needed frequent lubrication. Standby electricians and plumbers are to be on hand at all times, as is at least one \u201cmaster mechanic.\u201d Generators and elevators must have their own operators, even though they are automatic. An extra person is required to be present for all concrete pumping, steam fitting, sheet metal work and other tasks.In New York, \u201cunderground construction employs approximately four times the number of personnel as in similar jobs in Asia, Australia, or Europe,\u201d according to an internal report by Arup, a consulting firm that worked on the Second Avenue subway and many similar projects around the world.That ratio does not include people who get lost in the sea of workers and get paid even though they have no apparent responsibility, as happened on East Side Access. The construction company running that project declined to comment.The labor deals negotiated between the unions and construction companies also ensure that workers are well paid. The agreement for Local 147, the union for the famed \u201csandhogs\u201d who dig the tunnels, includes a pay rate for most members of $111 per hour in salary and benefits. The pay doubles for overtime or Sunday work, which is common in transit construction. Weekend overtime pays quadruple \u2014 more than $400 per hour.Other trades are not paid as much but get overtime more frequently on M.T.A. projects, driving up costs.Union officials pushed back against the idea that their members are overpaid. The construction unions, after all, arose in response to exploitative bosses who underpaid and endangered workers. More than a dozen people died building New York\u2019s subway, and many more have perished since. Even today, workers labor in dirty and uncomfortable conditions to build marvels.\u201cConstruction workers deserve every penny they make, and more,\u201d said Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York. \u201cWe live in New York. It\u2019s very expensive to live here. We take great pride in the work that we do. And the work rules are there to make sure we stay alive.\u201dBut statistics suggest that the labor deals multiply costs while doing little to boost safety. During the Second Avenue subway project, for example, there were 5.5 safety incidents for every 200,000 work hours, according to federal data. The national average is 3.2. The Silver Line in Washington, which cost just $300 million per mile, had an even lower rate of incidents.There also is no evidence that the deals spur faster construction. M.T.A. projects usually take longer than similar work elsewhere.Some labor leaders said they were willing to negotiate the work rules to increase efficiency.\u201cWe can figure out a way,\u201d said Richard Fitzsimmons, business manager for Local 147, who said that he often sees the construction companies insisting on workers that are not needed. \u201cI\u2019m the union, and sometimes I\u2019m saying to myself, \u2018What the hell are they even doing?\u2019\u201dBut, Mr. Fitzsimmons added, \u201cwe will never negotiate with the safety of our members.\u201dSeveral contractors said the unions are able to maintain the deals because everybody knows they are politically powerful. The unions working on M.T.A. projects have donated more than $1 million combined to Mr. Cuomo during his administration, records show.Peter Ajemian, a spokesman for the governor, referred inquiries to the M.T.A. on Thursday.\u201cContracting is handled by the M.T.A.,\u201d Mr. Ajemian said, \u201cso questions related to contracting should be directed to the authority.\u201dThe critics pointed to several unusual provisions in the labor agreements. One part of Local 147\u2019s deal entitles the union to $450,000 for each tunnel-boring machine used. That is to make up for job losses from \u201ctechnological advancement,\u201d even though the equipment has been standard for decades.\u201cI\u2019m not anti-union at all, but it\u2019s amazing how much they dictate everything that happens on a job in New York,\u201d said Jim Peregoy, a Missouri-based cost estimator who has worked on 240 projects in 27 states, including the Second Avenue subway. Mr. Peregoy said labor was a far bigger part of his estimates in New York than elsewhere. \u201cYou have to account for it, because it\u2019s huge.\u201dEven though the M.T.A. is paying for its capital construction with taxpayer dollars, the government does not get a seat at the table when labor conditions are determined. Instead, the task of reining in the unions falls to the construction companies \u2014 which often try to drive up costs themselves.Typically, construction companies meet with each trade union every three years to hammer out the labor deals. The resulting agreements apply to all companies, preventing contractors from lowering their bids by proposing less generous wages or work rules.That is not a problem in the private sector, where the possibility of nonunion labor can force unions to be more competitive, or in parts of the public sector that involve more potential bidders. But in the small world of underground construction, experts say there is little cost containment.Tim Gilchrist, a transportation adviser to Govs. Eliot L. Spitzer and David A. Paterson, noted all costs are passed on to the M.T.A. \u201cNobody at the negotiating table is footing the bill,\u201d he said.Critics pointed out that construction companies actually have an incentive to maximize costs \u2014 they earn a percentage of the project\u2019s costs as profit, so the higher the cost, the bigger their profit.Mr. Lhota, the M.T.A. chairman, agreed that leaving negotiations to unions and vendors may be problematic. \u201cYou\u2019re right; in many ways, there\u2019s this level of connection between the two,\u201d he said.But the chairman said he did not know what could be done about it. Hiring nonunion labor is legal but not politically realistic for the M.T.A. The transit authority could get unions to agree to project-specific labor deals, but it has not.The profit percentage taken by vendors also is itself a factor in the M.T.A.\u2019s high costs.In other parts of the world, companies bidding on transit projects typically add 10 percent to their estimated costs to account for profit, overhead and change orders, contractors in five continents said. Final profit is usually less than 5 percent of the total project cost, which is sufficient given the size of the projects, the contractors said.Things are much different in New York. In a series of interviews, dozens of M.T.A. contractors described how vendors routinely increase their estimated costs when bidding for work.First, the contractors said, the vendors add between 15 and 25 percent as an \u201cM.T.A. Factor\u201d because of how hard it can be to work within the bureaucracy of the transit authority. Then they add 10 percent as a contingency for possible changes. And then they add another 10-12 percent on top of all that for profit and overhead.\u201cIt adds up,\u201d said Mysore L. Nagaraja, a former head of M.T.A. construction now working as a consultant, who called the surcharges standard for most vendors. \u201cEverybody is looking out for their own interests.\u201dDenise Richardson, the executive director of the General Contractors Association, which represents construction companies on M.T.A. projects, said the surcharges are needed because the vendors assume huge risks on transit projects and often are forced to pay for mistakes made by the authority. At the end of the day, she said, the companies make a relatively small profit.\u201cIt is profit, not covering costs, that allows a firm to hire more people, expand their administrative space and buy new equipment,\u201d Ms. Richardson said. \u201cFirms that only cover their costs do not stay in business.\u201dLack of competition is also a problem for the M.T.A. A Times analysis of roughly 150 contracts worth more than $10 million that the authority has signed in the past five years found the average project received just 3.5 bids.\u201cIn other cities, you get eight bids for projects,\u201d said Gary Brierley, a consultant who has worked on hundreds of projects in the last 50 years, including the No. 7 line extension and the Second Avenue subway. \u201cIn New York, you get two or three, and they know that, so they\u2019ll inflate their bids if they think they can get away with it.\u201dOne of the most important contracts in recent years, for the construction of the Second Avenue tunnel, got just two bids. M.T.A. engineers had estimated the contract would cost $290 million, but both bids came in well above $300 million, and the authority did not have much leverage. Ultimately, it awarded the deal for about $350 million \u2014 20 percent above its estimate.And then there are the political connections. The vendors that worked on the East Side Access, Second Avenue subway and No. 7 line projects have given a combined $5 million to New York politicians since the projects began in 2000, a Times analysis found.More than a dozen M.T.A. workers were fined for accepting gifts from contractors during that time, records show. One was Anil Parikh, the director of the Second Avenue subway project. He got a $2,500 ticket to a gala, a round of golf and dinner from a contractor in 2002. Years later, shortly after the line opened, he went to work for the contractor\u2019s parent company, AECOM. Mr. Parikh and AECOM declined to comment.A Times analysis of the 25 M.T.A. agency presidents who have left over the past two decades found that at least 18 of them became consultants or went to work for authority contractors, including many who have worked on expansion projects.\u201cIs it rigged? Yes,\u201d said Charles G. Moerdler, who has served on the M.T.A. board since 2010. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s corrupt. But I think people like doing business with people they know, and so a few companies get all the work, and they can charge whatever they want.\u201dThe M.T.A.\u2019s high costs are not limited to the companies that build the tunnels. Projects start burning through cash long before construction begins.On average, \u201csoft costs\u201d \u2014 preliminary design and engineering, plus management while construction is underway \u2014 make up about 20 percent of the cost of transit projects in America, according to a 2010 report by the Transportation Research Board. The average is similar in other countries, contractors said.Not in New York.The latest federal oversight report for the Second Avenue subway projected soft cost spending at $1.4 billion \u2014 one-third of the budget, not including financing expenses. M.T.A. officials said that number was high because it included some costs for design of later phases of the line. But experts said it was still shocking.\u201cThe crazy thing is it\u2019s so high even with everything else,\u201d said Larry Gould, a transit consultant and former M.T.A. subway planner. \u201cIf we have three or four times as many workers, how can the percentage for soft costs be so high?\u201dSoft costs for East Side Access are expected to exceed $2 billion. The project plan called for the hiring of 500 consultants from a dozen different companies, according to a 2009 federal oversight report.Both the Second Avenue subway and East Side Access projects hired the same main engineering firm: WSP USA, formerly known as Parsons Brinckerhoff. The firm, which designed some of New York\u2019s original subway, has donated hundreds of thousands to politicians in recent years, and has hired so many transit officials that some in the system refer to it as \u201cthe M.T.A. retirement home.\u201dThe firm was the only vendor to bid on the engineering contract for the Second Avenue subway, records show. On East Side Access, it is sharing the contract with STV Inc., which recently hired the former M.T.A. chairman Thomas F. Prendergast. The contract was initially for $140 million, but it has grown to $481 million.WSP USA declined to answer questions. \u201cWSP has undertaken complex and enduring infrastructure projects across the U.S., and the New York region presents unique needs and challenges,\u201d the firm said in a statement.The M.T.A. is partly to blame. Officials have added to the soft costs by struggling to coordinate between vendors, taking a long time to approve plans, insisting on extravagant station designs and changing their minds midway through projects. In 2010, they hired a team of three consultants to work full time on East Side Access \u201coperational readiness\u201d \u2014 getting the tunnel ready to open \u2014 even though contractors knew construction would not end for another decade.Janno Lieber, who joined the M.T.A. as chief development officer in April, acknowledged there were parts of the authority\u2019s project management approach that have been \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cself-defeating.\u201d Changing plans midway through projects is a \u201chuge issue,\u201d as is over-customization of designs and poor management of consultants, he said.\u201cWe just have to do a much better job,\u201d Mr. Lieber said. \u201cWe\u2019re relying on these consultants to run our projects, and we\u2019re not getting good results out of them.\u201dOthers have a more skeptical perspective about the soft costs.Jack Brockway, an executive at Herrenknecht, a German manufacturer of tunnel-boring machines, said he got \u201cstacks and stacks and stacks\u201d of instructions from consultants for his work on the Second Avenue subway, down to details that barely made sense.\u201cIt makes you wonder if it\u2019s really necessary, or if they\u2019re just trying to do something to justify how much they\u2019re getting paid,\u201d Mr. Brockway said.Across the Atlantic Ocean, Paris is working on a project that brings the inefficiency of New York into stark relief.The project, called the Line 14 extension, is similar to the Second Avenue subway. Both projects extend decades-old lines in the hopes of reducing systemwide overcrowding. Both involved digging through moderately hard soil just north of the city center to make a few miles of tunnel and a few stations about 80 feet underground. Both used tunnel-boring machines made by Herrenknecht. Both faced strict regulations, high density and demands from neighbors, which limited some construction to 12 hours per day.But while the Second Avenue Subway cost $2.5 billion a mile, the Line 14 extension is on track to cost $450 million a mile.On a recent afternoon at a Line 14 construction site, an official expressed disbelief that New York was spending so much.\u201cWe thought ours was expensive,\u201d said Laurent Probst, managing director of \u00cele-de-France Mobilit\u00e9s, which controls transit in the French capital.As he descended into the hole carved for the future Pont Cardinet station, it became clear how the costs could be so different. Scattered around the cavern were a couple dozen workers, running drills, smoothing over soil and checking electrical systems. Mostly, they worked by themselves.Mr. Probst, 39, wearing a suit and blue tie under his orange safety jacket, pushed the button to operate the elevator himself.France\u2019s unions are powerful, but Mr. Probst said they did not control project staffing. Isabelle Brochard of RATP, a state-owned company that operates the Paris Metro and is coordinating the Line 14 project, estimated there were 200 total workers on the job, each earning $60 per hour. The Second Avenue subway project employed about 700 workers, many making double that (although that included health insurance).The tunnel-boring machine chewing through dirt north of Pont Cardinet \u2014 a secondhand machine, Ms. Brochard noted \u2014 was staffed by a dozen laborers who bounced between the control room, the cutting wheel and the sides of the machine.The small number of workers has not slowed the Paris project. The line, which will run driverless trains every 85 seconds, is set to open by 2020, six years after groundbreaking. The Second Avenue subway, by contrast, took a decade to build.M.T.A. officials declined to comment on the Paris project.RATP handled all the contracting, Mr. Probst said. But the government worked closely with vendors, trying to build the type of collaborative relationships that are rare in New York.The management contractor \u2014 Systra, which also worked on the Second Avenue subway \u2014 got a relatively small contract, Mr. Probst said. Soft costs totaled 20 percent of the project budget.Officials awarded dozens of contracts, and most garnered at least a half dozen bids, driving down costs.\u201cOur first cost estimate was 260 million euros,\u201d said Patrick Ramond, underground construction director at Razel-Bec, which beat five competitors to win a contract for half the tunneling. \u201cWe had to drop that by 40 million to get the job.\u201dBecause of that and some technical issues, Mr. Ramond said Razel-Bec was losing money on the job. Usually, he said, the firm makes a profit of about 5 percent.\u201cWe do fine. I make a good living,\u201d Mr. Ramond said with a laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to rip anybody off.\u201dDoris Burke and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Shrugs Off Debt Worries as Xi Takes Firmer Economic Grip", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 It\u2019s Xi Jinping\u2019s economy now, and he isn\u2019t too worried about debt.China signaled its economic priorities on Wednesday at the end of a meeting of top Communist Party economic leaders with a statement indicating that President Xi is fully in charge. Labeled \u201cXi Jinping Thought on Socialist Economy With Chinese Characteristics,\u201d the statement called for trimming industrial overcapacity, controlling the supply of money and other moves that have been staples of China\u2019s other recent declarations.\u201cPrudent monetary policy should be kept neutral, the floodgates of monetary supply should be controlled, and credit and social financing should see reasonable growth,\u201d the statement said.The statement illustrates both Mr. Xi\u2019s growing clout and what economists say is a subtle shift in how China may address its debt pile \u2014 a shift that suggests leaders may be willing to tolerate even more debt if it will help growth.\u201cIt shows that \u2018I am the boss,\u2019\u201d said Gary Liu, president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a nonprofit economic research group in Shanghai.The absence of major concern about debt also echoed recent Chinese statements. Since October, Chinese economic policymakers have expressed little interest in tackling the country\u2019s mountain of debt, which has accumulated rapidly over the past decade. By contrast, the work conference\u2019s statements over the past two years devoted more attention to the subject.Instead, the new statement called for stabilizing China\u2019s often-volatile housing market, particularly by helping to develop a stronger rental market, and for trimming the list of industries in which foreign investors are restricted from participating.China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second largest after that of the United States, is fueled to a considerable extent by lending from its state-controlled banking system. A relaxed stance on debt suggests leaders could be less inclined to take steps that would trim the debt load but also might hold back short-term economic growth.Chinese officials in recent months have signaled a \u201csubtle change of emphasis\u201d toward tolerating an overall increase in debt as long as corporate debt stays under control, said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist.The efforts seem to have slowed the rate at which debt is growing relative to the economy. Data from the Bank of International Settlements, a group of big central banks that is based in Basel, Switzerland, shows that China\u2019s ratio of nonfinancial corporate debt to economic output fell slightly in the second quarter of this year, the most recent for which data is available.\u201cHigh leverage is the general source of macrofinancial fragility, manifested in the real sector as overindebtedness and in the financial sector as an excessively rapid expansion of credit,\u201d he said in a statement on the central bank\u2019s website on Nov. 4.Meanwhile, there are persistent questions about how much debt has really been incurred by local governments and their corporate affiliates.China\u2019s debt accumulation is \u201cslower than before, but if you use the West as a benchmark, it\u2019s still pretty bad,\u201d said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Only Way to Keep Your Resolutions", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterNew Year\u2019s Eve is a time to set goals: to eat better, to save more money, to work harder, to drink less. It\u2019s Day 1 on the road to a \u201cnew you.\u201d But this road, as we all know, is difficult to follow. Humans are notoriously bad at resisting temptation, especially (as research confirms) if we\u2019re busy, tired or stressed. By Jan. 8, some 25 percent of resolutions have fallen by the wayside. And by the time the year ends, fewer than 10 percent have been fully kept.Unfortunately, the problem of New Year\u2019s resolutions is, in a way, the problem of life itself. Our tendency to be shortsighted \u2014 to value the pleasures of the present more than the satisfactions of the future \u2014 comes at a considerable cost. Surely by now you\u2019ve heard of the psychologist Walter Mischel\u2019s famous marshmallow experiments, in which children who could resist the temptation to immediately eat one sweet would be rewarded with a second sweet about 15 minutes later. Professor Mischel found that those who could wait \u2014 those who had self-control \u2014 were also the ones who had better academic and professional success years later.Since then, study after study has linked self-control to achievement in a wide range of areas, including personal finance, healthful eating and exercise, and job performance. Put simply, those who can persevere toward their long-term goals in the face of temptation to do otherwise \u2014 those who have \u201cgrit\u201d \u2014 are best positioned for success.If what I\u2019ve said so far sounds familiar, that\u2019s because over the past 30 years, in response to these findings, something of a cottage industry has sprung up to tell us how to increase our self-control. If you peruse the books on the best-seller lists, you\u2019ll find variations on a theme: The best way to increase self-control is to use our willpower (and related mental capacities like executive function \u2014 that part of the mind that directs planning and reasoning) to ignore or suppress our craving for immediate pleasure.But after a few decades of using this information, not much seems to have changed. We\u2019re still spending too much on impulse buys rather than saving for retirement, still continuing to indulge our sweet tooth rather than eating healthfully. Why?The answer, I contend, is that this view of self-control is wrong. In choosing to rely on rational analysis and willpower to stick to our goals, we\u2019re disadvantaging ourselves. We\u2019re using tools that aren\u2019t only weak; they\u2019re also potentially harmful. If using willpower to keep your nose to the grindstone feels like a struggle, that\u2019s because it is. Your mind is fighting against itself. It\u2019s trying to convince, cajole and, if that fails, suppress a desire for immediate pleasure. Given self-control\u2019s importance for success, it seems as if evolution should have provided us with a tool for it that was less excruciating to use.I believe it did; we\u2019re just ignoring it. That tool is our social emotions. These are the emotions \u2014 things like gratitude and compassion \u2014 that support the positive aspects of social life. For years I\u2019ve been studying the effects of these emotions on decision-making and behavior, and I\u2019ve found that unlike reason and willpower, they naturally incline us to be patient and persevere. When you are experiencing these emotions, self-control is no longer a battle, for they work not by squashing our desires for pleasure in the moment but by increasing how much we value the future.We too often think about self-improvement and the pursuit of our goals in bracing, self-flagellating terms: I will do better, I will muscle through, I will wake up earlier. But it doesn\u2019t need to be that way, and it shouldn\u2019t: Self-control isn\u2019t about feeling miserable.The research on self-control shows that willpower, for all its benefits, wanes over time. As we try to make ourselves study, work, exercise or save money, the mental effort to keep focused and motivated increases until it seems too difficult to bear.At moderate levels, the tendency to pursue achievement through willpower and rational analysis can be a boon. But at higher levels, it\u2019s a detriment to well-being \u2014 especially if you fail. When people who are exceedingly focused and dedicated to using force of will to achieve their goals come up short, they report a hit to their well-being that is 120 percent greater than that reported by those who follow a less austere and stressful path.From an evolutionary perspective, the fact that exercising willpower doesn\u2019t come naturally to us makes a lot of sense. For millenniums, what led to success wasn\u2019t the ability to study for exams, save for retirement, go to the gym or wait for a second marshmallow. For most of our evolutionary history, none of these self-focused goals mattered or even existed. It\u2019s far more likely that what led to success was strong social bonds \u2014 relationships that would encourage people to cooperate and lend support to one another, which helped to ensure that their sacrifices would be returned time and again when required in the future.What underlies these moral traits is the ability to put something else ahead of your own immediate desires and interests \u2014 to exercise self-control. Working hard to keep up your end of a deal or helping another person by giving time, money, food or a shoulder to cry on all require a willingness to sacrifice some resources in the moment. In exchange, you reap the benefits of those strong relationships down the line.I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in saying that I\u2019ve moved more couches and spent more time making gifts for friends than I thought possible when I felt gratitude toward them and wanted to show appreciation. Or that I\u2019ve worked longer and harder on difficult tasks when I wanted to feel proud about my abilities and contributions to a team. Or that I\u2019ve given more support to people when moved by compassion to do so.What these findings show is that pride, gratitude and compassion, whether we consciously realize it or not, reduce the human mind\u2019s tendency to discount the value of the future. In so doing, they push us not only to cooperate with other people but also to help our own future selves. Feeling pride or compassion has been shown to increase perseverance on difficult tasks by over 30 percent. Likewise, gratitude and compassion have been tied to better academic performance, a greater willingness to exercise and eat healthily, and lower levels of consumerism, impulsivity and tobacco and alcohol use.If using willpower causes stress, using these emotions actually heals: They slow heart rate, lower blood pressure and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. By making us value the future more, they ease the way to patience and perseverance.So as 2018 commences, take more time to cultivate these emotions. Reflect on what you\u2019re grateful to have been given. Allow your mind to step into the shoes of those in need and feel for them. Take pride in the small achievements on the path to your goals. Doing so will help ensure that every future New Year\u2019s Eve will have more to celebrate than to regret.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giving a Family Business a Jolt With Coffee That Empowers Women", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurshipIn Ms. Bohbot\u2019s estimation, Alakef \u2014 a profitable enterprise that financed her voice lessons, provided for family vacations and allowed her to enroll at a private university \u2014 had grown stale.\u201cWe were hitting a plateau, and it needed to be reinvigorated,\u201d said Ms. Bohbot, now 32, all steely determination and dry humor. Her parents considered selling the company, but instead, she thought, \u201cWe needed someone to come in and infuse a lot of new energy.\u201dThat person, she decided, was her.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to come in and keep things ho-hum,\u201d she told her parents. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to do this, I want to make it my own and grow it and bring it somewhere new.\u201dWhen consultants told her that \u201cit\u2019s great to have a mission, but it\u2019s not enough to drive sales,\u201d Ms. Bohbot insisted that an \u201cunapologetically feminine\u201d coffee brand would find consumers. Even so, the company\u2019s success has exceeded her expectations: Sales \u2014 principally through City Girl\u2019s online store and in the Twin Cities\u2019 high-end retailers, including Kowalski\u2019s Markets and Lunds & Byerlys \u2014 are up 300 percent year over year.City Girl aims to break into other Midwest markets, including Chicago, St. Louis and Des Moines, and then to select cities on the East Coast. Still, Ms. Bohbot is willing to be patient.\u201cIf you blow up too quickly, you will sacrifice something,\u201d she said.She has played witness to a slow build before. When her parents, Nessim and Deborah Bohbot, moved to Duluth from Israel in the late 1980s, they were dumbfounded by their new neighbors\u2019 preference for mass-market coffee brands like Folgers and Maxwell House, so they began roasting coffee in their basement. After locals started taking notice and wanting to buy the coffee, Alakef was formed.\u201cPeople thought we were crazy,\u201d Mr. Bohbot, 70, recalled with a laugh. \u201cAt first, people didn\u2019t understand why they had to pay so much for specialty coffee when you could go to a gas station and get it for 20 cents a cup. We had to educate them.\u201dMs. Bohbot initially intended to study vocal jazz at Syracuse University, but after discovering she had vocal cord nodules, she switched to retail management. In 2008, she moved to Boston to work in sales for the maker of Samuel Adams beer; after two years, she went back to school for a master\u2019s degree in guidance counseling. In mid-2014, when her parents told her that they were contemplating selling Alakef, she thought for the first time about taking over the business.Her parents were excited for her but reluctant to let her take over the business. \u201cWe wanted to be sure it was her passion,\u201d Mrs. Bohbot, 65, said.Returning home for a six-month trial period, Ms. Bohbot quickly realized she couldn\u2019t bear to see the company trade hands. \u201cThat was my whole life\u201d when she was growing up, she remembered thinking. \u201cWait a minute, we\u2019re just going to walk away from it?\u201dOnly a few months later, in April 2015, Ms. Bohbot struck upon her idea for City Girl after attending an International Women\u2019s Coffee Alliance breakfast at a conference in Seattle. There she learned of a Colombian widow unable to keep her family\u2019s coffee farm simply because of her gender; in many countries where coffee is grown, women are silent laborers left out of decision making largely because of cultural norms.\u201cThe women were out of the loop even though they were doing the majority of the work,\u201d said Connie Kolosvary, program director for Caf\u00e9 Femenino. Caf\u00e9 Femenino, which was formed in 2004, not only pays a premium for beans from cooperatives that follow its strict guidelines to empower women but also pays its female members directly for their harvests.With the men aware that more money is coming in simply because of female involvement, Ms. Kolosvary said, \u201cfor the very first time these women are now viewed as having a leadership role in their communities.\u201dThe I.W.C.A., with legally recognized chapters in 22 countries, helps mobilize women in the industry and provides a platform for them to share the challenges they face. Josiane Cotrim, chapter president for Brazil, the largest coffee-exporting country, said the support of organizations like the I.W.C.A. meant \u201cthe woman was no longer the daughter or the sister or the wife of someone in coffee.\u201dMs. Bohbot, who serves as a marketing co-chairwoman of the I.W.C.A., said she, too, faced challenges when she entered the coffee world, though they were largely business-related. Some of her chief competitors have argued that City Girl\u2019s female-empowerment message is little more than a marketing ploy. But \u201cin this day and age, you can\u2019t have a good product without having a good marketing story,\u201d Ms. Bohbot said.Also, buying coffee from growers run by women \u201cadds a whole other layer of stress on our company,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to work diligently to reach out to all of our importers to use our connections to find this coffee and bring it in.\u201dMs. Bohbot, who has made local philanthropy an increased priority at Alakef and will introduce new packaging and an updated logo there next year, said she got personal satisfaction from City Girl\u2019s success and being viewed as a leader among her female peers.When women in every industry are fighting daily battles to achieve equality, \u201cI feel hopeful,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen are vocalizing more than ever before.

{"Headline": "Would the G.O.P. Tax Bill Penalize California Wildfire Victims?", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the scorched landscapes of California, a little-noted provision of the Republican tax overhaul has property owners worried about being burned twice: Once by the wildfires that have destroyed thousands of homes, and then again by being denied a tax write-off for their losses. But there is much confusion about the legislation\u2019s actual effects. Here are answers to some of the vexing questions.The deduction helps soften the blow for people who are uninsured or underinsured, and many homeowners\u2019 policies do not cover the full value of their property, according to Michael Simkovic, a professor of law and accounting at the University of Southern California. Taxpayers nationwide deducted $1.6 billion in 2015 for losses from natural disasters, the I.R.S. calculates, and much of that was in California: the state\u2019s Department of Finance reports that in 2015, nearly 100,000 federal returns filed in California claimed casualty loss deductions totaling about $700 million.Both versions of the tax legislation now moving through Congress would take away the deduction for personal losses in wildfires. The House bill would eliminate the casualty loss deduction entirely; the Senate version would retain it only for losses in \u201cfederally declared disasters,\u201d and wildfires have hardly ever been so declared.No. The new tax law would not take effect until 2018. People whose homes were destroyed in 2017 would still be covered by the old law. They would, however, have to tally their uninsured losses and claim them on their 2017 return \u2014 the one they must file by April 15, 2018, unless they get an extension.However, damage that occurs on or after Jan. 1 would fall under the new law, and would not be deductible \u2014 though there could be some exceptions if the House version of the legislation is approved.Democrats have complained that these provisions are especially unfair to California, which is more prone to wildfires and earthquakes than most other states. But losses from hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and mudslides would not be deductible either, so the effects would be felt in many red states as well.Congress can pass special legislation to provide tax relief for victims of particular disasters, as they did after this year\u2019s major hurricanes, waiving the 10 percent threshold for casualty loss deductions and allowing early withdrawals from 401(k) retirement accounts without the usual tax penalty. Some Republican lawmakers have said they would approve a similar plan for victims of the California wildfires.Even so, Gov. Jerry Brown and Democratic lawmakers have said the repeal of the casualty loss deduction would make it much more difficult for Californians to bounce back from the state\u2019s inevitable disasters.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Treasury Defends Tax Plan Cost With One-Page Analysis", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Treasury Department released a one-page analysis of the nearly 500-page Senate tax bill on Monday that suggested the $1.5 trillion plan would more than pay for itself, assuming the economy grows much faster than any independent analysis of the bill has projected.The Treasury acknowledged that its analysis was based on optimistic economic forecasts that assumed a host of policy changes yet to be enacted, including increased infrastructure spending, further loosening of business regulations and changes to welfare programs.The analysis left many tax experts scratching their heads and prompted criticism that the Treasury was offering misleading data.\u201cThe report does not appear to be a projection of the economic effects of a tax bill,\u201d said Scott Greenberg, a tax analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation. \u201cIt appears, on the other hand, to be a thought experiment on how federal revenues would vary under different economic effects of overall government policies. Which is, needless to say, an odd way to analyze a tax bill.\u201dTreasury has come under criticism for failing to produce a full assessment of the $1.5 trillion tax plan moving swiftly through Congress. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has repeatedly insisted that his department would provide details to back up the claims that he and other Republicans have made that the tax cuts will generate enough economic growth to avoid adding to the national debt.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in magic,\u201d said David H. Brockway, staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation during the Reagan administration. \u201cIt\u2019s just a political statement.\u201dThe Treasury analysis assumes gross domestic product to grow at a rate of 2.9 percent over the next 10 years, rather than the 2.2 percent rate that many other groups have projected. That faster growth would raise $1.8 trillion over that period, paying for the $1.5 trillion tax cut and raising an additional $300 billion, the Treasury report said.On a conference call to discuss the report, a senior Treasury official said that about half of the difference between Treasury\u2019s estimates for higher growth was based on the proposed corporate tax cut, which would reduce the tax rate for corporations to 20 percent from 35 percent. The rest of the difference is attributed to reducing taxes for \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses, whose profits flow through to their owners and are taxed at individual rates, and the administration\u2019s plans for infrastructure, deregulation and changes to the welfare system that were outlined in the White House budget proposal this year.\u201cIt\u2019s not a dynamic score of the bill, because it includes regulatory reform, infrastructure and welfare reform,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who was chairman of former President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIt looks to me like it\u2019s a restatement of their budget.\u201d\u201cWe acknowledge that some economists predict different growth rates,\u201d the Treasury Department wrote in the report outlining its analysis of the plan.Kevin Hassett, chairman of President Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said the Treasury analysis was \u201cabsolutely defensible.\u201d He said that they started with the assumption that Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies would boost growth by about one percent per year over the decade and worked backward to demonstrate the effects of the tax cuts would not add to the deficit.\u201cIf you just assume you would get that kind of growth, then you say how much revenue you get from that,\u201d Mr. Hassett said on CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s all really just math.\u201dSeveral groups that have analyzed the Senate plan using sophisticated economic modeling have found it would not generate anywhere close to the revenues needed to pay for itself.The Joint Committee on Taxation, the economic scorekeeper of Congress, projected in late November that the Senate bill would increase the size of the economy by 0.8 percent over 10 years, beyond what it would otherwise have achieved \u2014 which is well short of the growth path implied by the Treasury one-pager. The committee\u2019s so-called dynamic analysis projected that the Senate plan would add $1 trillion to federal deficits over that time, after accounting for increased growth. That analysis was for the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s version of the bill, not the amended version later approved by the chamber.Kent Smetters, a professor at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, said that Treasury\u2019s view of what the tax cuts would do for economic growth was \u201caspirational in nature\u201d and not driven by analysis of an actual plan.The Treasury officials pointed to an assessment from the Council of Economic Advisers and a letter written by leading conservative economists that concluded that the tax cut plan would spur greater economic growth than some outside groups have projected.Republican lawmakers have seized upon those analyses to assert that the tax cuts will not add to the $20 trillion national debt, yet some of the economists who signed the letter have said otherwise.Robert Barro, a Harvard professor who signed the letter to the Treasury, said the corporate tax cuts would lead to less revenue in the short run before faster economic growth made up for some of the losses.\u201cMight be roughly a wash in Year 10, in which case cumulated fiscal deficit over 10 years would rise,\u201d Mr. Barro said, nodding to the fact that the debt would increase over that 10-year period.Mr. Holtz-Eakin said that he was frustrated that lawmakers were characterizing the letter as affirming that the tax cuts would be fully self-financing.The Treasury analysis comes as Congress is putting the finishing touches on a tax bill that the House and Senate are hoping to vote on next week. The House and Senate are trying to reconcile their two bills, which can add no more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade.A senior Senate aide said Republicans on Capitol Hill were blindsided by the Treasury report and had no warning that it was coming during such as sensitive time in the legislative process.Democrats doubled-down on their criticism of the Treasury Department on Monday, calling its analysis \u201cfake math.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s clear the White House and Republicans are grasping at straws to prove the unprovable and garner votes for a bill that nearly every single independent analysis has concluded will blow up the deficit and generate almost no additional economic activity to make up for it,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hannah Ryggen Wove Politics Into Her Gorgeous Tapestries", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOXFORD, England \u2014 On July 22, 2011, Hannah Ryggen\u2019s tapestry \u201cWe Are Living on a Star\u201d was hanging in the Cabinet Building in Oslo\u2019s Regjeringskvartalet, or government quarter, when a car bomb exploded in the street outside. Eight people died in the blast, which damaged the offices of the prime minister, as well as the finance and oil ministries. Ms. Ryggen\u2019s tapestry was torn and showered with splinters of glass and other flying debris.\u201cWe Are Living on a Star\u201d unites two enduring themes of Ms. Ryggen\u2019s work: her broadly socialist, anti-fascist response to world events, and a profound love for her family and the living earth that sustained it. Commissioned in 1958 for the Cabinet Building by its architect, Erling Viksjo, Ms. Ryggen\u2019s 13-foot-high, hand-woven work shows monumental male and female figures embracing before a blue ovoid form that represents the world, suspended amid planets in a night sky.Among the earliest works is the frieze-like \u201cEtiopia,\u201d Ms. Ryggen\u2019s furious response to the Italian occupation of Ethiopia in 1936. Portraits of the Emperor Haile Selassie and Italy\u2019s King Victor Emmanuel III are set above a large geometrically patterned rug panel suggesting Ms. Ryggen\u2019s kinship with African weavers. \u201cEtiopia\u201d was shown by Norway at the Paris Expo of 1937 in the pavilion adjacent to Spain, where Pablo Picasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica\u201d offered a horrified response to the Nazi bombing of a Basque town during the Spanish Civil War.Even in such company, Ms. Ryggen\u2019s work was censored: An upper portion of the tapestry, showing Benito Mussolini\u2019s decapitated head held aloft by an Ethiopian soldier, was folded over to avoid offending Italians.Born to a working class Swedish family in 1894, Ms. Ryggen trained as a portrait painter before turning to the loom. On a trip to Dresden, Germany, as a young woman, she immersed herself in the work of Vermeer, Goya and El Greco. She was likewise versed in the art of her own time, making repeat visits to the huge 1914 Baltic Exhibition in Malmo, Sweden, at which paintings by Kandinsky and the German expressionist group Die Br\u00fccke were shown. A spirited early self-portrait on display at Oxford shows Ms. Ryggen\u2019s considerable skill as a painter.Her turn to tapestry, and with it, her interest in craft traditions and the eccentric compositions of medieval art, was explicitly political. A tapestry was a mobile messenger: it could be nimbly rolled up, transported and displayed without sustaining damage as a painting might.Ms. Ridgway sees Ms. Ryggen as a figure ahead of her time: \u201cShe was making her art to contribute to public conversations about equality: hard enough today, but as a woman, then, it was even more so.\u201dMs. Ryggen gave almost all of her major tapestries to public institutions, hoping they would be widely seen. After moving to a remote area near Trondheim, Norway, in 1924, she and her husband Hans lived off the land they farmed. Raising sheep for wool, and making her own dyes from local moss, lichen, bark and plants (and the contents of a chamber pot), tapestry freed her from dependence on commercial materials.Created after a decade of self-education, Ms. Ryggen\u2019s first mature political tapestry \u201cFishing in the Sea of Debt\u201d (1933), shows starving families drowning in a blood-red fjord while a plump debt-collector\u2019s wife looks on from her picnic blanket. The Great Depression had hit Norway, bringing high unemployment and terrible deprivation. With its strong, roiling colors, and expressionistic style, the work suggests the influence of the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch. Like all of Ms. Ryggen\u2019s tapestries, it was created directly on the loom without preparatory sketches.To Ms. Ridgway, the curator, the political backdrop against which Ryggen wove her tapestries suggests painful parallels with the present. \u201cHer work was made in the face of rising nationalism in Europe,\u201d Ms. Ridgway said, \u201cracism that played on people\u2019s genuine fears about their economic stability.\u201dThrough close reading of the left-leading newspaper Dagbladet, Ms. Ryggen followed with horror the rise of fascist powers in Europe. The central suite of works in the Oxford exhibition address Nazi atrocities first in Germany, then Norway, and their eventual impact on Ms. Ryggen\u2019s family. In \u201cDeath of Dreams\u201d (1936), the German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky is pictured imprisoned, shortly after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. Two years later Mr. von Ossietzky was executed. A separate tapestry shows another figure in the German resistance to Nazism, Liselotte Herrmann, who was also executed in 1938.The extraordinary \u201c6 October 1942\u201d shows the shooting of Henry Gleditsch, the director of Trondheim\u2019s Trondelag Theater. Above a Piet\u00e0-like scene of Mr. Gleditsch\u2019s death, Hitler flies through Norwegian skies farting oak leaves as a symbol of German strength. The Ryggen family is seen floating in a boat of roses on the panel to the right: between the two sides stands Winston Churchill in a barricaded tower. Neither love nor military intervention could protect the Ryggen family: two years later Hans was imprisoned.Toward the end of her life, Ms. Ryggen turned her gaze to the United States. \u201cBlood in the Grass\u201d (1966), the final work in the exhibition, shows President Lyndon Johnson as a scarlet cowboy, a dog at his feet, beside a lawn of tufted green wool, through which seeps a violent red. Johnson\u2019s beagle made headlines after the president had lifted the dog by its ears during a photography shoot. As a contemporary report in The Times noted: \u201cSome authorities on dogs questioned the President\u2019s handling.\u201d In the following days, debate around the incident seemed to eclipse coverage of the Vietnam War.According to Ms. Ridgway, the news media\u2019s focus on comparatively trivial outrages dismayed the artist. \u201dShe was horrified by reports of the war, and was angry that coverage of the brutal loss of life in another country had been overshadowed by the media focus on the behavior of President Johnson as an individual,\u201d the curator said. Having relied on media sources for inspiration throughout her working life, Ms. Ryggen\u2019s disquiet over the way the president\u2019s public behavior could draw our focus away from more important international issues seems, as with many of the artist\u2019s other concerns, remarkably prescient.Hannah Ryggen: Woven Histories is at Modern Art Oxford, through Feb. 18, 2018.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Renewable Energy Is Surging. The G.O.P. Tax Bill Could Curtail That.", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican tax bills moving through Congress could significantly hobble the United States\u2019 renewable energy industry because of a series of provisions that scale back incentives for wind and solar power while bolstering older energy sources like oil and gas production.\u201cThe production tax credit has destroyed the energy market, especially in the Midwest,\u201d the employee, Jessica Unruh, who is also a state representative, told the president. \u201cWind production has really eroded our state tax base and replaced coal production when it comes to electricity production.\u201d\u201cWe would see a drastic drop-off in wind installations,\u201d said Michael Goggin, the senior director of research at the American Wind Energy Association. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing orders put on hold and projects not able to get refinancing. Even the threat of this bill is having a chilling effect.\u201d\u201cThere is a perfect storm of bad news that impacts investor confidence in renewables,\u201d said Trevor Houser, a former Obama administration climate official who now tracks energy economics as a partner at the Rhodium Group. \u201cIt is shaping up to be a pretty rough 2018.\u201dNo one is predicting the demise of solar and wind deployment, which rely less each year on tax subsidies as their costs decline and were already preparing for a gradual phaseout of the subsidies by 2020. But the sudden changes could slow what had been a steady pace of adoption and raise electricity prices for consumers in states like California, which have set mandatory targets for the share of renewables in their electricity mixes. In states without such targets, including Texas, more expensive new renewable plants could lose out to natural gas generation.\u201cIn the long run, we think wind and solar will become cheap enough to compete without subsidies,\u201d said Amy Grace, a renewables analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cBut in the short term, those tax credits have been important.\u201dThe Trump administration has made no secret of wanting to pull the plug on tax preferences for solar and wind, contending that those industries should have to compete on their own merit.\u201cI would do away with these incentives that we give to wind and solar,\u201d Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in October. \u201cI\u2019d let them stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas.\u201dIn a potentially bad sign for the renewable industry, the list of Republican senators named to the conference committee on Wednesday did not include Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, a longtime champion of the wind industry who has opposed the House\u2019s efforts to curtail wind tax credits before a phaseout scheduled for 2020.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.While the Senate version preserves the important tax credits for wind and solar, it includes a provision that could unexpectedly undermine their effectiveness \u2014 and has prompted major concern from the industry.Currently, the companies that build wind and solar farms often do not have large enough tax liabilities to take full advantage of the renewable credits. So they will sell the credits to banks and other investors who can take advantage of them to lower their own tax burdens. Roughly two-thirds of wind projects and three-fourths of solar projects in the United States are supported by such tax equity financing.But under a provision in the Senate bill known as the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax, intended to prevent companies from outsourcing investment abroad, many of those same banks could face a new minimum tax that reduces the value of those wind and solar credits. That, in turn, could dry up demand for such tax-financing deals. Renewable companies may have to look elsewhere for financing, which could either increase costs or stop some projects.Abigail Ross Hopper, the president and the chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said that the provision could negatively affect 39 gigawatts worth of new solar projects around the country \u2014 nearly as much as all of the solar power that has been installed to date.\u201cThe jury is still out on whether this was a carefully crafted hit on renewable energy or an unintended consequence,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to make sure members understand what the impacts of these changes would be.\u201d\u201cThat would definitely be a big blow to the electric vehicle market, which is just picking up steam,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at Edmunds.com. While Tesla and General Motors are nearing their cap for the tax credit, repeal could significantly affect companies like Nissan, which was planning to introduce a new model of its all-electric Leaf in the coming year.Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, has said he will work to oppose the House\u2019s repeal of the credit.

{"Headline": "John Portman, Architect Who Made Skylines Soar, Dies at 93", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn Portman, the architect and developer who revolutionized hotel designs with soaring futuristic atriums, built commercial towers that revitalized the downtowns of decaying postwar American cities and transformed Asian skylines from Shanghai to Mumbai, died on Friday in Atlanta. He was 93.Mr. Portman\u2019s family announced his death. No cause was given.One of the world\u2019s best-known and most influential architects, Mr. Portman, over a half-century, redefined urban landscapes in the United States. He built the Peachtree Center in Atlanta, the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, the Renaissance Center in Detroit and scores of hotel, office and retail complexes in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Fort Worth, San Diego and other cities.His buildings often evoked oohs and aahs from the public, but were not always a hit with critics, who called them concrete islands, self-contained cities within cities \u2014 serving their patrons yet insular, even forbidding to outsiders. But by combining architectural talents with the savvy of a real estate entrepreneur, Mr. Portman was hugely successful and a rarity among contemporaries: both an artist and a tough businessman.In the 1960s and \u201970s, his signature hotels \u2014 skyscrapers with escarpment atriums, cantilevered balconies overlooking interiors big enough to contain the Statue of Liberty, whooshing glass elevators, waterfalls, hanging gardens and revolving rooftop restaurants \u2014 offered thrilling antidotes to the standard lot of dreary hotel lobbies, claustrophobic box elevators and shotgun corridors lined with cells for the inmates.An Atlanta maverick who defied architects\u2019 ethics codes by plunging into real estate development, Mr. Portman, who had no money to start with, made and lost millions of dollars cofinancing many of his own projects. From the 1980s on he designed and built hotels, retail marts and office towers in China, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and India \u2014 and more complexes in Europe, the Middle East and the United States.As they proliferated in the United States, Mr. Portman\u2019s atrium hotels, many built for the Hyatt Corporation, were widely imitated by other architects who sought to capitalize on the dizzying exhilaration (some called it terror) of patrons soaring 50 stories in a Buck Rogers glass capsule, or dining under the stars as the city moved in a circle with the galactic night. You did not even have to rent a room.There were setbacks for the atrium concept. The 40-story Hyatt Regency Kansas City, designed by three local architects with an atrium imitating Mr. Portman\u2019s, was the scene of a collapse of two aerial walkways in 1981 during a dance competition in the lobby. The collapse killed 114 people and injured 216 others in one of the nation\u2019s deadliest structural failures.By the late 1980s, with atriums in the Westin Bonaventure in Los Angeles, the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco, the Marriott Marquis in New York and dozens of others, the design was so common that some motels had what passed for atriums. Travelers were no longer impressed, and critics said Mr. Portman had repeated himself too often.But his atriums were laced into popular culture. In the 1977 film \u201cHigh Anxiety,\u201d Mel Brooks, as an acrophobic psychiatrist facing a sheer drop at the San Francisco Hyatt, inches to his room clinging to the walls. And in a 1993 film, \u201cIn the Line of Fire,\u201d Clint Eastwood\u2019s Secret Service agent outlasts a would-be presidential assassin in a glass elevator at the Los Angeles Bonaventure.As federal support for urban renewal faded in the 1970s, Mr. Portman\u2019s commercial towers were hailed as downtown saviors, bringing back tourists and suburban shoppers, renewing economies and crumbling landscapes. But some failed, and a rising chorus of critics derided his structures as islands of exclusion, paradoxically cut off from the downtowns they were intended to rescue.His Renaissance Center in Detroit was a glaring example. A cluster of four 39-story office buildings and a 73-story hotel with shops, restaurants and theaters was built in the 1970s to save a depressed city. But its gleaming towers on the Detroit River were as remote as a cloud-ringed Disneyland castle. Office workers, visitors and suburban shoppers could drive in and out without ever setting foot downtown.Mr. Portman\u2019s Marriott Marquis Hotel, which opened in a still-seedy Times Square in New York in 1985 with a 45-story atrium and an eighth-floor lobby, was \u201ca cold, grim place,\u201d wrote Paul Goldberger, then The New York Times\u2019s architecture critic. \u201cLike so much of Mr. Portman\u2019s architecture, the hotel is turned almost completely inward; the architect seems interested in urban activity only insofar as it can be canned and packaged within its walls. To the rest of New York, this building turns a harsh concrete wall.\u201dMr. Portman scoffed, arguing that open spaces in congested cities relieved anxieties. Influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright, who harmonized structures with people and surroundings, Mr. Portman said his own buildings, especially hotels, were oases within cities, designed to enhance the experiences of the people who used them.\u201cAnyone can build a building and put rooms in it,\u201d he told The Times in 2011. \u201cBut we should put human beings at the head of our thought processes. You want to hopefully spark their enthusiasm. Like riding in a glass elevator: Everyone talks on a glass elevator. You get on a closed-in elevator, everyone looks down at their shoes. A glass elevator lets people\u2019s spirits expand. Architecture should be a symphony.\u201dColleagues said Mr. Portman, like his buildings, was proudly self-contained. Tall, soft-spoken, with a gentle smile and wavy hair, he worked incessantly, was not given to small talk and never shed his slight air of Old South formality.In a profession that regarded architecture and real estate development as a conflict of interest, he aggressively pursued both, designing buildings while his firm bought property and arranged financing and construction for projects that required partners and millions of dollars from lenders. At first, no hotel chain would touch his ideas. Even in Atlanta, few accepted his vision of a redeemable downtown.But the Peachtree Center in Atlanta was a spectacular success: 14 blocks of office towers, hotels and shopping arcades opened in 1961 with the Merchandise Mart, a wholesale complex that lured hordes of buyers. The Hyatt Regency was built in 1967 to accommodate them. It made Mr. Portman famous, revolutionized hotel construction and spurred Peachtree to completion. It was a key to the downtown renaissance and changed Atlanta\u2019s view of itself.\u201cPortman saw his mission as making the city safe for the middle class,\u201d Mr. Goldberger wrote in 1996, \u201cand he did so almost too well, for he filled Atlanta with buildings that brought a kind of suburban mall mentality to the center of downtown.\u201dJohn Calvin Portman Jr. was born in Walhalla, S.C., on Dec. 4, 1924, to John Calvin and Edna Rochester Portman. His father was a government worker, his mother a beautician. He grew up in Atlanta, where he played football and graduated in 1943 from Tech High School.In 1944, Mr. Portman married Joan Newton. They had six children. Besides his wife, he is survived by four sons, Michael, John C. III, Jeffrey and Jarel; a daughter, Jana Simmons; three sisters, Glenda Dodrill, Anne Davis and Joy Roberts; 19 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by a son, Jae, and two sisters, Mabel Creel and Phyllis Tippet.Mr. Portman attended the United States Naval Academy in 1944 and 1945, then transferred to the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he earned a degree in architecture in 1950. After an apprenticeship with an Atlanta architect, he opened his own practice in 1953. He struggled at first, designing drugstores and YMCAs.A growing respect for the hard economic realities of architecture prompted Mr. Portman\u2019s first venture into real estate, financing a small medical building he designed. The deal fell through, but Mr. Portman was convinced that development was the key to success in architecture.In 1956, he and H. Griffith Edwards, a former Georgia Tech professor, became partners. Mr. Portman designed buildings and Mr. Edwards, 20 years older, managed construction until he retired in 1968. They took joint credit for many projects, including the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, Mr. Portman\u2019s creative genesis.In the 1980s, Mr. Portman developed properties in Shanghai, Singapore and South Korea. By the end of the decade, with capital drying up and regulators tightening lending requirements, his empire was $2 billion in debt. He surrendered a controlling interest in the Peachtree Center, the keystone of his holdings.But in 1991, the lenders let him retain most of his properties and provided millions of dollars in new capital in exchange for 8 percent of Mr. Portman\u2019s assets. He was soon on his feet again, completing the huge, multiuse Shanghai Centre and properties in Beijing; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Mumbai, India.Mr. Portman rarely attended public events, though he accepted many awards in person and gave parties for hundreds. He painted abstracts, created sculptures and designed furniture at a beach house he built on Sea Island, Ga. He co-wrote several books, including \u201cThe Architect as Developer\u201d (1976, with Jonathan Barnett), and was the focus of a 2011 documentary by Ben Loeterman, \u201cJohn Portman: A Life of Building.\u201dAt 86, he was still running John Portman & Associates. \u201cA fish got to swim and a bird got to fly,\u201d he told The Times in his Southern Comfort drawl. \u201cI\u2019m here six days a week, and it\u2019d be seven if I didn\u2019t make a commitment to my wife to take a day off.\u201d He never retired.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "St. Louis Reconnects With the Gateway Arch and Its Pioneer Spirit", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetST. LOUIS \u2014 In a year that placed monuments at the center of civic strife, a $380 million project to expand the grounds and visitor center at the Gateway Arch, the tallest man-made monument in the Western Hemisphere, is bringing people together in this Mississippi River city.The project to beautify the arch grounds, redesign entrances and enlarge the underground visitor center drew such robust public support here that voters approved a 2013 local ballot proposition to finance the restoration with $85 million in sales tax revenue. An additional $250 million was raised in under 36 months from private donations. The balance of the budget was raised from federal and state grants.\u201cIt\u2019s a measure of how this city feels about its global icon,\u201d said Eric Moraczewski, executive director of the Gateway Arch Park Foundation, which led the capital campaign, producing the largest amount in private gifts for a National Park Service unit in history. \u201cThe arch brought us together.\u201dCity planners hope the arch, a symbol of the country\u2019s pioneer spirit, will help reunite its residents.The 630-foot-high arch, designed in 1947 by Eero Saarinen and completed in 1965, is clad in stainless steel and stands at the center of the 91-acre Jefferson National Expansion Memorial. After more than two decades of discussion, planning and design, the restoration is intended to significantly improve access to this city\u2019s reviving downtown, and reverse 12 years of steadily diminishing attendance.A little more than 1.2 people million visited the arch last year, the lowest number since it opened in 1967, according to National Park Service figures. Before the turn of the century, the arch drew as many as four million visitors annually, making it one of the most popular National Park Service attractions.\u201cThe arch, our greatest symbol, was a subpar visitor experience,\u201d said William O. DeWitt III, the president of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team and a member of the Gateway Arch Park Foundation board. \u201cWhen you went to it, you had to weave around traffic and walk around and go down into one of the arch legs to get up into the arch. It didn\u2019t all fit.\u201dTo improve the experience, the central features of the park\u2019s restoration were realigning its entrances, modernizing the visitor center and reducing the inconveniences for pedestrians.The designer, Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, a landscape architecture firm based in Brooklyn, N.Y., executed its assignment in several phases. First, it worked with two other New York firms, Cooper Robertson and James Carpenter Design Associates, to create an expansive glass entrance to the visitor center in the shape of a crescent moon. It also added 46,000 square feet to the facility to include a museum, movie theater, gift shop and cafe.The new entrance has room for visitors to wait in the ticket line out of the elements, a departure from the experience at the old entrance, which was accessible through an outdoor ramp at the foot of the arch. The visitor center construction cost $176.4 million, and the reopening is scheduled for July 4.Second, Valkenburgh Associates lined up the new entrance to face west toward a landscaped pedestrian corridor that extends eight blocks into the central business district. Key features include the Park Over the Highway, a $38.5 million pedestrian plaza that crosses over Interstate 44, as well as Kiener Plaza and Luther Ely Smith Square, both remodeled at a cost of $34.2 million. Before the corridor opened, the interstate blocked the arch from the city for half a century. Now, visitors have a green pathway that extends from the bank of the Mississippi, under the arch and deep into the city center.Other design elements include new walking paths in the arch\u2019s shadow and a 7.5-acre garden and amphitheater that replace a parking deck on the north end of the park. The $17.5 million open space hosts regular outdoor events, among them concerts organized by the Gateway Arch Foundation and the city\u2019s National Blues Museum, which opened just blocks away last year.\u201cThe people who envisioned this, raised the funds, did the planning really hit the spot,\u201d Mr. DeWitt said. \u201cWhen it opens next year, the arch park will be transformative.\u201dThe Gateway Arch park restoration project is a notable pivot point for a city trying to be more attractive to new residents and businesses. The city, founded as a French frontier post in 1764, was the nation\u2019s eighth-largest city when its population peaked in 1950 at nearly 857,000 residents. Since then, it has lost more than 500,000 residents, though the current population, roughly 315,000, has stabilized.City leaders credit that strength to the academic community, which includes Washington University and St. Louis University, as well as nine Fortune 500 companies and an elected leadership determined to bolster the city\u2019s competitiveness. In October, for instance, the Board of Aldermen, the city\u2019s legislative body, voted unanimously to acquire all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2035, joining other cities around the nation committed to that goal.\u201cThe arch restoration represents a lot of where we\u2019ve been as a city and where we want to go,\u201d said Ryan McClure, a spokesman for the Gateway Arch Park Foundation. \u201cWe have a structure that undeniably represents the city to the entire world. But until this project, the arch was separated from the city it represented.\u201dDon Roe, the director of the city\u2019s Planning and Urban Design Agency, said that when the restoration was finished, it would enable St. Louis to market a pedestrian-oriented downtown tourist circuit of history, sports, culture and entertainment. Major hotels are blocks from the Gateway Arch, as are several restaurants and bars. Busch Stadium, the home of the Cardinals, draws almost four million visitors a year and is only a few blocks from the arch.Alongside the stadium is Ballpark Village, a nearly four-year-old, $100 million hub of restaurants, taverns and giant video screens on an indoor plaza that is a joint project between the Cardinals and the Cordish Companies, a Baltimore developer of sports-focused mixed-use developments. Construction of the village\u2019s $260 million second phase is about to start. It includes a 120,000-square-foot office building; a 29-story, 300-unit apartment building; a 220-room hotel; and 50,000 square feet of space for retail, recreation and entertainment that will include a 30,000-square-foot health and fitness center.\u201cA third of the U.S. population lives within a day\u2019s drive of St. Louis,\u201d Mr. Roe said. \u201cOur premise is to get people to come here and to stay an extra day. By doing projects like Ballpark Village and making the improvements to the arch, that is all part of what we are after.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Leader for Central Park", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElizabeth W. Smith grew up in Rye, N.Y., about an hour north of Manhattan, and said her earliest memory of Central Park was from when she moved to the Upper East Side after college. She would go running around the park \u2014 not in the park itself, but on the sidewalks just outside the stone walls that surround it.This was in the mid-1970s. She carried pepper spray.\u201cCentral Park, believe it or not, was a place not to go,\u201d she recalled on Tuesday. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think it was scary, but in retrospect it was a scary place. Actually going to Central Park wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar.\u201dIn time Ms. Smith took a job that put going into the park on her radar \u2014 she was an assistant commissioner of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation when Michael R. Bloomberg was mayor. And on Tuesday, she was named to a job that will put her squarely on the park\u2019s radar, as one of the park\u2019s top stewards, the president and chief executive of the Central Park Conservancy.Ms. Smith, 65, will succeed Douglas Blonsky, who announced in June that he would step down after 32 years with the group, which is largely credited with rescuing the park after decades of neglect. It has been renovated and refurbished, renewing the lawns and meadows envisioned by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who designed it in the 19th century.Mark Levine, the chairman of the City Council Committee on Parks and Recreation, said he was a \u201cbig fan\u201d of Ms. Smith.\u201cI think she understands deeply, because of her involvement with the park and with parks citywide, that Central Park is essential to the health of the city as a whole, and for Central Park to thrive is a major undertaking,\u201d Mr. Levine said. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re trampled by more than 40 million visitors a year\u201d \u2014 more, he noted, than the total for the Magic Kingdom theme park at Disney World in Florida \u2014 \u201cit is a major undertaking.\u201dMs. Smith and Mr. Blonsky, who wears a Central Park baseball cap nearly everywhere he goes, came from different backgrounds \u2014 he was trained in landscape architecture, she in finance, beginning in the training program at what was then Morgan Guaranty Trust.\u201cShe had a lead role in making sure events were fun and safe and the city was reimbursed but that the park was protected in the loading in and loading out,\u201d said Adrian Benepe, who, as the parks commissioner in the Bloomberg administration, was her boss. \u201cShe was capable of getting in high dudgeon if somebody tried to drive a semi truck across the park. Betsy is an unceasingly polite person, but she could get her back up.\u201dUnder Mr. Blonsky, the conservancy raised nearly $1 billion, including $100 million from the Paulson Family Foundation. The conservancy spends about $44 million on the park every year, about 75 percent from donations.She talked about the ways the conservancy has reinvigorated the park. One consequence is that she now runs in the park, usually around 6 a.m.\u201cI feel safe in the park,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Korsnick, the head of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said in a statement.But opponents warned that electricity customers would end up paying for the delays and missteps made by Georgia Power, the lead utility building the two new reactors at the Alvin W. Vogtle generating station near Augusta.Unlike many states, Georgia still tightly regulates its electricity sector. The Georgia Public Service Commission approves plans for new power plants and then adjusts electricity rates to ensure utilities receive a \u201creasonable\u201d return on their investment.Critics said the companies backing the Vogtle project would now stand to make more money than they would have if they had simply completed the reactors on time and under budget.\u201cMost people have to pay for their mistakes, but Georgia Power is still profiting from theirs,\u201d said Kurt Ebersbach, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.The state\u2019s regulators were effectively grappling with the question of sunk costs. Georgia Power\u2019s 2.5 million customers were already facing a 5 percent increase in their utility bills for the construction to date. Finishing the reactors was likely to raise rates another 5 percent. Abandoning them would mean the earlier increase was all for nothing.But the commissioners disagreed, arguing that the state could regret abandoning the Vogtle reactors if gas prices rose over the next few decades.\u201cWe are in a difficult dilemma, no doubt about it,\u201d said Chuck Eaton, one of the commissioners, at the hearing Thursday. But, he added, the first two reactors built at Vogtle in the 1980s also went over budget and \u201care now considered the crown jewels of our fleet.\u201d\u201cThis decision will keep alive our nuclear construction supply chain through some lean years until we have reactor designs that are more appropriate for the current U.S. market,\u201d said Rich Powell, executive director of the ClearPath Foundation, a clean-energy group in Washington.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect title for a member of the Georgia Public Service Commission.

{"Headline": "Walmart Will Let Its 1.4 Million Workers Take Their Pay Before Payday", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, Walmart has taken heat for how it treats its work force, including paying low wages and creating unpredictable schedules. Now, the giant retailer is trying to ease some of its workers\u2019 financial strain, allowing them to receive wages before their next payday.Instead of waiting two weeks between paychecks, Walmart workers can now use an app to access a portion of wages for hours they have already worked.But Walmart\u2019s new service also highlights, albeit unwittingly, the financial struggles of the low-wage workers in the retail and service industries. Even as the economy strengthens, many workers in stores and restaurants are not earning enough to make ends meet.Walmart said the new initiative is intended to help workers avoid costly payday loans and other debt traps, and reduce the stress that comes with financial hardship.Workers who are less worried about cash issues \u201cfeel more confident and more settled at work,\u201d Judith McKenna, Walmart\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview.\u201cWe believe this is the right thing to do, and we are happy to champion it,\u201d Ms. McKenna said.Labor groups say the best investment Walmart could make is not in a new app, but in increasing pay.\u201cIt sounds like this may be a useful service but it doesn\u2019t tackle the fundamental problem Walmart workers suffer,\u201d said Paul Sonn, general counsel of the National Employment Law Project, a labor advocacy group. \u201cTheir paychecks are too small.\u201dThe minimum starting wage at Walmart is $9 an hour, which is $1.75 higher than the federal minimum wage. But it is lower than the starting wage at retailers like Costco, which pays $13 an hour, and Target, which recently raised its entry-level wage to $11 an hour.The average hourly wage for a full-time Walmart worker is $13.85, while the average hourly wage at Costco is about $24.50.Walmart executives say that raising wages alone will not solve the problems many Americans have managing their cash flow. Rather, the company says, the new service is meant to help workers with the broader issues of financial management.The app, called Even, has been used by other employers, but never on such a large scale as Walmart.With the new service, every Walmart employee can obtain a portion of his or her earned wages eight times a year free of charge. For most of the workers, the so-called Instapays will be deducted from their next paycheck. The workers can pay extra if they want more than eight Instapays.Alexis Adderley, who works nights in a Walmart distribution center in Fort Pierce, Fla., has started using the Even app as part of a pilot program.At first she was suspicious, she said, that the app was yet another in a long line of financial products like payday advances and \u201coverdraft protection\u201d that end up driving low-income workers deeper into a hole.But Ms. Adderley, the mother of boys ages 8, 7, 4 and 2, said she had been pleasantly surprised.The app, which connects to her bank account, calculates how much she pays for housing, food and phone bills and tracks when she makes big monthly payments. With that data, Even provides Ms. Adderley a real-time estimate of how much she has to spend before payday.She earns $19.25 an hour, more than the average Walmart employee, and works 30 hours a week. But money is still tight, especially since she was forced to leave her home after Hurricane Irma. Earlier this week, the app warned Ms. Adderley, 30, that she had only enough money to safely spend $9.08 before her next paycheck.\u201cI would love to save more,\u201d she said.These partnerships reflect Walmart\u2019s broader effort to make inroads in Silicon Valley, where the old-line retailer is seeking to acquire talent and ideas to increase its digital heft in its battle with Amazon.Before creating Even, one of the firm\u2019s founders, Jon Schlossberg, had developed an app called Knock, which allows phone users to unlock a Mac computer by knocking on their phone.Idealistic and flush with money from the success of Knock, Mr. Schlossberg said he began studying how a cash shortage affects people\u2019s physical and mental well-being.\u201cIt is a fundamental problem with the capitalistic society,\u201d Mr. Schlossberg said in an interview.Mr. Schlossberg, 30, said he set out to create a product that could reduce the stress associated with money problems, joining a crowd of other so-called fintech start-ups seeking to disrupt the traditional banking model.Walmart pays a small fee to Even to allow workers to withdraw their wages ahead of payday. Workers can take out only a portion of wages that they have already earned during the two-week pay cycle \u2014 so technically, Even says, these are not loans.\u201cYou have earned this money,\u201d said Safwan Shah, founder of PayActiv. \u201cWho decides you should get paid every two weeks?\u201dFor years, consumer advocates and regulators have warned about the dangers of using high-interest loans to pay for unexpected expenses.Walmart workers will not be charged interest if they opt to obtain their wages in advance. But getting paid early, while it may solve an emergency cash shortage, will leave the workers with less money on payday.\u201cIt is still going to be a struggle for most people,\u201d said Alex Horowitz, a senior researcher at the Pew Charitable Trusts who focuses on consumer finance.Matt Fixel, 29, a Walmart worker in Tucson, lives on the financial edge. He works part time earning $10.20 an hour unloading trucks and stocking shelves. When he ran into trouble paying rent one month, he overdrew his bank account, incurring huge fees. Unable to obtain a credit card because \u201chis credit is just shot,\u201d Mr. Fixel pays for services like Hulu with gift cards.\u201cThat app sounds helpful,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Fixel said of the Even service, but added, \u201cI would prefer it if they gave me more hours.\u201dMs. McKenna said Walmart was making a \u201creasonably substantial investment\u201d in paying for the Even service for its employees. The company raised starting wages nearly three years ago, and Ms. McKenna pointed out that Walmart has also increased employee training programs that aim to advance workers into management, where they can earn more.\u201cWe continue to look at investing in our associates,\u201d Ms. McKenna said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Marshall Loeb, Editor Who Shaped Money and Fortune Magazines, Dies at 88", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarshall R. Loeb, a business journalist who turned a floundering Money magazine into one of the nation\u2019s most successful publications in the 1980s and then led a similar revival at Fortune, died on Saturday in Manhattan. He was 88.His daughter, Margaret Karen Loeb, said the cause was Parkinson\u2019s disease.On retiring as Fortune\u2019s managing editor in 1994, Mr. Loeb was hailed in The New York Times as \u201cone of the most visible and influential editors in the magazine industry.\u201dHe joined Money in 1980 as managing editor, the magazine\u2019s top editorial post, after 14 years at Time magazine. Inheriting a magazine that was barely profitable, Mr. Loeb set about expanding its coverage of personal finance, among other things.\u201cLoeb wanted to make investing and spending money fun at a time when a lot of young people were having fun making a lot of money, but not necessarily knowing what to do with it,\u201d Folio\u2019s Publishing News said in 1991. \u201cHe created a voyeuristic publication that enabled readers to peek into the finances of their neighbors.\u2019\u2019According to that 1991 article, Circulation soon climbed to 1.4 million in 1984, from 825,000 in 1980, making Money the fastest-growing magazine in the country.Fortune recruited Mr. Loeb in 1986, and under his watch the magazine became must reading in executive suites and among those who aspired to occupy them. Mr. Loeb is credited with reviving the magazine\u2019s profitability and expanding its traditionally tight focus on corporate management and the economy to embrace broader topics, like executive life, and social issues, like homelessness and public education.Mr. Loeb expanded his reach through radio and television. While running Money\u2019s editorial division, he took over as host of \u201cYour Dollars,\u201d a daily two-minute CBS Radio feature broadcast nationally.He subsequently began broadcasting \u201cYour Money Minute\u201d for the radio network; a weekly five-minute segment for CBS television; and a 30-second segment, \u201cMoney Tips,\u201d for WABC-TV in New York.In 2012, David Callaway, then editor in chief of MarketWatch, an online financial service (he is now chief executive of The Street, the business news and financial services website), called Mr. Loeb \u201cthe father of modern business journalism.\u201dMr. Loeb died at his son\u2019s home.After leaving Time Inc. at 65, he edited The Columbia Journalism Review, wrote a nationally syndicated personal finance column, continued to broadcast daily financial advice on CBS Radio and was briefly the host of the PBS television program \u201cWall Street Week.\u201dMarshall Robert Loeb was born on May 30, 1929, in Chicago and grew up on what he called the \u201cscruffy\u201d West Side of the city \u2014 yearning, by his account, to break free of its confines.His father, Monroe Harriman Loeb, owned a wrecking and salvage company in Chicago. His mother, the former Henrietta Benjamin, was a milliner and a teacher.As a young man, Marshall came to see reporters for Chicago\u2019s major newspapers as \u201cheroic\u201d figures whom he said he wanted to emulate, in part to see the world.He earned a journalism degree at the University of Missouri. (He later said he always regretted that he never studied accounting.) After graduation, \u201cwanting to find out what made Nazi Germany possible,\u201d he said, he went to Germany and worked at an international student house in Goettingen before landing a job as a correspondent for United Press in Frankfurt.There he met Irmingard Loewe (known as Peggy), a German-French stewardess for Pan American World Airways. They married in 1954. After they moved to the United States, he was hired by The St. Louis Globe-Democrat. But that job did not to satisfy his ambitions.\u201cI wanted to be sure that what I wrote would be printed or broadcast beyond the place where I was sitting,\u201d he said in a 2009 interview, and he decided he needed to go to New York or Washington \u201cto get that global reach.\u201dNew York it was, after Time hired him. He went on to flourish there as business editor, national editor and economics editor, writing or editing scores of Time cover stories, including one of 8,000 words on J. Paul Getty, billed as the first billionaire. (\u201cThere wasn\u2019t that much back then in terms of long-form business journalism,\u201d he recalled in the 2013 interview.)Over his career he interviewed presidents and covered the space program and a dozen national political conventions, he said. But he considered his work at Fortune to have been his most satisfying.He expanded Fortune\u2019s use of graphs, charts, lists and tables while continuing the magazine\u2019s tradition of deeply researched articles and its fierce circulation and advertising rivalry with Forbes magazine. He also commissioned a profile of Warren Buffett, a little-known investor at the time, helping to lift him to prominence.In 1964 he and William Safire wrote \u201cPlunging Into Politics,\u201d which recommended that neophytes begin a political career by working on campaigns at the precinct level. (Mr. Safire went to become a columnist for The New York Times.) His book \u201cMarshall Loeb\u2019s Lifetime Financial Strategies\u201d was published in 1996.Besides his daughter and son, Mr. Loeb is survived by six grandchildren. His wife died in 2010.Among his honors were two Gerald Loeb Awards for financial journalism, named for a Wall Street executive who was no relation. One of those awards was for lifetime achievement.Hannah Wulkan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Tuition-Free College Turned Into a Casualty of the Tax Wars", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe median family income of a Berea family is $29,000.But a last-ditch effort by Mr. Sanders and Senate Democrats to embarrass Republicans \u2014 or at least delay final passage of the tax bill \u2014 rendered Berea collateral damage in the partisan wars in Washington. A provision in the tax bill, introduced by Kentucky\u2019s senior senator, Mitch McConnell, would have exempted Berea from a 1.4 percent excise tax that will be imposed on the nation\u2019s wealthiest colleges.Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, added language to distinguish that only an institution with at least 500 \u201ctuition paying\u201d students would be subject to the tax, effectively shielding little Berea from a Republican-designed tax aimed at the wealthy Ivy Leagues.Mr. Sanders, as the ranking member of the Budget Committee, challenged the provision as a clear carve-out for an institution from Mr. McConnell\u2019s home state. The Senate parliamentarian agreed, ruling that the language violated Senate budget rules that prohibit \u201cextraneous matters\u201d and policymaking on bills that use a special procedure to avoid filibusters.\u201cIn the mad dash to provide tax breaks for their billionaire campaign contributors, our Republican colleagues forgot to comply with the rules of the Senate,\u201d Mr. Sanders and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said in a joint statement.By Wednesday morning, Berea\u2019s president, Lyle Roelofs, was fielding calls from apologetic politicians. Republican leaders assured him that he still had their support. Democratic leaders told him the move was not personal.But Mr. Roelofs said it will be personal for students whose education can no longer be funded.\u201cWe\u2019re a casualty of polarized decision making in the Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think the federal government supports what we do, but we aren\u2019t particularly pleased that they\u2019re making it harder for us to do it.\u201dThe goal of the excise tax was to prompt universities like Harvard and Yale to channel more of their huge endowments into financial aid and lower tuition. But that is not an issue at Berea. The school\u2019s $1.2 billion endowment funds between 70 and 80 percent of the school\u2019s budget, and the four-year scholarships of its 1,600 students. Berea\u2019s tuition is valued at around $38,000 a year, and its endowment pays about $35,000 for each of its students.The new tax will apply to institutions with endowments valued at $500,000 per student; Berea\u2019s is $700,000.A 1 percent decrease in revenue each year would shave off the number of students that the school is able to fund, Mr. Roelofs said. The school already can accept only 20 percent of its applicants.\u201cWe think of Berea as consisting of 1,600 stories of transformation for students who may not have had the opportunity to join the middle class,\u201d Mr. Roelofs said. \u201cThat would mean 16 out of those 1,600 stories aren\u2019t going to happen \u2014 kids who come out of the mountains or the urban centers of Appalachia who we just can\u2019t serve.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. McConnell said he was \u201cmystified\u201d by the Democrats\u2019 challenge to the provision.\u201cDemocrats\u2019 fanatical opposition to the tax bill reached such hysterical heights that Bernie Sanders proudly led the charge to deliberately harm Berea College, which offers free tuition to less fortunate families,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.Mr. Sanders said in a statement that Mr. McConnell knew that a policy change targeted at benefiting one institution would be problematic.Mr. Sanders also said that he was \u201cglad that Senator McConnell has suddenly developed an interest in making college affordable for working-class families,\u201d and that Mr. McConnell should consider co-sponsoring Mr. Sanders\u2019s legislation making all public colleges and universities tuition-free.\u201cThe truth is that while Berea College is an excellent school, there are colleges all over this country that use their endowment funds to provide free or significantly reduced tuition for lower-income students,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Higher education and policy experts said that the Berea dispute was a small part of the broader concerns they have about the tax bill.\u201cWe have already believed that when you took a bad idea and hasty process, you\u2019re going to create problems, and I think this is pretty good illustration of what can happen,\u201d said Terry W.

At Berea, students work a minimum of 10 hours a week, on the college\u2019s farm and forest, as janitors and teaching assistants, or designing art and artifacts that are sold nationwide.\u201cThey all have a stake,\u201d Mr. Roelofs said. \u201cThey have an investment even though they\u2019re not writing a big check to the college every year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tax Bills Could Expand Private School Benefits and Hurt Public Education", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Friday night turned into Saturday morning, Vice President Mike Pence cast a tiebreaking vote in the Senate to extend a tax benefit available for higher education to families paying tuition for private elementary and secondary education \u2014 or even homeschooling their children.The vote on the amendment by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, was emblematic of the sweeping tax bills entering final negotiations between House and Senate Republicans. Provisions in both measures could change families\u2019 approach to elementary and secondary education, and every type of school stands to benefit except those attended by 90 percent of the nation\u2019s students \u2014 public schools.Under the House and Senate bills, families who can afford to put money away for private or sectarian schools each month would be able to watch their savings earn interest and capital gains free of taxation. In the Senate bill, even home schoolers could withdraw up to $10,000 a year for school expenses in their own living room \u2014 from tax-favored savings accounts.By contrast, the drastic curtailing of state and local tax deductions in both bills could hamstring local governments\u2019 efforts to finance their public schools. State, county and city governments have always struggled to raise taxes or pass bond measures for schools, but were able to argue that increases in sales or income tax rates could be deducted from federal income taxes. In the House and Senate bills, the state and local tax deduction would be reduced to a deduction of up to $10,000 of property taxes each year and nothing else.\u201cWe have provisions that are incentivizing parents to keep students in private schools or send them to private schools,\u201d said Sasha Pudelski, assistant director for policy and advocacy at the American Association of School Administrators. \u201cIf there\u2019s going to be tax breaks in the bill, giving it to the parents in the private education system over the public education system doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dHow generous the new tax preference for private education would be is subject to debate. As with current 529 plans, contributions would not be tax deductible, but interest and capital gains would not be taxed. Withdrawing funds for elementary school would not give families much time to see their investments grow tax-free. That alone has divided advocates of school choice.\u201cAs currently structured, 529 plans are not designed to deliver significant benefits to poor families in college,\u201d wrote Nat Malkus of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cGiving families flexibility to spend those funds sooner does nothing to address their capacity to save; it only minimizes the potential benefits.\u201dBut that assumes that those working-class families have money to save, and many do not.\u201cThe opinion ranges from being marginally helpful, to a nothingburger, to being harmful because it plays into the narrative that school choice is about helping rich people,\u201d said Michael J. Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, which favors government-funded vouchers for private school tuition. \u201cAre there people out there who cannot afford school choice and will now be able to? No.\u201dBut other conservative groups, like the Heritage Foundation, which began advocating the expansion of 529 plans in 2012, praised the amendment. Lindsey M. Burke, director of the foundation\u2019s Center for Education Policy, said that when more families learned that anyone could contribute to the savings plans, they would become more popular at all income levels.Ms. Burke disagreed with public school advocates that the 529 expansions would hurt public schools by incentivizing families to leave them.\u201cIf their district-assigned school is a good fit, they have nothing to worry about,\u201d she said.For homeschoolers, the Cruz amendment was a cause for celebration. For years, homeschool advocates have denounced what they called a \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d tax code. Not only were 529s limited to just college costs, but existing K-12 expense accounts, called Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, are recognized for homeschools only in a handful of states where they can win designations as private schools. Coverdell contributions are limited to $2,000 a year, while contributions to 529 accounts can reach $14,000 a year without incurring gift taxes.Mr. Estrada said that since the Trump administration took office, the organization had been working behind the scenes with the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and Ivanka Trump\u2019s staff to have the nearly two million students in home schools recognized. Homeschooling families spend about $500 to $600 a year on average on instructional materials like books, Mr. Estrada said.\u201cWe want to be treated fairly,\u201d he said.For public school advocates, the 529 expansion was just the latest in a series of decisions they said illustrated the Trump administration\u2019s disinvestment in public education.\u201cIt\u2019s just icing on the cake,\u201d Ms. Pudelski said. \u201cIt seems they\u2019re just asking how many different ways can we not support public schools.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With a staff of seven and a budget of about $350,000, the group has made itself a formidable influence on city policy.Mr. Williams now lives in his native Baltimore where he still advocates for the homeless. Mr. Haggins died in 2003.On Tuesday, the New York City Council approved legislation that requires Department of Housing Preservation and Development to report its inventory of all vacant buildings and lots that could be used for affordable housing. Another piece of legislation requires the city to take a census of vacant properties zoned as residential every five years.Picture the Homeless has also criticized the cluster program since its inception in 2000 as a stopgap to opening traditional shelters. The private apartments are expensive and often owned by neglectful landlords, and Picture the Homeless has urged the city to use the stronger tactic of eminent domain.While the successes this month affirm that the organization is being heard, the group will remain scrappy, Ms. George said. \u201cWe spent a lot of years kicking tail to be at the table. You cannot make decisions without talking directly to people who are affected,\u201d said Ms. George, who was briefly homeless as a teenager. \u201cWe\u2019re at the table.

{"Headline": "Passing Through to Corruption", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnless something drastic happens, this will be the week Republicans ram through a tax cut that adds more than a trillion dollars to federal debt while undermining health care for millions. They will do so by violating all previous norms for major legislation, having held not a single hearing and rushed to a vote before the new senator from Alabama could be seated.The question is, why are they doing this? For this bill isn\u2019t just a policy crime; it also seems to be a political mistake. It will, however, be good, one way or another, for the bank accounts of quite a few Republican members of Congress. Is that why it will pass?Nevertheless, Republicans have persisted. Why?Another answer may be that Republicans believe that legislative victories put \u201cpoints on the board,\u201d helping their electoral prospects, even if the bills are unpopular. Obama officials thought the same thing back in 2009 \u2014 but they were wrong: Major legislative victories on economic stimulus, health care and financial reform did nothing to stop disastrous losses in the 2010 midterm elections.The final, and most disturbing, possible explanation for the behavior of Republican legislators is that they\u2019re supporting legislation, knowing that it\u2019s bad for both the country and their party, because it\u2019s good for them personally.And when it comes to the Senate, bear in mind that many senators are personally wealthy, meaning that they might be swayed by policies that enhance their personal fortunes.

{"Headline": "Republican Tax Bill in Final Sprint Across Finish Line", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The day after suffering a political blow in the Alabama special Senate election, congressional Republicans sped forward with the most sweeping tax rewrite in decades, announcing an agreement on a final bill that would cut taxes for businesses and individuals and signal the party\u2019s first major legislative achievement since assuming political control this year.Party leaders in the House and Senate agreed in principle to bridge the yawning gaps between their competing versions of the $1.5 trillion tax bill, keeping Republicans on track for final votes next week with the aim of delivering a bill to President Trump\u2019s desk by Christmas. The House and Senate versions of the tax bill started from the same core principles \u2014 sharply cutting taxes on businesses, while reducing rates and eliminating some breaks for individuals \u2014 but diverged on several crucial details.In the end, more of the Senate bill appeared to be included in the final version, though lawmakers continued to make significant changes from the legislation that passed either the House or the Senate.The changes included a slightly higher corporate tax rate of 21 percent, rather than the 20 percent in the legislation that passed both chambers, and a lower top individual tax rate of 37 percent for the wealthiest Americans, who currently pay 39.6 percent. But the bill will still scale back some popular tax breaks, including the state and local tax deduction and the deductibility of mortgage interest.In a break from the House bill, the agreement would allow taxpayers to continue to deduct high out-of-pocket medical expenses, and it would retain a provision allowing graduate students who receive tuition waivers to avoid paying taxes on that benefit. Also included in the consensus bill is the Senate\u2019s repeal of the Affordable Care Act requirement that most Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty and a provision that opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to energy exploration.Still unclear is the overall cost of the revised legislation, which cannot exceed the $1.5 trillion bucket that lawmakers have allowed if they want to pass the bill without Democratic support. Several of the provisions added by the Senate to help pay for the overall bill were either reversed or scaled back in the consensus version, and some tax breaks eliminated by the House were added back in.The announcement that Republicans had overcome their differences to get to a consensus bill added more momentum to the sprint to the finish line. Republicans dismissed requests by Democrats to delay a vote until the new senator from Alabama, Doug Jones, is sworn in.\u201cI see no need to wait for Doug Jones to become a senator,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. \u201cWe vote all the time in lame-duck sessions with retired and defeated members casting votes.\u201dSenator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip, told reporters that he was confident the final bill would be approved next week. The leaders of the tax-writing committees in the House and the Senate, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, each proclaimed a bill \u201cclose\u201d to completion.In a compromise between the bills, the deal would cap the popular deduction for interest on mortgage debt at $750,000 for newly purchased homes, a higher cap than the $500,000 limit in the House-passed bill but lower than the $1 million limit that currently exists and remains in the Senate-passed bill.The agreement would cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, which is lower than the current 35 percent rate but higher than the 20 percent that Mr. Trump had, until recently, said was nonnegotiable. The corporate rate would take effect in 2018, rather than 2019, as the Senate bill originally called for, according to a senior Republican congressional aide.The bill also allows individuals to somewhat choose how to use their state and local tax deduction, giving them the ability to write off up to $10,000 in property taxes, income or sales taxes paid or a combination of property and sales or property and income taxes. That move is intended to alleviate the concerns of House Republicans, particularly those from California, over the bill\u2019s treatment of the state and local tax deduction.Lawmakers also yielded to concerns by business groups about the Senate\u2019s last-minute inclusion of the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was added as a way to pay for the bill but faced stiff blowback from companies that said it would restrict their ability to use the research and development tax credit.In an effort to assuage concerns that wealthy individuals would face a potential tax increase, the top individual income tax rate will drop to 37 percent, down from the current rate of 39.6 percent in the Senate bill and the 38.5 percent in the House bill. And the lower rate will apply to more people, allowing those with income levels below the $1 million cutoff outlined in both the House and Senate bills to claim the marginal rate.The consensus bill will preserve the individual alternative minimum tax, which the House bill had eliminated and the Senate bill retained in a watered-down form. But it will apply to even fewer taxpayers than the Senate bill would have, the congressional aide said. The alternative tax, which was put in place to ensure high-income earners did not exploit loopholes to avoid paying taxes, would kick in for individuals earning at least $500,000 and for couples earning at least $1 million.The agreement may allow some high-earning business owners to claim an even larger tax break than the Senate bill would have. Negotiators agreed to keep the Senate\u2019s approach to provide a tax deduction for so-called pass-through companies, whose owners pay taxes on profits through the individual code. That deduction is likely to be lower than the 23 percent deduction in the Senate-passed bill.But, the aide said, the consensus bill will include a House provision that would allow some pass-through owners with few employees \u2014 but large amounts of investment in their businesses \u2014 to bypass a limit on how much income qualifies for the preferential deduction.The consensus bill would also largely retain the Senate approach to taxing multinational companies, by levying what is effectively a minimum tax on both American-based and foreign-based companies that operate in the United States.Mr. Trump praised House and Senate negotiators in a lunch meeting at the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re very close to getting it done; we\u2019re very close to voting,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the tax bill.It is not clear whether all Republican senators will roundly endorse the deal, which includes provisions that Ms. Collins and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida had raised concerns about this week. Ms. Collins has said she does not favor a lower individual rate, and Mr. Rubio has pushed for a more generous child tax credit.Republicans have resolved the differences between the two versions of their tax bill.Still, none of those concerned senators indicated on Wednesday that they were opposed to the bill taking shape under the agreement in principle, an encouraging sign for Republican leaders.The Senate bill narrowly passed 51 to 49, with Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, voting against the legislation, and other lawmakers, like Ms. Collins, getting on board only once certain changes, including expanding the medical expense deduction, were made. Mr. Corker said on Wednesday that \u201cnothing has alleviated the concerns\u201d that caused him to oppose the bill, which were rooted in a desire not to add further to the national debt.The agreement was completed on Wednesday morning, hours before the first and only scheduled public meeting of the congressional conference committee formed to work out the differences between the House- and Senate-passed versions of the bill.\u201cLet\u2019s understand what\u2019s happening today is a sham,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cNobody ought to mistake this conference for real debate.\u201d\u201cAs a candidate, I promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday working American families who are the backbone and the heartbeat of our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNow we are just days away from keeping that promise. We want to give you, the American people, a giant tax cut for Christmas.\u201dMr. Trump added that if the bill were to be signed in that time frame, Americans would begin seeing tax cuts reflected in their paychecks by February, citing the Internal Revenue Service. \u201cThe cynical voices that opposed tax cuts grow smaller and weaker, and the American people grow stronger,\u201d he said.Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to one provision of the tax proposal. The agreement would retain a provision allowing graduate students who receive tuition waivers to avoid paying taxes on that benefit. It does not apply to tuition stipends.Michael Tackett contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Campaign to Drive Out Migrants Slams Beijing\u2019s Best and Brightest", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 With coding skills, a foreign degree, fluent English and an apartment barely big enough for his espresso maker and two cats, Si Ruomu thought he was the kind of go-getting young tech worker that Beijing needs to thrive in the 21st century.That was before the police arrived at his apartment building and ordered him and hundreds of others to vacate within 48 hours. Like most of his fellow tenants, Mr. Si had come from elsewhere in China to find work in the capital, which often treats migrants virtually as second-class citizens.\u201cOne minute you\u2019re drinking espressos, the next you\u2019re being evicted,\u201d said Mr. Si, 28, a bespectacled programmer who grew up in northern China and studied computer science in New Zealand. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think whether people like me have a future in Beijing.\u201dBeijing is a cultural, technological and commercial capital as well as a political one, and the tenements on its outskirts are home to tens of thousands of hopeful young college graduates who have moved here seeking better jobs and better lives.These job seekers are treated as migrants in their own capital, because China\u2019s biggest cities are fortresses of official privilege, especially Beijing. The government gives inhabitants who hold permanent residence papers, called hukou, more generous access to housing, schools and health care. But migrants must pay more for many services, and many live on the edges of Beijing, where rents are lower.Now whole swaths of these neighborhoods have been emptied out and in many cases reduced to rubble as the authorities condemn buildings as unsafe or illegal and order migrants to leave.That has ignited debate about how Beijing can function without the blue-collar migrants who serve as its cooks, cleaners and vendors, but there are also worries the campaign might harm the city\u2019s fast-growing tech sector, which employs armies of migrants who work for relatively low pay.When the authorities arrive with eviction orders, many migrants search for newer, safer homes even further from the city center. Others say they may abandon Beijing to find work elsewhere.\u201cThis will certainly change my impression of this city. I don\u2019t really want to stay in Beijing,\u201d said Zhang Mi, 25, a web application developer from Hebei, the province surrounding the capital, as he crammed his bags into a van after being evicted.\u201cTo young tech workers like me, there\u2019s really no option \u2014 only the big cities like Beijing have more opportunities,\u201d said Hu Xianyu, 22, an intern at Baidu, the internet search giant, who moved to Beijing from the northern province of Shanxi and was forced out of his apartment last month.\u201cTech workers for the bigger companies can get help from them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for those working for small companies or start-ups, the evictions can be disastrous.\u201dMigrant workers have often reacted to the eviction orders with angry resignation. But small confrontations have flared up, and the largest and most organized protest broke out on Sunday, when hundreds of people in a neighborhood in northeast Beijing scheduled for clearance gathered and chanted \u201cviolent evictions violate human rights.\u201dLast month, five delivery companies warned of delivery delays following the expulsions.Gan Wei, secretary-general of the China Electronic Commerce Logistics Industry Alliance, said the companies represented by her group would have to raise delivery prices in Beijing by about 20 percent.\u201cWhy is takeout food so cheap in Beijing? Because of all the cheap labor from the countryside,\u201d said Jia Dayong, 43, a stringy courier from the northwestern province of Shaanxi who was being expelled from Banjieta Village, a migrant neighborhood in northern Beijing.\u201cNobody cares whether we have a place to live,\u201d he said.\u201cIf they keep clearing out like this, Beijing will suffer a drought of employees next year,\u201d said Wang Le, 29, a hotel manager from the eastern province of Jiangsu.She was one of about 100 tenants \u2014 most of whom worked in finance, technology and hospitality \u2014 living in steel shipping containers that had been converted into small, brightly painted apartments. They were being torn down on government orders.In an attempt to slow the influx of job seekers, Beijing has cut the numbers of university graduates from other parts of China receiving the hukou permits that confer privileged status and benefits. But they have kept coming.Without permanent residency, they are forced to live precariously. Trying to save money, many find cheap apartments in the same run-down neighborhoods as migrants working menial jobs.\u201cEven if the industry I\u2019m in is very high-level, as far as the government is concerned, I\u2019m also a peasant worker, a migrant worker,\u201d said Zhang Xingwang, 24, who studied automation in college and came to Beijing from Hebei Province seeking work as a software programmer.He had to find new housing after his old apartment near where the deadly fire broke out last month was demolished. \u201cI thought Beijing would be relatively fair and tolerant, and the government would behave better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after this happened \u2026\u201dChina\u2019s big tech firms have refrained from criticizing the migrant crackdown, perhaps out of fear of angering the government. Alibaba, the online commerce giant, said the overall impact on its business \u201chasn\u2019t been significant.\u201dBut some experts have warned that by choking off the flow of migrants, Beijing risks losing entrepreneurial energy.Even before the recent expulsions, Yin Deting, a demographer who advises the Beijing city government, warned that heavy-handed clearances of migrants would accelerate the aging of the city\u2019s work force.\u201cIf we place our hopes for reducing the population just in demolishing illegal buildings and low-grade markets, the actual outcomes may well be contrary to what is hoped for,\u201d Mr. Yin wrote earlier this year.Mr. Si, the programmer who studied in New Zealand, eventually found a place to stay on the eastern edge of Beijing where he could keep his cats.

{"Headline": "Tawdry Tales Depict a Texas Congressman\u2019s Frat House on the Hill", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Lauren Greene, a former communications director for Representative Blake Farenthold, sued him claiming sexual harassment, among her complaints was that he \u201cdisclosed that a female lobbyist had propositioned him for \u2018a threesome.\u2019\u201dMr. Farenthold, in legal documents, said that Ms. Greene had it wrong. The woman wasn\u2019t a lobbyist, he said.As allegations of sexual misconduct rock Capitol Hill \u2014 three lawmakers announced their resignations last week alone \u2014 Mr. Farenthold, Republican of Texas, stands out as the survivor. He was sued over accusations of sexual harassment three years ago, paid out an $84,000 settlement, financed by taxpayers, and has an open Ethics Committee investigation into his behavior. Yet only a few Republicans have called for his resignation.Throughout the Capitol, House aides have described office cultures where sexually explicit conversations are routine, pickup lines are part of daily life, hiring can be based on looks, tolerance is expected and intolerance of such behavior is career-ending. In Mr. Farenthold\u2019s case, legal documents and interviews with former aides suggest an atmosphere in which the congressman set the tone for off-color jokes and inappropriate banter, which flourished among his underlings.So far, Republicans are mostly standing by Mr. Farenthold; his backers, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, cite a 2015 decision by the Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent, nonpartisan board that cleared Mr. Farenthold of wrongdoing.But the congressman\u2019s status changed sharply last week, when the House Ethics Committee announced that it was forming an investigative subcommittee to examine Ms. Greene\u2019s allegations. Ms. Greene, who won the $84,000 settlement, is said to be cooperating. Mr. Farenthold has promised to repay the Treasury and insists his conduct has been proper.\u201cI\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d he said in a brief interview last week. \u201cI\u2019m happy to visit with anybody who has a concern and explain the facts to the extent that I am allowed to under the settlement agreement.\u201dDetails of Ms. Greene\u2019s allegations have been known for several years, ever since she filed suit against Mr. Farenthold in 2014; she said, among other things, that Mr. Farenthold told another aide he was having \u201csexual fantasies\u201d about her and that she was fired after she complained.But she was not the only Farenthold aide to find fault with the office environment; in 2016, two additional aides complained \u2014 prompting the congressman to hire an independent law firm to investigate, a spokeswoman for Mr. Farenthold, Stacey Daniels, confirmed in a statement.The review found no evidence of \u201cgender bias\u201d or \u201cinappropriate sexualized comments,\u201d Ms. Daniels said, adding that all staff members, including Mr. Farenthold, later \u201ctook sensitivity and anti-harassment training to ensure full compliance with office policy and the law.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Peace said \u201cthe behavior never changed,\u201d which was partly why she decided to quit in March. \u201cThere were a lot of inappropriate things that happened in that office that I don\u2019t think would have happened if the congressman hadn\u2019t already set the tone,\u201d she said.Ms. Peace and another former aide to Mr. Farenthold, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of harming that aide\u2019s reputation, described an atmosphere in his Washington office that was freewheeling, yet also filled with anxiety.A list of men who have resigned, been fired or otherwise lost power since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke.The congressman, they said, was volatile. When he was angry, they added, Mr. Farenthold would berate them, sometimes sweeping his arm across his desk, knocking its contents to the floor, and threatening to fire people. Ms. Daniels, who has worked for Mr. Farenthold since March, said she had never witnessed such behavior, adding, \u201cAll the staff get along here very well.\u201dThe refrigerator in the \u201cbullpen\u201d \u2014 the open area where aides worked \u2014 was filled with beer, and sometimes happy hour would begin at 4:30 p.m., which his aides called \u201cbeer-thirty.\u201d Ms. Peace said women would discuss which male lobbyists had texted them pictures of their genitals, and both men and women would talk about strip clubs and whether certain Fox News anchors had breast implants.\u201cThere were numerous lewd comments that were made either about female reporters\u2019 breast size, or other reporters\u2019 breast size as well as female lobbyists and their appearance that would go on,\u201d the other former aide said. \u201cOn any given week you were prone to either ridicule, rude comments, acts of aggression or rage.\u201dIn the office, the congressman was known to like redheads. In her complaint, Ms. Greene said Mr. Farenthold \u201cregularly drank to excess, and because of his tendency to flirt, the staffers who accompanied him to Capitol Hill functions would joke that they had to be on \u2018redhead patrol\u2019 to keep him out of trouble.\u201dIn their response, lawyers for Mr. Farenthold acknowledged that \u201csome staff occasionally joked that Rep. Farenthold finds redheads attractive.\u201d But they said he denied the rest of that allegation, including \u201cthe implication that this was a source for, or cause of, concern for any staffer.\u201dExperts in civil rights and employment law say that the culture of any office or organization is set from the top and that sexual harassment may be more prevalent in workplaces in which there is anger and infighting among employees.\u201cIf you are trying to create a workplace where sexual harassment and other sorts of unlawful harassment don\u2019t happen, you really need to be thinking about workplace culture more broadly and about civility and respect,\u201d said Emily Martin, the general counsel for the National Women\u2019s Law Center here.Kristin Nicholson, who spent 20 years as a House aide and now directs the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, said that every office on Capitol Hill reflected the personality of the lawmaker and the chief of staff.\u201cAnecdotally we all know that there are offices out there that are really toxic or unpleasant to work in, whether it\u2019s sexual stuff or the way that staff is treated,\u201d Ms. Nicholson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the norm, but it\u2019s certainly not unusual for staffers to be subjected to inappropriate comments or sexist remarks.\u201dHe won the election, ousting Representative Solomon P. Ortiz, then an incumbent Democrat who had served for more than two decades, by less than one percentage point. The Republican-controlled legislature then redrew the district lines, making the district much more conservative. He is now serving his fourth term.In 2014, the same year in which Ms. Greene sued him, Mr. Farenthold announced that he would be giving up an internet domain name \u2014 one that describes a sexually explicit act \u2014 that he had held since 1999, when he was in the business of buying such names on speculation and selling them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Robert G. Wilmers, Bank Chief and Buffalo Philanthropist, Dies at 83", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert G. Wilmers, who had led the Northeast regional bank M&T as its chief executive since 1983, steering it through the 2008 financial crisis without so much as reducing its stock dividend, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83.An M&T spokesman confirmed the death but did not give a cause.As the country\u2019s largest banks sought government bailouts at the height of the crisis while hundreds of smaller institutions failed, M&T glided through the turmoil unscathed, an achievement Mr. Wilmers\u2019s industry peers attributed to his conservative management style.He never involved the bank in speculative trading and made a point to know his customers, running M&T as though it were a much smaller institution.By buying up smaller banks, Mr. Wilmers eventually expanded M&T to nearly 800 branches in locations as far from Buffalo as Baltimore and Washington.\u201cWhile M&T Bank is in no way a community bank by any reasonable definition, its chairman, Bob Wilmers, thought and acted like a community banker,\u201d Camden Fine, the head of a Washington trade group representing the nation\u2019s smallest banks, said in an email.To build up M&T, Mr. Wilmers, who was not a native of Buffalo and commuted there from Manhattan, cultivated local connections. Soon after buying his first shares of the bank in 1980, he befriended the publisher of The Buffalo News, which is owned by the investor Warren E. Buffett. That relationship led Mr. Wilmers to Mr. Buffett, who invested in M&T soon after.To stay in touch with customers, Mr. Wilmers hosted regular dinners for them, inviting 50 to 60 at a time and appearing at each one to mingle. The last dinner was on Dec. 5.Brent Baird, a Buffalo investor who became an outside director at M&T, said that while Mr. Wilmers was worried at first about being seen as a carpetbagger trying to do business in an unfamiliar place, he worked his way to prominence in Buffalo through philanthropy and community development efforts.\u201cHe became sort of more Buffalo than a lot of the rest of us,\u201d Mr. Baird said in a telephone interview.But despite his prominence in Buffalo, New York City was Mr. Wilmers\u2019s real home base. He flew to Buffalo on Monday mornings after breakfast, then home again on Wednesday nights for dinner with his family at his Central Park West apartment, his son Christopher said.In 2016, Mr. Wilmers and three other investors bought a group of small New England newspapers, including The Berkshire Eagle.Robert George Wilmers was born in New York City on April 20, 1934, to Charles Wilmers and the former Cecilia Eitington. He spent his childhood in New York and Belgium, where his father was an executive of the utility Sofina. He graduated from Harvard University and attended Harvard Business School but did not receive a degree there.Early in his career, Mr. Wilmers worked as an officer at the Bankers Trust Company. He campaigned for John V. Lindsay in his successful race for mayor of New York City in 1965 and later served as the mayor\u2019s deputy director of finance and his acting finance administrator.After leaving City Hall, Mr. Wilmers became a vice president of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, a predecessor of JPMorgan Chase. While he was chief executive at M&T, he was also chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation under Gov. David A. Paterson.His death elicited tributes from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, who said in a statement, \u201cThere have been very few men who have done as much for Buffalo, since its founding hundreds of years ago, as Bob Wilmers.\u201dIn addition to his son Christopher, Mr. Wilmers is survived by his wife, Elisabeth Roche Wilmers; four stepchildren, Camille de Wouters, Guillaume de Wouters, Juliette Chevalier and Charlotte de Coupigny; a sister, Mary-Kay Wilmers, the editor of The London Review of Books; two grandchildren; and 11 step-grandchildren. Another son, Robert Jr., died in 1993. His marriage to Gertrude de Gersdorff ended in divorce.In a telephone interview, Christopher Wilmers, a wildlife ecologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said his father had regularly visited him on research trips to remote places, even when conditions were tough.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t always necessarily his thing,\u201d the younger Mr. Wilmers said, \u201cbut he never complained.\u201d Once, he said, his father flew to Alaska to spend a week with him and a friend in a remote cabin. It rained most of the time; the three men passed the time playing the card game hearts. The elder Mr. Wilmers\u2019s strategy was more conservative than his son\u2019s.\u201cNothing fancy,\u201d Christopher Wilmers said, \u201cbut in the long run he ends up doing better than anybody else.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary, using information from M&T Bank, omitted the name of a survivor. In addition to those named, Mr. Wilmers is survived by his sister, Mary-Kay Wilmers, the editor of The London Review of Books.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Resort-Style Living for Graying Boomers", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by16 PhotosDeveloped as a place to raise a family, Long Island \u2014 like many other suburban areas that grew and thrived in post-World War II America \u2014 is graying.While new communities on the island were built for baby boomers back when they were babies, the latest wave of new development \u2014 country club-style living in communities for people 55 and older \u2014 hopes to help ease them into their retirement years and beyond.Prices at the gated community range from $650,000 to $1.3 million. In less than a year, 215 out of 230 units in the first phase sold off floor plans and computer renderings before construction had even started, said Steven Dubb, a principal. The 80-acre property includes an adjacent shopping center, an amenity-laden clubhouse, two heated pools, tennis courts and a walking trail.Just don\u2019t call it a retirement community. \u201cPeople are going there to feel young and act young,\u201d Mr. Dubb said.If you stay in the neighborhood where you raised your children, he said, \u201cyoung people move in and you are the old people next door.\u201d By contrast, in these new age-restricted developments, \u201cyou are not the old people next door \u2014 everybody is running around with an iPhone full of pictures of their grandchildren.\u201dAge is not a protected class under the Fair Housing Act, and most municipalities allow exclusive communities for older adults because of the recognized need for senior housing programs. The federal Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995 set a requirement that at least 80 percent of the units in an age-restricted community have at least one person who is 55 years or older, and requires the community to publish and adhere to certain policies.But more people on Long Island seem to be choosing to age in place than in other parts of the region. Since 2000, the number of people over 65 has increased by 34 percent on Long Island, compared with between 20 and 28 percent elsewhere in the region, Mr. Jones said.Take Merle and Stephen Neidell, who initially thought they would spend the rest of their lives in the three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath farm ranch in Head of the Harbor that they had called home since 1985.\u201cIt is a different lifestyle we were after,\u201d said Ms. Neidell, 73, a retired guidance counselor. The home where they had raised their children was in \u201ca very isolated setting,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we are aging, we like having neighbors right nearby. Now we have as much privacy as we want, plus as much socialization as we want.\u201dBy moving to a community where the ages range from the late 50 to early 80s, \u201cwe increased our social circle tremendously, which is great at our age,\u201d Ms. Neidell said. \u201cFor those of us who came to Long Island in the late 1960s and are choosing to remain here, this is a perfect opportunity for us to stay.\u201dMr. Neidell, 74, a retired assistant superintendent of schools, said lower taxes and maintenance costs and an elevator (used now primarily as a dumbwaiter to bring packages up and down, since they still use the stairs) were also pluses. \u201cWe felt the 55 and over was more appropriate for us at this point,\u201d he said.Jim Tsunis, managing member of the Northwind Group, the developer of Village Vistas and similar upcoming developments in Bayport and Fort Salonga, said the communities are filling a need. \u201cPeople that live here want to continue to live here, but they don\u2019t want the costly expenses of a single-family home and the real estate taxes that go along with it,\u201d Mr. Tsunis said. \u201cThey stay to be closer to their kids.\u201dHis buyers are often able to split the profits from the larger single-family homes they sell to buy a condo on Long Island and another in a warmer climate, like Florida, the Carolinas or Arizona.In Bayport, N.Y., where 85 of the 148 age-restricted townhomes that Mr. Tsunis is building are under contract, the community will have a clubhouse with indoor and outdoor pools, a fitness center, a billiard room and space for card games, fitness and yoga classes and other activities.After raising their two daughters in a four bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath contemporary colonial on a third-acre lot in Farmingdale, Sherri and Joseph Azizollahoff, both 66, are looking forward to single-level living at Country Pointe in Plainview.\u201cWe were ready for a change after 28 years,\u201d said Ms. Azizollahoff, an occupational therapist. In October 2016, they put a deposit on a two-bedroom villa in the high $800,000s that comes with a full basement and one-car garage, and are expecting to close by the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t like children or younger families, but we like the idea of making friends with people that we would have more in common with.\u201d The development is close to a daughter and two grandchildren in Syosset, she said, with enough space for their other daughter and two grandchildren to visit from Maryland.Mr. Azizollahoff, a medical sales representative, is looking forward to the gym, and cycling and jogging on the greenbelt being built around the development. \u201cIf something happened to one of us, we are better off being there than being here and isolated,\u201d he said.By 2019, according to the National Association of Home Builders, households headed by someone 55 or older will constitute more than 45 percent of all American households. And developers nationwide hope to appeal to those graying boomers as they downsize.In Westchester, many of the age-restricted developments are below market-rate rental housing, said Martin Ginsburg, a Valhalla-based developer who has built both affordable and luxury communities for older adults.The growth in age-restricted housing, Mr. Jones said, has been helped by the fact that \u201cit is easier to get those projects approved because there is less concern about having school children that will raise school costs and property taxes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a great business, because the population on Long Island is aging and continuing to age,\u201d Mr. Krieger said. At the Seasons at Seaford, 112 two-bedroom, two-bath units, priced around $500,000, quickly sold out. And in three months, 120 of 160 units in phase one at the 256-unit upcoming Seasons at Elwood have sold.\u201cPeople on Long Island are looking for a lifestyle change and looking to remain close to their families,\u201d Mr. Krieger said. \u201cThey want to see their grandchildren growing up. They want to continue to go to the same doctor, to the same supermarket, to the same restaurant for lunch.\u201dAnd in the new developments, he said, \u201call the common things that would typically be a headache for a homeowner are taken care of.\u201dMitchell H. Pally, chief executive officer of the Long Island Builders Institute, said taxes for buyers in age-restricted communities are lower than they would be for those buying a single-family home.The niche market \u201chas exploded\u201d for both sales and rentals developments, Mr. Pally said, estimating that 4,000 to 5,000 age-restricted units have been built on Long Island in the last five years.\u201cWe will be cutting our taxes by more than half,\u201d said Mr. Cranmer, who worked in New York City\u2019s Department of Finance. \u201cIt offers us comparable living space at a much more affordable cost of living.\u201d They expect to move next September.In the meantime, they are slowly weeding through \u201c30 years of stuff\u201d and planning a garage sale, said Mrs. Cranmer, a former systems programmer. Looking forward to card games, mah-jongg and pizza night with new neighbors, they are feeling more secure about the future. \u201cIf something happens to one of us, the other won\u2019t have to rush to make an extreme lifestyle change,\u201d Mrs. Cranmer said.With life expectancy rising, assisted living facilities catering to octogenarians and beyond are also popping up. While 55-and-older communities offer independent living for active adults of a certain age, assisted living is for those who don\u2019t need nursing care, but who can no longer manage completely on their own and need help with things like meal preparation, getting dressed, taking medications and social activities.\u201cYou can\u2019t build assisted living facilities on the island fast enough,\u201d Mr. Pally said. According to New York State Department of Health data, Long Island currently has 89 assisted living facilities, and another seven are in the works.\u201cThere are a lot more people in their 80s and 90s who require some sort of assisted living,\u201d said Mr. Jones, of the Regional Plan Association. \u201cThat will only increase over the next few decades.\u201dThe Engel Burman Group has 15 Bristal assisted living complexes on Long Island, in Westchester and in Bergen County, N.J., with more in the pipeline, Mr. Krieger said.The average age of residents in assisted living is 88, up from 82 in 2000. Ninety percent move from within four miles, and many have friends from the same neighborhood. Most are settling close to their adult children.As older parents age, \u201ckids are moving their parents back close to them,\u201d Mr. Krieger said. \u201cThe parents are constantly moving back from Florida and the Carolinas.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bettinger II, the chief executive of the discount broker Charles Schwab. \u201cGod bless him, but no one ever said Baron\u2019s fees are little.\u201dYou can say that again.Mr. Baron\u2019s mutual funds charge some of the higher investment fees around, and the fees have held steady despite a $1 trillion exodus out of old-school mutual funds into cheaper, better performing rivals that track a variety of indexes and investment styles.In a global economy where competition and Amazonian price destruction have forced companies to cater to cost-wary customers, the mutual fund industry is a rare outlier. Fees on most actively managed mutual funds, which house the retirement savings and other assets of millions of Americans, have barely budged.The reasons for that \u2014 quiescent mutual fund boards, complacent investors and a general unwillingness to call a halt to one of the great gravy trains in financial history \u2014 are all visible inside Mr. Baron\u2019s fund family.The Baron Funds group manages $26.4 billion in assets on behalf of hundreds of thousands of small and large investors. An old-fashioned stock picker, Mr. Baron achieved renown in the 1990s and the 2000s for successfully betting on small companies.But his performance has suffered in recent years. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, his flagship fund, Baron Growth, trailed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index by an average of seven percentage points.This year, the results have been better: He is up 27 percent, compared with 20 percent for the S. & P.The 13 Baron funds impose fees that were 54 percent higher than last year\u2019s industry average \u2014 and vastly higher than what a comparable exchange-traded fund would charge.In November, Baron reduced fees on three of its smaller funds. But the largest, Baron Growth, with $6.3 billion in assets, still charges 1.3 percent of assets. That is a third higher than the median level for similar funds, according to Morningstar.Since 2010, investors have withdrawn, in net terms, just over $5 billion from the growth fund, according to Morningstar. But many have stuck around.Mr. Baron, 74, is perhaps best known for his annual investment conference, now held at the Metropolitan Opera House at New York\u2019s Lincoln Center and in its 26th year. Mixing rock stars, pop entertainment (Barbra Streisand and Paul McCartney have performed in the past), patriotism (this year celebrated the 100th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s birth) and triumphant chief executives, the gala is a giddy ode to American capitalism.Few fund companies offer a comparable perk, and some 5,000 Baron fund holders travel to New York to attend.At the conference in November, with markets hitting new highs each day, investors were exultant. But there was a lingering concern.\u201cThe fees are very high,\u201d one man said to a friend as they exited the Chris Rock comedy show. \u201cYou really have to have the market go up to do well.\u201dEven longtime fans acknowledge they are paying up.\u201cI won\u2019t say performance warrants the fees they charge,\u201d said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. \u201cBut I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.\u201dWhen the shareholder asked Mr. Baron why his rates were so much higher than Schwab\u2019s, the audience response was telling: The opera hall erupted in sympathetic laughter \u2014 and applause.Mr. Baron has been getting flak for his funds\u2019 high costs for years.Mr. Baron is unapologetic about the high fees. He argues that his skills and experience \u2014 and the arduous task of researching small growth companies \u2014 justify the fees.\u201cSince inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.\u201dBut if you want to bet on American growth stocks, \u201cyou can double your money in 10 years,\u201d he said. He frequently sticks with his top picks for decades.While this year has been stellar, over a longer stretch his performance is less robust.Mr. Baron believes that the true measure of his success is performance since his fund\u2019s launch in 1994. A $10,000 investment in his main fund then would be worth $163,207 today, according to Baron data. That compares with $57,889 for the Russell growth index and $84,904 for the S. & P. 500, per Baron.Mr. Baron\u2019s funds are not the only ones refusing to budge on fees. In fact, the average fee for 2,000 actively managed mutual funds has remained 0.84 percent of total assets for the past three years, according to Morningstar.Some, like the Capital Group and Fidelity, have gotten the message and have reduced their fees over this period.Industry experts say there are several reasons that active mutual fund fees have not succumbed to broader pricing trends in the economy.The first is their power. While more than $1 trillion has left higher-fee funds in favor of passive competitors, that still leaves some $10 trillion. That generates about $100 billion in fees for fund companies. And it suggests they don\u2019t need to cut fees to retain assets.It\u2019s dizzyingly complicated for investors to figure out what fees they\u2019re paying. With funds\u2019 multiple share classes, varying structures and oceans of boilerplate, even sophisticated investors may not realize they are paying up for a laggard.Another reason for elevated fees, experts say, is lax oversight.Every mutual fund is overseen by a board of trustees \u2014 a mix of executives from the fund company and mostly independent officers that must, by law, look out for investors\u2019 interests.But are these boards truly effective advocates for investors?A number of lawsuits brought against major investment companies, including Axa, BlackRock and Pimco, allege that trustees are not pushing hard enough for lower fees. The judge overseeing the BlackRock case in 2015 declined to dismiss the suit, saying the allegations raised questions about \u201crubber stamping\u201d by boards.BlackRock has said the suit lacks merit.At the Baron fund family, the fee oversight is complicated by the fact that Mr. Baron, the largest shareholder in the investment company and the manager of its largest fund, has a financial incentive to keep fees high. In addition to his salary and bonus, tied to performance among other measures, he gets a reward based on a percentage of the fees his funds bring in, according to regulatory filings.That is unusual. At most fund companies, compensation packages reward managers for beating their benchmarks \u2014 not collecting fees.While the average age for independent mutual fund directors is 66, some directors stay on boards into their 80s and even 90s. Such long tenures often make directors weak voices for investors, he said.Baron funds are overseen by nine directors. Seven are listed as independent. Four of those seven have served as trustees since Mr. Baron established his first funds 30 years ago.One of them, David A. Silverman, has zero financial experience: He is a doctor with an expertise in infectious diseases.The lead independent trustee, Raymond Noveck, worked as a managing director at Baron from 1985 to 1987.\u201cTrustees have very little incentive to fight managers,\u201d Mr. Birdthistle said. \u201cKicking and scratching is unlikely to lower fees but certainly will antagonize the manager, which is the one institution that can arrange for the trustees\u2019 dismissal. Besides, trustees will tell themselves, if a fund\u2019s fees really are too high, the market will sort things out and investors simply won\u2019t invest in the fund.\u201dThe board has taken steps to recruit trustees with bulkier backgrounds, most recently Tom Folliard, a former chief executive of CarMax.In a statement, Baron Funds said that it regularly assessed its board\u2019s effectiveness and that the long tenure of some members was a sign of the board\u2019s experience and expertise. It said fees were approved via data and analysis from an outside party. The board also said it was represented by an independent lawyer.One clear winner of this arrangement is Mr. Baron. \u201cIn 1970, my net worth was minus $15,000,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cNow my children and I have over $670 million invested in our funds.\u201dForbes pegs his wealth at just over $2 billion \u2014 and he is not shy about showing it off.His office in Manhattan\u2019s General Motors Building is a museum of trophies and curiosities, from paintings by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein to Kennedy\u2019s rocking chair. He has invested about $150 million in a 59-acre beachfront estate in East Hampton, N.Y., that he bought in 2007.Mr. Baron\u2019s investment philosophy \u2014 that over the long term the stocks that he picks will keep doubling \u2014 is fired by a relentless optimism that he attributes to his life\u2019s good fortune.A grandchild of immigrants from Poland and Russia, Mr. Baron grew up scraping for extra cash in Asbury Park, N.J. He worked his way through college and law school, which he left without getting a degree.In 1982, after a stint as a Wall Street analyst, he founded his investment firm.His timing was perfect. It was the start of a bull market, and he developed an expertise in picking small companies that would grow into big ones such as Charles Schwab, Vail Management Company and Tesla.It was the heyday of the individual stock picker. Peter Lynch at Fidelity and Bill Miller at Legg Mason gained cultlike followings, accumulating billions of dollars in assets and gracing the covers of the personal finance magazines that lionized them.Mr. Baron\u2019s star power was of a lesser variety, but it was not insubstantial. He became a regular television commentator and won a reputation as the longest of long-term investors, holding positions for decades. His assets peaked at $28 billion in 2015.\u201cWe have made $23.6 billion for our clients,\u201d Mr. Baron said.But it is his annual investor gala, which he pays for himself, that defines him. Onstage, he cultivates a grandfatherly mien, bragging about how much money the chief executives of his portfolio companies made for Baron shareholders. His chief maxim is \u201cWe invest in people,\u201d and he treats management as family.There are warm bear hugs onstage for some. Others get personal advice.Spotting a top executive from the data firm FactSet, another portfolio holding, he offered to connect her with his longtime tax lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what he has done,\u201d Mr. Baron said.A surprise raffle is part of the atmospherics, and this time a Model 3 from Tesla was the grand prize. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill performed.As the event ended, attendees streamed out of Lincoln Center into a freezing evening. Mr. Baron, without a coat, greeted them on the plaza. He hugged and kissed old friends and posed for selfies with new ones.Nobody complained about the fees.An earlier version of this article misstated how the iShares Russell 2000 Growth fund performed over a five-year period. It is up 15 percent, not 96 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Didn\u2019t Set Out to Be a Feminist Hero", "Date": "2017-12-09", "News": "The Federal Reserve chair (don\u2019t call her \u201cchairwoman\u201d) quietly achieved rock-star status. Now that she\u2019s leaving, her many fans are sad to see her go.Supported byMs. Yellen, the first woman to serve as the head of the Federal Reserve Board, didn\u2019t ask to become a feminist icon, and she almost never talks about gender in the abstract or her historic role as the agency\u2019s chairman (she bristles at being called \u201cchairwoman\u201d). And yet, during a tenure characterized by a plummeting unemployment rate and consistently low inflation, Ms. Yellen became a pop culture phenomenon.Despite his unorthodox decision to replace her, even Mr. Trump has agreed that Ms. Yellen has performed well in the job. In the Rose Garden announcing Mr. Powell\u2019s nomination, the president called Ms. Yellen an \u201cabsolutely spectacular person\u201d and said she had \u201cdone a terrific job.\u201dSo, why, many women wondered, replace her with a man?\u201cJanet should\u2019ve been renominated, as every past Fed chair has been renominated for nearly the last 40 years,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in an interview. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the first time and certainly not the last a highly qualified woman is passed over for a job she clearly deserves.\u201dIt\u2019s a funny thing Americans have about powerful women. Voters haven\u2019t always responded to women who ask for the big jobs (see: Hillary Clinton), but when they see a woman simply doing the job \u2014 and a good one, at that \u2014 they seem happy to give her rock star status.It\u2019s true of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice who has become known to many young women simply as \u201cthe Notorious RBG.\u201d And it was true of Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state, traveling the world and negotiating with world leaders in a scrunchie and glasses while basking in 70 percent approval ratings. (When Mrs. Clinton was asked about her in-the-toilet favorability numbers during the 2016 presidential campaign, she said, \u201cOnce I\u2019m doing the job, we\u2019ll be back to people viewing me as the person doing the job instead of the person seeking the job.\u201d)\u201cI\u2019m the biggest Janet fangirl,\u201d said Julia Coronado, founder of the economic research firm MacroPolicy Perspectives.Mr. Powell, the incoming chairman, studied closely under Ms. Yellen and is largely expected to continue the economic path she has laid. \u201cThey appointed the apprentice instead of the master,\u201d Heidi Hartmann, the president and chief executive of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, said.The change, Ms. Hartmann added, speaks to the broader problem of a lack of women represented in finance and economic policymaking. \u201cI think men have a fair amount of loyalty to other men, and the other people Trump consulted would\u2019ve been more open to a man,\u201d she said.The White House shunned any accusations of sexism playing into the decision. \u201cThe mere suggestion is an affront to Chair Yellen,\u201d the press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.Described as even-keeled and soft-spoken, but fierce (\u201cPeople underestimate her at their peril,\u201d Ms. Warren said), Ms. Yellen has never inserted herself into the gender wars but by virtue of that \u201clarge I.Q.,\u201d she has inadvertently found herself in the cross hairs.The Brooklyn-born Ms. Yellen was the only woman among those earning a Ph.D. in economics at Yale in 1971. For years, she was known in academic circles as \u201cthe trailing spouse,\u201d overshadowed by her husband, George Akerlof, a Nobel-prize winning economist. The couple has a son, Robert Akerlof, who is also a highly regarded economist.This trailing spouse, however, went on to be a top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a member of the central bank\u2019s board of governors. Then, in 2013, 100 years after the Federal Reserve was founded, she made history as its first woman chair.But history making is often a messy matter. And even with her low profile, Ms. Yellen managed to kick up a central-banking storm.Mr. Obama\u2019s initial choice to steer the nation\u2019s shaky economy through the recession had been the economist Lawrence H. Summers, who had served as an adviser. But many Democrats in the Senate, including Ms. Warren, protested the move. They argued that Ms. Yellen, who had worked closely with the outgoing chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was the obvious choice.Then there was the issue of Mr. Summers, who during his time as president of Harvard had caused controversy and a suitable backlash when he argued that inherent differences between the sexes were a possible reason for the lack of female science professors.Theories abound that Ms. Yellen has been accepted \u2014 and even beloved \u2014 in a high-powered role because she has not made being a woman a central theme of her career. In contrast to Mrs. Clinton who made gender a significant part of her 2016 candidacy, Ms. Yellen has inserted the issue more subtly.\u201cYou try to make the economy better and reflect priorities of the nation, and there isn\u2019t a woman\u2019s budget,\u201d said Alice M. Rivlin, who served as director of the Office of Management and Budget and as vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Board during the Clinton administration. \u201cI felt the same way about the Federal Reserve.\u201dWomen in the workplace have been \u201champered by barriers to equal opportunity and workplace rules and norms that fail to support a reasonable work-life balance,\u201d Ms. Yellen said, adding that \u201cif these obstacles persist, we will squander the potential of many of our citizens and incur a substantial loss to the productive capacity of our economy.\u201dConsidering her tenure at the Federal Reserve, economists said that having a woman in that role had brought about a more representative approach to monetary policy, even if Ms. Yellen did not emphasize an agenda intended to advance the interests of women. Several academic studies, for example, show that women economists are more likely to address inequality than their male counterparts.\u201cThe economic profession as a whole has a terrible white male problem,\u201d Ms. Coronado, said. \u201cAre you even going to ask the right questions if you have a lot of privileged people setting the agenda?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coinbase: The Heart of the Bitcoin Frenzy", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The booming stock market of the 1920s had the New York Stock Exchange. The tech bubble of the 1990s had Nasdaq and E-Trade. And the virtual currency market of the last year has had Coinbase. The company faces challenges that are a reminder of the early days of now-mainstream online brokerages, which suffered through untimely outages and harsh criticism from traditional finance companies and government regulators. And Coinbase\u2019s missteps make it clear that the virtual currency industry is still young, with little of the battle testing that other financial markets have faced.Recently, every last inch of space has been pressed into action. The day after Bitcoin hit $10,000 last week, a training session for Coinbase managers was moved to the game room because the engineering team needed to set up an emergency war room in the regular conference room. The engineering team was trying to get Coinbase back up after the company\u2019s site was knocked offline, overwhelmed by a wave of incoming traffic. The number of visitors was double what it had been during the previous peak \u2014 two days earlier \u2014 and eight times what it had been in June, the peak until recently. All of the big Bitcoin exchanges went down for at least part of the day, and Coinbase got back online faster than most. Still, any sort of downtime like that would be unacceptable in more traditional exchanges where stocks and commodities are traded. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a little bit too focused on the price or people trying to make money,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said last week. \u201cThe thing I\u2019m passionate about with digital currency is the world having an open financial system.\u201d In addition to the brokerage service for small investors, Coinbase also runs an exchange, called GDAX, tailored to larger investors. GDAX is overseen by Adam White, a former Air Force officer and a graduate of Harvard Business School. The day Bitcoin hit $10,000, he was in New York speaking with big financial institutions that are looking into Bitcoin. Some companies are getting ready to begin trading Bitcoin futures contracts in December, when that activity becomes available on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A year ago, his Wall Street outreach was difficult, but \u201cit\u2019s all inbound now,\u201d Mr. White said. Not surprisingly, Coinbase is on a building spree. It recently leased office space in New York that will handle the Wall Street business and a new service that holds virtual currencies for large customers. In San Francisco, the company is adding two new floors in the building where it now has one. Coinbase is trying to be more responsive. At the beginning of the year, the company had 24 employees providing customer support. It now has around 180, with most of them outsourced from a call center in Texas and an email response team in the Philippines. The cafeteria is often turned into a \u201cCrypto Club\u201d where new employees are taught the ins and outs of virtual currency. Daniel Romero, the general manager of Coinbase, said he wanted to have 400 customer support employees by the first quarter of next year to provide phone support around the clock. But in the meantime, there is a 10-day backlog of service requests.\u201cWhen your customer support issues are that publicly bad, and you have your site go down when people want to be trading,\u201d it\u2019s a very humbling experience, Mr. Romero said. A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified where Coinbase employees were gathered for lunch. It was the company's gaming room, not the cafeteria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As G.O.P. Celebrates House Vote, New York and New Jersey Lawmakers Say No", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd in almost every case, the reason for that cross-Hudson opposition came down to the assertion that their two states were basically being used to pay for tax cuts in the other 48.\u201cThat was totally avoidable,\u201d Mr. Zeldin said.But the opposition was by far the most concentrated in New Jersey and New York, two high-tax, largely Democratic states. And the chief source of consternation for Mr. King and others were new provisions to cap the combined deduction for state and local income tax and property taxes at $10,000. That limit, they warn, could decrease property values, stymie the real estate market and cause tax migration to less tax-heavy states.That sort of messaging was met by shrugs by many Republicans in New York. It also did not seem likely that the dozen defectors would face retaliation from inside the Republican conference. A few hours before the House vote, the chamber\u2019s chief tax writer, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, showed no ill will toward the dissenters.In fact, Mr. Brady said lawmakers from states where the deduction for state and local taxes is a significant issue had achieved \u201cgood wins\u201d through their negotiations. Earlier proposals had included a complete elimination of the deduction for state and local income taxes, with a $10,000 cap on only property taxes.\u201cThey\u2019ve been terrific,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cWhether they vote for it or not, they\u2019ve done a great job staying at the table.\u201dRepresentative John Faso, a Republican from the Hudson Valley who voted no, agreed that the bill that passed Tuesday was better than earlier versions, but still worried that it would \u201cdrive a lot of high-earners out of New York\u201d and have \u201cdisproportionate impact on state and local finances.\u201dBut he blamed Democrats, in his state and elsewhere, for not doing more to change the bill. \u201cDemocrats from high-tax states, had their votes been truly in play, would have been able to influence the results,\u201d he said in an interview.No Democrat voted for the bill, and Representative Joe Crowley of Queens, who serves as the chairman of the Democratic Caucus, flatly rejected any suggestion that his party \u2014 boxed out of negotiations by the reconciliation process \u2014 owned any of its possible negative consequences, either in New York, New Jersey or nationwide. Those consequences would be profound, with a quarter of New Yorkers experiencing a tax increase, he estimated.And while he appreciated the no votes of the five New York Republicans, he said they still shouldered responsibility for the bill. \u201cThey voted for the leadership that allowed this vote to come to the floor in the first place,\u201d Mr. Crowley said, adding, \u201cThat speaks volumes.\u201dThomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Which Nation Does the World Trust Most? (Hint: Follow the Dollar)", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA provocateur like Mr. Trump will trigger strong opinions, but opinions are flighty. A president\u2019s character is indeed likely to affect America\u2019s soft power \u2014 its cultural and diplomatic influence \u2014 while he is in office. It is less clear, however, that any erosion of soft power under Mr. Trump represents a permanent threat to America\u2019s hard power, including its measurable economic and financial strength.Even before Mr. Trump, the declinists cited data showing China gaining a greater share of the global economy at America\u2019s expense, a trend that is easy to exaggerate. America\u2019s current 24 percent share looks much diminished compared with 30 percent in 2000 but about the same as the 26 percent share in 1980. It\u2019s simple to cherry-pick a start date that makes American decline look bad, but the reality is that China is gaining global economic share at the expense mainly of Europe and Japan.America is a tested economic superpower, having survived 21 recessions and a Great Depression since 1900. China remains untested, having suffered not one outright recession since its modern renaissance began around 1980. It has yet to be seen just how well China will weather such a test, which is inevitable for any large economy.China\u2019s rise has already slowed sharply. When the Chinese economy grew at a double-digit pace last decade and its currency appreciated strongly, many forecasters thought it would match the size of the American economy by now. Instead, following a significant slowdown, China is on pace to catch up to the United States by 2030 \u2014 and then only if it experiences no major disruptions or further slowdown. Both things are highly possible.At a time when finance increasingly dominates the global economy, America\u2019s influence as a financial superpower is as great as ever. Central banks around the world are always looking for a safe place to park their money, and they usually buy United States assets, typically Treasury bills, which show up as dollars in their foreign exchange reserves. Since 1980, the dollar\u2019s share of foreign exchange reserves has held roughly steady at around 66 percent. This is in part the world\u2019s way of saying it not only trusts the United States to pay its debts but also trusts it more than Europe, Japan and especially China.Serious money does not equate America with Mr. Trump, and those obsessed with American decline ignore the state of its rivals. The euro was introduced 19 years ago, ambitious to become a reserve currency, but its youth and the recurring fears of a eurozone breakup have limited the world\u2019s willingness to trust it. Aging Japan\u2019s long stagnation acts as a permanent cap on the yen\u2019s popularity. And outsiders remain even more wary of the renminbi, owing both to China\u2019s debt troubles and the standing threat that Communist rulers pose to free flows of capital.When businesses in two countries \u2014 say, India and Argentina \u2014 want to conduct a deal, they almost always arrange payment not in rupees or pesos but in dollars. Everyone wants to hold the world\u2019s most trusted and liquid currency. Nearly 90 percent of bank-financed international transactions are conducted in dollars, a share that is close to all-time highs.The world is on a dollar standard, and in some ways the reach of the dollar is expanding. When individuals and companies borrow from lenders in another country, they increasingly borrow in dollars, which now account for 75 percent of these global flows, up from 60 percent just before the global financial crisis in 2008. Even though the crisis began that year in the United States, American banks dominate global finance more now than they did before the crisis \u2014 in part because debt troubles have dogged banks in Europe, Japan and China even more persistently.The share of countries that use the dollar as their main \u201canchor\u201d \u2014 the currency against which they measure and stabilize the value of their own currency \u2014 has risen to 60 percent today from about 30 percent in 1950 and 50 percent in 1980. And those countries collectively account for some 70 percent of the global gross domestic product. In other words, most of the world chooses to live in a dollar bloc.Critically, there is no sign that the dollar\u2019s status on any of these measures \u2014 as a reserve, an anchor or the favored currency for cross-border transactions and loans \u2014 has declined since Mr. Trump took office.In a dollar world, most countries are happiest when the dominant currency is cheap and plentiful. A strong dollar raises the cost of borrowing, which slows global economic growth and has often triggered debt crises in the emerging world. A weak dollar has the opposite effect, which is why the weakening of the dollar this year offers more evidence of its dominance: Partly as a result, the world is enjoying an unusually broad recovery encompassing every major economy.Instead, the renminbi has gained no ground as a reserve currency and probably won\u2019t as long as China\u2019s financial markets remain largely closed, underdeveloped and subject to government meddling. One reason foreigners like to hold the dollar is that they know they will never get stuck with it, thanks to the vast, open and highly liquid American stock and bond markets.Many observers nonetheless assume that with China rising as an economic power, financial clout will follow. Perhaps, but the United States surpassed Britain as the world\u2019s largest economy in the late 19th century, and the dollar did not fully displace British sterling as the leading reserve currency until after the world wars, which left British finances shattered. That doesn\u2019t mean it will take World War III to end the dollar\u2019s reign, but it will take time and a shock bigger than one unpredictable president.History also suggests that economic size alone will not be enough to propel China to financial superpower status. From 1450 through the late 1700s, the leading reserve currency was held by smaller countries \u2014 first Portugal, followed by Spain, the Netherlands and France. These nations were all major trading and military powers with credible financial systems, but not one was the world\u2019s largest economy. Throughout those centuries, the leading economy was primarily China. It never gained the advantages of having the leading reserve currency because, then as now, its financial system lacked credibility.No one doubts that China poses a growing military and economic challenge to the United States. But Mr. Trump\u2019s critics may be overstating both the scope and inevitability of American decline and the role one president can play in advancing it.To identify which nation the world really trusts in the long term, follow the money.

But unilateral American sanctions on doing financial transactions with Iran remain in place, and the cumulative effect of sanctions has been severe. Mr. Rouhani, who heralded the agreement as a fresh start, has faced criticism for not doing enough to jump-start the economy.The Trump administration seized on reports of the protests to denounce Iran. \u201cIran\u2019s leaders have turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos,\u201d the State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said in a statement. \u201cAs President Trump has said, the longest-suffering victims of Iran\u2019s leaders are Iran\u2019s own people.\u201d She added that the United States \u201cstrongly condemns the arrest of peaceful protesters.\u201dIt was difficult to judge the size of the demonstrations and whether they were organized, and if so, by whom.Relatively prosperous, Mashhad is dominated by hard-liners, including supporters of Ibrahim Raesi, who lost to Mr. Rouhani in the May elections. Mr. Raesi has pressed the plight of the poor, a cause picked up by hard-liners who say that Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government has failed to address rising inequality.A new budget presented by the government this month was widely debated on Telegram, Iran\u2019s most used social media outlet. Many people were upset over appropriations for religious and revolutionary institutions while other areas of the budget were cut. An unpopular \u201cexit tax\u201d that Iranians pay whenever they travel outside the country was increased, and millions of dollars were cut from a modest but popular subsidy plan for the poor.At the same time, the government has allowed Iran\u2019s currency to depreciate over the past half year, a psychological blow that resulted in inflation of certain products like a 40 percent increase in the price of eggs.Protests over economic conditions are not uncommon in Iran. They usually take place in front of Parliament in Tehran, and in smaller cities it is not uncommon to see protests by people who have lost their savings in bank failures, or retirees who can\u2019t make ends meet. What seems distinctive about the protests this week is how quickly news about them spread on social media and was in turn picked up by foreign-based satellite channels.\u201cA number of them left after being warned by police. A few others, however, remained despite being warned to leave,\u201d the news service quoted him as saying, and \u201ca number of them were detained after arrest warrants were issued.\u201dThe Tasnim news agency quoted Mr. Hamedani as saying that no protest permits had been issued for Tehran and warning that \u201csuch gatherings will be firmly dealt with by the police.\u201dHard-liners, including Mr. Hamedani, castigated the protesters, warning that Iran\u2019s enemies would take advantage of any sign of dissent.One hard-line religious leader, Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda, said that a protest in the northeastern city of Sabzevar had been disrupted when \u201call of a sudden, a small group of roughly 50 people among the crowd started to chant norm-braking slogans such as \u2018Forget Palestine\u2019 or \u2018No to Gaza, No to Lebanon, I will give my life for Iran.\u2019\u201d (Government-approved protests routinely invoke the Iranian government\u2019s self-designated role as a defender of Palestinian aspirations and as a foe of the United States.)A reformist ally of Mr. Rouhani, Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, warned that protesters risked setting off unrest that might not be controllable.\u201cThe ones who trigger political moves in the streets may not be the ones who will put an end to it, since others may ride the wave they have started, and they must know that their action will backfire on them,\u201d the semiofficial ISNA news agency quoted Mr. Jahangiri as saying. He added that the government was open to receiving \u201cfair criticism.\u201dAbout 300 people gathered at Freedom Square in the city and carried out a march in which public property was damaged, according to the semiofficial Fars news agency, which is close to the country\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.The protesters shouted antigovernment slogans like \u201cDeath or freedom,\u201d \u201cCare for us and leave Palestine\u201d and \u201cPolitical prisoners must be freed,\u201d according to Fars.Ali Vaez, the Iran project director for the International Crisis Group, said it was possible that hard-line opponents of Mr. Rouhani were behind the protests in Mashhad, capitalizing on anger about the economic belt-tightening and about rising food and gasoline prices.\u201cThe trigger was apparently a protest that the government\u2019s hard-line opponents organized in Mashhad, which got out of control and turned into an anti-regime rally and is now spreading across the country,\u201d he said.\u201cThe system will probably use it as a show of force and in its wake will repress any dissent,\u201d Mr. Vaez said. \u201cThe only meaningful consequence probably is that it will provide ammunition for the Trump administration to further condemn the regime.\u201dBut Nader Karimi Juni, a reformist journalist, was skeptical that hard-liners were behind the protests. \u201cIf the protests continue for a while, which is not certain, it will be dangerous for the regime,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the future is unpredictable and the regime has managed to crack down on more serious protests in the past decades.\u201dFazel Meybodi, a reformist cleric from the holy city of Qom, said he believed the protests had emerged from authentic concerns, as the government\u2019s new budget had \u201cmade people in the provincial towns angry.\u201d\u201cIf the police and government treat people gently, this crisis will wane and tranquillity will prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise they might \u2014 I stress might \u2014 grow in the future. Economic issues are urgent, and the protests have nothing to do with any factions \u2014 neither reformist nor hard-liner. Poor people are protesting, that is it.\u201dThomas Erdbrink reported from Niseko, Japan, and Nilo Tabrizy contributed reporting from Vancouver, Canada.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gifts Tied to Opioid Sales Invite a Question: Should Museums Vet Donors?", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVisitors to the Victoria and Albert Museum\u2019s white porcelain plaza in London commonly walk past a wall that says \u201cThe Sackler Courtyard.\u201d About a mile away, the words \u201cSerpentine Sackler Gallery\u201d appear above a colonnade running along the front of a former gunpowder repository turned art space.And across the Atlantic, the family\u2019s name is attached to centers and programs at institutions like the Dia Arts Foundation, the Guggenheim and the American Museum of Natural History.Since the 1970s, the Sackler family has donated millions of dollars to prominent museums and cultural institutions. The name has become nearly synonymous with the arts.But few institutions seem concerned that the money they have received may be tied, in some way, to a family fortune partly built on the sale of opioids.The New York Times surveyed 21 cultural organizations listed on tax forms as having received significant sums from foundations run by two Sackler brothers who led Purdue. Several, including the Guggenheim, declined to comment; others, like the Brooklyn Museum, ignored questions. None indicated that they would return donations or refuse them in the future.\u201cWe regularly assess our funding activities to ensure best practice,\u201d wrote Zo\u00eb Franklin, a spokeswoman for the Victoria and Albert Museum, which was listed as receiving about $13.1 million from the Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation in 2012. \u201cThe Sackler family continue to be an important and valuable donor to the V & A and we are grateful for their ongoing support.\u201dTo what degree are cultural institutions responsible for vetting every dollar they receive? Can financially strapped arts organizations be picky about a patron\u2019s source of wealth, and if so, where should they draw the line? At a donor who engages in unlawful or unethical behavior? Or whose conduct is at odds with the institution\u2019s goals?The issue stretches back to the days of Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick and the Rockefellers, cultural philanthropists whose sources of income were characterized at some point as monopolistic, or anti-union or harmful to the environment.But museums have shown an unwillingness to return money or end a philanthropic relationship.\u201cHistorically, museum audiences have not shown evidence of being terribly concerned about sources of income for museums,\u201d said Susie Wilkening, a museum consultant in Seattle. \u201cEspecially if there is no conflict between the mission of the museum and the philosophies or beliefs of the donor.\u201dSome of Mortimer and Raymond\u2019s descendants have sat on the company\u2019s board or held executive positions since the mid-90s. In response to inquiries by the Times, Purdue confirmed that Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, one of Mortimer\u2019s daughters; Mortimer D.A. Sackler, one of his sons; and Theresa Elizabeth Sackler, his widow, are directors of the company\u2019s board today. But the company did not say whether any other family members currently serve on the board and did not provide a requested list of those who did from 1995 to 2007.(The shares of Arthur Sackler, the eldest brother and third owner of Purdue, were bought by Mortimer and Raymond at some point, according to The New Yorker. Arthur\u2019s descendants have said they have not profited from the sale of OxyContin.)Robert Josephson, a spokesman for the company, pointed to its efforts to stem the opioid epidemic \u2014 distributing prescription guidelines, developing abuse-deterrent painkillers and ensuring access to overdose-reversal medication \u2014 and noted that OxyContin has never had a large share of total opioid prescriptions. In an email, he added, \u201cMany leading medical, scientific, cultural and educational institutions throughout the world have been beneficiaries of Sackler family philanthropy.\u201dRisa B. Heller, a spokeswoman for the families of Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, declined on their behalf to comment.Andrew Ross, a professor of social and cultural analysis at New York University, said that donors sometimes give hefty amounts to institutions in an effort to shift attention from business practices that may strike some as unsavory.Such donations have opened organizations to criticism. In the 1980s, for example, antismoking groups denounced the Joffrey Ballet and other institutions for accepting money from tobacco companies.\u201cThat\u2019s a risk museums take on by having these sorts of trustees and donors,\u201d Professor Ross said. \u201cThey are supposed to have ethical values baked in, and because they trade in culture we expect different standards from them.\u201dBut some in the arts world see the acceptance of donations not as an endorsement or political statement but simply as a way to support programming.Reynold Levy, who was president of Lincoln Center for 13 years, said institutions would be unlikely to change the behavior of donors by rejecting their money. And, he added, declining donations from people who are acting lawfully could create a slippery slope of shifting standards that would do little to benefit an organization\u2019s audience.\u201cFor institutions to draw lines outside of the law, there would need to be a pretty heavy burden of persuasion to refuse a gift that would advance a meritorious mission,\u201d he said, adding that at the same time \u201cboard members should feel free to raise these questions and issues.\u201dOf course, it might be uncomfortable to begin such conversations when donors are closely tied to an institution. Mortimer D.A. Sackler, for example, is a trustee of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, which was recorded as receiving $2.49 million from the Mortimer D. Sackler Foundation between 2003 and 2015. Ilene Sackler Lefcourt is an honorary trustee of the American Museum of Natural History, which was listed as receiving $1.7 million from the Mortimer D. Sackler Foundation between 2006 and 2013.Anne Canty, a spokeswoman at the natural history museum, suggested that it needed time to take stock of the recent reporting on the Sacklers.\u201cSince this has all emerged very recently, we haven\u2019t had sufficient time to fully absorb it so we don\u2019t have any comment,\u201d she wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Lenders Collect Invasive Data and Offer Billions. Beijing Is Worried.", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Bai Shichao has a debt problem that is bigger than his paycheck \u2014 and that\u2019s a problem for the rest of China, too.Mr. Bai, a 30-year-old Beijing deliveryman, has borrowed heavily from China\u2019s growing ranks of online cash lenders. In a country that lacks reliable ways to tell who might be a good borrower, these lenders use artificial intelligence and oddly personal data \u2014 like tracking how fast prospective borrowers type on their phones \u2014 to determine who will pay them back.With Mr. Bai, they have failed. First he borrowed to start a business. When that went bust, he borrowed to bet on coal, rapeseed oil and sugar on China\u2019s futures markets. Soon Mr. Bai began borrowing from one lender to pay another.Today, Mr. Bai is more than $5,000 in debt, on a paycheck of less than $600 a month.\u201cIt\u2019s like gambling,\u201d said Mr. Bai, a university dropout who has cycled through a series of menial jobs like security guard and waiter. \u201cYou start to gamble. Soon you get addicted to it.\u201dWith more than $100 billion worth of loans and rising worries among Chinese consumers about privacy, Beijing is moving to rein in a freewheeling, well-funded boom in online personal loans.In November, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, stopped companies and people from starting new online cash lending platforms. In early December, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said it would crack down on unlicensed cash loan companies and put a lid on high-interest loans.China\u2019s small loans are piling up. More than 8,600 companies offer some form of small loan, and about $145 billion of those debts remain unpaid, according to the People\u2019s Bank of China. Other estimates run as high as $392 billion, according to the Boston Consulting Group. The government does not track default rates among online lenders, which disclose little on their own.\u201cWe are worried that in an environment where there is no effective credit system, people tend to overborrow, especially when capital comes in,\u201d said Bai Chengyu, an executive at the China Association of Microfinance, who is no relation to Bai Shichao.These lenders originally emerged as a solution to that problem: how to lend to people with no credit history. By most estimates, that could total about one billion people.China turned to the fast-moving technology sector. Today, thousands of Chinese apps offer cash or financing, often within seconds, based on a wide array of sometimes deeply personal information. China\u2019s biggest internet companies and financial names are funding the effort.Two years ago the central bank asked China\u2019s most successful internet companies \u2014 including affiliates of the sophisticated online giants Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group \u2014 to create their own credit ratings systems. Since then, it has declined to issue licenses that would formalize those systems, and officials have indicated in local news reports that the plan has fallen short of expectations.Last month, an internet financial association affiliated with the People\u2019s Bank of China announced plans to start a system that would crunch data from China\u2019s big tech firms. Few details were provided.The new online lending platforms also raise issues of privacy, a new but growing area of public concern in China. Many platforms that track smartphone use have access to data like location services, phone contact lists and call logs that can be used to track and harass delinquent borrowers.\u201cThe government has struggled a lot because they realize that consumers\u2019 personal information is everywhere,\u201d said Liu Yue, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group in Beijing. \u201cBut they don\u2019t really know how to change that because the data is already being used.\u201dMr. Bai of the China Association of Microfinance added that \u201csome cash loan companies use all kinds of soft violence to press customers to pay their loans back.\u201dLast month, Guangdong Province in southern China warned that more than a dozen apps had security loopholes that allowed companies to steal user information. Some of this information was then used to harass borrowers and their friends and families.One of those was an app called Paipaidai. Its parent company, PPDAI Group, recently listed its shares in New York. The Guangdong authorities said the app sends out users\u2019 contacts without permission. The practice \u201cseriously exposed users\u2019 privacy,\u201d the authorities said.One Paipaidai borrower, a man named Lin in a small town in Fujian Province called Quanzhou, said he had racked up about $75,000 in loans from 30 different platforms for living expenses and an investment in a shoe store. Mr. Lin, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of reprisal from debt collectors, said he received multiple calls a day from them.Mr. Lin showed images of text messages from one called Yongsheng Outsourcing that threatened to \u201cuse whatever method to deal\u201d with debt that he owed to Paipaidai. When contacted by The New York Times, a person at that number declined to say whether he worked for Yongsheng or Paipaidai.Paipaidai did not respond to requests for comment.Bai Shichao, the food deliveryman with the growing debt problem, tapped some of China\u2019s most closely watched and best-funded online lending services during his borrowing spree.One of those was a company named Smart Finance. Its app \u2014 Yongqianbao, or \u201cuse wallet\u201d in Chinese \u2014 helps it build a credit rating system based on 1,200 data points related to user behavior. Yongqianbao then connects potential borrowers with lenders. Backed by the venture capital vehicle of Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google China and a prominent start-up investor in China, it has approved 1.5 million loans a month.Its algorithms look for correlations between behavior and repayment history \u2014 and some of those are unusual. Yongqianbao considers how quickly people type on their phones, how often they eat takeout or how much power is left on their smartphone batteries when they apply for the loan. It also evaluates whether the borrower took the time to read the Yongqianbao user agreement. Approval can come in eight seconds or less.\u201cIt is hard to determine how the machine knows,\u201d said Jiao Ke, a former Baidu product manager who created Smart Finance, \u201cbut it is much more accurate\u201d than a traditional loan officer.Even borrowers like Mr. Bai who don\u2019t pay back \u2014 what Mr. Jiao calls a \u201ccontrolled delinquency\u201d \u2014 help the company by providing data, the company says.Smart Finance uses repayment behavior data to help strengthen its credit rating system, \u201cbut there is still a long way to go,\u201d said Carrie Fang, a spokeswoman for Smart Finance.Mr. Bai said he received a $270 loan from Yongqianbao in September. Thanks to the high interest rate, the balance had grown to more than $330 by mid-November.In exchange for loans, he has given lending platforms considerable personal information \u2014 and they are now using it. First they called the people he listed as emergency contacts, he said. Then they started calling other people on his phone contacts.Some debt collectors sent him texts saying they could trace his location through his phone. \u201cIt is meant to threaten you,\u201d Mr. Bai said. That ability could not be independently verified. In addition to the thousands that he owes to cash lenders, Mr. Bai owes more than $2,000 for rent and other personal debts.Mr. Bai said he now realized that it was not worth trading his privacy for quick cash. \u201cBut at that time, whenever I saw a cash loan service,\u201d he said, \u201cI wanted to borrow.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Alabama Senate Race May Have Already Been Decided", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2014 The Senate election in Alabama on Tuesday is not just about the choice between Doug Jones and Roy Moore. It\u2019s also about a voter suppression campaign that may well sway the result of a close race.A state senator who had tried for over a decade to get the bill into law, told The Huntsville Times that a photo ID law would undermine Alabama\u2019s \u201cblack power structure.\u201d In The Montgomery Advertiser, he said that the absence of an ID law \u201cbenefits black elected leaders.\u201dPhoto ID laws may seem innocuous. For many of us, it might be easy to take a few hours off from work, drive to the nearest department of motor vehicles office, wait in line, take some tests, hand over $40 and leave with a driver\u2019s license that we can use to vote. But this requires resources that many rural, low-income people around the country simply do not have.I work with poor, black Alabamians. Many of them don\u2019t have cars or driver\u2019s licenses and make under $10,000 a year. They cannot afford to pay someone to drive them to the motor vehicles or registrar\u2019s office, which is often miles away.The study controls for numerous factors that might otherwise affect an election: how much money was spent on the races; the state\u2019s partisan makeup; changes in electoral laws like early voting and day-of registration; and shifts in incentives to vote, like which party controls the state legislature.In Alabama, an estimated 118,000 registered voters do not have a photo ID they can use to vote. Black and Latino voters are nearly twice as likely as white voters to lack such documentation.Attorney General Jeff Sessions, then a United States senator, applauded the ruling as \u201cgood news\u201d for the South. For Mr. Sessions, who called the Voting Rights Act an \u201cintrusive\u201d piece of legislation, it was a victory. But for voters in Alabama and the rest of the South, it was terrible news.Sadly, on Tuesday, many of the voters who would most benefit from picking lawmakers who will represent their interests in the Senate will be kept away from the polls. Those voters are disparaged for their purported disengagement with the election, while the state\u2019s voter suppression campaign is largely ignored.We\u2019ve made too much progress to tolerate this. Federal courts must reject the voter ID law. Congress needs to restore the Voting Rights Act to its full strength. Nothing less than our democracy is at stake.Advertisement"}

And by the time our readers read this newsletter, I can\u2019t even fathom what the price is going to be.I\u2019m not a fortune teller, but even though the market is very volatile, Bitcoin has achieved a level of stickiness in the culture that will keep its price fairly high.

{"Headline": "You Cannot Be Too Cynical About the Republican Tax Bill", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rush to enact the tax bill was designed to mask \u2014 as a break for the middle class \u2014 what is in fact a $1.4 trillion package of benefits for key donors and lobbyists, the richest members of Congress, President Trump, his family and other families like his.The authors cite a wide range of specific flaws, but their main argument is that the measure is gravely deficient at its core:The most serious structural problems with the bill are unavoidable outcomes of Congress\u2019s choice to preference certain taxpayers and activities while disfavoring others \u2014 and for no discernible policy rationale. These haphazard lines are fundamentally unfair and inefficient, and invite tax planning by sophisticated taxpayers to get within the preferred categories.Glogower, Kamin, Kysar, and Shanske argue that some of the most egregious loopholes and schemes permitted by the legislation are that individual taxpayerswill be able to shield their labor income from tax by simply setting up a corporation and having their income accrue in the form of corporate profits. As a result, income that would have been taxed at the high individual rates is instead taxed at the low corporate rate.Second, the legislation creates a huge incentive for anyone in a position to do so to change his or her status from employee to \u201cindependent contractor or a partner in a firm. The game is clear: Don\u2019t be an employee, instead be an independent contractor or partner in a firm.\u201d The ability to make this shift is available primarily to the well-paid.The legislation, according to Glogower and his colleagues, also fails to present a coherent rationale:the fundamental problem is the lack of any underlying logic in deciding who benefits from the pass-through deductions, and who does not. Independent contractors and partners benefit, but not employees. Why? An owner of real estate through a REIT benefits, but not the doctor in the building. Why? An architect benefits in some ways that a lawyer does not. And so on.The bill encourages tax evasion. Glogower and his colleagues citeopportunities to use rate differentials and ill-considered transitions to engage in transactions that serve to basically pump money out of the Treasury and into the pockets of well-advised taxpayers.To provide an example, they use a company that purchased equipment under existing law, which provides them with tax breaks on the cost spread out over the years in a depreciation schedule. The new law allows companies to immediately write off the full cost of buying equipment, known as expensing.\u201cSo,\u201d the authors ask, \u201cwhat does that mean?\u201dIt means that old property can still get the benefit of expensing, but only if it is sold to another party. If the original owner holds it, they have to depreciate according to the old rules; if they sell it to another party, then suddenly the full cost is eligible for expensing, and the net effect is an immediate deduction of the existing tax basis of the asset. The parties can split the resulting surplus. It appears that the buyer of the asset could even lease it back to the existing owner, so that the property doesn\u2019t even have to go anywhere.I emailed some of the authors of this report for their individual thoughts.Mitchell Kane, a law professor at N.Y.U., wrote in response that the bill willcreate new incentives to shift tangible assets (and jobs) abroad. Given President Trump\u2019s relentless message about U.S. jobs, it is incomprehensible to me that we are about to pass something that has this effect without any kind of meaningful discussion of the issue.He noted thatlower and middle-income families, who are especially dependent upon inflation-indexed deductions, credits, and bracket thresholds, will feel the impact increasingly as time goes on.In the first year, 2018, the changed inflation rate raises a relatively modest $31.5 billion but it grows every year, reaching $37 billion in 2027. \u201cTo be sure,\u201d Hemel wrote, \u201cthis affects everyone to some degree, but most of the burden is paid for by families in the bottom four quintiles.\u201dIn the long term, Hemel argued,this is a very subtle way to increase taxes on the lower and middle classes and then use those revenues to pay for a massive tax cut for corporations.This full-speed-ahead strategy simultaneously constrained the ability of the press to explore the special interest provisions buried in the legislation.A tax expert who insisted on anonymity in order to protect client confidentiality, emailed me his critique of the bill:(1) The corporate rate reduction is permanent, for individuals only temporary. Completely obnoxious. In effect the money \u201csaved\u201d within the 10 year budget window by making those individual cuts temporary helped to underwrite the cost of making the corporate/pass though side permanent(2) Carried interest provision. When Trump was careening around in his populist candidate mode, he promised to end it. Here is one campaign promise that he \u201csomehow\u201d failed to redeem when the clear and available chance presented itself.(3) Restriction on state and C local tax deduction \u2014 consciously vindictive imposition of double taxation on citizens of certain Democratic states; corporations and pass through businesses, the darlings of the Republicans, still get to deduct those very same taxes in full.(4) Expanding the standard deduction but financing the cost of so doing by repealing the personal exemptions is a bit of a bait and switch maneuver. Some people might be worse off.(5) In a bill in which 100s of billions of dollars were sloshing around to provide steep tax cuts for already wealthy and highly prosperous corporations and pass through businesses, the Republicans could only find the will to raise the refundable portion of the child care tax credit from $1000 to $1400. Rubio wanted it to be raised to $2000 and his Republican brethren refused to even meet him halfway. Pitiful.(6) Deduction for extraordinary medical expenses \u2014 retention of this deduction did not even get the five-year sunset window applied to all the other individual tax provisions, two years only. Vicious.(7) Pass through business taxation \u2014 the bill is a massive tax gift to some of the wealthiest people in the country, who are conducting business operations in non-corporate form or are investors in same.What amounted to three major pieces of legislation were approved by the full House and the Senate Finance Committee, \u201ctwo weeks after the bill was unveiled, without a single hearing on the 400-plus-page legislation,\u201d as Thomas Kaplan and Alan Rappeport put it in The Times.One of our jobs is to flesh out competing views with such seriousness and respect that we should be mitigating, not exacerbating, the polarization that does exist ...Good teachers don\u2019t shut down debate; they try to model Socratic seriousness by putting the best possible construction on arguments, even \u2014 and especially \u2014 if one doesn\u2019t hold those positions.for a return to regular order, letting committees of jurisdiction do the principal work of crafting legislation and letting the full Senate debate and amend their efforts. We won\u2019t settle all our differences that way, but such an approach is more likely to make progress on the central problems confronting our constituents. We might not like the compromises regular order requires, but we can and must live with them if we are to find real and lasting solutions.So far, however, only one Republican senator has suffered real costs for deciding to vote for the tax bill.No way that Bob Corker is going to vote for a tax reform bill that I think in any way is going to add to the deficit. It\u2019s not going to happen, never. It\u2019s never going to happen. Never, never, ever.This is the most passionate thing for me, period, that I work on. Not foreign policy. Not banking. It\u2019s this deficit issue.For Corker, this issue went way beyond routine politics: \u201cDeficits matter,\u201d he forcefully asserted. \u201cThey are a greater threat to us than North Korea or ISIS.\u201dIn the end, after 11 years in the Senate, I know every bill we consider is imperfect and the question becomes is our country better off with or without this piece of legislation. I think we are better off with it.All of this raises a basic question. How could nearly every Republican representative \u2014 and all 52 Republican senators \u2014 support the tax bill? The best answer may be the most cynical: because it benefits key leaders, their friends, their heirs and their donors.After looking at the legislation in its entirety \u2014 its substance and the procedures used to get there \u2014 it is difficult to conclude that the motivations of its sponsors are either benevolent or somehow in the best interests of the country. More likely it is hypocrisy and venality mixed up into one awful bill.An earlier version of this column misstated the given name of a law professor at N.Y.U.; he is Mitchell Kane, not Michael Kane.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poland Gets a New Prime Minister in Cabinet Reshuffle", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARSAW \u2014 Poland will get a new prime minister next week, the centerpiece of a cabinet reshuffle at the midpoint of the governing party\u2019s four-year term. But the party\u2019s undisputed leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, will retain the real behind-the-scenes power in the country\u2019s increasingly authoritarian government.Beata Szydlo, whom Mr. Kaczynski lifted from the ranks of the right-wing Law and Justice Party to become prime minister in 2015, offered her resignation at a meeting of its political committee on Thursday, said Beata Mazurek, the party spokeswoman. It was accepted.The new prime minister, Ms. Mazurek said, will be Mateusz Morawiecki, a former international banker and a favorite of Mr. Kaczynski who had been finance minister and a deputy prime minister. Ms. Szydlo will be given some other top job in the government, party officials said.The move will not become official until Parliament approves it next week, though that outcome is certain, as Law and Justice holds a solid parliamentary majority.The cabinet reshuffle had been expected for weeks amid reports that Mr. Kaczynski had become disenchanted with Ms. Szydlo and wanted a more internationally adept figure in the top ministerial job.Mr. Morawiecki, 49, a former banker, has conducted extensive business abroad and is fluent in several languages. He was seen by party leaders as better qualified to represent Poland to Western leaders, especially European Union officials who have seen the country\u2019s rightward drift as a threat to the bloc\u2019s unity.The move comes just a day before Poland\u2019s Parliament is expected to vote on new laws to alter the country\u2019s courts, a step that officials in Brussels have labeled a threat to the independence of the judiciary. Opposition leaders said the cabinet reshuffle was an attempt to deflect attention from that court vote. Protest groups plan to gather outside Parliament on Friday to oppose the court vote.When the governing party initially unveiled the laws last summer, it described them as \u201ccourt reform,\u201d but critics claimed they were an attempt to put the courts more firmly under the governing party\u2019s control, and tens of thousands of Poles took to the streets for more than a week.The protests stopped only when Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, vetoed two of the court bills and promised to write his own versions, which he unveiled in November.The moves to restructure Poland\u2019s courts caused the European Union to begin a process that could result in the invocation of Article 7, a part of the union\u2019s founding treaty that allows for the punishment of member nations that violate democratic standards. Though that could lead to economic sanctions against Poland, or even revocation of voting rights in the union, such an outcome is considered unlikely.Under the initial legislation presented last summer, the country\u2019s entire Supreme Court would have been forced to resign, with replacements to be determined by the governing party\u2019s justice minister. The new version, proposed by President Duda, lowers the retirement age for high court judges to 65, immediately forcing 40 percent of the 83-member court from office.European Union officials said this new version still threatened the rule of law in Poland.The cabinet reshuffle, which is also expected to include resignations or changes in portfolio for other ministers, is not unusual at the middle of a government\u2019s four-year term. It does not indicate a change of policy in the government.Ms. Szydlo thanked her supporters on Twitter on Thursday evening.\u201cThese two years were an amazing time,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand the service to Poland and Poles was an honor.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Marijuana Start-Ups, Shut Out From Banks, Turn to Private Backing", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurshipMarijuana is becoming legal in California, and entrepreneurs are rushing in with infused artisanal chocolates, specialized farming equipment and security teams to guard large hauls. On Jan. 1, companies will be able to produce and sell marijuana in the state, making it one of eight in the United States where the recreational use of cannabis has been legalized. But finding expertise and financing won\u2019t be easy.Cannabis-focused accelerators and investment companies aim to change that.These enterprises have long been a presence in Silicon Valley, offering mentoring and investment in exchange for an ownership stake. Companies that provide these types of resources are critical to expanding a nascent industry around legal marijuana, said Mr. Krane, if only because they can introduce its entrepreneurs to angel investors and other private capital sources.When the pair started, medical marijuana had been legal for two decades, but Gateway found many companies\u2019 business practices were still \u201cnot far departed from those of the black market,\u201d Mr. Larson said. With legal adult use in sight, the industry is making a rapid transition to more sophisticated, transparent and mainstream business practices, he said.Gateway now offers $50,000 in exchange for 5 percent of a company\u2019s ownership, and brings the management team of start-ups into its offices for about six months to work with experts, mentors and potential investors. Applicants present their business plans and answer questions on legal issues, trends and the competitive landscape. Mr. Larson sometimes assigns homework, asking founders to conduct customer interviews and do market research.Entrepreneurs bring a wide variety of ideas because the industry is just forming. For example, new apps, sensors and machinery help control growing conditions, save energy and reduce labor costs in greenhouses.Even \u201cthe boring areas\u201d of the marijuana industry offer terrific opportunities, said Mr. Larson, because growers are currently spread too thin. The same company might be cloning plants, harvesting crops, selling to dispensaries and making deliveries. \u201cThere may be eight different steps in their value chain that could be specialized\u201d and contracted out, he said.Increasing brand recognition for products and retailers is another major opportunity for start-ups. \u201cThere\u2019s no Starbucks or Nordstrom\u2019s yet \u2014 names that mean things to people,\u201d Mr. Larson said.Octavia Wellness now has a network of 80 \u201cwellness consultants\u201d who advise more than 1,100 clients in California, and will be expanding to Nevada, where both medical and recreational marijuana is legal. Ms. Tice said that legalizing recreational use will boost her sales considerably because people will no longer have to obtain a doctor\u2019s recommendation to buy her products.Companies like Big Rock, which has invested more than $10 million in the cannabis industry, are playing an important part in funding the industry\u2019s growth. \u201cStarting up a testing lab or a dispensary is extremely capital intensive,\u201d said Stephen Kaye, Big Rock\u2019s chief operating officer. Private firms can make decisions and move large amounts of money quickly, he said. He receives pitches every day from entrepreneurs, and is especially interested in medical research.Of course, there are other challenges. Evolving rules and regulations, like new packaging requirements, can add unexpected costs to processors and retailers. Companies forced to deal only in cash can run into safety and theft issues. Many small growers emerging from the black market \u201chave no idea how to run a commercial-scale facility,\u201d Mr. James of Marijuana Venture said.Despite the hurdles and uncertainty facing the industry, Mr. Larson of Gateway has remained optimistic. \u201cPeople are gaining confidence as legalization spreads, and the growth is going to be huge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trudeau Holiday on Aga Khan\u2019s Island Broke Ethics Law, Report Says", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 Last Christmas, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and his family were basking in the Caribbean sun on a private island owned by the Aga Khan, the billionaire philanthropist and spiritual leader of Ismaili Muslims.But after an adverse ruling on Wednesday about the vacation from Canada\u2019s conflict-of-interest and ethics commissioner, Mr. Trudeau said he would spend this holiday season at an official residence a short drive from Ottawa and in the Canadian Rockies.Ms. Dawson found that Mr. Trudeau was not a personal friend of the Aga Khan, not in the legal sense, and should not have accepted the holiday. \u201cMr. Trudeau must ensure that he has arranged his private affairs so that they are not incompatible with his public duties,\u201d Ms. Dawson wrote.Speaking with reporters, Mr. Trudeau said he accepted the report\u2019s findings and would clear future personal holidays through the ethics commissioners\u2019 office. He also apologized.\u201cIt is important that as we move forward, we learn from this mistake,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said.The apology did not satisfy opposition parties in Parliament, whose members have repeatedly used the daily question period to challenge the prime minister about the trip.\u201cI had a lot of hope in this government, I had a lot of hope in this prime minister,\u201d Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party, told reporters. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned today is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has broken the law \u2014 there is no other way to put it but that he has broken the law with respect to ethics.\u201dOf Mr. Trudeau and his Liberal Party colleagues, Mr. Singh added, \u201cThey exist in a world where they don\u2019t understand the realities of everyday Canadians.\u201dThe ethics investigation hinged on two questions. The first was whether Mr. Trudeau broke Canadian law by accepting a ride on the Aga Khan\u2019s personal helicopter from Nassau to the compound at Bells Cay. The other issue was whether the Aga Khan was Mr. Trudeau\u2019s personal friend. Under Canadian law, the prime minister can accept gifts like holidays from friends and family members.Pierre Trudeau, the former prime minister and father of the current one, was close to the Aga Khan, whom he first met in the 1960s. The elder Mr. Trudeau welcomed the refugees from Uganda at the Aga Khan\u2019s request.Repeatedly on Wednesday, Justin Trudeau described the Aga Khan as a \u201cclose family friend.\u201d But in her report, Ms. Dawson found that their only contact between 1983 and 2013 was at the funeral of Pierre Trudeau 17 years ago, when the Aga Khan served as a pallbearer.\u201cThere were no private interactions between Mr. Trudeau and the Aga Khan until Mr. Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party of Canada,\u201d Ms. Dawson wrote. \u201cThis led me to conclude that their relationship cannot be described as one of friends for the purposes of the act.\u201dAnd while the report supported Mr. Trudeau\u2019s earlier comments in which he said that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police recommended that for security reasons he use the Aga Khan\u2019s helicopter for the 65-mile trip to the island retreat, Ms. Dawson rejected his contention that there were no other viable travel options.\u201cThe circumstances surrounding the acceptance of the private air travel were not exceptional,\u201d she wrote. Canadian cabinet ministers and other public officials were barred from accepting flights on private aircraft several years ago after it emerged that some corporations were regularly providing them with air service.While opposition politicians had focused on the trip last Christmas, the report found that Mr. Trudeau or his family had been the guests of the Aga Khan on three occasions. Their first was in December 2014. And in March 2016, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, and a friend traveled with their children to the island.Mr. Trudeau said Wednesday that his family had a \u201cstanding invitation from the Aga Khan.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article gave an incorrect conversion to American dollars for the Canadian government\u2019s contribution to the Aga Khan Foundation Canada. The contribution of 49 million Canadian dollars is worth about $38 million at current exchange rates, not $63 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Working in Philanthropy, Then Finding Himself in Need", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Neediest Cases FundKenneth Dillard Jr. remembers the day he committed to improving the lives of others instead of his own.Just before Mr. Dillard left his position as an accountant at the firm Coopers & Lybrand in 1979, the head of human resources took him to the Rainbow Room in Manhattan to woo him to stay at the company over a steak dinner. His mind, however, had already been made up.\u201cI don\u2019t need to make a million bucks,\u201d Mr. Dillard said this fall, recalling his thinking at that time. \u201cI just want to be comfortable. If there\u2019s excess, I want to share it.\u201dFor much of his life, Mr. Dillard, 68, worked for nonprofit organizations, hoping to help others. But over the past nine years, Mr. Dillard himself has been in need of assistance. He has struggled to find work and was priced out of his apartment in Manhattan, leaving him homeless for nearly three years.Following his mentor\u2019s advice, he began to take his education seriously and in 1975 earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business science from Baruch College, part of the City University of New York.\u201cHe was someone who I regarded highly,\u201d Mr. Dillard said. \u201cWhen he would talk to me about things like that I would listen.\u201dAfter college, Mr. Dillard worked as an auditor at Coopers & Lybrand, gaining the experience required to be a licensed certified public accountant. While at the firm, he realized that his career interests lay in the nonprofit sector and soon found work as an auditor at the IP Foundation, the philanthropic arm of International Paper that provides grants to nonprofit organizations.In the early 1980s, Mr. Dillard returned to Operation Crossroads Africa as its director of finance. Although Mr. Dillard said he had found being employed by that organization rewarding and enjoyed traveling for work to West African nations like Nigeria, his tenure there lasted less time than he would have liked because of a management shake-up a few years after his arrival.After Mr. Dillard left the organization for a second time he struggled to find steady work. In 1990, Mr. Dillard began the first of several part-time accounting jobs at the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, a nonprofit organization. By 1995, he found steady, but part-time consulting work for the New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts through a temp agency. He came close to finding a full-time job in 2001, but the offer was rescinded two days after the collapse of the twin towers.\u201cThey didn\u2019t need me or they had other issues that they needed to tend to,\u201d Mr. Dillard said. \u201cAnd then that was pretty much around that time there were no jobs being offered.\u201dAfter this rejection, Mr. Dillard continued to search fruitlessly for a full-time job. Although he was unable to secure one, he occasionally found work through a temp agency as a consultant or bookkeeper, including at Food Bank NYC and the United Nations Development Programme.The income he earned was not enough to cover the rising rent on his Manhattan apartment. In 2008, no longer able to afford the rent, he became homeless.He spent nearly three years sleeping at his sister\u2019s apartment in Brownsville, Brooklyn, as well as at city shelters, before being placed in supportive housing at Hunterfly Trace in Brownsville. Mr. Dillard stayed there for seven years. During that time, because of his age, he began to consider himself retired but continued to pursue short-term employment opportunities.Mr. Dillard, who receives monthly assistance totaling $1,356, which includes Social Security Income and food stamps, could not afford to furnish his new space. In April, the organization used $630 from the fund to buy him a couch and a sofa bed.\u201cI\u2019ve never had a bed this big,\u201d he said.Mr. Dillard said he was starting to feel at home in his new neighborhood and seeking volunteer work at food pantries. Although he previously focused on looking for jobs in the nonprofit industry, he has expanded his search to the private sector.Mr. Dillard said he was inspired to persevere by his hero, Senator John McCain of Arizona, a former prisoner of war who, at age 81, is battling cancer while continuing to serve his country.\u201cHe\u2019s still working. And I shouldn\u2019t be?\u201d Mr. Dillard said. \u201cNo.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the kind of housing lottery that Mr. Dillard won. It was run by Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens; it was not a city housing lottery. (The error was repeated in a picture caption.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leave the Johnson Amendment Alone", "Date": "2017-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs the House and the Senate seek agreement on tax reform, they will have to decide the fate of the so-called Johnson amendment. This provision of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits tax-exempt charities from electioneering \u2014 that is, from becoming involved in any way in a candidate\u2019s campaign for elected office. The tax reform bill passed by the House last month loosened this prohibition to the point where it would no longer prohibit much. The Senate\u2019s tax reform bill made no change to current law.The breadth of the House proposal is far from clear. When are activities \u201cregular and customary\u201d? When is an expense \u201cde minimis\u201d (meaning insignificant) or \u201cincremental\u201d? If this uncertain standard becomes law, the I.R.S. will need to give charities and potential donors guidance about the meaning of those terms. Whatever rules the I.R.S. announces, they are sure to be fraught with complication.But no matter what the I.R.S. says, the amendment in the House bill would open the floodgates to politicking by charities. Charities today make enormous use of social media. A charity\u2019s webpage often serves as its most important public gateway. Nothing in the House revision of the Johnson amendment forbids speeches, sermons, policy discussions or other activities that include electioneering from being posted on that webpage, streamed or tweeted. Communicating this way would cost the charity next to nothing and would probably qualify as a \u201cde minimis\u201d expense. In our digital era, the communicative impact of an exception for de minimis financial outlays is far more than de minimis.The sponsors of the proposed change to the Johnson amendment may have intended to permit only brief, occasional instances of electioneering. We know that established charities, particularly churches, engage in such activity now. But the House proposal, if enacted as written, will do far more than bless current practice. Given that the I.R.S. is already suffering from too few enforcement resources, the I.R.S. may well hesitate to take action against possible violations of this de minimis limit. As a practical matter, a de minimis exception will come close to repealing the Johnson amendment completely.Other tax-exempt organizations (such as section 501(c)(4) welfare organizations) can already engage in electioneering to a considerable extent. The Johnson amendment does not apply to them. But it is precisely because of the Johnson amendment\u2019s prohibition on electioneering that charities have been a sanctuary in our increasingly partisan world. Over time, permitting charities to engage directly in electoral politics will reduce the respect they have long been afforded. In the long run, it will harm the sector. That is why so many charities, including many religious organizations, have opposed any change to the Johnson amendment.Contributions to charities are deductible; contributions to PACs and section 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations are not. Because charities can have enormous influence on political campaigns with very little expense, many who wish to intervene in political campaigns will shift their contribution from PACs and social welfare organizations to charities. Currently, the House proposal operates for five years, from Jan. 1, 2019, to Dec. 31, 2023. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the revenue loss for this five-year period at $2.1 billion. This number probably underestimates the actual cost of the House\u2019s proposed change to the Johnson amendment. Charities that make a decision to electioneer will attract large donations from donors who would like to obtain deductions and influence elections in one fell swoop.The House proposal also encourages the establishment of new entities to take advantage of the revised rules. These newly created organizations would establish their own norms as to what is \u201cregular and customary.\u201d In short order, organizations would be formed precisely to take advantage of this new electioneering rule.Under our current campaign finance regime, only dollars that have been subject to income tax can be used for electioneering. A de minimis exception for electioneering by charities will undermine this basic principle. It will harm both the law regulating charities and the law regulating campaign finance. Our country will be far poorer for such changes.The Senate version of tax reform does not alter the Johnson amendment. Its position should prevail. During reconciliation, the House amendment to the Johnson amendment should be dropped.Ellen P. Aprill is a professor of tax law at Loyola Law School.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roy Moore\u2019s Alabama", "Date": "2017-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorARLEY, Ala. \u2014 I recently drove the back roads from Birmingham for over two hours before I finally found a sign for Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for the United States Senate, outside the Arley Coffee Shop. A retired coal miner who frequents what the cashier called the \u201cliars\u2019 table\u201d put it to me in the familiar Winston County way. \u201cThe women,\u201d he said of Mr. Moore\u2019s accusers, were lying to make him look like a sexual predator. \u201cGroping,\u201d he added, \u201cused to be all right anyway.\u201dThe Free State of Winston is Alabama\u2019s most distinctive political culture, and now it may be the center of America\u2019s current political convulsion. Winstonians tend to go to one side or another in a big way, and they don\u2019t care what the rest of the world thinks. According to one historical account, the residents voted 515 to 128 for an antebellum legislator who promised to oppose the Ordinance of Secession that took Alabama out of the Union in 1861. Today they believe President Trump is an untarnished Republican savior and are cheering his endorsement of Mr. Moore.Arley\u2019s hereditary Republicanism was fiercely populist before Donald Trump. These hill-country farmers defied the greedy plantation masters who split the Union. Now they\u2019re contemptuous of both the national Republican Party and the elitist Republicans in Alabama cities who are seen as wanting to punish Mr. Moore because working-class Republicans nominated him over the sitting senator, Luther Strange.An innocuous lawyer and former state attorney general appointed to replace Jeff Sessions when he became attorney general, \u201cBig Luther\u201d would have won Tuesday\u2019s oddly timed election in a landslide, even though he was financed by the super PAC aligned with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, regarded hereabout as a satanic figure. Polls show the race between Mr. Moore and the Democrat, Doug Jones, is a tossup now, probably because suburban Republican women and independents shunned Mr. Moore after reports of a number of allegations against him, including that he molested a 14-year-old girl and cruised shopping malls for other high schoolers while in his 30s.I have closely studied Winston County history and have long been proud of my ancestral ties. I wanted to explore whether traditional Republicanism could fully explain how the Old South\u2019s most independent thinkers became Trump zombies willing now to send a plausibly accused pedophile to the Senate rather than a Democrat.This political contest has blasted away middle ground that once existed here in Arley.In my memory, the symbol of that vanished comity was the hickory tree in the yard of my grandfather Robert Cyle Walker, a Republican justice of the peace whose farm is now a well-groomed city park.The hickory tree, which stood hard by the unpaved road at the northeast corner of my grandparents\u2019 front yard, is gone. So is the bipartisan flexibility it symbolized in the alliance of an anti-Wallace Democrat like Mr. Elliott and my grandfather, a conservative populist Republican. Like much of Appalachia, Winston County had very few slaves, and black people now account for less than 1 percent of the residents. A visiting Canadian journalist wrote recently that folks here are tight-lipped around outside reporters. The Walker graves in the Baptist cemetery give me dirt-road cred, but I didn\u2019t push too hard. These people fear being depicted as \u201ctotal rednecks\u201d and argue urgently that they do not fit the stereotype. Neat brick bungalows have replaced ramshackle farmhouses. The community center conducts weekly yoga and aerobics classes, and the literary society convenes once a month.But if you scratch this hard North Alabama soil, you\u2019ll find Native American arrowheads and a secret dissent, like the patriotism that led rampaging Confederate guerrillas to loot the farms of Winston men who joined the Union Army. Lost Cause historians at the University of Alabama watered down the radical nature of Winston\u2019s devotion to the Union. A misleading statue in Double Springs, showing a soldier in a uniform that is half Union and half Confederate, disguises the fact that Winston provided more troops to the Union Army than to the Confederate. Records in the National Archives show that my great-great grandfather, Hial Abbott, who farmed near here, was a key figure in a local underground that sneaked mountain boys through the Confederate lines to enlist for the North.In Arley, women are the rebels in the current election. \u201cAll those women who are coming forward, they\u2019re not making it up,\u201d a female civic leader told me over coffee within sight of the \u201cliars\u2019 table.\u201d This gender division exists in the household of Mavinee and Odis Bishop. Mrs. Bishop greeted me at the door saying, \u201cYour grandfather married us 72 years ago when my husband was home from the war.\u201d Mr. Bishop, a veteran of the Battle of the Bulge, said he had drifted over to the Democrats when Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal paid him and his jobless friends to work on the kind of infrastructure projects promised by candidate Trump. But he sees modern Democrats as detached from common folk. He\u2019ll vote for Mr. Moore and intends to \u201csway\u201d his wife from her plan to support Mr. Jones.\u201cNo, he won\u2019t,\u201d Mrs. Bishop said in that firm Free State way as she stepped in from the kitchen.There in a nutshell are the swing factors that will determine this election. Upper-income suburbs in the state\u2019s major cities are covered with Doug Jones signs, foreshadowing a powerful Republican soccer-mom rejection of Mr. Moore\u2019s purported predation. Older Republican women whisper about lobbying their female friends to do the unthinkable and vote for the Democrat.The other swing factor, of course, is race. Mr. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, needs a strong black turnout in Birmingham and the Black Belt to go along with disaffected Republicans who are now putting up a fresh batch of \u201cG.O.P. for Jones\u201d signs in their yards.In a sense we are all Alabamians now, wincing when sophisticates abroad satirize our willingness to be beguiled by abnormality. Electing Mr. Jones, who is admired nationally for prosecuting racial crimes, would be a cultural watershed for Alabama voters and a sign that the Trump base will fracture with unexpected ease. Deep in their bones, Alabamians know that if Roy Moore goes to Washington, the wardrobe department at \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d will surely accommodate them by finding a cowboy vest, a tiny pistol and a Girl Scout dress, and they\u2019re prepared to feel very put upon.Howell Raines is a former executive editor of The New York Times.Advertisement"}

He called Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris deal \u201cvery bad news,\u201d but added that \u201cmany have decided to not necessarily accept the American federal government\u2019s decision to leave the Paris agreement.\u201d\u201cSecond, we are not going fast enough,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cWhat we are starting today is the time of action, because the urgency has become permanent and the challenge of our generation is to act.\u201dSeveral announcements by states, companies and international organizations were made at the meeting, aimed at helping industries and poorer countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and at shifting private investment away from fossil fuels toward cleaner, renewable energies.Other announcements included the creation of a space observatory for climate research, a five-year initiative of 220 global investors to step up pressure on the 100 companies that emit the most greenhouse gas, and the start of a carbon pricing market, initiated by Mexico, to connect different regions of the Americas that have put a price tag on carbon, including California, Quebec and Ontario.But the leaders at the summit meeting did not announce new binding requirements to curb carbon emissions and did not unlock significant new funds to help developing countries transition away from fossil fuel economies.Jovenel Mo\u00efse, the president of Haiti, said that richer countries were lagging in their commitments. Industrialized nations have pledged to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and address the effects of climate change.\u201cWe left Bonn with the feeling that the job was unfinished,\u201d said Lucile Dufour, who follows international negotiations on climate change for R\u00e9seau Action Climat, a French advocacy group. \u201cStates made big speeches, but without any concrete or ambitious measures.\u201dTuesday\u2019s meeting left her with a similar impression, she said. \u201cThe urgency is there in the speeches, but the announcements aren\u2019t.\u201dStill, some said the summit meeting on Tuesday showed increased awareness of climate change issues at the business and local level.Attendees included the United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres; Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain; President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico; and Gov.

{"Headline": "Can Steve Bannon Realign American Politics?", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Bannon has insisted that his intraparty efforts in a \u201cseason of war\u201d on the Republican establishment are about nothing less than a basic reorientation of what the parties fight about and who is on which side.The term for that is \u201cparty realignment.\u201d Overhyped claims of an overturned political order are a staple of American politics \u2014 just ask the last would-be architect of a new Republican majority coalition, Karl Rove. Mr. Bannon is hardly alone, however, in seeing the potential for realignment in the volatile electoral party dynamics that carried Donald Trump to the White House.But realignments are made, not born. A recent outbreak of Republican congressional retirement announcements reflects fears of a Democratic wave in next year\u2019s midterms more than any clear pattern of looming party transformation. Still, the volatile electoral dynamics that carried Mr. Trump to the White House offer the potential for activists, organized groups and political elites to restructure party conflict. There is no substitute for this work to be done on a sustained, long-term basis \u2014 measured in decades rather than an election cycle or two.What would a realignment amount to? The contemporary divide between the Democratic and Republican Parties closely aligns with an ideological divide between what we call modern liberalism (a bundle of issue positions favoring activist and redistributive government and cultural tolerance and cosmopolitanism, and more) and modern conservatism (a bundle of positions favoring limited government and cultural traditionalism, and more).If one party definitively shifted its position on an important subset of those issues \u2014 if the Republican Party shifted left on entitlements, for instance \u2014 the response by the other party could bring about a realignment. That\u2019s what Mr. Bannon says he\u2019s after.More frequently, the nature of Mr. Bannon\u2019s envisioned realignment appears different, and darker \u2014 centered around racial and ethnic identity. Breitbart\u2019s output under Mr. Bannon\u2019s editorial control and the Trump who brought us the wall, the Muslim ban and the response to Charlottesville, Va., are consistent with the goal of a cross-class party coalition of whites united by whiteness. Economics wouldn\u2019t be what defines the coalition \u2014 white nationalism would.By contrast, a serious pursuit of reforms that could advantage \u201cpopulists\u201d might include changes to the campaign finance system, which currently facilitates the very party dominance by plutocrats that Mr. Bannon denounces.If the potential is out there in the electorate to reshuffle the deck of political alliances and conflict, how would a serious realigner actually do it? Such a person might look at the very realignment that produced our current, polarized age.Starting in the postwar years and throughout the second half of the 20th century, politicians in both parties deliberately pursued their reorientation around modern liberalism and conservatism. National politics at midcentury involved historically high levels of bipartisanship: Conservative Southerners remained an empowered force in the Democratic Party; liberal and moderate Republicans were frequent occupants of East and West Coast statehouses and Senate seats.Key intellectuals, activists and politicians on both the left and the right came to share a systemic critique of the parties\u2019 fuzzy programmatic overlap, as well as a democratic argument for forging disciplined, ideologically distinct parties in their stead. When, say, the United Auto Workers passed a resolution in the 1950s calling for a \u201creal realignment\u201d of the party system producing a \u201cclear demarcation\u201d between a liberal party and a conservative one, the liberal union was echoing contemporaneous sentiments expressed by the editors of National Review, who criticized the \u201cfatuous\u201d celebration of \u201cbipartisanship\u201d and heralded a \u201ctwo-party system that fights its feuds in public and honestly.\u201dThe polarizers\u2019 efforts involved both coalitional and institutional work. A postwar generation of issue-driven liberal activists battled to wrest control of Democratic organizations from traditional political machines while challenging the clout of conservative Southerners within the national party. On the right, intellectuals and operatives incorporated racial elements into a broader conservative ideology that helped to facilitate Republican forays into the Solid South. In the aftermath of the 1960s, meanwhile, movement activists like Heather Booth and Michael Harrington worked with the progressive wing of organized labor to reconstitute a labor-liberal alliance at the base of the Democratic Party, while New Right political brokers like Phyllis Schlafly and Paul Weyrich secured a lasting partnership between Republicans and a nascent Christian right.Key activists recognized the party system as a system. Transforming it would require not just ideological advocacy but reform of the party organizations themselves and the governmental institutions in which they operated. Liberal Democrats pursed congressional reforms that ended the sanctity of seniority and the autonomy of committees \u2014 which had long advantaged Southerners \u2014 while concentrating new powers in a party leadership accountable to rank-and-file sentiment. Others instituted reforms of the Democratic presidential nominating procedure that opened them up to popular participation. These reforms rendered the political system more permeable and responsive to ideological activism, with long-term consequences for the parties\u2019 ideological sorting. By drawing new party lines across an array of issues while rendering the parties vehicles for issue-oriented politics, the polarizers helped to construct our political world.The story of how such a system came to be forged tells us something about what it would take to transform it. The ideologically defined partisan conflict that currently structures our politics is not the only world possible. But changing it would take as much collective and long-term effort as it took the polarizers to bring it about in the first place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Years of Attack Leave Obamacare a More Government-Focused Health Law", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Affordable Care Act was conceived as a mix of publicly funded health care and privately purchased insurance, but Republican attacks, culminating this month in the death of a mandate that most Americans have insurance, are shifting the balance, giving the government a larger role than Democrats ever anticipated.In short, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement is becoming more like what conservatives despise \u2014 government-run health care \u2014 thanks in part to Republican efforts that are raising premiums for people without government assistance and allowing them to skirt coverage.By ending the tax penalty for people who do not have coverage, beginning in 2019, Republicans may hasten the flight of customers who now pay the full cost of their insurance. Among those left behind under the umbrella of the Affordable Care Act would be people of modest means who qualify for Medicaid or receive sizable subsidies for private insurance.\u201cRepublicans have inadvertently strengthened the hand of Democrats like me who prefer richer subsidies to a mandate and welcome the expanded federal role that will come with those subsidies,\u201d said Joel S. Ario, a former insurance commissioner from Pennsylvania who worked in the Obama administration.In days, the Trump administration is expected to carry out an executive order with proposed rules that would allow people to buy less expensive \u2014 and less comprehensive \u2014 coverage, through either business and professional associations or short-term private policies.The Affordable Care Act\u2019s success in reducing the number of uninsured owes more to Medicaid than to private health insurance. About 75 million people are now enrolled in Medicaid, a number that has increased by about one-third since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act. A smaller number, about 10 million, buy coverage from private insurers through the health law\u2019s marketplace.Among people ages 18 to 64, the proportion with private health insurance coverage is about the same today as in 2005, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. But the proportion with public insurance coverage has increased to more than 19 percent, from 11.5 percent in 2005, and the share of people in that age range who are uninsured has fallen to 12.5 percent, from about 19 percent.In total, more than one-third of the population is covered with federal assistance, through Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the military and Affordable Care Act subsidies. (And that does not include the larger group of people who benefit from tax subsidies for health insurance provided by employers.)Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress failed this year in their efforts to cut Medicaid and could try again in 2018. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said this month that Republicans would try next year to slow the growth of federal health spending because \u201cit\u2019s the health care entitlements that are the big drivers of our debt.\u201dA Democratic wave election in November could also shift the balance of power in a few other state capitals.While the marketplaces, or exchanges, have struggled with a series of problems since they opened in 2014, Medicaid, administered by an experienced corps of state officials, has gone from strength to strength. Public appreciation for the program has steadily increased as people come to understand its importance in the health care system, including its central role in combating the opioid epidemic.And though Congress has effectively repealed the requirement for people to have health insurance, federal subsidies are still available to low- and moderate-income people who want insurance. The federal government pays, on average, about three-fourths of the premium for more than three-fourths of the people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.Insurers are still required to provide coverage to anyone who applies. They cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a person\u2019s pre-existing conditions. And people receiving premium subsidies are generally insulated against insurance price increases.By contrast, the sharp increases in premiums in many markets this year have made insurance less attractive and less affordable for middle-income people who do not receive subsidies. The brunt of premium increases falls on people who must pay the entire cost themselves \u2014 an individual with annual income over $48,240 or a family of four with income over $98,400.Mr. McConnell says he remains committed to bringing to a vote early next year two bills to stabilize insurance markets. One would restore government subsidies to insurance companies to help cover out-of-pocket expenses for low-income customers. Another would offer money to states to lower premiums, perhaps by setting up \u201creinsurance\u201d programs to cover the highest-cost customers with serious illnesses.Mr. Trump appeared to embrace some kind of bipartisan health care legislation on Tuesday with a Twitter post from his resort in Palm Beach, Fla.: \u201cBased on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill, which essentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare, the Democrats & Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan!\u2019\u2019But even with those measures, health policy experts say they expect the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplaces to be populated increasingly by consumers who qualify for financial assistance or have clear medical needs.\u201cIt seems to me that the exchanges will evolve into an extended form of government coverage very much akin to Medicaid,\u201d said J. B. Silvers, a professor of health care finance at Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland. Increasingly, he said, \u201cthose who are not subsidized will drop out because of the high prices, and those getting the subsidy will still see great bargains,\u201d after taking account of the subsidies.When the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, the Congressional Budget Office expected that the insurance exchanges would be more important than Medicaid in expanding coverage. The reverse has been true.\u201cEnrollment in the exchanges is nothing like what anyone expected,\u201d said Daniel N. Mendelson, the president of Avalere Health, a research and consulting company. \u201cRepeal of the mandate will probably serve to take out some relatively healthy people who think they can coast by without insurance. What we will have left is a heavily subsidized high-risk pool for low-income people who are not eligible for Medicaid.\u201dCongress\u2019s decision to eliminate the individual mandate means that healthier people with less need for insurance are less likely to buy it. The remaining pool of insurance buyers will have higher costs, on average, so insurers will increase premiums even more. And when premiums rise, consumers are entitled to larger subsidies from the federal government to help defray the higher costs.In some ways, Medicaid is more generous than commercial insurers. The benefits are more comprehensive, and coverage is nearly free, with beneficiaries required to pay only nominal amounts. While Medicaid is a government program, most states contract with private insurers to deliver and manage care.Among the few companies that have been successful on the Affordable Care Act exchanges are insurers like Centene that have experience in Medicaid.\u201cThe reason so many people are on Medicaid,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, \u201cis that so many people have low incomes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Tax Bill May Inspire Cuts Globally, While Fueling Trade Tensions", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe overhaul is already threatening economic relations, adding to concerns that Mr. Trump is advancing a nationalistic agenda at the expense of other countries.European leaders this week raised the prospect of a trade battle, implying that they may fight the new tax rules before the World Trade Organization. Chinese officials are readying defensive measures to protect the country\u2019s economy and its competitiveness.On Friday, Mr. Trump again emphasized his \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantra, saying at a signing ceremony that the tax bill would mean more jobs and investment in the United States. \u201cA lot of things are going to be happening in the U.S.A.,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring back our companies. They\u2019ve already started coming back.\u201dIt all starts with the corporate tax rate.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge incentive to governments around the world who want to see more investment to be part of that,\u201d said Andrew Mackenzie, the chief executive of the mining giant BHP, which has its headquarters in Australia and major operations in North and South America. \u201cThey will have to follow suit.\u201dCorporate rates were already on a downward trajectory. Many countries have used low taxes as an advantage over the United States, which offers a huge domestic market, plentiful venture capital and relatively light workplace regulation.\u201cThere will be pressure for a new round of lowering corporate taxes,\u201d said Stefano Micossi, the director general of Assonime, an Italian association of publicly listed companies.China, a frequent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s over its trade practices, may also be forced to play the tax game.For all of its appeal as a manufacturing hub thanks to its skilled work force, solid infrastructure and other benefits, China charges high taxes. On top of a standard corporate rate of 25 percent, companies are required to make social security contributions and other payments that push their tax burden higher there than it is in many other countries.Last week, China\u2019s vice finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, pledged to \u201ctake proactive measures\u201d in response to the tax overhaul, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency. \u201cThe external impact of tax policy change in the world\u2019s largest economy cannot be overlooked,\u201d Mr. Zhu said, according to Xinhua.Mr. Zhu did not offer details about the measures China might take, but they could include streamlining regulations that foreign businesses face, or deferring certain taxes if money is reinvested locally, according to Andrew Choy, a tax partner for Greater China at EY.Deep in the tax package\u2019s fine print were provisions that looked like protectionism to Asian and European companies.The European Commission, which manages the European Union, objected to a tax break that companies in the United States would get for so-called foreign-derived intangible income \u2014 money they make from selling property or services abroad.The legislation would cut taxes for corporations. American taxpayers, in large part, would also get cuts, though most of the changes affecting them would expire after 2025.The measure is supposed to encourage companies to produce goods in the United States and sell them overseas. But European officials said the provision appeared to violate agreements among countries against subsidizing their exports.\u201cThe commission will reflect on all possible measures that may need to be taken if the bill enters into force as agreed today,\u201d the commission said in a statement. \u201cAll options are on the table.\u201d\u201cAs the world\u2019s largest economy, we would expect the U.S. to ensure that tax reform will be nondiscriminatory and in line with its W.T.O. obligations,\u201d the commission said.The provision is meant to keep companies from shifting income to low-tax countries. But it adds a levy to some transactions between a bank or insurance company\u2019s American operations and its foreign affiliates, which would affect real deals, not just tax maneuvers. The Swiss bank Credit Suisse said on Friday that it would have to cut $2.3 billion from fourth-quarter profit because of the new tax regime.The tax \u201cmay harmfully distort international financial markets,\u201d a group of European finance ministers wrote to officials in the United States last week.In China, officials are preparing to deal with a wrinkle unique to their country: a challenge to tough Chinese laws that keep money from leaving its borders.\u201cCompanies know that when they send money to China, it\u2019s basically a one-way gate,\u201d said Christopher Balding, an associate professor of finance at the Peking University HSBC School of Business in Shenzhen, China.Some Chinese officials worry that the tax measure will cause more American companies to try to take money out and are mulling new restrictions on capital flows. The newly approved tax incentives could appeal to companies that are frustrated by China\u2019s rising labor costs, ambitious local competitors and tangled legal systems, or that would rather spend their money at home or elsewhere.Companies with big investment plans in China would probably prefer to keep the money there than to bring it home; others may simply want to keep it there on a bet that China\u2019s currency will strengthen in value.Patrick Yip, a tax partner at Deloitte China, estimated that his clients \u2014 large companies with many years of experience in China \u2014 could move $20 million to $30 million on average from the country over the next year. Some clients who have accumulated as much as $80 million or $90 million in recent years could look to bring that money back, he said.\u201cWe have clients who are in the process of thinking about where to deploy their investments,\u201d he said.Alexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong and Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "The reputation of Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution in IDC's report is well deserved. In fact, since its introduction into the government cloud market in 2013, Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution has achieved steady growth in customer size and has excelled in both government cloud service capabilities and technologies, helping Huawei become a recognized brand among the industry's finest.The government cloud provides not only the main evolution direction of the IT infrastructure of government sectors but also the platform of the Smart City and even the future Smart Society. Huawei has a clear e-Government cloud strategy. By working with partners and customers to build a government cloud ecosystem, Huawei offers simplicity and improved performance to get the best out of the government cloud solutions. Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution facilitates digital transformation of government sectors, helping government IT develop with smart societies, today and in the future.Following its debut in 2013 in China's government cloud market, Huawei transformed itself by building up a solid customer base with more than 230 government sectors, including 16 national ministries covering such departments as national information centers, finance departments, customs offices and tax bureaus. Other partners include multiple provincial governments such as Beijing, Jiangxi and Tianjin, as well as more than 200 local governments. Huawei has excelled in government cloud markets in China, enhancing its reputation as one of the industry\u2019s finest.Here are just some of the reasons customers choose Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution:Huawei believes that the government cloud construction cannot be completed overnight but should be planned and built in three steps: First build the government cloud platform, then deploy the government data support platform, and then construct the government application support and Big Data platforms. These three steps can effectively address challenges in government cloud construction and help achieve the goal of the government cloud. In terms of success cases, Huawei has cooperated with Wuhan University GeoStar, a well-known GIS software developer in China, to build a spatiotemporal information cloud platform. As an important part of the Smart Xuzhou e-Government cloud project, the platform brings together historical information, current status, real-time information and future planning information of Xuzhou City to improve essential government affairs, such as social governance, emergency command and major decision-making.In the \"central nervous system\" of the Smart Traffic project in Shenzhen, Huawei and Shenzhen Traffic Police set up a unified data collection, analysis and processing platform to share, integrate and leverage information resources in a Big Data resource pool. The platform is able to carry all data from the traffic grid with full interconnection and complete analysis capabilities. Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution helps deliver high-quality and efficient traffic services for the entire city.Another example is the Jiaxing e-Government cloud project jointly constructed by Huawei, Jiaxing Telecom and Jiaxing municipal government. Since its deployment, this project has had a major influence in daily activities of Jiaxing's citizens in terms of education, healthcare, and local business. In Huawei's opinion, the government cloud solution involves tens of thousands of fields in society, making it impossible for a single enterprise to monopolize the market. Instead, every partner and customer dedicated to a specific field is the expert most familiar with the requirements of the field. Only by leveraging the strength of the ecosystem can Huawei deliver the most practical and comprehensive solution that meets specific industry requirements. Such careful consideration and determination are why Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution has become the top choice for customers.As one of the world's leading data research companies, IDC has a strict set of standards for evaluating vendors in the government cloud market. After considering Huawei, Aliyun, Tencent Cloud, Inspur and other vendors and analyzing each of their current capabilities, future strategies and market performance, IDC rates Huawei top in the leaders quadrant in China's government cloud market.According to IDC, the advantages of Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution are as follows:The four aspects revealed by IDC are the distinguishing features of Huawei as an IT and cloud infrastructure supplier. These advantages have become a driving force for the continuous growth of Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution.Huawei enters the government cloud market as a participant. Through years of gaining rich experience in the e-Government field, Huawei has become a heavyweight player in the government cloud arena and has grown into a leading figure. Huawei's growth from a participant to a leader is attributed to the following three aspects:As another example, in terms of partner enablement and incentives, Huawei has established a joint innovation lab and started the Developer Enablement Plan to promote and optimize the ecosystem, so that the ecosystem will maintain its maximum vitality. As the saying goes, \"As you sow, so shall you reap\" \u2014 a seed sown with proper temperature and soil will bear desirable fruit. In the government cloud market, Huawei has good products and comprehensive product lines. Moreover, Huawei is empowered not only with customer recognition and partner support, but also with insights, strategies and implementation measures. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that Huawei Cloud becomes a leader in China's e-Government cloud market.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
