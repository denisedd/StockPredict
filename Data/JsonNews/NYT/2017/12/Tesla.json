{"Headline": "Trying to Bypass Anxiety on the Road to Driverless Cars", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGOTEBORG, Sweden \u2014 One of the big unknowns about self-driving cars is how human drivers will react once they can hand off the tasks of steering, braking and avoiding obstacles to a combination of unseen sensors, software and computer chips under the hood.Volvo Cars is trying to find an answer. It is putting video cameras into cars equipped with its latest driver-assistance features and giving them to five families to record their actions while rolling along in highway traffic.The aim is to gather data that will help Volvo develop fully autonomous cars for highway use by 2021, Marcus Rothoff, a Volvo executive heading the project, said at an event here Monday. By then, the person in the driver\u2019s seat will be able to watch a movie while the car navigates the morning commute, he said \u2014 but only if people are comfortable letting go of control.\u201cIf you don\u2019t trust the car, you can\u2019t do other things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make a car that people trust and have confidence in.\u201dThe XC90 sport-utility vehicles involved are equipped with sensors and cameras that monitor the eyes, faces and feet of the person in the driver\u2019s seat. Like all XC90s, they are outfitted with driver-assistance technology that maintains a certain speed, keeps the car in its lane on the highway and maintains a distance from the car in front. The driver must keep a hand on the wheel at all times, or an alarm goes off.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Automakers like Volvo \u2014 which since 2010 has been owned by Geely Holding of China \u2014 have fretted over the challenge of managing the interaction between a human driver and a car capable of driving itself, especially in critical moments when the driver needs to resume control of the vehicle.Ford Motor has set a goal of producing a self-driving car with no steering wheel and no pedals by 2021, allowing time to make sure such technology can be managed safely.Federal investigators have determined the man failed to keep his hands on the steering wheel despite repeated warnings by the car. The cars\u2019 radar and cameras failed to see a tractor-trailer crossing the road in front of him, and neither the driver nor the car activated the brakes.Understanding the variations in human behavior is essential for Volvo, said Trent Victor, senior technical leader in crash avoidance and an adjunct professor of driving behavior at Chalmers University in Goteborg.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.\u201cThere are people who immediately jump in and trust the system,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people that are very reluctant. A system that is designed for a person that is hesitant has to be designed in a different way.\u201dUntil now, much of the discussion has centered on technology, the sensor and algorithms that control the vehicle. \u201cWe are taking the development of autonomous driving to another level, where we are studying the drivers\u2019 experiences,\u201d Mr. Victor said.Two families have already received the specially equipped cars, including Sasko and Anna Simonovski, who will use theirs for the commute to Goteborg from suburban Langedrag, a distance of six to eight miles, and to drive their two children to their activities.Mr. Simonovski, a manager in research and development at the software company Ericsson, applied online to take part in the project in September. \u201cBeing a bit nerdy on technology, I thought it would be interesting,\u201d he said.Since picking up the car on Wednesday, Mr. Simonovski said, he could already feel a subtle difference in his well-being during the commute.\u201cEven though I am responsible, I still find it less stressful in the rush-hour traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s another benefit that I think could improve even more with autonomy. I can\u2019t say I have done very much more with that time, other than it has made me feel more calm.\u201dHe has found one other change. \u201cI can browse through Spotify more,\u201d he said.Christina Anderson reported from Goteborg, and Neal E.

{"Headline": "How the Fingerling Caught On (Robot Grip and All) as 2017\u2019s Hot Toy", "Date": "2017-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout two years ago, Sydney Wiseman had a challenging assignment for an engineer at her family toy company.Sure, the engineer told her. What do you want the little monkey to do?Thus was born the Fingerling, a five-inch monkey that grips your finger with its legs and arms, as it babbles, blows kisses and blinks its eyes. Cradle a Fingerling in your hand and it drifts off to sleep. Press the Fingerling\u2019s head and it passes gas.Created by the Canadian company WowWee, the Fingerling has been anointed one of this year\u2019s hot toys for the holidays, a designation that most toymakers only dream of achieving.For decades, there has always been a must-have holiday toy \u2014 Cabbage Patch Kids, Beanie Babies, a Tickle Me Elmo doll. Parents drive long distances to scour stores for the one item in short supply at exactly the moment when everyone wants it. Scalpers sell the toys at ridiculous markups, while counterfeiters dupe desperate families into buying knockoffs.At stake are the tears \u2014 of joy or misery \u2014 of the children whose dearest wishes are fulfilled, or dashed.How the Fingerling reached this tipping point \u2014 when suddenly millions of children cannot do without a $15 farting monkey \u2014 is the story of a promising idea\u2019s going viral on social media, a large retailer\u2019s savvy pricing strategy and the science of managing scarcity.The monkey\u2019s journey from Ms. Wiseman\u2019s imagination to holiday sensation also shows how the making of a hot toy has evolved through the generations.The $84 billion global toy industry is struggling for the attention of children obsessed with smartphones and tablets. Global toy sales have been growing each year, but at a slower pace than video games.The average life span of a toy fad is about eight months from its launch until it\u2019s marked down, said Richard Gottlieb, an analyst and publisher of Global Toy News.\u201cThe life of an item is a little rockier\u201d than it used to be, said Anne Marie Kehoe, the Walmart vice president who runs the retailer\u2019s toy division in the United States. \u201cWe move as a country faster from one thing to the next.\u201dWowWee says it did not intentionally create the shortage. But whether by design or happenstance, there is no question that scarcity fuels a toy\u2019s mystique.\u201cThe reality is that you are better off having some disappointed children this year in order to excite them next year,\u201d said Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, a supply-chain analytics firm.But extended shortages can be perilous. Empty shelves can tantalize for only so long before would-be buyers might give up.This fall, WowWee increased the number of Chinese factories producing Fingerlings to three, from two. Fingerlings started arriving by plane because it was taking too long for the toys to reach the United States from Asia on container ships.\u201cIt\u2019s like coming up with a hit movie or a hit song,\u201d Richard Yanofsky, one of WowWee\u2019s founders, said in an interview last month. \u201cIf you see signs of success, you pour gas on it.\u201dOne bitter cold morning last month, Ms. Wiseman scrolled through her phone in the WowWee offices in a former industrial building on Rue Saint-Patrick in Montreal.She pulled up the picture of a wild pygmy marmoset that launched the idea for the Fingerlings.\u201cBringing animals to life is something that is in our DNA,\u201d said Ms. Wiseman, who, ebullient and energetic, sounds as if she is about to burst into joyous laughter at any moment.WowWee is owned by Ms. Wiseman\u2019s uncles, Richard and Peter Yanofsky, with Richard living and working in Montreal and Peter in California. Her mother, a former veterinarian, also works at the company, as do two cousins. Ms. Wiseman is a brand manager at WowWee.But pricey robots are more difficult to sell these days. The challenge for WowWee\u2019s designers was developing a monkey with just enough sounds and movements to entertain children, but not so many sensors and circuitry that it would be prohibitively expensive to make.Ms. Wiseman worked with Davin Sufer, the company\u2019s 38-year-old chief technology officer, on the design.The first prototype looked like a primordial creature that had crawled out of the jungle. \u201cIt was a little scary,\u201d recalled Mr. Sufer, who has three daughters, an 8-year-old, a 6-year-old and a 4-month-old.Over time, the monkey\u2019s face softened into something cuter. It developed a curly tail and plump arms and legs. Ms. Wiseman reviewed dozens of monkey sounds until she settled on the right voice.A Fingerling can snore, say hello and babble in monkey gibberish. If one Fingerling starts singing, it triggers sensors in nearby Fingerling monkeys \u2014 the company hopes you\u2019ll buy several \u2014 that get them to join in.Ms. Wiseman and her team came up with the name Fingerling \u2014 not Finger monkey \u2014 so the brand could produce other miniature animals. (One of them, a sloth, moves, sings and, yes, farts about 10 percent slower than the monkeys.)\u201cYou know you can trust a toy company if its toys fart,\u201d Ms. Wiseman said. \u201cIt knows what kids want.\u201dWowWee\u2019s offices look like a hip playroom for grown-up kids. Techno music is piped into the design lab, while Japanese anime plays on a screen mounted on the wall above a row of 3-D printers.Every shelf in the conference room was filled with robots that WowWee has produced over the decades: Robosapien, a guard dog, a panda, a Minion on wheels.The company, with about 100 employees, also has the intensity of a Wall Street trading floor, where everyone is in constant motion and new ideas are flying. Its executives travel to Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Bentonville, Ark., site of Walmart\u2019s headquarters.Whenever possible, staff engineers, designers and executives sit down and have lunch together, often at an old-style deli known for its smoked meat sandwiches and matzo ball soup.\u201cWhen the toy business is good, it is really fun,\u201d said Richard Yanofsky, 59, after parking his Tesla outside the deli one afternoon. \u201cWhen it is bad, it is really bad.\u201dMr. Yanofsky got his start as a trader. He used to buy items from wholesalers in the old part of Montreal and resell them out of the trunk of his car to retailers at a markup.\u201cIf I thought I could sell it, I would buy it,\u201d he said.The Yanofsky brothers started developing toys in the 1980s. After some early success, Hasbro bought their business in 1999, and the brothers were incorporated into Hasbro. The marriage was short lived. Mr. Yanofsky said that the toy giant hadn\u2019t been willing to take the risks he wanted, but that they had parted amicably.The brothers eventually bought back their business, then sold it to another public company and then took it private again.Over the decades, Mr. Yanofsky has watched as the industry consolidated and retailers struggled. (Toys \u201cR\u201d Us filed for bankruptcy in September.) The rise of social media \u2014 where toys can be instantly validated or just as quickly panned \u2014 has raised the stakes for companies like WowWee.\u201cThere are less shades of gray,\u201d Mr. Yanofsky said. \u201cYou either fail or you succeed.\u201dAnne Marie Kehoe, the high-ranking toy executive, is Walmart\u2019s real-life Santa Claus. She plays a big role in determining what millions of children will get for Christmas.Ms. Kehoe knew right away that the Fingerling would be a hit.\u201cThis monkey creates an emotional connection right in front of your face,\u201d Ms. Kehoe said in an interview this month. But it is sales potential, not emotion, that drives her decisions. Ms. Kehoe views even a wacky toy like the Fingerling through the lens of a retailer with troves of data on what customers are willing to buy, and at what price.\u201cIt\u2019s such an art and a science,\u2019\u2019 she said.WowWee\u2019s wooing of Walmart began in June 2016 when Ms. Wiseman flew to Bentonville to pitch the Fingerlings.Walmart was sold almost instantly on the toy\u2019s appeal, but the price was a problem. WowWee had originally planned on selling the Fingerling for $20, but the giant retailer was insistent: About $15 was the magic number. Drop $5 from the price and Walmart would buy as many as 10 times more Fingerlings.Walmart had been doing this for decades \u2014 pushing down the price of paper towels, toothbrushes, avocados and now robotic monkeys in order to sell as many as possible.Back in Montreal, the WowWee executives debated the price cut; it would mean sacrificing significant profit on each monkey.\u201cIt was pure margin,\u201d Mr. Sufer recalled.Ms. Wiseman pleaded with the team. In the past, WowWee had stood firm on keeping a higher price, only to mark down the toys later when they didn\u2019t sell.\u201cI said, \u2018I am telling you, I don\u2019t want to fight this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wiseman recalled. \u201cThey are saying it for a reason. They know.\u201dThe price was set at roughly $15.In July, Walmart invited hundreds of children to a convention center to play with a range of new toys, including the Fingerling.Based on the children\u2019s feedback, the retailer named the Fingerling one of its 25 top-rated toys for the holidays and purchased more monkeys.When Fingerlings hit stores across the United States in August, Maya Vallee-Wagner, 7, was overcome with emotion.\u201cFingerlings,\u201d Maya said, through sobs. \u201cThey\u2019re in stores. I am so happy.\u201d\u201cThis made my life,\u201d Ms. Wiseman said of the video.The video was a marketing coup, just as WowWee was launching its social media push \u2014 an effort that in many ways resembled the rollout of a Hollywood movie.Gone are the days when a toy company could simply blitz Saturday morning cartoons with ads.WowWee focused much of its effort on YouTube, where children go to watch other children play with toys in a phenomenon called \u201cunboxing\u201dThe toy company sent Fingerlings to key \u201cinfluencers\u201d on YouTube \u2014 two preschool \u201cbesties\u201d who make videos about their trips to a playground and a skinny girl with faded fingernail polish who publishes daily posts about toys. Some influencers were paid to promote the monkeys; others did it for fun.Mackenzie Ziegler, a dancer with more 1.7 million YouTube subscribers, and her friend Lauren wrapped multiple monkeys around their fingers and mugged for the camera.Not long after the social media push in August, the monkeys were basically sold out everywhere, and WowWee was able to pull back on its marketing.\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful problem when your demand outstrips supply,\u201d said Mr. Gottlieb, the toy analyst.But managing supply can be a delicate balancing act. If WowWee fails to deliver enough Fingerlings by Christmas, it could miss the moment when the fad reaches its peak, or alienate desperate parents who feel manipulated by the hype.\u201cIt\u2019s really not fair,\u201d one woman posted on Facebook. \u201cPeople work and no one has time to stalk\u201d toy stores.Last year, there was a run on Hatchimals, furry birds that hatch from an egg, causing shortages. Parents complained that when they did manage to get their hands on the birds, some failed to hatch on Christmas morning. \u201cMy four-year-old is gutted,\u201d a father wrote on Twitter.WowWee ramped up shipments of Fingerlings in October and November \u2014 way ahead of the number of Hatchimals that were shipped to the United States at this time last year, according to data supplied by Panjiva. Retailers say Fingerlings are being bought up as quickly as they can be stocked.WowWee executives are confident the Fingerling\u2019s popularity will live on past Christmas, but the company\u2019s designers are already pitching their next big toy for 2018.\u201cOur lives are at the whim of 5- to 9-year olds,\u201d said Richard Yanofsky\u2019s son Michael, vice president of sales at WowWee. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How does the Disney deal affect Fox\u2019s efforts to buy control of Sky?\u2022 The media world is gossiping over whether someone might try to top Disney.\u2022 Meet the advisers who helped put the transaction together.\u2022 Tim Cook and Charles Koch wrote a joint op-ed urging protection of Dreamers.As the Trump administration moves to block one media deal, it appears more supportive of today\u2019s big transaction.President Donald Trump called Rupert Murdoch on Thursday and congratulated him ahead of a deal for Walt Disney Co. to buy some of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox Inc., White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.\u201cI know that the president spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal,\u201d Sanders said.But then there\u2019s the jobs angle There\u2019s a problem. Here\u2019s what Disney\u2019s C.F.O., Christine McCarthy, told analysts this morning:We expect to fully realize roughly $2 billion of cost synergies by 2021.As Andrew reminded earlier this week, \u201csynergies\u201d is a code word for \u201clayoffs.\u201d And Disney executives said that the company expects to start realizing synergies within the first year after the deal closes.It isn\u2019t clear yet how many jobs would be cut if the transaction succeeds, but this would be a rare deal if it actually generated new positions on balance.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedFox has a bit of unfinished business before it can go forward with its deal with Disney.It\u2019s in the process of seeking regulatory approval in Britain to take full control of the British satellite television giant Sky in a deal worth about $15 billion. The two companies said on Thursday that Fox plans to proceed with the acquisition and hopes to complete the acquisition of the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn\u2019t own by the end of June.Sky would then be wholly owned by Disney, following the closing of the Fox deal.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company had previously said that its existing stake in Sky was \u201cnot a natural end position.\u201d\u2014 Chad BrayAs part of his company\u2019s $52.4 billion deal for Fox, Bob Iger of Disney agreed to renew his contract through 2021 to help complete the merger and integrate the new businesses.That would seem to mean a 2020 presidential run is off the table for Mr. Iger.The publication added:Iger told THR in June that \u201ca lot of people \u2014 a lot \u2014 have urged me to seek political office\u201d but denied he would consider a run for California governor or senator, positions that historically have served as stepping stones to the White House. However, Iger didn\u2019t specifically address the prospect of a White House run at the time.Here are a few other notable business people that are on the list:\u2022 Howard Schultz of Starbucks\u2022 Mark Cuban\u2022 Oprah Winfrey\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook\u2014 Stephen GrocerThat\u2019s the question that media executives and Wall Street bankers have been asking this morning.Could a digital company like Amazon, Google or Apple emerge with a higher bid? Or Verizon or Comcast?Or could some of them team up to buy the assets and split them among themselves? For example, Comcast has always wanted Fox\u2019s international assets, while any of the digital players would love to own Fox\u2019s content business.The Fox-Disney deal has about a $1.5 billion breakup fee if a higher bid were to emerge. If regulators block the deal, Disney would have to pay about $2.5 billion.The Murdochs\u2019 voting control is worth 39 percent of 21st Century Fox in most situations, except for this: If the company were up for sale, they can only vote their economic stake, which is about 17 percent. And of course, even if the deal is completed as presented today, the next chess piece that will become a point of focus is Hulu given its ownership: Disney would control 60 percent of the service, but Comcast would still own 30 percent and Time Warner owns another 10 percent.It gets complicated quickly.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinAnd, more important, how some of them will split an estimated fee bounty of up to $154 million.For Disney:\u2022 Guggenheim Partners\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2022 Cravath Swaine & MooreFor Fox:\u2022 Goldman Sachs\u2022 Centerview Partners\u2022 Deutsche Bank\u2022 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom\u2022 Hogan Lovells\u2022 Simpson Thacher & BartlettHere\u2019s how much each set of advisers could collectAccording to estimates from Freeman & Company:\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s Paul Pendergrass\u2019s take:One is a tech C.E.O. who has publicly espoused socially liberal initiatives.

The sooner that Congress resolves this situation \u2014 on a permanent basis \u2014 the sooner dreamers can seize the opportunity to plan their lives and develop their talents.This extraordinary set of circumstances has brought the two of us together as co-authors. We are business leaders who sometimes differ on the issues of the day. Yet, on a question as straightforward as this one, we are firmly aligned.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2022 The Murdochs, who own about 17 percent of existing shares in Fox, will own less than 5 percent of Disney and won\u2019t have any board seats there.What Robert Iger of Disney has to say We\u2019re honored and grateful that Rupert Murdoch has entrusted us with the future of businesses he spent a lifetime building, and we\u2019re excited about this extraordinary opportunity to significantly increase our portfolio of well-loved franchises and branded content to greatly enhance our growing direct-to-consumer offerings.\u2022 The corporate tax rate going down to 21 percent,instead of 20 percent\u2022 The top tax rate going down to 37 percent\u2022 A $10,000 deduction that can be split between mortgage payments and state and local taxes\u2022 A repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, but not the individual A.M.T.\u2022 The repeal of the individual insurance mandate\u2022 A preservation of tax breaks for medical expenses and tuition stipends for graduate students\u2022 A tax deduction for pass-through businesses that largely mirrors the Senate bill\u2019s treatmentThe tax flyaroundWhen told that the president thinks the Republican tax plan could lead to growth of more than 4 percent, here\u2019s what Ms. Yellen said:\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to rule anything out.

{"Headline": "Tesla the Car Is a Household Name. Long Ago, So Was Nikola Tesla.", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Tesla is an electric car. Just about everybody knows that.But it is less widely known that the car was named for Nikola Tesla, an electrical engineer who was once renowned as the prototype of a genius inventor.While Tesla\u2019s star began to fade long ago, Elon Musk has contributed to something of a Nikola Tesla revival.In the age of Edison, Westinghouse, Marconi and J. P. Morgan, Tesla was a giant of innovation because of his contributions in the fields of electricity, radio and robotics.\u201cIt\u2019s a sociological fact that Elon Musk took the Tesla name and launched Nikola Tesla into the stratosphere,\u201d says Marc Seifer, the author of \u201cWizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla.\u201d \u201cTesla\u2019s risen to the surface again, and now he\u2019s getting his due.\u201dIn 1884, Tesla came to New York to work for Thomas Edison with the hope that Edison would help finance and develop a Tesla invention, an alternating-current motor and electrical system.But Edison was instead investing in highly inefficient direct-current (D.C.) systems, and he had Tesla re-engineer a D.C. power plant on Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan. The men soon parted company over a financial dispute.But George Westinghouse provided funding for Tesla\u2019s A.C. induction motors and devices, which soon came to dominate manufacturing and urban life. Unlike the D.C. motors of the time, Tesla\u2019s motors didn\u2019t create sparks or require expensive permanent magnets to operate. Instead, they used a rotating magnetic field that used power more efficiently in a basic design that is still the core of most electric motors.Tesla developed radio technology and tested it from 1892 through 1894. He called radio an \u201coscillator\u201d through which electricity is converted into high-frequency radio waves, enabling energy, sound and other transmissions over great distances.He envisioned a system that could transmit not only radio but also electricity across the globe. After successful experiments in Colorado Springs in 1899, Tesla began building what he called a global \u201cWorld System\u201d near Shoreham on Long Island, hoping to power vehicles, boats and aircraft wirelessly. Ultimately, he expected that anything that needed electricity would get it from the air much as we receive transmitted data, sound and images on smartphones. But he ran out of money, and J. P. Morgan Jr., who had provided financing, turned off the spigot.Tesla\u2019s ambitions outstripped his financing. He didn\u2019t focus on radio as a stand-alone technology. Instead, he conceived of entire systems, even if they were decades ahead of the time and not financially feasible.\u201cHe proved that you could send power a short distance,\u201d said Jane Alcorn, president of the Tesla Center. \u201cBut sending power a long distance is still proving to be a hurdle. It would be monumental if it could be done.\u201dAnother Tesla invention combined radio with a remote-control device. We\u2019d now call it a robotic drone.An innovation in the boat\u2019s circuitry \u2014 his \u201clogic gate\u201d \u2014 became an essential steppingstone to semiconductors.Tesla\u2019s tub-shaped, radio-controlled craft heralded the birth of what he called a \u201cteleautomaton\u201d; later, the world would settle on the word robot. We can see his influence in devices ranging from \u201csmart\u201d speakers like Amazon\u2019s Echo to missile-firing drone aircraft.Tesla proposed the development of torpedoes well before World War I. These weapons eventually emerged in another form \u2014 launched from submarines.Tesla failed to fully collaborate with well-capitalized industrial entities after World War I. His supreme abilities to conceptualize and create entire systems weren\u2019t enough for business success. He didn\u2019t manage to build successful alliances with those who could finance, build and scale up his creations.Tesla\u2019s achievements were awesome but incomplete. He created the A.C. energy system and the basics of radio communication and robotics but wasn\u2019t able to bring them all to fruition. His life shows that even for a brilliant inventor, innovation doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. It requires a broad spectrum of talents and skills. And lots of capital.An earlier version of this article misstated who named the carmaker Tesla after the inventor Nikola Tesla. It was Martin Eberhard, one of the company\u2019s founders, not Elon Musk, another founder and the current chief executive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Needs to Happen Before Electric Cars Take Over the World", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElectric vehicles have only a tiny market share, but the auto industry is betting billions that they will soon be as cheap as conventional cars.On the slope of a thickly forested Czech mountain, three men in hard hats and mud-spattered fluorescent vests dig for the metal that could power a new industrial revolution.They watch carefully as a mobile rig, mounted on tank treads, hammers and spins a drill bit hundreds of yards into the bedrock. Water gushes from the bore as the bit punctures an underground spring.The men are prospecting for new sources of lithium, a raw material now found primarily in China and Chile that could become as important to the auto industry as oil is now.Faster than anyone expected, electric cars are becoming as economical and practical as cars with conventional engines. Prices for lithium-ion batteries are plummeting, while technical advances are increasing driving ranges and cutting recharging times.\u201cOnce the trend gets going, it can happen very fast,\u201d said Guido Jouret, chief digital officer at ABB, an electronics company based in Zurich whose businesses include constructing charging stations.But this electric-car future is still missing some pieces. Some crucial raw materials are scarce. There are not enough places to recharge. Battery-powered cars still cost thousands of dollars more than many gasoline vehicles.Car companies are racing to overcome these obstacles. They, and the millions of people they employ, risk becoming irrelevant.\u201cMany people are nervous about how fast this is coming and how much they have to invest,\u201d said Norbert Dressler, a senior partner at Roland Berger in Stuttgart, Germany, who advises the auto industry.Here\u2019s a look at what needs to happen before electric cars take over the world.Price of an electric car powertrain: Price of a conventional car powertrain: One reason battery costs are falling is that manufacturers are ramping up production. The greater the supply, the lower the price.Car companies like Daimler are getting into the battery business. Daimler has invested $590 million in a new battery plant in Kamenz, a sleepy city in a rural part of eastern Germany.\u201cThis is an important investment in the future,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel told Daimler executives and other dignitaries at a groundbreaking in May. Within a few months, workers had erected prefabricated concrete walls for the enormous new building and assembled the roof girders.\u201cWe could buy batteries,\u201d said Jupp Kaufer, head of quality at Accumotive, Daimler\u2019s battery unit.But Daimler would rather earn the profits than pay them to a supplier like Samsung or Panasonic. \u201cThe battery is a crucial part of the vehicle,\u201d Mr. Kaufer said as he walked through the assembly line of another factory in Kamenz that is already running at capacity.Price of cobalt: Price of lithium: Price of graphite: Carmakers are racing to secure the essential ingredients in batteries like cobalt, lithium and graphite. They need to avoid shortages that would drive prices too high, making electric vehicles unaffordable.The risk that a few countries could control most of the ingredients for electric car batteries is what spurred the drilling crew to the mountainside in Cinovec in the Czech Republic. As early as the 1300s, miners dug tin \u2014 \u201ccin\u201d in Czech \u2014 from the mountains around the town. Later, the area was an important source of tungsten, but the last shaft closed in 1993. Demand for lithium has made mining in the area attractive again.European Metals Holdings Ltd., an Australian company, is drilling into the bedrock and hauling out core samples to map deposits. The company plans to complete a feasibility study next year and begin mining and processing the ore in Cinovec soon after.\u201cWe are already in touch with some battery makers,\u201d Richard Pavlik, manager of a European Metals subsidiary overseeing the work in Cinovec, said as he watched the drilling crew.As for cobalt, it comes primarily from the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of the world\u2019s most war-torn and unstable countries. Illegal mining operations there have been accused of using child labor.Mining companies are hunting for sources in less problematic locations. First Cobalt, based in Toronto, has announced plans to reopen a former silver and cobalt mine in the aptly named town of Cobalt, Ontario. \u201cWe think we are at a point of no return with electric vehicles,\u201d said Trent Mell, the company\u2019s chief executive.Average range of a gasoline-powered car: Average range of an electric vehicle: Even when people can buy an electric car for the same price or less than a gasoline model, they face another problem: where to plug it in. And they won\u2019t want to wait all day for the car to recharge.Electric cars will become commonplace once there is a dense network of high-voltage charging stations where drivers can refill their batteries in the time it takes to use the restroom and drink a cup of coffee.At the moment, a cross-country drive in an electric car is an adventure.Edwin Stafford, a professor of marketing at Utah State University in Logan, Utah, carefully plotted his charging stops before setting out recently in his Tesla S for Berkeley, Calif., with his family.Tesla S owners have free access to Tesla charging stations and can use the waiting time to have a meal or shop. In half an hour, a high voltage Tesla \u201csupercharger\u201d can supply enough juice to travel 170 miles, according to Tesla. But the amenities at charging stations varied, Mr. Stafford said.At one in Nevada, the only nearby business was a casino, he said. At another, the charging apparatus was blocked by an illegally parked truck. Close to the Bay Area, there were sometimes lines of other Tesla owners waiting to charge, he added.But an array of start-ups and established companies like ABB are busy installing charging stations around the world, and they are on their way to becoming commonplace. There are already about 16,000 public charging stations in the United States, up from a few hundred in 2010. That compares with about 112,000 gas stations.time from 0 to 60 m.p.h., Audi A8: One of the biggest barriers for electric vehicles is psychological. People are used to internal combustion engines and the sensations that go with them \u2014 the odor of the fuel, the shifting of the transmission, the sound of the engine as the car accelerates.Electric cars have a different personality that people need to get their heads around before they will buy one.Electric cars are quiet, nearly vibration free and they don\u2019t smell like gasoline or exhaust. They don\u2019t need oil changes. They cost less to operate \u2014 around 4 cents per mile compared with 10 cents per mile for a gasoline-powered car, depending on local costs for electricity and fuel, which often fluctuate. Electric cars hug the road because heavy battery packs, typically arrayed underneath the passenger compartment, provide low centers of gravity and high stability.\u201cThere is no question that an electric car gives you significantly better performance,\u201d Mr. Stafford said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the mainstream driver is going to understand that unless they experience it.\u201dCarmakers\u2019 investment in electric vehicles: Carmakers\u2019 annual profit: Electric cars have about 25 percent fewer parts than conventional autos. Companies that make engine parts like pistons, fuel injection systems or spark plugs will have to find new products to sell, or die. Some workers\u2019 skills will no longer be needed.Governments will lose fuel tax revenues. Filling stations and auto repair shops will go out of business. To compete with Tesla, which allows customers to buy cars online, car companies will have to radically streamline their dealership networks.\u201cThe cake will be smaller,\u201d said Volkmar Denner, the chief executive of Bosch, the auto parts maker.Big car companies recognize the threat and argue that they can deploy their enormous manufacturing networks to roll out electric vehicles faster than Tesla, which has struggled to meet demand.\u201cWe won\u2019t have a problem building one million cars,\u201d said Herbert Diess, chief executive of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars.But the automakers\u2019 existing expertise \u2014 building internal combustion engines \u2014 will no longer give them a competitive edge.\u201cThey are losing a lot of their intellectual capital,\u201d said Geoffrey Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School. \u201cAnd they have to find a way to replace it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the cost of of operating an electric-powered vehicle.

Besides a notebook for jotting down ideas in the middle of the night and a large yellow highlighter. The latter is used for both types of books: to mark factual tidbits to incorporate into future books or to note passages of prose that do something unique or are exceptionally well done. What\u2019s currently weighing down my nightstand are \u201cThe Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,\u201d by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, for research; \u201cThe Stone Sky,\u201d by N. K. Jemisin, for pleasure; and \u201cInfinite Jest,\u201d by David Foster Wallace, because I really should finish it. Who is your favorite novelist of all time? Who are your favorite writers \u2013 novelists, nonfiction, journalists, poets \u2013 working today? I\u2019d pick E. Annie Proulx. I try to read every award winner each year, so I begrudgingly read \u201cThe Shipping News,\u201d which even to this day is the novel on my bookshelf with the most highlighted passages. Proulx\u2019s versatile use of language and sentence structure undid some blockage in my head. I attribute reading that book to freeing something inside my brain that allowed me to become a published writer. What genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?There\u2019s the old adage: Authors should write what they love to read. That\u2019s certainly the case for me \u2014 and a problem. I grew up reading a wide variety of genres: science fiction, fantasy, mysteries (both hard-boiled and cozy), spy novels, action/adventure fiction. And that\u2019s what I write today, a mix of all of the above. I still remember the head of my publishing house calling me into his office in New York to ask me one question: \u201cWhat the heck do you write?\u201d Sadly, I didn\u2019t have a satisfactory answer. As to what I avoid \u2014 very little. If I had to pick one, it would be novels that explore timelines of alternate history. Maybe because I have enough trouble keeping track of the real timeline in my head. Tell us your favorite action-adventure novels. In addition to your action-adventure novels and thrillers, you write fantasy novels under the name James Clemens. What are your favorite fantasy novels of all time? And your favorite fantasy novelist writing today?My absolute favorite is the master of the genre, J. R. R. Tolkien. I was so much of a fan (and geek) in high school that I had a well-worn T-shirt emblazoned with the words \u201cKeep on Tolkien.\u201d During those same high school years, I also became obsessed with a new writer in the field, an unknown at the time by the name of George R. R. Martin. How could I not as both writers shared the double R\u2019s? So I was thrilled when Mr. Martin returned to fantasy writing decades later with the first book in his new series, \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Sadly, in a fit of awed rage, I broke the spine of my first-edition hardback of that novel when I threw it across the room after reading the passage of Jon Snow discovering the pack of direwolf pups. It was such perfection in both plotting and prose that I knew I could never match it. Then again, I doubt anyone can. What\u2019s the most interesting thing you learned recently from a book? What books might we be surprised to find on your bookshelves?I have nearly every book written by the romantic suspense author Sandra Brown. She is the queen of nail-biting, torturous romantic tension \u2014 not to mention great storytelling. Take a moment to praise a few unheralded writers. Whom should we be reading? While not necessarily unheralded, this author deserves far more recognition and attention. That writer is Dan Simmons. Besides being a spectacular storyteller, he ventures brazenly into multiple genres \u2014 science fiction, horror, fantasies, even literary works \u2014 and damn his fingers, he wins awards in each of those fields. The one book that still haunts me to this day is his novel set in India, titled \u201cSong of Kali.\u201d It is brilliantly told, and so disturbing, it should come wrapped with a warning to think twice before opening. What kind of reader were you as a child? Your favorite book? Most beloved character?To give you some idea, I took measure of my reading habits as a child not by the number of books I consumed, but by the inches those books took up on my shelf. To this day, I remember when I reached a yard of books. Most of my favorite stories back then dealt with animals, from Anna Sewell\u2019s \u201cBlack Beauty\u201d to Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2019s \u201cTarzan of the Apes.\u201d I was especially fascinated by the latter\u2019s ape-to-English dictionary at the end of the novel. However, my most beloved character from my childhood was Danny Dunn, the boy scientist and sleuth from the series of children\u2019s books by Jay Williams and Raymond Abrashkin. Danny had no magic powers, only his wits and cleverness to get him out of scrapes \u2014 making him a true hero for a kid to look up to. Does your previous vocation as a veterinarian make its way into your fiction in any way?How could it not? Not that it was necessarily planned. As soon as I stopped practicing full time, more and more animals crept into my writing. It took an email from a reader to bring this to my attention. Suddenly my characters had all manner of furry sidekicks: an orphan jaguar cub, a search-and-rescue wolf mix, a military war dog, a young gorilla. It seemed the half of my brain that loved animals could not be suppressed and seeped into the half that loved to spin wild stories. Of the books you\u2019ve written, which is your favorite or the most personally meaningful?While it\u2019s not a full-length book, I\u2019d say \u201cThe Pit,\u201d which is a novella I wrote for George R. R. Martin\u2019s anthology \u201cWarriors.\u201d The conceit for this collection was for each contributing writer to compose a story featuring a \u201cwarrior.\u201d The protagonist could be from any time or place. I chose to write from the point of view of a dog stolen from a backyard and trained for combat in a criminal dog-fighting enterprise. As a veterinarian, it gave me a chance to shine a light on the cruelty of such a blood sport. As a writer, it gave me a chance to compose a story of despair, revenge, redemption and ultimately the forgiveness one must nurture to truly survive the worst. If you could pick any of your books to be turned into a movie or TV series, which would it be and why?I would choose one of my stand-alone thrillers, \u201cAmazonia.\u201d In that book, a mutagen gets loose in the Brazilian rainforest and melds and transforms various native species \u2014 including the creation of a nasty little critter when a poison dart frog crosses genes with a piranha. I\u2019d mostly like to see a movie from this book because of the potential for a McDonald\u2019s tie-in promotion: Buy a Happy Meal and get a plushy piranha-frog for your kid. If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?\u201cAlas, Babylon,\u201d by Pat Frank. A postapocalyptic tale of nuclear war and its very human cost. You\u2019re hosting a literary dinner party. Which three writers are invited?Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle and Michael Crichton. I considered inviting George R. R. Martin, but then it would give him one more excuse not to finish his series. Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didn\u2019t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing? Who would you want to write your life story?My dog Duncan \u2014 if he had opposable thumbs and the ability to concentrate longer than 17 seconds. Duncan knows my deepest, darkest secrets. So maybe it\u2019s best he can\u2019t talk. What books are you embarrassed not to have read yet?When it comes to action/adventure writing, the gold standards are Clive Cussler and Tom Clancy. I\u2019ve consumed both authors\u2019 books in great abundance, but sadly I\u2019ve failed to read what many consider to be their best work: \u201cRaise the Titanic!,\u201d by Cussler and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October,\u201d by Clancy. What do you plan to read next?Considering what I just admitted above: \u201cRaise the Titanic!,\u201d by Clive Cussler, and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October,\u201d by Tom Clancy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: The Tax Bill\u2019s \u2018Spiraling Consequences\u2019", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.As Republicans in Washington work to combine their tax bills into one, economists and tax specialists on the West Coast are adding up the ways that the changes could hurt California.Among the most publicized is the capping of the mortgage interest deduction, which could make buying a home in California even less affordable than it is now. The abolishing of deductions for state and local taxes, which could sharply raise Californians\u2019 tax bill, is another.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Gonzalo Freixes, a tax expert at the U.C.L.A. Anderson School of Management. \u201cIt could have spiraling consequences \u2014 the economy, the real estate market, revenues to local governments \u2014 it goes further and further into things where it could have a negative impact.\u201dBut the sweeping tax bill extends well beyond headline changes.The House bill called for the elimination of the tax credit for electric vehicles, a potentially big blow for Tesla, which has large manufacturing facilities in California.Under the Senate bill, single filers earning $160,000 to around $200,000, of whom there are many in coastal California, would see their top marginal tax rate increase to 32 percent from 28 percent.Research universities like Stanford, Berkeley, U.C.L.A. and Caltech would likely be hit by the repeal of deductions for graduate students and a new tax on endowment income. Executives wanting to pursue a midcareer M.B.A. might reconsider; the House bill removes deductions for professional education courses.\u201cThese things have big consequences,\u201d said Ken Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business.\u201cIt makes the decision of staying in California much more difficult,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cIt\u2019s already difficult, it\u2019s already expensive.

Others expressed concern over the loss of community they were witnessing as a result of rapid development.Here are a few of their responses.My generation, the millennials, have fought hard to eke out a life in our urban landscape. Until we allow for apartment buildings in single-family home-exclusive districts, gentrification will continue to ravage our neighborhoods, our friends, our support networks.\u2014 Victoria Fierce in OaklandThese higher-density homes and apartments have not decreased the value of the single-family homes. It\u2019s time to realize that being a renter is not a crime and a neighborhood can support many types of housing.\u2014 Voter in the 49th in CaliforniaI live around the corner from this house. People who have been here forever and can never afford to move are seeing an almost immediate turnover of their community. It\u2019s scary for them. When Kurt talked about his vegetables he wasn\u2019t being so literal; he was describing the loss of an old and interdependent network of supportive and caring folks: a neighborhood.\u2014 Daniel Rosenthal in BerkeleyThis agenda does not promote affordable housing, it promotes developer profits.

They had been bought with contributions collected in Seattle, and Professor Pozzo returned there to plan next steps with a universitywide committee she had helped put together.Researchers\u2019 heads have danced with visions of self-sufficient microgrids and solar-harnessed battery systems as they dream of giving Puerto Rico a new power system that is cleaner and less carbon intensive than the fossil-fuel-dependent one the storm wrecked. The island is becoming an important proving ground for ideas about how low-carbon energy can be practical, both technically and financially.\u201cThe West Coast of the United States has now become the epicenter of innovation and deployment of new energy systems,\u201d said David J. Victor, who teaches energy policy at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s partly an effort to cement leadership around climate change, which is politically very popular,\u201d Professor Victor added. \u201cThe election of Donald Trump has probably made it more popular.\u201dCompanies are also jumping in. Tesla, the electric vehicle and energy company based in Palo Alto, Calif., created and installed a project using solar generation and battery electricity storage for a children\u2019s hospital in San Juan in October, and recently announced plans for six more battery projects on two Puerto Rican islands. Arensis Corporation, a Los Angeles-based company specializing in off-the-grid electricity, installed a generating system at a refugee support center in Fajardo, aiming to use building waste from the disaster itself as fuel.The University of Washington is building what it calls an innovation district west of its central campus with the goal of becoming the regional hub for energy research. Researchers hope it can connect with the global health and climate work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, just across town in Seattle.\u201cOur state is doubling down,\u201d said Daniel T. Schwartz, the director of the Clean Energy Institute.The ferment for low-carbon energy, felt up and down the coast, reaches beyond power grids. Transportation systems are also rapidly electrifying in ways that researchers said could play a role in Puerto Rico and in the aftermath of future disasters, when fuel supply and distribution often become a major headache.As battery technology has improved, King County Metro in Seattle, the nation\u2019s fifth-largest bus and trolley system by passenger-miles, has been a leader in electrifying its vehicle fleet. So has Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s second-largest system. And two of the world\u2019s biggest electric bus manufacturers have consolidated operations or research work on the West Coast, to be nearer their markets and the technical talent they need to recruit.Because of the huge hydroelectric dams of the Columbia River system, the Pacific Northwest\u2019s power supply has long been among the cheapest and cleanest in the nation. That has shaped the region\u2019s power grid and the ideas that bubble up here about what a grid should be.Matthew D. Murbach, a graduate student at the University of Washington, came up with a way of testing and repurposing used bus batteries, an idea he said makes economic sense in a place like Seattle, which uses many hybrid electric-diesel buses. Working with his professors at the Clean Energy Institute, he helped to start a company to commercialize the idea even before finishing his Ph.D.Mr. Murbach said transit managers would put the problem this way: \u201cWe\u2019re paying to get rid of these batteries. We know there\u2019s probably some value in them, but we don\u2019t know how to get it out.\u201dThe first big test of his method started this month on an island off the coast of British Columbia, an hour north of Seattle by floatplane. A small internet provider there is using decommissioned Seattle transit batteries, harnessed together with solar panels and a generator, to power a wireless network for 700 off-the-grid customers. If the project is a success, it could have potential for many other remote communities.In the same way, electricity experts said, the work in Puerto Rico promises to be useful in helping other regions prepare their power systems for major disasters like hurricanes, blizzards or earthquakes, and to emerge from them both more resilient and more climate friendly.\u201cLots of utilities, including Washington utilities, are going through identity crises,\u201d said Reed Schuler, a senior adviser to Governor Inslee on climate issues. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at how drastically different the needs of the future are from the needs of the recent past.\u201dProfessor Pozzo and other experts say their optimism has to be tempered by the reality that the large amounts of public or private money needed to thoroughly rebuild disaster-ravaged electrical systems simply may not materialize. Without it, people in places like Puerto Rico may be left to patch together whatever ad hoc power supply they can \u2014 and rather than move to a cleaner future, they may have to depend even more heavily on small, inefficient oil-burning generators.One way or another, said Professor Victor at the University of California, \u201cPuerto Rico is an important test case of climate-change politics.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If even more so than we\u2019d imagined.A 30-year-old quarterback who once led his team to a Super Bowl would normally be in line for a new contract worth millions of dollars, but with the 2017 season nearing its end, Kaepernick, formerly of the San Francisco 49ers, remains the league\u2019s most famous unsigned player \u2014 and one of its best-known names, after he spurred the #TakeAKnee movement this season.The best counterargument, which has been offered by various anonymous front-office employees and coaches, is that Kaepernick\u2019s blend of running ability and powerful yet inaccurate passing requires a bespoke offensive scheme, which isn\u2019t something a team would orchestrate for a backup quarterback.There is something to this argument, as Kaepernick actually lost his starting job with the 49ers before the protests began and only got it back because his replacement was less effective. But that argument ignores the fact that 72 quarterbacks have appeared in a game this season, dozens of whom cannot match Kaepernick\u2019s talent in any system.Everyone who smokes cigarettes knows that their lungs get a little blacker and death draws a little nearer with each puff. Now those who pour a glass of pinot for pleasure, or to harvest its \u201cmedicinal\u201d properties, can\u2019t help but think of cancer too.Fans who have followed her since she was a stripper in the Bronx named Camilla know that her success didn\u2019t come overnight. She\u2019s been making money moves for years, from her days on VH1\u2019s \u201cLove and Hip-Hop\u201d to her mixtapes which, bafflingly, never took off the way \u201cBodak\u201d did.Rachel Lindsay \u2014 America\u2019s first and maybe last black \u201cBachelorette\u201d \u2014 walked away with a ring at the end of the last season, but it was not presented by the American steel-haired ironman heartthrob Peter Kraus and so 7.5 million hearts and brains broke at once. The rule of the \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise is that we will make sense of the heart. The rules of reality television are that enough editing and music can make us understand anything.But in this case, producers of Rachel\u2019s season of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d had to dodge an inexplicable gravity sinkhole in the middle of their universe. They know why Rachel and Peter aren\u2019t together, and they have no way, within their limited palette of reality show hues, to paint us the picture that explains it. No one else involved will or can! They are all too busy doing sponsored content and getting paid. The tabloid universe, which lives by similar rules, can\u2019t execute on this narrative either: they tried \u201cPeter Kraus Reveals Why He Turned Down \u2018The Bachelor\u2019: \u2018I Was Not Ready,\u2019\u201d and it just smells like smoke screen spirit.Issa\u2019s attempt at a self-described \u201choe-tation,\u201d in which she juggles multiple partners at varying levels of seriousness, only reveals her lack of experience with romantic relationships when boundaries aren\u2019t clearly defined. As for Lawrence, his new and nearly serious relationship highlights just how wounded Issa left him. (Spoiler: In Season 1, Issa cheats on Lawrence with an old flame.)For many, the ultimate betrayal is finding out the person you\u2019re in a monogamous relationship with has had sex with someone else. But what this season of \u201cInsecure\u201d showed, particularly the heart-tugging finale, was that often both parties have had a hand at the gradual erosion of the union.One strange thing about 2017 was that you could talk about preparing for the end of the world and not even have to explain why. The headlines were filled with apocalyptic scenarios \u2014 hellish wildfires, North Korean nuclear threats, melting glaciers, not to mention a long-prophesied economic collapse. As such, the popular image of the survivalist is changing, from wild-eyed cave dweller in camouflage fatigues, hoarding canned goods, to the mild-mannered executive or lawyer or insurance salesman who lives next door.Advertisement"}

Founded in 1962, the nonprofit helped bring yoga, organic food and meditation into the American mainstream.The leaders behind humanist psychology worked from the lodge, and legend has it that Hunter S. Thompson wandered the place with a shotgun. Nudity was the norm.\u201cThere\u2019s a dawning consciousness emerging in Silicon Valley as people recognize that their conventional success isn\u2019t necessarily making the world a better place,\u201d said Mr. Tauber, 34, a former Google product manager and start-up executive coach. \u201cThe C.E.O.s, inside they\u2019re hurting. They can\u2019t sleep at night.\u201dStill, there is most likely enough crisis to go around. Mr. Tauber has stacked Esalen\u2019s calendar with sessions by Silicon Valley leaders, which are selling out.Dave Morin, a venture capitalist and early Facebook employee, will lead a program on depression and tech; a former Google ethicist, Tristan Harris, led a weekend on internet addiction; and tech futurists will host a conference on virtual reality and spirituality. Chargers have been installed for Tesla electric cars, and there is usually a line to use them. The new sessions in 2018 are aimed at the workers building virtual reality, artificial intelligence and social networks.\u201cThey wonder if they\u2019re doing the right thing for humanity,\u201d Mr. Tauber said. \u201cThese are questions we can only answer behind closed doors.\u201dAbout a three-hour drive south from San Francisco along Highway 1, past hundreds of tourists pulled off on the side of the road, Esalen comes in around a turn.The bar serves kombucha, coconut water, wine and beer. Sitting and having a cold kombucha one recent evening was Bodhi Kalayjian, 47, who lives in Big Sur, wears flip flops and has shaggy gray-blond hair.\u201cIt\u2019s about putting Silicon Valley back in their bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got a soul. It\u2019s about finding it.\u201dMr. Kalayjian was an early Google employee and Google chef, but \u201conce the I.P.O. happened it was less fun,\u201d he said. Now he\u2019s an Esalen baker and masseur.\u201cThe old-timey hippies are moving into the history books, but why would you ever want to keep things static?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do your work, things are always in a state of change.\u201dGopi Kallayil, the chief evangelist of brand marketing at Google, was running late from work to the class he would host at Esalen called \u201cConnect to Your Inner-Net.\u201dHis assistants were scrambling to set up. \u201cIt has to be so if two engineers are sitting on opposite sides they wouldn\u2019t feel there is too much space between them,\u201d said Jnanada Schalk, who was formerly named Jennie and is assisting Mr. Kallayil as a volunteer.Mr. Kallayil arrived wearing a pink button-down and a large Android smartwatch. He had met Mr. Tauber when they worked for Google Plus, the search engine\u2019s social networking feature.Mr. Kallayil had the participants go in a circle and introduce themselves. There was a health tech investor, a product manager, several software engineers and developers, an entrepreneur who had just sold his food start-up, a nurse, an affordable-housing advocate and two lawyers. Mr. Kallayil spoke in the language of Silicon Valley.\u201cWhat is it that moves the technology to where your inner net moves forward?\u201d he asked. \u201cThankfully, other people have developed the operating manual.\u201dHe said that many of the people who came to him had floundered this year, and that he, too, found himself wondering about the impact of his work.\u201cWhat are these technologies doing?\u201d said Mr. Kallayil, who also teaches at 1440. \u201cDecisions we make affect more than one billion people. Here, you shed your clothes and your inhibition, and there\u2019s a rawness.\u201dThe Inner-Net schedule is loosely packed. The next morning, there would be mindful walking, mindful eating, reimagining work and life integration, then compassion practice, self-compassion and, finally, yoga. After dinner, there would be work on envisioning lives as they are and as we want them to be. Then Mr. Kallayil would lead some chanting.\u201cOne of the portals we use to put the technology for the body at peak performance is music,\u201d he said. \u201cSierra will play the flute, Jennie the violin.\u201dEvery morning is dance awake, a chakra meditation and guitar class where Esalen guests dance across the large hardwood floor.Down in the kitchen, Mr. Kallayil\u2019s assistant collected a large bag of raisins for eating during meditation.\u201cI just sold my start-up and needed a place to reflect,\u201d said Sam McBride, 31, from Chicago. \u201cTo give me some perspective.\u201dEsalen\u2019s hot springs are good all day but are famous for the night scene, when they open to the public between 1 and 3 a.m. A weekend stay for a couple at Esalen can cost $2,890, so budget travelers stay nearby and come wandering in with towels a little after midnight.The dirt path to the baths leads to a concrete corridor and a changing room. Around a corner, it was pitch black with an overpowering smell of sulfur. As the eyes adjusted to starlight, big steaming concrete hot tubs, claw-foot personal tubs and a couple of dozen quiet naked bodies could be seen. The space cannot be photographed.\u201cI was tired of my life,\u201d said Marina Kurikhina, 32, who lives on a ranch nearby. \u201cI represented Latin American art at a gallery in London. Now I teach creative subconscious painting.\u201dShe said people visited Esalen \u201cfor transformation.\u201d Soon, she plans to open a health bar on site serving raw desserts, cold-pressed juices and high-end coffee.With the focus on the emotional life of executives, Esalen plans to close Gazebo, its preschool of 40 years.\u201cIt was the soul of the institution of Esalen \u2014 all those little babies and what they\u2019re going to be,\u201d said Zoe Garcia, a guest and nearby resident, who has been going to Esalen for 30 years.The closing is partly a sign of the region\u2019s changing demographics. As more of Big Sur\u2019s homes are bought by tech executives as second homes, there are not as many young children, so the class of 30 had dwindled to 15 before the floods shut it down.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly sad,\u201d said Cortlan Robertson, whose daughter attended Gazebo and who said the Big Sur community had offered to pay for the preschool to continue. \u201cBen is always saying it\u2019s just child care. But it was so much more.\u201dClosing Gazebo was also a sign of a shifting culture and new rules.\u201cBack then, we could go topless in the lodge,\u201d Ms. Garcia said. \u201cMore conservative people started to come, so they started to make rules. Now next is mindfulness and technology. Who knows?\u201d\u201cI realized I was addicting people to their phones,\u201d Mr. Tauber said. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis that everyone\u2019s in the culture of killing it, and inside they\u2019re dying.\u201dIn the hot spring one night, he ran into an Esalen leader who invited him to a conscious business event. Mr. Tauber quit Google to open a business coaching start-up founders and developed Esalen\u2019s technology strategy, joining the board in 2015. During the springtime flooding, as Esalen cut its staff to 50 from 330, Mr. Tauber took over.His plan is to aim programming at top executives. \u201cHow do we scale our impact as an organization?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe do it through impacting the influencers.\u201dHis house is a wood-and-stone half circle built into the hillside, looking out through the cypress onto the water. He wanted a better view so had the cypress pruned. He has a ukulele, a prayer bowl and various massage tools by the sofa. By the dying embers of a fire that he makes every morning, he was reading a history of Esalen and a Summer of Love coffee table book.Upstairs, the Inner-Net class was doing a compassion exercise. Everyone spent 10 minutes looking into a stranger\u2019s eyes and silently repeating phrases like \u201cthis person has emotions just like me,\u201d \u201cthis person has experienced pain and suffering just like me,\u201d \u201cthis person will die just like me.\u201d They were barefoot. Some were wrapped in coarse blankets.The art teacher downstairs had made a trough of warm, foaming mushroom drink.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Bill Largely Preserves Incentives for Wind and Solar Power", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAs wind and solar projects have soared in the U.S., in both red and blue states, so has the industry\u2019s influence in Washington, D.C., on both sides of the aisle,\u201d said Dan W. Reicher, director of the Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford.While some industry groups said they still had concerns about a technical change in the final bill that could negatively affect a key financing tool used for wind and solar projects, they expressed relief that most of the major incentives for renewable energy had survived the negotiations.With only a slim majority in the Senate, Republican leaders could not afford to alienate lawmakers in their own party who favored these clean energy provisions.In the end, lawmakers made significant tweaks to this provision, allowing multinational banks and other investors to use wind and solar credits to offset as much as 80 percent of the minimum tax. But they also made a separate change that could end up applying the minimum-tax provision to a broader set of investors \u2014 a change that caught renewable advocates off guard and could potentially shrink the market for tax-equity financing.\u201cWe\u2019re grateful that Congress eliminated most of the provisions that would have been devastating to the renewable energy sector,\u201d said Gregory Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy. \u201cBut on this one complicated issue, which is important for financing, we have an uncertain result.\u201dIt remains unclear how much of an impact this latest change could have on wind and solar growth. One possibility is that financial institutions could find ways to adjust to the new rules and continue to fund wind and solar projects as before. Or Congress could tweak the provision further in subsequent legislation.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.The administration has made no secret of wanting to roll back tax preferences for solar and wind, arguing that those industries should have to compete on their own merit.\u201cI would do away with these incentives that we give to wind and solar,\u201d Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in October. \u201cI\u2019d let them stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas.\u201dSome lawmakers have said that the nuclear credit and other energy provisions could be taken up in separate legislation next year.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Renewable Energy Is Surging. The G.O.P. Tax Bill Could Curtail That.", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican tax bills moving through Congress could significantly hobble the United States\u2019 renewable energy industry because of a series of provisions that scale back incentives for wind and solar power while bolstering older energy sources like oil and gas production.\u201cThe production tax credit has destroyed the energy market, especially in the Midwest,\u201d the employee, Jessica Unruh, who is also a state representative, told the president. \u201cWind production has really eroded our state tax base and replaced coal production when it comes to electricity production.\u201d\u201cWe would see a drastic drop-off in wind installations,\u201d said Michael Goggin, the senior director of research at the American Wind Energy Association. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing orders put on hold and projects not able to get refinancing. Even the threat of this bill is having a chilling effect.\u201d\u201cThere is a perfect storm of bad news that impacts investor confidence in renewables,\u201d said Trevor Houser, a former Obama administration climate official who now tracks energy economics as a partner at the Rhodium Group. \u201cIt is shaping up to be a pretty rough 2018.\u201dNo one is predicting the demise of solar and wind deployment, which rely less each year on tax subsidies as their costs decline and were already preparing for a gradual phaseout of the subsidies by 2020. But the sudden changes could slow what had been a steady pace of adoption and raise electricity prices for consumers in states like California, which have set mandatory targets for the share of renewables in their electricity mixes. In states without such targets, including Texas, more expensive new renewable plants could lose out to natural gas generation.\u201cIn the long run, we think wind and solar will become cheap enough to compete without subsidies,\u201d said Amy Grace, a renewables analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cBut in the short term, those tax credits have been important.\u201dThe Trump administration has made no secret of wanting to pull the plug on tax preferences for solar and wind, contending that those industries should have to compete on their own merit.\u201cI would do away with these incentives that we give to wind and solar,\u201d Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in October. \u201cI\u2019d let them stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas.\u201dIn a potentially bad sign for the renewable industry, the list of Republican senators named to the conference committee on Wednesday did not include Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, a longtime champion of the wind industry who has opposed the House\u2019s efforts to curtail wind tax credits before a phaseout scheduled for 2020.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.While the Senate version preserves the important tax credits for wind and solar, it includes a provision that could unexpectedly undermine their effectiveness \u2014 and has prompted major concern from the industry.Currently, the companies that build wind and solar farms often do not have large enough tax liabilities to take full advantage of the renewable credits. So they will sell the credits to banks and other investors who can take advantage of them to lower their own tax burdens. Roughly two-thirds of wind projects and three-fourths of solar projects in the United States are supported by such tax equity financing.But under a provision in the Senate bill known as the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax, intended to prevent companies from outsourcing investment abroad, many of those same banks could face a new minimum tax that reduces the value of those wind and solar credits. That, in turn, could dry up demand for such tax-financing deals. Renewable companies may have to look elsewhere for financing, which could either increase costs or stop some projects.Abigail Ross Hopper, the president and the chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said that the provision could negatively affect 39 gigawatts worth of new solar projects around the country \u2014 nearly as much as all of the solar power that has been installed to date.\u201cThe jury is still out on whether this was a carefully crafted hit on renewable energy or an unintended consequence,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to make sure members understand what the impacts of these changes would be.\u201d\u201cThat would definitely be a big blow to the electric vehicle market, which is just picking up steam,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at Edmunds.com. While Tesla and General Motors are nearing their cap for the tax credit, repeal could significantly affect companies like Nissan, which was planning to introduce a new model of its all-electric Leaf in the coming year.Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, has said he will work to oppose the House\u2019s repeal of the credit. Tesla is building a major battery factory in his state.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

His head of the Environmental Protection Agency has turned the E.P.A. over to the fossil fuel industry. Ditto at Interior. His I.R.S. is being starved of funding to do its job. And his secretary of state is gutting the State Department, shedding our most experienced diplomats and replacing them with \u2026 no one.The Treasury secretary\u2019s economic \u201canalysis\u201d of the G.O.P. tax bill consisted of a one-page \u2014 fewer than 500 words \u2014 assessment, claiming that the $1.5 trillion plan would more than pay for itself, assuming a whole set of perfect circumstances come true. Your kid\u2019s third-grade book report was longer than the Treasury\u2019s analysis of our biggest tax overhaul in 30 years.But this erosion of institutions is not all on the White House \u2014 the G.O.P. congressional leadership went along for the ride, spurning proper congressional oversight of the tax bill. There were no hearings with a range of economic and tax experts, and only nominal debate. It was just rammed through.In short, the G.O.P. Congress treated this one-in-a-generation tax rewrite with as much rigorous analysis as naming a post office for Ronald Reagan! This is how democratic institutions get soiled.And then there\u2019s the future: Putin never could have dreamed up this deformed Trump-G.O.P. tax bill, but it is precisely how you don\u2019t make America great again. We actually have a tried-and-true formula for that \u2014 one employed by every great American president since our founding. It has five parts, and this bill pretty much ignores all five.First, we\u2019ve always educated our citizens up to and beyond whatever the main technology of the day was \u2014 when it was the cotton gin, that meant universal primary education; when it was the factory, that meant universal high school; and now that it is the computer and artificial intelligence, it should be some form of postsecondary education for all \u2014 and then lifelong learning. If we were really doing tax reform intelligently, we\u2019d make all postsecondary education tax deductible, to encourage everyone to become a lifelong learner.Second, we invested in the best infrastructure \u2014 roads, rail, ports, airports, telecom. This tax bill not only makes no provision for that, it actually erodes such investments in many states. With a limitation on the deduction for state and local taxes, and the deficit\u2019s ballooning by $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion, many cities and the federal government will have fewer resources for new schools and bridges.Third, we had the best rules to incentivize risk-taking and to prevent recklessness. I am all for cutting corporate taxes \u2014 and payroll taxes \u2014 but I\u2019d offset them with a carbon tax that would simultaneously combat climate change and stimulate renewable energy, the next great global industry, to make us more resilient and innovative. It never occurred to Trump.Iowa\u2019s Chuck Grassley saved the wind credits, because of the vast number of wind turbines in his red state; Dean Heller of Nevada saved the electric vehicle credits, because of all the jobs that the Tesla battery factory has created in Reno; and Rob Portman helped save all these clean tech credits because of the thousands of new jobs they\u2019ve stimulated in Ohio. It shows you just how ignorant Trump is about the benefits of clean tech.On health care regulations, though, the whole G.O.P. bought into Trump\u2019s nonsense, eliminating the Obamacare requirement that all individuals buy health insurance. It means we are returning to socialized medicine. Now lots of healthy young people, and others, will forgo health care, and when they get sick, they\u2019ll go to hospital emergency wards to get treated \u2014 and those of us with health insurance will pay for their care through higher premiums or higher hospital bills. That\u2019s called socialism. Marx would approve.Fourth, we had, in the last century, the most open immigration policy to attract the most high-I.Q. risk-takers, the people who often start new business, as well as high-energy lower-skilled workers. I don\u2019t have to tell you where Trump is on that.Fifth, we had the most government-funded research to push out the boundaries of science so our companies could pluck the best ideas \u2014 witness the internet and GPS \u2014 to start new industries. The surge in the deficit created by this tax bill will curtail precisely such research.So there you have it: a tax \u201creform\u201d bill that defies all five principles that made us great for two and half centuries.Rather than starting by asking the question: What world are we in, what are the biggest trends \u2014 like rapid technological change, the automation of an increasing number of middle-skill jobs, increasing climate disruptions, a world getting more interdependent than ever \u2014 and how we can use tax policy to enable more of our citizens to get the most out of these trends and cushion the worst, we have a bill driven by the need to reward big donors and to put \u201cpoints on the board\u201d for Trump before the midterms.Even Putin surely could not have imagined that Trump would be this foolish and the G.O.P. this cynical. It\u2019s just the extra dollop of caviar on Vladimir\u2019s Christmas blini.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Mutual Fund Fees So High? This Billionaire Knows", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe billionaire investor Ronald S. Baron flashed the grin of a proud father at his annual investor jamboree in November, as the chief executives of his favorite companies explained how slashing prices stoked their bottom lines.That is, until a shareholder in one of his mutual funds drew an awkward parallel.\u201cExcuse me \u2014 Schwab is charging a very low fee,\u201d a woman pointed out, after a presentation by Walter W. Bettinger II, the chief executive of the discount broker Charles Schwab. \u201cGod bless him, but no one ever said Baron\u2019s fees are little.\u201dYou can say that again.Mr. Baron\u2019s mutual funds charge some of the higher investment fees around, and the fees have held steady despite a $1 trillion exodus out of old-school mutual funds into cheaper, better performing rivals that track a variety of indexes and investment styles.In a global economy where competition and Amazonian price destruction have forced companies to cater to cost-wary customers, the mutual fund industry is a rare outlier. Fees on most actively managed mutual funds, which house the retirement savings and other assets of millions of Americans, have barely budged.The reasons for that \u2014 quiescent mutual fund boards, complacent investors and a general unwillingness to call a halt to one of the great gravy trains in financial history \u2014 are all visible inside Mr. Baron\u2019s fund family.The Baron Funds group manages $26.4 billion in assets on behalf of hundreds of thousands of small and large investors. An old-fashioned stock picker, Mr. Baron achieved renown in the 1990s and the 2000s for successfully betting on small companies.But his performance has suffered in recent years. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, his flagship fund, Baron Growth, trailed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index by an average of seven percentage points.This year, the results have been better: He is up 27 percent, compared with 20 percent for the S. & P.The 13 Baron funds impose fees that were 54 percent higher than last year\u2019s industry average \u2014 and vastly higher than what a comparable exchange-traded fund would charge.In November, Baron reduced fees on three of its smaller funds. But the largest, Baron Growth, with $6.3 billion in assets, still charges 1.3 percent of assets. That is a third higher than the median level for similar funds, according to Morningstar.Since 2010, investors have withdrawn, in net terms, just over $5 billion from the growth fund, according to Morningstar. But many have stuck around.Mr. Baron, 74, is perhaps best known for his annual investment conference, now held at the Metropolitan Opera House at New York\u2019s Lincoln Center and in its 26th year. Mixing rock stars, pop entertainment (Barbra Streisand and Paul McCartney have performed in the past), patriotism (this year celebrated the 100th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s birth) and triumphant chief executives, the gala is a giddy ode to American capitalism.Few fund companies offer a comparable perk, and some 5,000 Baron fund holders travel to New York to attend.At the conference in November, with markets hitting new highs each day, investors were exultant. But there was a lingering concern.\u201cThe fees are very high,\u201d one man said to a friend as they exited the Chris Rock comedy show. \u201cYou really have to have the market go up to do well.\u201dEven longtime fans acknowledge they are paying up.\u201cI won\u2019t say performance warrants the fees they charge,\u201d said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. \u201cBut I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.\u201dWhen the shareholder asked Mr. Baron why his rates were so much higher than Schwab\u2019s, the audience response was telling: The opera hall erupted in sympathetic laughter \u2014 and applause.Mr. Baron has been getting flak for his funds\u2019 high costs for years.Mr. Baron is unapologetic about the high fees. He argues that his skills and experience \u2014 and the arduous task of researching small growth companies \u2014 justify the fees.\u201cSince inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.\u201dBut if you want to bet on American growth stocks, \u201cyou can double your money in 10 years,\u201d he said. He frequently sticks with his top picks for decades.While this year has been stellar, over a longer stretch his performance is less robust.Mr. Baron believes that the true measure of his success is performance since his fund\u2019s launch in 1994. A $10,000 investment in his main fund then would be worth $163,207 today, according to Baron data. That compares with $57,889 for the Russell growth index and $84,904 for the S. & P. 500, per Baron.Mr. Baron\u2019s funds are not the only ones refusing to budge on fees. In fact, the average fee for 2,000 actively managed mutual funds has remained 0.84 percent of total assets for the past three years, according to Morningstar.Some, like the Capital Group and Fidelity, have gotten the message and have reduced their fees over this period.Industry experts say there are several reasons that active mutual fund fees have not succumbed to broader pricing trends in the economy.The first is their power. While more than $1 trillion has left higher-fee funds in favor of passive competitors, that still leaves some $10 trillion. That generates about $100 billion in fees for fund companies. And it suggests they don\u2019t need to cut fees to retain assets.It\u2019s dizzyingly complicated for investors to figure out what fees they\u2019re paying. With funds\u2019 multiple share classes, varying structures and oceans of boilerplate, even sophisticated investors may not realize they are paying up for a laggard.Another reason for elevated fees, experts say, is lax oversight.Every mutual fund is overseen by a board of trustees \u2014 a mix of executives from the fund company and mostly independent officers that must, by law, look out for investors\u2019 interests.But are these boards truly effective advocates for investors?A number of lawsuits brought against major investment companies, including Axa, BlackRock and Pimco, allege that trustees are not pushing hard enough for lower fees. The judge overseeing the BlackRock case in 2015 declined to dismiss the suit, saying the allegations raised questions about \u201crubber stamping\u201d by boards.BlackRock has said the suit lacks merit.At the Baron fund family, the fee oversight is complicated by the fact that Mr. Baron, the largest shareholder in the investment company and the manager of its largest fund, has a financial incentive to keep fees high. In addition to his salary and bonus, tied to performance among other measures, he gets a reward based on a percentage of the fees his funds bring in, according to regulatory filings.That is unusual. At most fund companies, compensation packages reward managers for beating their benchmarks \u2014 not collecting fees.While the average age for independent mutual fund directors is 66, some directors stay on boards into their 80s and even 90s. Such long tenures often make directors weak voices for investors, he said.Baron funds are overseen by nine directors. Seven are listed as independent. Four of those seven have served as trustees since Mr. Baron established his first funds 30 years ago.One of them, David A. Silverman, has zero financial experience: He is a doctor with an expertise in infectious diseases.The lead independent trustee, Raymond Noveck, worked as a managing director at Baron from 1985 to 1987.\u201cTrustees have very little incentive to fight managers,\u201d Mr. Birdthistle said. \u201cKicking and scratching is unlikely to lower fees but certainly will antagonize the manager, which is the one institution that can arrange for the trustees\u2019 dismissal. Besides, trustees will tell themselves, if a fund\u2019s fees really are too high, the market will sort things out and investors simply won\u2019t invest in the fund.\u201dThe board has taken steps to recruit trustees with bulkier backgrounds, most recently Tom Folliard, a former chief executive of CarMax.In a statement, Baron Funds said that it regularly assessed its board\u2019s effectiveness and that the long tenure of some members was a sign of the board\u2019s experience and expertise. It said fees were approved via data and analysis from an outside party. The board also said it was represented by an independent lawyer.One clear winner of this arrangement is Mr. Baron. \u201cIn 1970, my net worth was minus $15,000,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cNow my children and I have over $670 million invested in our funds.\u201dForbes pegs his wealth at just over $2 billion \u2014 and he is not shy about showing it off.His office in Manhattan\u2019s General Motors Building is a museum of trophies and curiosities, from paintings by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein to Kennedy\u2019s rocking chair. He has invested about $150 million in a 59-acre beachfront estate in East Hampton, N.Y., that he bought in 2007.Mr. Baron\u2019s investment philosophy \u2014 that over the long term the stocks that he picks will keep doubling \u2014 is fired by a relentless optimism that he attributes to his life\u2019s good fortune.A grandchild of immigrants from Poland and Russia, Mr. Baron grew up scraping for extra cash in Asbury Park, N.J. He worked his way through college and law school, which he left without getting a degree.In 1982, after a stint as a Wall Street analyst, he founded his investment firm.His timing was perfect. It was the start of a bull market, and he developed an expertise in picking small companies that would grow into big ones such as Charles Schwab, Vail Management Company and Tesla.It was the heyday of the individual stock picker. Peter Lynch at Fidelity and Bill Miller at Legg Mason gained cultlike followings, accumulating billions of dollars in assets and gracing the covers of the personal finance magazines that lionized them.Mr. Baron\u2019s star power was of a lesser variety, but it was not insubstantial. He became a regular television commentator and won a reputation as the longest of long-term investors, holding positions for decades. His assets peaked at $28 billion in 2015.\u201cWe have made $23.6 billion for our clients,\u201d Mr. Baron said.But it is his annual investor gala, which he pays for himself, that defines him. Onstage, he cultivates a grandfatherly mien, bragging about how much money the chief executives of his portfolio companies made for Baron shareholders. His chief maxim is \u201cWe invest in people,\u201d and he treats management as family.There are warm bear hugs onstage for some. Others get personal advice.Spotting a top executive from the data firm FactSet, another portfolio holding, he offered to connect her with his longtime tax lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what he has done,\u201d Mr. Baron said.A surprise raffle is part of the atmospherics, and this time a Model 3 from Tesla was the grand prize. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill performed.As the event ended, attendees streamed out of Lincoln Center into a freezing evening. Mr. Baron, without a coat, greeted them on the plaza. He hugged and kissed old friends and posed for selfies with new ones.Nobody complained about the fees.An earlier version of this article misstated how the iShares Russell 2000 Growth fund performed over a five-year period. It is up 15 percent, not 96 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s in the Tax Bill, and How It Will Affect You", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of these provisions are temporary, however, and are set to expire after seven years. They all take effect in 2018, unless noted otherwise.The child tax credit is increased to $2,000 for each child \u2014 and up to $1,400 of that can be delivered in the form of refundable credit, which means taxpayers can receive money back even if they have no tax liability. (Taxpayers may also reduce their tax bill by up to $500 for other dependents who are not children.)But that all changes in 2025, when the deductions and exemptions revert to current law.For homeowners who pay their state income taxes quarterly, it is O.K. to pay the last and final installment due Jan. 16 on or before the last day of this year, if you want to claim the deduction this year.You can also deduct the interest paid on mortgage debt up to $750,000; that includes your primary home and one other \u201cqualified residence,\u201d which may include a mobile home or a boat. But if you bought a property before Dec. 15, you can still deduct interest up to $1 million (the limit under current law). Home equity loan interest is no longer deductible for anyone.Ex-spouses who want to modify existing agreements \u2014 created on or before Dec. 31, 2018 \u2014 can continue to follow the current 2017 tax rules, as long as they specify that in the new agreement. These individuals are likely to stick with the old rules \u2014generally speaking, it would only make sense to change to the new tax treatment if the ex-spouse paying the support is in a lower tax bracket than the recipient.Using a slower-growing measure also means certain tax breaks would also grow more slowly, like the earned-income tax credit, among others.This change is permanent; the measure would continue to be used even after other tax changes, including the increased standard deduction, expire.The rules revert to today\u2019s law in 2025.Taxation on children\u2019s earned income is unchanged and is taxed at single taxpayers\u2019 rates.________Advertisement"}
