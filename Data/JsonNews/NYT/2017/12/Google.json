{"Headline": "An Alexa Holdout Wants to Know Who\u2019s Listening", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of my kids has asked for a Google Home Mini. But hold up, Santa.Of course, we\u2019ve been trading off privacy for the wonder and convenience of technology for years. How comfortable we are with gradually ceding more data to the machines is probably inversely correlated with how many times we\u2019ve watched \u201cThe Terminator.\u201d And I\u2019ve watched it. A lot.Still, the kid wants it, and I\u2019ll probably fold, eventually. But I\u2019d like to know what I\u2019d be getting into. So let\u2019s start with the fine print.In a statement, Amazon said, \u201cWe\u2019ve built multiple layers of privacy protections into Echo including a mute button that electronically disconnects the microphones, clear visual indicators when voice recordings are being captured and streamed, as well as the ability for customers to see and delete voice recording history for their devices.\u201dIn its own statement, Google said that \u201call the devices that come with the Google Assistant built in are designed with privacy in mind.\u201d It added that \u201cGoogle only stores voice-based queries\u201dafter it is manually activated or recognizes \u201cthe hotwords \u2018O.K. Google\u2019 or \u2018Hey Google.\u2019\u201dI asked Joel Wallenstrom, the chief executive of Wickr, a messaging company focused on security, what he thought of the rise of digital assistants. He doesn\u2019t have one, though he pointed out that we already have this kind of technology \u201cby virtue of Siri.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of ways to have privacy and security, it just requires an awful lot of human oversight and management, and that typically doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. With a digital assistant, he added, \u201cyou\u2019d have to constantly be on your toes about updates and changes to their privacy policy.\u201dI already spend a lot of time interacting with talking computers. When I recently moved from London to New Jersey, my new American phone synced with my old British one, including Google Maps. I now spend weekends being bossed around by the voice of an unyielding British woman who seems incredibly confident about the back roads of suburban New Jersey. We get along great. But she\u2019s not recording my rants about traffic and sending them to the cloud.At least I can take comfort that I\u2019m not the only one who wonders about these things. In the past three years, the Better Business Bureau told me it had received 9,876 complaints about Amazon.com. Seventy-nine were related to the Echo speaker, which features Alexa, and just a single one of those complaints mentioned privacy concerns.The lone dissenter was identified by the bureau as \u201cDennis W\u201d in Massachusetts, who told them he bought an Echo because he thought it \u201cwould be good for an information source (news, weather, sports)\u201d but \u201cupon further research I found that this device is an unwanted privacy concern where Amazon collects and sells info.\u201dWhen he tried to return his Echo, Amazon tried to allay his fears. \u201cI do not believe them,\u201d he said.So there you go, I\u2019m not the only one worried. There\u2019s the one other guy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Thinks I\u2019m Dead", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by(I know otherwise.)I\u2019m not dead yet.But try telling that to Google.For much of the last week, I have been trying to persuade the world\u2019s most powerful search engine to remove my photo from biographical details that belong to someone else. A search for \u201cRachel Abrams\u201d revealed that Google had mashed my picture from The New York Times\u2019s website with the Wikipedia entry for a better-known writer with the same name, who died in 2013. My father pointed this out in a quizzical text message, but the error seemed like an inconsequential annoyance best ignored indefinitely. To anyone who knows me, it is clearly not me \u2014 I am not married, my mother\u2019s name is not Midge, and I was not born in 1951. But when an acquaintance said she was alarmed to read that I had passed away, it seemed like an error worth correcting. And so began the quest to convince someone at Google that I am alive. My picture, however, appeared inaccurately only in Google search results, so it seems reasonable to assume that a company with thousands of employees, whose parent company, Alphabet, has a market capitalization of about $740 billion, would be able to help. But like many technology companies, Google doesn\u2019t really put a lot of emphasis on human technical support, something anyone who has had a problem with Gmail already knows. There\u2019s no customer service hotline, and it\u2019s unclear which of the various \u201cfeedback\u201d options is appropriate. But even against that backdrop, correcting the impression about something as simple as whether a person is alive should be eminently fixable. Right?\u201cIn my experience, it is very difficult to submit correction requests to Google for situations that aren\u2019t clear violations of policies or laws,\u201d Mr. Matta said. \u201cMost individuals are overwhelmed with the difficulty of the problem, and don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201dSince the Google entry was using my official Times photo, I first contacted someone on Google\u2019s corporate communications team, identifying myself as a member of the media.Here\u2019s how that goes:This allows Googlers to get basic information, like a phone number or address, without visiting another website. The cards also feed answers to smart speakers like Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google Home. If these speakers rely on the cards, it\u2019s conceivable that they would repeat their errors, so my cousin and I decide to ask his Alexa some questions. That biographical information belongs to the writer Rachel Abrams, the late wife of Elliott Abrams, who held prominent positions during the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Ms. Abrams, who came from a family of well-known conservative thinkers, published online on her blog, Bad Rachel, and her writing appeared in national publications.My cousin presses Alexa more specifically. \u201cWho is Rachel Abrams at The New York Times?\u201dAlexa makes a noise that sounds like a sigh, and powers off. A friend tries Google Home next. It does not bring up the Northern Mariana Islands. It also does not seem to know about any Rachel Abrams at The New York Times. But none of the four options feels applicable:\u201cYou own the topic\u2019s official website, YouTube channel, or Google+ page.\u201d (Doesn\u2019t seem right.)\u201cYou\u2019ve added the official website to Search Console.\u201d (???)I try to make one of the options work anyway, without any luck. At the bottom, the author of this help page, a cartoon doodle of a \u201csearch expert\u201d named Katie, asks whether her advice was helpful. \u201cNo,\u201d I click, prompting me to fill out another feedback box. Katie thanks me for my submission, although she doesn\u2019t pledge to do anything. I am moving closer to actual death by the minute, and running out of ideas. I decide to call the number listed for the Googleplex, the company\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The automated greeting informs me that the Googleplex does not provide support, but that there is plenty of help online. \u201cWe\u2019re busier than usual today,\u201d the recording insists when I stay on the phone, in what feels by now like a deliberate attempt to discourage me. \u201cIt could be at least a half-hour until one of our agents is freed up.\u201dOn the bright side, the recording says that if I don\u2019t enjoy the music, I can hit any key to browse Google\u2019s selection. The website says I should keep submitting feedback, over and over again from different IP addresses. If possible, I should also enlist the help of other people. I surmise that this will help push my query to the top of Google\u2019s to-do pile. Or it won\u2019t do anything. One thing\u2019s for sure \u2014 there\u2019s no way to know!Complaints about what appears in Google\u2019s search results aren\u2019t new. But as the company has grown into one of the largest technology forces on the planet, the strategy for fixing the inevitable misfires can\u2019t keep up with the thousands of complaints it receives every day. \u201cSome of those requests, we have to assume, are frivolous or invalid or misleading,\u201d according to Mr. Matta from ReputationDefender. \u201cGenerally, all you can do is write more content that is more accurate and have that content rise to the top of Google\u2019s search rankings.\u201dOne option, Mr. Matta explained, is to create an entirely new webpage about myself and hope that I eventually become more famous than the other Rachel Abrams, so that my Knowledge Graph card may one day shove hers out of the way. This strategy seems unfair to both of us. On Thursday afternoon, I decide to email the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Sundar Pichai. What would Mr. Pichai tell people facing a similar problem? I also alert the Google spokeswoman that I am writing an article about this nearly weeklong effort and ask for comment \u2014 a requirement of journalistic fairness, but a step that may also push Google to fix the problem more quickly, an advantage that most users won\u2019t have. It\u2019s \u201cimportant to balance the need to make changes quickly with wanting to ensure the change is accurate,\u201d she writes.Mr. Pichai doesn\u2019t respond. But hours later, my photo has been removed. I am alive again. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eric Schmidt to Step Down as Alphabet\u2019s Executive Chairman", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEric Schmidt joined Google in 2001 to provide what amounted to adult supervision for the company\u2019s young founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. He helped take Google public in 2004 and built it into a colossus. In 2011, after being appointed executive chairman, he became a prominent emissary for the company to Washington.No reason was provided for the change. In a statement, Mr. Schmidt said that he, Mr. Page, Mr. Brin and Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, \u201cbelieve that the time is right in Alphabet\u2019s evolution for this transition.\u201dThe shift underlines how Mr. Schmidt\u2019s influence at Alphabet has waned over time and how a new generation of leaders is firmly in charge at the giant company. Mr. Page and Mr. Brin remain at the top of Alphabet and retain voting control, but the executives they now have working for them have evolved. More of them are younger executives who rose through the ranks, such as Mr. Pichai, or are superstar executives hired from the outside, including Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer who was brought in from Morgan Stanley in 2015.Mr. Schmidt\u2019s stepping back is expected to have little practical effect on the day-to-day operations of the behemoth operation. But it is one of the most significant personnel shifts at the internet giant since Mr. Page took over as chief executive in 2011, and especially because Mr. Schmidt has been such a willing public face of the company for so long.Internally at Google, the inclusion of Mr. Pichai in Mr. Schmidt\u2019s statement on Thursday, alongside the names of Mr. Page and Mr. Brin, was seen as a passing of the torch and the creation of a new power triumvirate.Mr. Page, in a statement on Thursday, alluded to the new generation at Alphabet and Google. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly excited about the progress our companies are making, and about the strong leaders who are driving that innovation,\u201d he said.For years, Mr. Schmidt served as a buffer for the company, smoothing relationships with regulators and the broader tech industry, said John Battelle, author of \u201cThe Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture.\u201d\u201cHe did a lot of that important public facing work on behalf of the company,\u201d he said. \u201cAt a moment when the world needs to have more conversations with Google about its growing power and influence, my question is not why is Eric stepping down. It\u2019s who is going to fill the void.\u201dMr. Page and Mr. Brin have largely avoided public events, with Mr. Page having a medical ailment that has made public speaking difficult and Mr. Brin focusing on the company\u2019s more experimental projects. Mr. Pichai has tended to speak mostly about products and services, instead of policy.Through a Google spokesman, Mr. Schmidt declined to comment.Mr. Schmidt has been marginalized over time at Alphabet through a combination of its changing leadership, the shifting political environment in the United States, and his own personal gaffes, according to people familiar with the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Since 2011, Mr. Schmidt has been a go-between for the company in Washington \u2014 some people internally referred to his role as Google\u2019s secretary of state. During President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, Mr. Schmidt, who has supported many Democratic politicians, prominently represented Google on policy matters. He also gave money and technical assistance to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign team during the 2016 presidential race.But since President Trump came to office, Mr. Schmidt\u2019s standing has changed. He has been eclipsed in Washington by others at Google, including Susan Molinari, a former Republican Congresswoman from New York, said some of the people familiar with the company. Google also has new Washington staff members such as Max Pappas, a longtime political operative who has a relationship with Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who support conservative causes. In the meantime, Google is under fire, along with other tech giants, as legislators seek to deal with the perceived monopolies these companies have.Some gaffes by Mr. Schmidt over the years have also received attention.Google has donated more than $21 million to the New America Foundation and helped make the foundation one of the most influential policy voices in progressive politics. After the incident, Mr. Schmidt lost some of the cachet he had built up in government circles, according to two people with knowledge of the incident.Mr. Schmidt has not kept his head down. He has still been seen at some of the company\u2019s weekly Friday meetings, which are called TGIF, according to Google employees.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwakaAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Language Rules for the Digital Age", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I don\u2019t actually remember a world that seriously included the word \u201cwhom\u201d \u2014 but that\u2019s not the point of Emmy Favilla\u2019s provocative and jaunty romp through the dos and don\u2019ts of writing for the internet (which gets the thumbs-up over \u201cInternet\u201d). As chief copy editor for BuzzFeed, Favilla\u2019s at the sharp edge of online editing. There she was tasked with creating and maintaining a style guide that had a logical integrity (but also room for considered variation); addressed those language issues that demanded a rethink; was attractive to readers; and, of course, encouraged them to click through to the all-important articles. \u201cA World Without \u2018Whom\u2019\u201d tells the story behind this handbook: the decisions, and how they were reached. The fast-paced, conversational tone gives the book a Chicago-Manual-of-Style-meets-cute-cat-video (aww) feel. Once you adjust to that, though, it also provides a fascinating examination of how a modern grammar guru handles the quandaries that arise out of the dialect of social media, at a time when we are afraid \u2014 or perhaps excited \u2014 that the way we communicate online may be re-engineering our language itself.In fact, many of these stylistic issues are chestnuts, but they demand fresh answers for each generation. Some questions Favilla raises were being debated when I started working on the Oxford English Dictionary in 1976. We whispered in corners that \u201calright\u201d might be an acceptable spelling of \u201call right,\u201d and we hemmed and hawed over whether abbreviations should take points (\u201cU.S.\u201d or \u201cUS\u201d), or if the possessive of \u201cEuripides\u201d was \u201cEuripides\u2019s\u201d or just \u201cEuripides\u2019.\u201d I have to confess, however, that I\u2019ve since forgotten whether we ever thought of putting two spaces rather than one between our sentences as we typed happily away in those distant days.But language is very much part of the culture of its day. Back when we were still living in the shadow of the postwar era, the rules were stricter and more religiously observed; you weren\u2019t supposed to challenge time-honored authority. But the internet was a product of that era, and of a generation that demanded a new order (or disorder). Breaking the rules was part of the game, and this book witnesses the latest wave of rule-breakers reaching their own adaptation of our changing lexicon. Favilla introduces us to the online punctuation police (\u201ccomma panic,\u201d vanity capitalization), helps us read between the lines in our inboxes (\u201cthe 48 most annoying ways to start off an email\u201d) and steers us through the etymological minefield that is modern digital communication (\u201c42 ways to type laughter\u201d). She accommodates variation with alacrity, but generally advises consistency. In fact, she may be closer to the mainstream than she realizes.In some parts the book is a guide for the initiated, in others one for the outsider who is surprised to have landed in the online world. Despite her self-deprecation (she lives in perennial fear of \u201ceveryone in my office and my life discovering that I am a fraud\u201d), Favilla is admirably suited to the \u201caccidental livelihood\u201d that has come her way at a fast-paced, high-energy digital news organization. Once she acclimates to this new speed, she is well in command of the stylistic questions she encounters in her daily ride through BuzzFeed text. Although her research involves typing questions into Google and firing microbrief questions to her editing team and friends (\u201cglueing or gluing \u2026 both look terrible but are acceptable per MW,\u201d the in-group abbreviation for \u201cMerriam Webster\u201d), Favilla always balances the results against the established style manuals, sometimes finding them deficient and sometimes not. As her own enthusiastic interoffice emails often end, \u201cBests.\u201dJohn Simpson was chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionary until his retirement in 2013.

If you\u2019re looking for the perfect gift for children eager to learn the basics of coding, or want to give a little one a heads up when they get to logic and problem solving in school, here are 10 of the best coding toys on the market today.The simplest toys teach coding with physical building blocks. Some require companion smartphone apps to work, but the best (and the ones friendliest to young children) do not, and let kids play with them freely, without needing pricier screens or devices.For older children, or kids with mobile devices, app-enabled coding toys allow children to drag and drop block-based commands to chain together a sequence of actions. New, more advanced challenges are typically unlocked in each toy as a child progresses.Construction-based coding toys require a lot of time, patience and room, but the payoff is that children can show off their own creations.I had the opportunity to test out several of these coding toys with my brother\u2019s three children: Ava, 8; Will, 6; and Henry, 2. We skipped the construction toys, primarily because they had too many parts and took too long to build. They wanted something that worked right out of the box.Less familiar with coding than his sister, Will was drawn to the Osmo Coding Jam, which eased him into creating his own music with simple picture instructions. He shouted with glee as he passed each lesson in the tutorial. I had hoped to entice him with the playful antics of Cozmo, but the setup, which required connecting to its own Wi-Fi network with a password, took too long.Henry loved the bright lights and loud music emitting from the Code-a-Pillar. The durable construction meant he could bang on it without breaking it. Even though we could not get the Code-a-Pillar to respond to more than five segments at a time, he still liked pushing it around the floor by hand.After all, it\u2019s better to ease children into coding and get them hooked on something right for them that they can then step up from, than to start with something that is too advanced that will collect dust in a corner.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Congratulated Murdoch on the Disney Deal: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How does the Disney deal affect Fox\u2019s efforts to buy control of Sky?\u2022 The media world is gossiping over whether someone might try to top Disney.\u2022 Meet the advisers who helped put the transaction together.\u2022 Tim Cook and Charles Koch wrote a joint op-ed urging protection of Dreamers.As the Trump administration moves to block one media deal, it appears more supportive of today\u2019s big transaction.President Donald Trump called Rupert Murdoch on Thursday and congratulated him ahead of a deal for Walt Disney Co. to buy some of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox Inc., White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.\u201cI know that the president spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal,\u201d Sanders said.But then there\u2019s the jobs angle There\u2019s a problem. Here\u2019s what Disney\u2019s C.F.O., Christine McCarthy, told analysts this morning:We expect to fully realize roughly $2 billion of cost synergies by 2021.As Andrew reminded earlier this week, \u201csynergies\u201d is a code word for \u201clayoffs.\u201d And Disney executives said that the company expects to start realizing synergies within the first year after the deal closes.It isn\u2019t clear yet how many jobs would be cut if the transaction succeeds, but this would be a rare deal if it actually generated new positions on balance.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedFox has a bit of unfinished business before it can go forward with its deal with Disney.It\u2019s in the process of seeking regulatory approval in Britain to take full control of the British satellite television giant Sky in a deal worth about $15 billion. The two companies said on Thursday that Fox plans to proceed with the acquisition and hopes to complete the acquisition of the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn\u2019t own by the end of June.Sky would then be wholly owned by Disney, following the closing of the Fox deal.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company had previously said that its existing stake in Sky was \u201cnot a natural end position.\u201d\u2014 Chad BrayAs part of his company\u2019s $52.4 billion deal for Fox, Bob Iger of Disney agreed to renew his contract through 2021 to help complete the merger and integrate the new businesses.That would seem to mean a 2020 presidential run is off the table for Mr. Iger.The publication added:Iger told THR in June that \u201ca lot of people \u2014 a lot \u2014 have urged me to seek political office\u201d but denied he would consider a run for California governor or senator, positions that historically have served as stepping stones to the White House. However, Iger didn\u2019t specifically address the prospect of a White House run at the time.Here are a few other notable business people that are on the list:\u2022 Howard Schultz of Starbucks\u2022 Mark Cuban\u2022 Oprah Winfrey\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook\u2014 Stephen GrocerThat\u2019s the question that media executives and Wall Street bankers have been asking this morning.Could a digital company like Amazon, Google or Apple emerge with a higher bid? Or Verizon or Comcast?Or could some of them team up to buy the assets and split them among themselves? For example, Comcast has always wanted Fox\u2019s international assets, while any of the digital players would love to own Fox\u2019s content business.The Fox-Disney deal has about a $1.5 billion breakup fee if a higher bid were to emerge. If regulators block the deal, Disney would have to pay about $2.5 billion.The Murdochs\u2019 voting control is worth 39 percent of 21st Century Fox in most situations, except for this: If the company were up for sale, they can only vote their economic stake, which is about 17 percent. And of course, even if the deal is completed as presented today, the next chess piece that will become a point of focus is Hulu given its ownership: Disney would control 60 percent of the service, but Comcast would still own 30 percent and Time Warner owns another 10 percent.It gets complicated quickly.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinAnd, more important, how some of them will split an estimated fee bounty of up to $154 million.For Disney:\u2022 Guggenheim Partners\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2022 Cravath Swaine & MooreFor Fox:\u2022 Goldman Sachs\u2022 Centerview Partners\u2022 Deutsche Bank\u2022 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom\u2022 Hogan Lovells\u2022 Simpson Thacher & BartlettHere\u2019s how much each set of advisers could collectAccording to estimates from Freeman & Company:\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s Paul Pendergrass\u2019s take:One is a tech C.E.O. who has publicly espoused socially liberal initiatives. The other is one of the most prolific and prominent conservative donors around.From the piece:This is a political, economic and moral imperative. The sooner that Congress resolves this situation \u2014 on a permanent basis \u2014 the sooner dreamers can seize the opportunity to plan their lives and develop their talents.This extraordinary set of circumstances has brought the two of us together as co-authors. We are business leaders who sometimes differ on the issues of the day. Yet, on a question as straightforward as this one, we are firmly aligned.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2022 The Murdochs, who own about 17 percent of existing shares in Fox, will own less than 5 percent of Disney and won\u2019t have any board seats there.What Robert Iger of Disney has to say We\u2019re honored and grateful that Rupert Murdoch has entrusted us with the future of businesses he spent a lifetime building, and we\u2019re excited about this extraordinary opportunity to significantly increase our portfolio of well-loved franchises and branded content to greatly enhance our growing direct-to-consumer offerings.\u2022 The corporate tax rate going down to 21 percent,instead of 20 percent\u2022 The top tax rate going down to 37 percent\u2022 A $10,000 deduction that can be split between mortgage payments and state and local taxes\u2022 A repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, but not the individual A.M.T.\u2022 The repeal of the individual insurance mandate\u2022 A preservation of tax breaks for medical expenses and tuition stipends for graduate students\u2022 A tax deduction for pass-through businesses that largely mirrors the Senate bill\u2019s treatmentThe tax flyaroundWhen told that the president thinks the Republican tax plan could lead to growth of more than 4 percent, here\u2019s what Ms. Yellen said:\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to rule anything out.

{"Headline": "A Doctor With a Phone and a Mission", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "Startled by the hard sell addicts face, a psychologist discovered the rehab industry\u2019s customer acquisition tricks, one crank call at a time.More than 200,000 people seek addiction treatment on the phone or online every month. Few of them realize that their pleas for help are a valuable commodity \u2014 one that is quietly fought over by those angling to turn a distress signal into cash.Addicts represent big money to treatment centers, which are happy to pay a middleman $50 for a \u201clead\u201d on a patient who might generate $40,000 or more in insurance claims in a matter of months. That is why television ads offering help to addicts air constantly nationwide.But lead generators, or lead gens, aren\u2019t necessarily the ideal path to rehab clinics \u2014 as Dr. Alan Goodwin, an inquisitive psychologist in Palm Beach, Fla., accidentally discovered earlier this year. That discovery led him on a monthslong personal mission to try to understand the ethically murky business of customer acquisition in the treatment world.It started when Dr. Goodwin, who works as an education and health care consultant, phoned a local substance abuse awareness coalition with a question about the format of a presentation he was to make. Instead of the organization, he got a recording saying the number had been disconnected \u2014 but before he could hang up, the message continued.Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018\u201cWe can help you find an alternative addiction specialist,\u201d the recording said, according to Dr. Goodwin. \u201cPlease stay on the line while we look.\u201dThe medical group\u2019s phone number, he quickly realized, had been hijacked by a drug-treatment referral service.A man who identified himself as Jacob came on the line, and started asking Dr. Goodwin the kind of questions you ask an addict in crisis. Dr. Goodwin instantly invented a new persona: a 67-year-old with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s, an unhinged wife named Betty and a drug-addled son who had just introduced him to heroin.\u201cI can get into it,\u201d Dr. Goodwin said later, recalling his imagined identity. \u201cMy father was a retailer, but he somehow was involved with Second City, the improv comedy troupe in Chicago. So it might be genetic.\u201dWith his call, Dr. Goodwin had chanced across the underbelly of the treatment industry, where new customers are corralled, often with a hard sell. By the time his conversation with Jacob was over, he had developed a new vocation \u2014 dialing up and lecturing the sketchy rehab referral services that have become telemarketers to the addicted.He spent months struggling to map this realm, inventing a small cast of characters to help him find answers and meticulously documenting his encounters. All the while, he tried to determine who was behind the most ubiquitous TV ad on the air, one featuring a figure he called \u201cthe man in blue.\u201dThis was a project he assigned to himself. Now 76, Dr. Goodwin had spent decades in the addiction treatment field and had become the kind of trusted voice now occasionally called by clinics for advice. Because of that, he already knew that some clinics used underhanded tactics, which outraged him.\u201cI went into activist mode,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I saw was pure opportunism.\u201dLead generators, those who connect the people seeking a service to the people selling it, operate in a variety of businesses \u2014 carpet cleaners, locksmiths, personal injury lawyers and, as America confronts a persistent opioid crisis, drug treatment centers. Dr. Goodwin became a student of the business, starting with Jacob, the man he found himself speaking to during that first call.When the rep offered to send a car \u2014 that very afternoon \u2014 to pick him up at home, it was time to end the ruse. \u201cI\u2019m not an addict,\u201d Dr. Goodwin said he told the representative. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Alan Goodwin, and I have some concerns about what just happened.\u201dDr. Goodwin thought his critique would at least get an audience, and perhaps even prompt some changes. It was the first of many disappointments.\u201cWe have to constantly monitor the web for fake versions of our clients\u2019 websites,\u201d said Daniel Gemp of Dreamscape Marketing, a Maryland firm that works with addiction clinics. \u201cFake social media reviews. Fake Facebook profiles. We have worked with 28 different industries and we have never had to play more defense than we do in addiction treatment.\u201dSome lead-gen operators in this field are hard to find, let alone get on the phone. But the chief executive of a major player, TreatmentCalls.com of West Palm Beach, Fla., contended that he performs a valuable service. Jason Brian, who founded TreatmentCalls.com in 2014, said that he will not work with clinics that lie about themselves, including where they are located and what services they offer. So, he said, people who reach clinics through his call system are more likely to enroll with quality providers.And after Florida criminalized paid health care referrals, Mr. Brian said he took the word \u201creferral\u201d out of his ads to stay on the right side of the law. Further, he now says that his company isn\u2019t, strictly speaking, in the referral business, because every caller in his system is automatically routed to a rehab clinic without any input from TreatmentCalls.com. His company, in his judgment, is merely connecting \u2014 not referring.Critics counter that deception is built in to this and other business models. Callers are unlikely to be told that they are getting medical recommendations that have been shaped by financial incentives.Ben Cort, a consultant to rehab clinics, has conducted his own first-person experiments with addiction treatment lead gens. He said he has been placed on hold for a few minutes and then put up for a kind of instant auction after his personal information \u2014 age, insurance, drug of choice \u2014 were collected.\u201cPeople are making decisions in real-time because their loved ones are in immediate peril,\u201d Mr. Cort said. \u201cOne more overdose and that\u2019s the end. So nobody is researching rehab the way people research college, and that creates a huge opportunity for lead gens and clinics to take advantage.\u201dDr. Goodwin has treated hundreds of addicts in a career that has spanned three decades. He grew up in a suburb of Chicago and earned his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Alabama. He was a freshman there when he volunteered at a state psychiatric hospital \u2014 and found his life\u2019s work.Starting in 1977, he served as the executive director of the Indian Rivers Mental Health Center, in Tuscaloosa, which eventually named a building in his honor. In the 1990s, he helped a private hospital, The Manors, in Tarpon Springs, Fla., create an addiction treatment program.He later became an entrepreneur and now runs a company that designs what he calls group e-learning for colleges and other entities. He also cocreated a board game, \u201cDrugs/Alcohol: Play it Straight,\u201d the most public example of his knack for mixing the fun with the serious.Though no longer employed in the treatment field, Dr. Goodwin is still regarded by physicians and clinic owners as a resource. In April of last year, an investor in a clinic in West Palm Beach got in touch with him, he said, asking for patient referrals. Dr. Goodwin said he wanted to check out the place first. After a few days, he concluded that clients there were being grossly overcharged.\u201cThey wanted to own fancy cars,\u201d he said of the owners, \u201cnot to help anyone.\u201dMr. Goodwin took his findings to the state\u2019s attorney general. He said he was amazed that prosecutions for insurance fraud didn\u2019t follow.\u201cMy dad loves a challenge,\u201d said his son, Joey Goodwin. \u201cAnd when he found out what was happening in rehab, this was a challenge right in his neighborhood. Literally, because so many clinics are near his home in Florida.\u201dThe acting part of his phone calls came naturally, Dr. Goodwin said, because of the years he had spent role-playing in group therapy settings. \u201cPlus, I\u2019ve worked for years with all the people I was pretending to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with the elderly heroin addict. I\u2019ve worked with the kid smoking pot. I know them all.\u201dAfter his first call, he started typing up his conversations, in part to keep track of a handful of different personas he\u2019d created, each with their own name and biography.They included a churchgoing, 18-year-old Duke University freshman who had recently tried pot. (\u201cI kept my voice really low,\u201d Dr. Goodwin said, explaining how he tried to sound young.) There was also a multimillionaire claiming to be calling on behalf of an autistic son who was dabbling in drugs.He wanted to understand who was behind the pitches. Clinics? Phone banks? Who ran them, and how did they parcel out leads?But Dr. Goodwin said he had a second purpose in mind: to persuade clinics he reached to change their ways, if he found their procedures lacking. Which he often did.For instance, most people he spoke to lacked medical training, so in follow-up calls he would urge clinics to staff up with professionals. And nearly everyone pushed the priciest treatment, Dr. Goodwin said \u2014 even if he was playing a character who barely used drugs at all.But every time he offered advice, he said, he was rebuffed, starting with that very first call to Palm Partners.\u201cThe person on the phone just blasted me,\u201d he said, describing the conversation after he revealed his true identity. \u201cHe said something about helping thousands of people and how I was wasting their time.\u201dDr. Goodwin said he asked for a manager to call him back \u2014 not to get the phone rep in trouble, but to get the company \u201cto really look at their practices.\u201d\u201cHe hung up on me,\u201d Dr. Goodwin said. \u201cI later left a message. No one ever called me back.\u201dMessages left with Palm Partners by The New York Times were not returned.Soon, she said, the internet was home to countless sites promoting Narconon clinics. Over the years, Narconon\u2019s success produced imitators who packed sites with keywords in hopes of kicking their services to the top of search results.It is a hustle carried out with a bit of internet chicanery.Typically, one of the links in the box is labeled \u201csuggest an edit.\u201d It allows users to change details of the listing. Google\u2019s goal is to offer a simple way for people to correct addresses and phone numbers. But relying on users across the world has a flaw: Bad actors can use the function to insert their own phone numbers, in effect redirecting calls from the intended company to another.Google has safeguards to reduce foul play. For example, a business can take control of its own Google My Business listing \u2014 making shenanigans tougher to pull off \u2014 via a system where Google snail-mails the business a postcard with a verification code. But the safeguards aren\u2019t perfect \u2014 the workarounds are complicated but motivated competitors can still divert calls.A Google spokeswoman declined to say whether a fix for this problem was in the works, other than noting that the company is always looking for ways to improve its system.\u201cWe use manual and automated systems to detect for spam and fraud,\u201d the spokeswoman, Liz Davidoff, wrote. \u201cBut we tend not to share details behind our processes so as not to tip off spammers or others with bad intent.\u201dThis time Dr. Goodwin pretended to be \u201cAlan Richard,\u201d a wealthy man whose wife thought he was smoking \u201ca little too much weed.\u201dJacob advised against the rehab centers in Florida, suggesting that they were little more than resorts for kids on drugs. Better to head to Michigan, where a company called Behavioral Rehabilitation Services operated a clinic.Next, that company\u2019s intake coordinator came on the line. After a brief patient assessment \u2014 What drugs are you taking? What kind of insurance do you have? \u2014 the coordinator offered two options: a $32,900 shared room, or a semiprivate room for $40,000 at a facility in Harrison, Mich.\u201cI have no idea what the difference is,\u201d Dr. Goodwin said. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask. I just went for the most expensive choice.\u201dAfter that, a third person came on the line and told him that he would receive a free one-way plane ticket to Detroit, on Delta Air Lines. (\u201cYou will be responsible for your transportation home,\u201d she added, according to Dr. Goodwin\u2019s notes.) In a follow-up call, Mr. Richard was informed that everyone detoxing from marijuana was entitled to on-demand massages.Still pretending to be Alan Richard, Dr. Goodwin later called back to say that his personal physician was concerned about the lack of medical information that had been requested during the intake process. Could his doctor speak to the medical director?He had to ask a few times before getting connected to a nurse. Then, Dr. Goodwin unmasked himself.\u201cShe sounded a little panicked,\u201d he said. \u201cShe said she\u2019d have some administrator call me, but no one ever did.\u201dThe executive director of Behavioral Rehabilitation Services, JJ Bush, told The New York Times in a brief interview that he knew nothing about the company\u2019s marketing efforts but would have someone in that department get in touch. No one did. A follow-up phone call was not returned.Even after months of calls, Dr. Goodwin\u2019s picture of the business remained fuzzy. When he asked phone reps who they worked for, they either refused to say or, Dr. Goodwin suspected, they lied.\u201cIf you\u2019ve been trying to quit your addiction to drugs or alcohol without any luck,\u201d the man in blue says, \u201cthen you need to call the number on your screen now.\u201dThe ad promoted \u201cThe Addiction Network.\u201d But each time Dr. Goodwin dialed the number he saw on the screen, a representative at a different clinic answered. None of the clinics seemed affiliated with any other. And none seemed interested in discussing it.\u201cI got pushback whenever I tried to find out anything about the ad,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone was pretty evasive.\u201dIf the man in blue is a puzzle, Mr. Brian of TreatmentCalls.com can solve it.On a sunny afternoon, Mr. Brian, the company\u2019s founder and owner, sat in his office and explained how his business works.In a typical day, his company and its affiliates air hundreds of TV ads across the country, along with many online ads, he said. Combined, those ads generate roughly 2,000 calls a day. The mid-September changes made by Google, he said recently, have had no effect on the company.Through the magic of modern telephony, incoming calls are automatically routed to a rotating list of treatment centers, which prepay to receive a set number of calls per month. It costs treatment centers between $40 and $50 each time their phones ring, whether the person signs up for treatment or not.TreatmentCalls.com\u2019s ads are generic on purpose. The man-in-blue ad, for instance, long promised little more than a \u201cfree referral.\u201d But even that was been toned down lately. Concerned about Florida\u2019s new patient-brokering law, Mr. Brian snipped the word \u201creferral\u201d out of his ads. Recently, he said by email that he simply sells \u201ccalls.\u201dThe company\u2019s model is good for consumers, Mr. Brian said. His employees monitor calls, he said, and the company will not renew its deals with clinics that mislead people.\u201cOur clients aren\u2019t lying about the quality of care or their qualifications,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who call a center directly could get a snake oil salesman.\u201dThe TreatmentCalls.com model has its critics. One of them is Mr. Cort, the consultant. He noted that people in Mr. Brian\u2019s system may have no idea that their call has been sold to a clinic. Further, because the clinic is randomly selected, it may be the wrong one for the client.\u201cCallers who are patients are not simple commodities,\u201d Mr. Cort said. \u201cWhen no thought is given to appropriate referrals based on a patient\u2019s specific needs it demonstrates either a lack of understanding or a callousness.\u201dAs Dr. Goodwin made more calls over the months, he wondered if he could say anything that would cause a clinic to advise against immediate enrollment. Sometimes this meant presenting himself as the most casual of drug users. Other times, he added berserk details to his story.That reached an extreme when he told a clinic in New Jersey that, in a drug-fueled depression, he had just slit his wrists. To his amazement, the phone rep did not suggest that he head straight to a hospital. Instead, Dr. Goodwin said, he was counseled to immediately board a plane and fly to the clinic.Someone else, however, \u201cdid the right thing,\u201d Dr. Goodwin said. When the owners of the clinic\u2019s affiliated detox center heard about his call, they phoned the authorities.

(You may also hear babbling about tiny fear demons or cursed band candy, but your results may vary.) \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d largely about a teenage girl called upon by mystical tradition to protect the world by dusting those evil fanged bloodsuckers, cheekily treated the high school experience like the horror movie it was for many people. Buoyed by lively acting, the show continually found new ways to tell its stories, which were sprinkled with snappy dialogue, punchy girl-power action scenes and very real emotions.Readers can get the inside scoop on a wide range of topics \u2014 for instance, what it was like to film \u201cHush,\u201d a fourth-season \u201cBuffy\u201d episode that contained only 17 minutes of spoken dialogue in a 44-minute broadcast, or the main reason the \u201cAngel\u201d cast had a major change-up late in its run. The social issues the shows tackled (or not) at the time are also discussed, particularly in regards to WB network concerns: A staff member reveals that the part of Cordelia, Buffy\u2019s acerbic rich pal, was originally meant for a black actress, but spine-free executive worries about interracial relationships thwarted the casting intention. Queer characters eventually fared better.For the obsessive viewer, \u201cSlayers & Vampires\u201d is a new primary text to pore over, with plenty of behind-the-scenes tidbits about who hated whom and how TV shows are made. The authors even devote about 10 pages to the \u201cBuffy\u201d cast and crew recalling the creation of \u201cOnce More, With Feeling,\u201d the popular sixth-season musical episode that proved to be a bright spot in the grim American fall of 2001.That musical episode, like many of the early \u201cBuffy\u201d scripts, was written and directed by Joss Whedon, the show\u2019s creator and a frequent voice in \u201cSlayers & Vampires.\u201d Dissatisfied with the way his film screenplays were produced by others, he vowed: \u201cThe next person who ruins one of my scripts is going to be me.\u201dThat\u2019s not the only place he declined to comment. At the very end of \u201cSlayers & Vampires,\u201d the authors note that Whedon\u2019s numerous responses were taken from conversations he\u2019d had elsewhere with the co-author Edward Gross. In their acknowledgments, the authors also state that \u201cin almost all cases, material is taken from original interviews\u201d but admit to scraping public comments from news conferences and conventions into the manuscript.The revelation that \u201cSlayers & Vampires\u201d is something of a cut-and-paste job is not much of a surprise, given the sometimes-disjointed flow of the commentary, with writers and actors directly contradicting one another as if they weren\u2019t in the same room. Nearly identical comments from the same person appearing a page or two apart also distract. Key actors like Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendon (who played two of Buffy\u2019s closest buddies, Willow and Xander) are barely in the book, which is also devoid of photos.\u201cSlayers & Vampires\u201d is clearly intended for \u201cBuffy\u201d and \u201cAngel\u201d aficionados, but these dedicated fans are also going to notice skewed representation and authorial slips. For example, in the synopsis describing the excellent second season of \u201cBuffy,\u201d the authors write that events forced \u201cBuffy to turn Mr. Pointy on the former object of her affections.\u201dWhile it sounds like a hip reference, Mr. Pointy was actually the favorite stake of Kendra, the Jamaican slayer who came forth as a plot point in the first season \u2014 and Buffy skewered her beloved with a sword blessed by a virtuous knight who had defeated the demon Acathla centuries before. Seriously, guys, Buffyverse fans notice these details and we get cranky about our fictional realities.J.D.

{"Headline": "Governor Cuomo Proposes More Disclosure for Online Political Ads in New York", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 Following a federal push for more disclosure, and amid investigations into Russian meddling into American elections, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is proposing legislation to close legal loopholes in New York regarding political ads on the internet, with the goal of pressuring companies like Facebook to root out foreign-based interlopers in online campaigns.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal, which would require approval from a divided New York legislature, would also require that digital companies that receive money for ads maintain a publicly accessible file showing which person or group is responsible for their content. That, too, is part of the federal bill, though the proposed federal benchmarks for such disclosure seemingly target larger companies with at least 50 million unique monthly viewers. The proposed New York law would likely have lower thresholds for disclosure, likely set by state regulators, according to Alphonso David, the governor\u2019s counsel.All told, the New York bills would \u201ccombat unscrupulous and shadowy threats to our electoral process,\u201d according to a statement from Mr. Cuomo, after \u201ca systematic effort to undermine and manipulate our very democracy\u201d during the 2016 presidential campaign.In a statement issued on Thursday, Will Castleberry, Facebook\u2019s vice president for state and local public policy, said that the company was also \u201cfirmly committed to transparency in political advertising,\u201d and as well as to \u201cprotecting our platforms and the people who use them from bad actors trying to undermine our democracy.\u201dHe added that Facebook looked forward \u201cto working with Governor Cuomo and other lawmakers on those issues over the coming year.\u201dOn the issue of online ads, Mr. Cuomo, a second-term Democrat who is a purported presidential contender, lined up statements of support from Mr. Warner and Ms. Klobuchar. And initial reaction from election law experts suggested that such ideas would be an improvement on current disclosure requirements.\u201cThe more transparency we have as far as who is putting out ads and messages, the better informed the voter is,\u201d said Jerry H. Goldfeder, a veteran New York elections lawyer.Paul Seamus Ryan, the vice president of policy and litigation for Common Cause, a nonprofit that pushes for government accountability and supports the federal bill, says that expanding disclosure rules to online advertisements is an idea that states like New York should embrace. \u201cIt makes good sense at federal level and makes good sense at a state level, too,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.The public-filing requirement, however, might be trickier to implement, said Mr. Ryan, who wondered how strong enforcement of the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d clause would be at a state level, which he called \u201cpretty weak tea.\u201d\u201cThere are stronger ways to address foreign meddling in U.S. elections,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s an improvement on the status quo.\u201dMr. David added that the proposals were meant to address \u201ca huge gaping hole\u201d in state election law and require billion-dollar internet companies to exercise \u201cdue diligence in posting political advertising.\u201d\u201cWhy is it that individuals have to register to place a political ad in the newspaper,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not if they are posting it online?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Bill Hysteria", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn case you haven\u2019t heard, nearly all that\u2019s good and pleasant in the world died this week. The tax bill passed.To which any G.O.P. political strategist would rejoin: Keep it up, folks.There are things genuinely to dislike in the tax bill. It raises taxes on too many people. It barely cuts the top income-tax rate. It doesn\u2019t eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax. Taxpayers will get kicked into higher brackets (of which there are still too many) sooner, thanks to a new measure of inflation.Worst of all is probably the provision for full expensing, which allows companies immediately to deduct the cost of capital investments from their tax bill. This is supposed to be the most stimulative part of the bill, especially for smaller companies looking to grow. But it\u2019s also an invitation to invest \u2014 and over-invest \u2014 based on tax incentives rather than the straight business case. Bankruptcies will follow.O.K., no doubt your objections are different (and probably stronger) than mine. But here are two things to know: Slashing corporate rates \u2014 the bill\u2019s central achievement \u2014 is good economics. And wailing against the bill as an American Armageddon is dumb politics, at least for Democrats.On the first point, consider the following case against the outgoing system:\u201cOur current corporate tax system is outdated, unfair and inefficient. It provides tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas and hits companies that choose to stay in America with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It is unnecessarily complicated and forces America\u2019s small businesses to spend countless hours and dollars filing their taxes. It\u2019s not right and it needs to change.\u201dAnd maybe there\u2019s something to be said for Google parking several billion dollars in profits in a Bermuda shell company, just to take advantage of the islands\u2019 zero rate. It\u2019s delightfully devious coming from the well-heeled apostles of \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil.\u201dBut the suggestion by senior Democrats that it is now a moral abomination to enact the very type of tax reform they themselves favored until quite recently smacks of partisan dishonesty, if not ideological hysteria. Many developed countries, including Germany, Sweden and Britain, have all slashed their corporate rates in recent years. Lo, the sky did not fall.A Times analysis of the poll also found that half of the people who will get a tax cut under the bill don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get one, likely out of distrust for the president.Time will tell, and stuff happens \u2014 think: war on the Korean peninsula, or perhaps a Bitcoin meltdown. For now, the G.O.P.\u2019s legislative triumph is only being sweetened by the wildly overblown reaction to it. Why liberals would want to give the administration a holiday gift like this is beyond me, but, anyway, Merry Christmas.Gail Collins is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Company Markets Itself to the Newly Divorced With a Ring to Sell", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingDozens of people were gathered on a Manhattan rooftop, nibbling on appetizers, sipping drinks and toasting the author Emma Johnson and her new book, \u201cThe Kickass Single Mom.\u201dMs. Johnson\u2019s pink dress matched the cover of her book as she drifted through the gathering. The Midtown rooftop was festooned with strings of lights, and featured a spectacular view of the Empire State Building.It is a message of empowerment that Worthy hopes will translate into more customers.Founded by an Israeli businessman, Benny De-Kalo, the company serves as middleman between customers and buyers, who are usually small diamond dealers or jewelry designers. Worthy takes a seller\u2019s and buyer\u2019s fee starting at 20 percent for a $5,000 a ring, less for the more expensive ones. The seller sends the ring to the company, which values it and offers to let the customer auction it off on its website; the seller can pull out of the auction at any point before receiving a minimum bid.An auction typically lasts two days, said Gil Gadot, Worthy\u2019s chief operating officer. About 20 percent of rings don\u2019t sell because they don\u2019t meet the seller\u2019s minimum. If the item doesn\u2019t sell at auction, there is no fee.From the way the company\u2019s executives talk, it could be easy to think Worthy\u2019s mission was therapy for divorced women rather than selling jewelry. The staff has been trained to \u201cunderstand the journey\u201d that customers have been on, a company spokeswoman, Judy Herbst, said. Roy Albers, the company\u2019s chief gemologist, will often get on the phone with a potential seller to explain why a diamond may be worth \u2014 or not worth \u2014 a certain price.\u201cThe recently divorced have been through fire. They may have been lied to, cheated,\u201d said Mr. Albers, who was formerly chief gemologist for Tiffany & Company. \u201cWe do a lot of hand-holding here.\u201dStacey Freeman, 45, a divorced single mother of three children, is lifestyle editor for Worthy. She writes three to five articles a month for the company\u2019s site and for outside publications.\u201cI am that person who went through that divorce,\u201d she said. She hasn\u2019t sold her engagement ring, however. Her mother had it made into a necklace.\u201cIt\u2019s an insurance policy,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I need to, it\u2019s salable.\u201dHer articles and others by writers for the company\u2019s blog almost all focus on life after divorce. There are posts on saving money, dating, traveling and empowerment through living as a single woman.\u201cIt\u2019s a whole emotional campaign,\u201d said Anthony DeMarco, founder of Jewelry News Network, a website about jewelry and watches.Maura Enright, 49, of Oxford, Conn., is a typical Worthy customer. She was married for 11 years before a divorce in 2012. She held on to her ring for a while, and then decided to see what she could get for it.\u201cEvery time I thought I would get it priced, I felt like I was getting ripped off,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was worth it to give it up for a few thousand dollars.\u201d She found Worthy online and reached out, and someone from the company called her back.\u201cThat was key because I\u2019m so busy,\u201d she said. She sold her ring through Worthy for $7,000. Now, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve told all my divorced friends about it.\u201dThe company also runs contests, like the one recently in which women could vie for a chance to be flown to Manhattan for the book party. The winner, Janelle Johnson, 34, of Milwaukee, was awarded airfare and hotel costs for her and a friend, after describing how she is trying to start her own business after the dissolution of her marriage of one year. Worthy even paid for child care for Ms. Johnson\u2019s two children while she was in New York.She sold her engagement ring through Worthy and got about $350, roughly a quarter of its original price. \u201cI was more than satisfied,\u201d she said, noting that the money helped pay for a few dinners during her trip to Manhattan.\u201cMy audience is their audience,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a perfect marriage.\u201dWithout the ring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Indonesia\u2019s Crackdown on Gay Men Moves From Bars Into the Home", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Steven Handoko admits it wasn\u2019t his most dignified moment. Naked as the day he was born, the bookish 25-year-old had been invited on stage by one of the strippers hired for a party at the Atlantis Gym.That hardly qualified as outrageous behavior in the red-light district of Kelapa Gading in North Jakarta, where the Atlantis was located. Nearby were plenty of venues with suggestive names like the Playboy Sensation, massage parlors for straight men. The Atlantis was a gay sauna in a conservative country, but given the generally live-and-let-live milieu of the Indonesian capital\u2019s night life, Mr. Handoko felt safe, if a little embarrassed.But he wasn\u2019t. Soon after he took the stage, the police stormed the premises. Officers herded naked, cowering men into the middle of the room and began taking photos, some of which \u2014 including one of Mr. Handoko \u2014 appeared on Indonesian social media within hours. He and 140 other men were taken away.\u201cWhen a future employer Googles me, this is what they will see,\u201d Mr. Handoko, an aspiring journalist, said last week in an interview at Cipinang prison in Jakarta, where he has been held since the raid in May.This week, prosecutors notified Mr. Handoko\u2019s family that he had been sentenced in absentia to two years and three months in prison, convicted of violating Indonesia\u2019s antipornography law, which includes a ban on striptease performances.In Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority country, homosexuality has generally been tolerated, if marginalized. But that began to change last year, when the authorities, under pressure from right-wing Islamic groups, started arresting gay men in what experts say are unprecedented numbers, raiding not just bars and saunas but hotel rooms and private apartments.The crackdown began in November 2016, when the police broke up a party in South Jakarta and detained 13 men. The most recent incident was in October, when 51 men were arrested at what is thought to be Jakarta\u2019s last gay sauna. (The Atlantis closed soon after the raid in May.)Most of the hundreds of men swept up in the raids were released with no charges filed, and few cases have made it to trial. Nine other detainees from the Atlantis raid were sentenced last week to more than two years in prison.But even men who weren\u2019t charged have been subjected to humiliating scrutiny and lurid news coverage, with their photos often posted on social media. Indonesian news outlets breathlessly detailed services offered at the Atlantis, like mock jail cells for role playing, and speculated that it was a hub for prostitution.The authorities have justified the raids by citing the pornography law\u2019s loosely worded ban on material or actions that undermine public decency. Ade Armando, a communications professor at the University of Indonesia who helped draft the pornography statute, said the raids went well beyond the law\u2019s intent.\u201cIt is not fair. It is not right what the police are doing there,\u201d Mr. Armando said. \u201cHotels are private places. The pornography law does not apply.\u201d\u201cMost Indonesians had no idea what \u2018gay\u2019 meant,\u201d he said. \u201cThis just was not on the government\u2019s radar.\u201dIn early 2016, the minister of higher education banned an L.G.B.T. student group from the University of Indonesia campus. Later, the broadcasting regulator banned the depiction of gay characters or effeminate men on television.Mr. Boellstorff said the current crackdown on gay men had no precedent. \u201cThings are worse now than they have ever been in Indonesian history\u201d for gay people, he said.Rights advocates had been skeptical that Mr. Handoko and the other Atlantis defendants would get fair trials. The head judge, Pinta Uli Boru Tarigan, was criticized by Human Rights Watch in 2011 for expressing contempt for the Ahmadis, a minority Muslim sect, while overseeing the trial of men charged in a mob attack that killed three of them. Mr. Handoko said Judge Tarigan recounted the story of Sodom and Gomorrah at one of his hearings.\u201cShe had a poor record on human rights,\u201d said Ricky Gunawan, a lawyer for the Community Legal Aid Institute in Jakarta, which specializes in human rights cases.Mr. Handoko said his family hired a lawyer chosen by the police, and he entered a guilty plea that was essentially a carbon copy of the prosecution\u2019s charges. A sister of Mr. Handoko, who asked not to be identified because she feared repercussions at her workplace, said the family had cooperated in hopes of a lenient sentence.\u201cWe were worried that the court would be like quicksand,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more you struggle, the quicker you sink.\u201dMr. Handoko\u2019s sister had suspected something was wrong on the night of the Atlantis raid, when he uncharacteristically failed to respond to text messages. The next day, fearing the worst after colleagues said they hadn\u2019t heard from him, she left work early and drove home to be with her mother. On the way, cryptic messages of support began arriving from distant relatives.At home she found her mother, a devout Christian, in tears \u2014 not just because her son had been arrested, but because he was gay.Many Indonesians have struggled to put the news about the raids into context, because there are few positive examples of gay men in the popular media, Mr. Handoko\u2019s sister said. There is no Indonesian equivalent of \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d she said.Mr. Handoko\u2019s mother has been supportive since overcoming her initial shock, as have other family members and friends. About once a week, she braves Jakarta\u2019s awful traffic, and the hour or so it takes to wind through security, to visit him in prison. His life there has been a dull routine of exercise, library and church. He said he hadn\u2019t been mistreated.But Mr. Handoko, referring bitterly to the \u201cIt Gets Better\u201d campaign aimed at bullied gay youths, was not optimistic about what the future held for a gay man in Indonesia.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get better, does it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Amtrak Has an App to Guide You", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPennsylvania Station in Manhattan is such a confusing, multilevel maze of corridors lined with pizza parlors and coffee shops that even veteran commuters occasionally get lost.Starting on Wednesday, Amtrak, the national railroad that serves as the station\u2019s landlord, will offer a guiding light in the form of a smartphone app. The free app, FindYourWay, was designed to help travelers navigate the labyrinthine station and to avoid the crowds that form around the electronic boards that provide train information.\u201cThe experience in Penn Station, if you\u2019re not there every day, can be daunting,\u201d said Bob Dorsch, an Amtrak executive who oversaw the creation of the app. \u201cWe know that a ton of our customers stand at that big board and wait for the train gate to come up and scurry off to the ramp.\u201dHerds of passengers forming around the boards and then stampeding toward narrow staircases to catch trains is \u201csomewhat of a security risk,\u201d Mr. Dorsch said. Providing gate assignments in real time through the app should reduce the size of those gatherings and lower the overall level of anxiety within the station, he said.The app could also spare the police officers in the station from having to provide directions to so many disoriented travelers, said Lenka Hennessy, marketing director for Amtrak.\u201cPeople are always asking: Where is my gate? Where is the restroom? Where is the A.T.M.?\u201d Ms. Hennessy said, while offering a demonstration of the app\u2019s wayfinding function on her phone.Zyter has installed more than 300 small beacons in Amtrak\u2019s section of the station and plans to install 300 more in the areas that are managed by the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit. The beacons allow the app to recognize pinpoint a user\u2019s location within the station, data that Ms. Hennessy said would not be stored afterward.Initially, the app will provide real-time information about only Amtrak trains, but Mr. Dorsch said Amtrak hoped eventually to include information about the commuter trains as well. And Ms. Hennessy said Amtrak hoped to add other stations around the country to the app.\u201cIf we\u2019re able to implement something here, doing it in Boston, doing it in Chicago, doing it in Philadelphia is almost a piece of cake,\u201d she said, alluding to the complexity of Penn Station and the 650,000 people who pass through it on a typical weekday.\u201cI know my way around New York,\u201d said Ms. Goodell, who commutes daily from South Orange, N.J., to her job as a college textbook designer in Manhattan. But inside Penn Station, she said, \u201cI have to depend solely on the landmarks of stores. There\u2019s the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and then the bookstore.\u201dMs. Goodell, 40, said she used her smartphone to look up train information on New Jersey Transit\u2019s website, but usually double-checked the video screens she passed on her way to the platform. She said she probably would download the FindYourWay app and \u201cmaybe try it in those moments of desperation where I have to deviate from my already-learned paths.\u201dBut she was wary about spending too much time staring at her phone among the shifting tides of harried commuters. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get stuck standing still and having to look down at your screen,\u201d Ms. Goodell said, \u201cbecause you\u2019re going to get knocked over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Business Schools Now Teaching #MeToo, N.F.L. Protests and Trump", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNASHVILLE \u2014 Tim Vogus, a professor at Vanderbilt University\u2019s business school, was stoking the debate in his classroom one day this fall, asking first-year M.B.A. students about one of the most successful, and controversial, companies of the day. On the syllabus was Uber, a case study in both sensational business success and rampant corporate misbehavior.There were some awkward chuckles, and then hands started popping up. \u201cIt\u2019s carrying fraternity culture with you into adult life,\u201d said one student, Nick Glennon. Another student, Jonathon Brangan, said, \u201cIt\u2019s arrogance mixed with the feeling of invincibility.\u201d\u201cYou basically have these 20-year-olds who are in charge of these companies that are worth billions of dollars,\u201d said Monroe Stadler, 26. \u201cAnd they fly too close to the sun.\u201dAn M.B.A. education is no longer just about finance, marketing, accounting and economics. As topics like sexual harassment dominate the national conversation and chief executives weigh in on the ethical and social issues of the day, business schools around the country are hastily reshaping their curriculums with case studies ripped straight from the headlines.At Vanderbilt, there are classes on Uber and \u201cbro\u201d culture. At Stanford, students are studying sexual harassment in the workplace. And at Harvard, the debate encompasses sexism and free speech.\u201cSomething has changed,\u201d said Ed Soule, a professor at the Georgetown McDonough School of Business. \u201cI would be kidding you if I told you there wasn\u2019t a different vibe in the classroom.\u201dThis fall, Professor Soule assigned coursework covering sexual harassment at Uber, how companies like Amazon respond when attacked by Mr. Trump and the social justice protests by N.F.L. players.During one class, students debated whether players should have been more deferential to the wishes of team owners and the league, or whether the league should have supported players more vocally. The conversation grew tense when the topic turned to respect for the national anthem, and Mr. Trump\u2019s forceful response to players who continued to kneel as it was played.\u201cEthics and values have taken on more significance,\u201d Professor Soule said. \u201cIt has to do with all of the things going on in this administration, often things that challenge our understanding of ethics and leadership.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a growing body of M.B.A.s who are really passionate about this,\u201d said LaToya Marc, who graduated from Harvard Business School last spring and now works in sales and operations at Comcast. \u201cIt may not affect your bottom line directly, but it needs to be affecting how you make decisions.\u201dStudents also realize that as leaders of increasingly diverse work forces, they will need to understand their employees\u2019 perspectives on national debates, and how corporate decisions affect them.\u201cIt is a shift, absolutely, mostly because all of our companies are just starting to look a lot different,\u201d Ms. Marc said.One way that some business schools are responding is by drawing on the social sciences, like behavioral economics and psychology. The Stanford Graduate School of Business\u2019s ethics class \u2014 taught by two political scientists, one an expert in behavior and the other in game theory \u2014 sounds more like a course in human nature than in finance.A new topic this year is sexual harassment, and how to create a workplace culture in which people feel comfortable reporting it. The Stanford students studied psychological research showing that people are more willing to challenge authority if at least one other person joins them, and discussed ways to encourage such reporting.\u201cIt\u2019s not just how the C.E.O. of Uber was treating women,\u201d Ms. Mandelbaum said. \u201cThe bias is throughout the system.\u201d\u201cWe said, \u2018This is not just a gender issue. It\u2019s a business issue,\u2019\u201d Ms. Meyer said. \u201cIt has marketing implications, legal implications, H.R. implications.\u201dTwo dozen schools have started groups based on the program, including groups called the Manbassadors, for men committed to gender equity in business, at the business schools at Columbia, Dartmouth and Harvard.The goal is \u201cmaking sure that as men we\u2019re very aware of some of the privileges we\u2019re afforded simply because of gender,\u201d said Alen Amini, a third-year student at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth and a founder of its Manbassadors group.As previously taboo subjects enter the classroom debate, students and professors are still adjusting.At Vanderbilt, Professor Vogus solicited ideas from the class about how Uber might change its ways. One student suggested hiring fewer star engineers and more team players. Another proposed hiring a woman to lead human resources.\u201cWe have a \u2018C.E.-bro\u2019 culture in the technology sector today, but we\u2019ve had \u2018C.E.-bros\u2019 throughout time,\u201d said a student, April Hughes. \u201cEnron was an example of this. All the guys there thought they were smarter than everyone else.\u201dThe class turned testy, however, as students debated whether Uber\u2019s hard-charging culture might have been an asset.\u201cSome of that brashness was actually critical to the company being successful,\u201d said one student, Andrew Bininger.When the Uber conversation turned to gender and power dynamics, a female student suggested that women in the Vanderbilt M.B.A. program had to work harder than their male counterparts.\u201cThe women who do make it to business school are all super strong personalities, whereas the men here can float through without being the cream of the crop,\u201d Natalie Copley said, adding of the women in the class, \u201cThey\u2019re not meek little timid things.\u201dThat drew jeers from the men in the group, and Professor Vogus changed the subject.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "City of the Future? Humans, Not Technology, Are the Challenge in Toronto", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 For a city striving to become a major technology center, it was a prize catch: A Google corporate sibling would spend the coming year planning a futuristic metropolis in a derelict part of Toronto\u2019s waterfront.When announcing this fall that the company, Sidewalk Labs, would create a city of tomorrow, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada promised the project would create \u201ctechnologies that will help us build smarter, greener, more inclusive\u201d communities. Even the nasty weather off Lake Ontario would be tamed, the developer pledged.But tempering the excitement of some Toronto residents are concerns that are perhaps inevitable when it comes to a company renowned for collecting and analyzing data.Quayside, as the project is known, will be laden with sensors and cameras tracking everyone who lives, works or merely passes through the area. In what Sidewalk calls a marriage of technology and urbanism, the resulting mass of data will be used to further shape and refine the new city. Lifting a term from its online sibling, the company calls the Toronto project \u201ca platform.\u201dBut extending the surveillance powers of one of the world\u2019s largest technology companies from the virtual world to the real one raises privacy concerns for many residents. Others caution that, when it comes to cities, data-driven decision-making can be misguided and undemocratic.\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount of interest and also quite a bit of concern,\u201d said Shauna Brail, the director of the University of Toronto\u2019s urban studies program. \u201cIt will be a political issue no matter what.\u201dMr. Doctoroff, who peppers conversations about Quayside with references to \u201cconsultation\u201d and \u201ctransparency,\u201d came to Toronto fully expecting concerns and criticism.\u201cIf you\u2019re going convince people about new ideas, they have to be a part of it,\u201d Mr. Doctoroff said. \u201cThe whole notion of this place as a platform is apparently more democratic than, we think, traditional place-making has actually been.\u201dDuring its first two years in operation, Sidewalk looked at 52 places in the United States and several others around the world for a site to begin building cities of the future, Mr. Doctoroff said. But in Toronto, the company\u2019s interests found a match. An agency that included the federal government, the city and the province of Ontario was looking for a developer for about 800 acres of federally owned waterfront just east of downtown.It was last developed during the 1950s, when officials hoped that the St. Lawrence Seaway would allow trade with Europe to become an integral part of Toronto\u2019s economy.Little of that vision came to fruition. The area is now home to overflow parking for car dealerships, an abandoned grain elevator and docks lined with small, slightly shabby cruise boats where high school prom parties are held. No one calls it home.The current agreement between Sidewalk and the three government entities covers only 12 acres, for an initial experiment.Pretty much everything in Quayside will be reimagined. Buildings will be prefabricated for the most part, and will be highly energy-efficient; breaking with traditional zoning rules, they will not have fixed uses. A Sidewalk drawing shows a low-rise structure in which office workers and apartment dwellers share space with what appears to be a large distillery. Packages will be delivered by robot; other robots will pick up the garbage.Private cars will be restricted in favor of self-driving cars (another area of interest for Alphabet), walking, cycling and mass transit. The wires and pipes that are the connective tissue of every city will sit inside tunnels fitted with access panels that Sidewalk claims will eliminate the need to dig up streets. Neighborhood mini-grids that do not rely on fossil fuels will supply electricity.When it rains, or the hot summer sun beats down, massive awnings will unfold; heated paths will melt the snow to make way for cyclists in winter.But its data-collection capability may be the greatest distinction, and source of opposition, for the Sidewalk plan.Sensors inside buildings will measure such things as noise, while an array of cameras and outdoor sensors will track everything from air pollution to the movement of people and vehicles through intersections.Nothing is too prosaic to analyze: Toilets and sinks will report their water use; the garbage robots will report on trash collection. Residents and workers in the area will rely on Sidewalk-developed software to gain access to public services; the data gathered from everything will influence long-term planning and development.To Mr. Doctoroff, that marriage of data and urbanism holds the key to the project\u2019s success.\u201cWe looked at literally about 150 different attempts to create urban innovation districts, cities of the future, smart cites.\u201d he said. All of them, in Sidewalk\u2019s view, failed because they could not bridge the gulf between technology and traditional urban planning.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this at this scale before,\u201d Ms. Robinson said.Ms. Robinson expressed concern that Sidewalk\u2019s vast data might not reflect the city as a whole. Quayside\u2019s current plans promise housing for people of all income levels. But the only company so far committed to moving there is Google Canada, suggesting an influx of young, affluent workers.The data, Ms. Robinson warned, might be used to limit or discourage the otherwise legal use of public spaces by homeless people, teenagers or other groups.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to create what\u2019s effectively a gated community,\u201d she said.Like many other skeptics, Ms. Robinson noted that people online can avoid the all-seeing eye of technology companies by, for example, opting not to use social media sites. No obvious way to opt out of Quayside\u2019s surveillance systems exists, except by staying out of the area.\u201cDemocracy and the rights of citizens is inherently political; it\u2019s not something you should shy away from,\u201d said Ms. Sieber, who studies the use of data by citizen groups. \u201cGovernments need to be all about fairness.\u201d If city government were concerned only with efficiency, she said, \u201cyou don\u2019t send buses where it\u2019s rural or poor.\u201d\u201cWe believe there\u2019s enormous potential but we also are very sensitive to the fact that there\u2019s going to have to be an intense community conversation,\u201d Mr. Doctoroff said. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to commit the money to do the planning over the course of the next year and leave it to the people of Toronto as to whether or not they are excited by the vision.\u201dFollow Ian Austen on Twitter: @ianraustenAdvertisement"}

But the Trump campaign foreign-policy adviser can\u2019t seem to stop talking.Supported byThe more Page talks, the less clear his story has become \u2014 and people have begun to wonder about not just his competence but also his sanity. But as we walked through Manhattan that afternoon, Page assured me that he was playing a long game. \u201cHow do I say this without sounding overly confident or arrogant?\u201d he mused. \u201cNo one is better prepared to have gone through this than me.\u201d He flashed that familiar beatific smile. \u201cNot only am I ready for it,\u201d he said, \u201cI savor it.\u201dBefore I visited him in November, Page told me I was the first reporter he had allowed into the office. \u201cI\u2019m sure if you Google \u2018Carter Page shadowy,\u2019 hundreds of articles come up,\u201d he boasted. \u201cI like being a shadowy figure.\u201d But when I entered the inner sanctum, I discovered that Global Energy Capital\u2019s headquarters were actually a corporate co-working space. Page, the firm\u2019s only employee, rents a windowless room \u2014 outfitted with a small circular table, a whiteboard on wheels and a painting of an orchid \u2014 by the hour. Other tenants include the National Shingles Foundation and a wedding-band company called Star Talent Inc. Still, when he mentioned Trump, Page cocked his head toward Fifth Avenue and referred to him as \u201cthe gentleman next door here.\u201dThe office is one of many things about Page that are less than initially meets the eye. When Trump announced Page as one of his foreign-policy advisers during a meeting with The Washington Post editorial board in March 2016, he was eager to tout Page\u2019s credentials, identifying him as \u201cCarter Page, Ph.D.\u201d Page\u2019s doctoral adviser for his degree, received in 2011 from the University of London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies, was Shirin Akiner, a controversial scholar who has been derided by fellow academics and human rights groups for trying to whitewash human rights abuses in Uzbekistan. But in an email, Akiner told me, \u201cI am afraid I have no information about Carter Page \u2014 some 10 years ago, he was one of my many students.\u201dPage tried unsuccessfully to publish his doctoral dissertation, on energy in Central Asia and Russia, as a book \u2014 a failure for which he has blamed the \u201canti-former Soviet Union, anti-Russia sentiment of various academic publishers.\u201d But one political scientist who reviewed Page\u2019s manuscript told me: \u201cIt was very analytically confused, just throwing a lot of stuff out there without any real kind of argument. I gave it a thumbs down \u2014 and that\u2019s kind of rare in this business for a review of a full book manuscript.\u201dIt was the Trump campaign that finally provided Page what he had been seeking for years: a seat at the table. Ed Cox, the chairman of the New York State Republican Committee and an acquaintance, secured Page a meeting in early 2016 with Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who in turn passed off Page to Sam Clovis, a talk-show host and conservative activist in Iowa who was building out Trump\u2019s foreign-policy team. Even among Trump advisers, that team was an object of derision. \u201cTo call them D-listers would be an insult to D-listers,\u201d one former Trump adviser says. But Page didn\u2019t see it that way at all. \u201cThese were some of the best discussions I ever had, with some of the most impressive people,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was like an oasis.\u201d\u201cThe team is only as strong as the weakest link,\u201d Page told me. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not that I\u2019m a weak link. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m the link getting smashed with an anvil.\u201d Testifying before the House Intelligence Committee in November, he lamented, \u201cUnfortunately, I am the biggest embarrassment surrounding the campaign.\u201dPage hasn\u2019t always helped himself in his dealings with investigators. For more than a year, he vacillated on whether he hadPage continues to insist that there was nothing nefarious about any of his work for the Trump campaign. Besides, he told me, the foreign-policy team he served on was \u201ca lower-level working group, of which I was on the lower end of the lower level.\u201d And yet Page seemingly can\u2019t quite stomach the prospect of returning to the periphery, so he has crafted an alternative scandal narrative \u2014 a scandal in which he sits at the center. Page contends that the real story of the 2016 election was not collusion between Trump and Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton but rather collusion between the Democratic National Committee \u2014 which helped pay for the Steele dossier \u2014 and the F.B.I. to defeat Trump. And their efforts, Page insists, focused on him. \u201cI was the most central element, the central linchpin,\u201d he told me. Referring to his wiretapping by the F.B.I., he added: \u201cThere are two people who got hacked last year: Podesta\u201d \u2014 John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, whose emails were published by WikiLeaks \u2014 \u201cand me.\u201dThere may be scant evidence for this theory, but rhetorically, it has allowed Page to insist on his innocence and his significance at the same time: If circumstances have conspired to keep him from being a wise man, then at least he can be a martyr. The whole affair has wrecked his business, he says, and cost him relationships. He compares himself to the oft-imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. He even likens his plight to those of women who have suffered sexual harassment or assault. \u201cTalk to some ladies you know,\u201d he told me, \u201cand ask them: \u2018What would you rather have? Someone putting their hand on your rear end or your breast momentarily? Or having to give up all of your personal communications, all of your thousands of emails and thousands of documents? Which would you prefer?\u2019 It\u2019s a powerful person putting influence on someone who\u2019s less powerful.\u201dIn September, Page filed a libel lawsuit against Yahoo\u2019s corporate parent and the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which operates Radio Free Europe, for their reporting about his July Moscow trip \u2014 \u201cperhaps the most dangerous, reckless, irresponsible and historically instrumental moments in modern-day sensational crime-story journalism,\u201d as the suit puts it. Page is representing himself. \u201cThe real investigation, I think, is going to be the discovery process in my lawsuit,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe information that will come out of this may be far more revealing than these other investigations.\u201dAnd in that, Page maintains, he will be able to achieve his most important goal: avoiding a cataclysmic conflict between the United States and Russia. He believes he is uniquely suited, perhaps even destined, to bring the two countries together. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously for myself in some ways, but the bigger motivation is to prevent the legacy of ashes, the next Iraq, the next Libya, the next Vietnam, which are all minuscule compared to the level of potential conflict between our two countries,\u201d Page told me.An earlier version of this article described incorrectly Carter Page\u2019s statements about his interactions with Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich. Page vacillated on whether he met with any Russian government officials. It is not the case that until his November 2017 testimony, he maintained that he hadn\u2019t met with any Russian government officials on a 2016 trip to Moscow.Advertisement"}

For now, she settles for a stall at one of San Francisco\u2019s outdoor markets.The base purchase price of the Cold Prep is $65,000 each for a minimum order of three \u2014 about the price of a new food truck, but with three locations (instead of just one) and none of the maintenance required by a kitchen on wheels. Vendors outside the Bay Area will be able only to buy, not rent, unless there\u2019s enough demand for Mr. Cohen to create an additional transportation hub. He has 20 Cuberts ready to go and plans to build the rest to order, with a six-week lead time; he hopes to have so many orders that six weeks quickly becomes a struggle.For the fall test drive, an Off the Grid employee drove the Cubert to Fort Mason on a flatbed truck, unfolded it, extended the flap that shields customers from inclement weather and made sure that the self-contained sinks and refrigeration unit were working. Ms. Miranda, a 26-year-old baker, arrived later that morning with her ingredients and a deep fryer that she connected to the unit\u2019s generator.When she was done for the day, she went home. The Off the Grid driver cleaned, folded and loaded the cube back onto the truck, and drove it to a storage space.The temporary-stall model has grown as well: For the last two years, Mr. Cohen \u2014 who started with three markets and now runs 15 (with as many as 60 weekly events in the March-through-October season) \u2014 has fielded about 350 applications for eight or nine open slots at Fort Mason alone.Jon Feldman, Stumptown\u2019s vice president in charge of wholesale accounts, sees potential for growth at sites where specialty coffee couldn\u2019t go before. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to do what we do from any old place: power and water requirements, space constraints,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Cubert you can open a small coffee outlet in the middle of a field,\u201d for, say, a music festival.Brian Lewis, senior vice president for retail development and curation at Kilroy Realty Corporation in San Diego, plans to install a Cubert in a San Francisco office building early in 2018, to see if it can revive a moribund corner of a ground-floor plaza. He wants to replace a cafe in a Santa Monica, Calif., property with one as well, betting that the Cubert can give older properties an edge in what he calls \u201can all-out amenities war with our competition.\u201dIf big companies bite, Mr. Cohen will be able to expand his transportation and support network beyond the Bay Area, though he is quick to reassure potential customers outside the region that hiring \u201ca flatbed truck isn\u2019t a big thing,\u201d and that Off the Grid is ready to help purchasers find a local transport company. He is already thinking about ways to improve the basic Cubert, including climate control to make them cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.For now, Ms. Miranda is grateful simply to have been awarded a Cubert at Fort Mason in the spring, as a way of thanking her for trying it last fall. The cube made her life \u201cso much easier,\u201d she said, and made her dream of a bakery seem within reach.\u201cIt would be a huge next step,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite a food truck or brick and mortar, but it\u2019s not a tent outside.

However, their desire to share their union with their community prompted them to hold a reception in Denver. Enter cake. The bakery owner, Jack Phillips, turned them down, citing a religious objection. The couple sued, claiming the bakery violated Colorado\u2019s anti-discrimination law.Ostensibly, this is a free-speech case. The baker has a right, as an individual, to express his disapproval of the choice of two men to make a life together. Does he have the right to convert that disapproval into refusing service? When granted the right to marry, are we also granted the right to a wedding and a host of other cultural expressions?Nothing has surprised me more than finding out I abhorred wedding planning. I consider myself a mix of Auntie Mame and the guy who is always dropping by Ina Garten\u2019s house just in time for crudit\u00e9s and gossip. Putting on a huge to-do is what I was born for. I see it as part of a queer cultural inheritance: a resilient determination to celebrate, despite oppressive social policies.It felt like the dream of my ancestors that I would be able to register for expensive gravy boats and sign a document held in City Hall. It also felt like a chore.\u201cI have been waiting for this moment my entire life,\u201d I told my husband-to-be, David, clutching my first expo registration like a golden ticket. \u201cThere will be so much free cake! There will be brochures! About napkins!\u201d I waxed rhapsodic about signing onto the mailing lists of various D.J.\u2019s; he nodded. He expressed regrets he couldn\u2019t join. He\u2019s a pastor and the expo was on a Sunday, a work day.I wasn\u2019t about to let religious expression get in the way of my pursuit of cake samples, so I went alone.\u201cWhere\u2019s the bride-to-be?\u201d a vendor asked as I stared at his tower of orchids. I replied, \u201cWell, there isn\u2019t one.\u201dA lighting designer asked, \u201cAre you making decisions for the lucky lady?\u201d I cocked my head. \u201cI am the lucky lady,\u201d I said.I had expected to be showered with attention and, more important, complimentary carbohydrates. Despite my \u201cI\u2019m getting married!\u201d sticker, I found myself ignored.I ventured up to the third floor and found a table with a surfeit of cake options, but no labels. \u201cDo you think one of these is lemon?\u201d a woman next to me asked. I turned to her: \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201dShe replied, \u201cEat them all?\u201d My soul mate.She asked me if I was enjoying myself. I shrugged. \u201cApparently, you\u2019re invisible without a bride,\u201d I said.She told me she understood. She wore scrubs, with her hair tied back, a marked difference from the party-casual dress of many other attendees. She explained that she was a vet and had accidentally left her engagement ring at work. Grabbing two more slices of cake, we wandered away from the table.We were interrupted by a voice: \u201cHello, young lovers!\u201d We found ourselves in front of a centerpiece vendor who hadn\u2019t had time for me earlier. A woman behind the table waved at us. \u201cSo, when\u2019s the big day?\u201d I looked at the vet. The vet replied, \u201cAugust.\u201d\u201cHow big?\u201d the vendor asked.\u201c150 people?\u201d I said.\u201cSo exciting,\u201d the vendor said, as she cracked open a huge binder. As we excused ourselves, she grabbed my arm. \u201cThere\u2019s Champagne downstairs,\u201d she said, conspiratorially. \u201cMake sure you all get some!\u201dSeparately, the vet and I were two lonely, barely visible people with icing on our fingers. Together, we became a charming young black couple with a summer wedding and a deep interest in as many bite-size shortcakes as we could find. We looked the way people expected young and cake-worthy couples to look.We agreed to take this expo for everything it had to offer. It turns out heteronormativity is a very effective con.We bounced from table to table, collecting samples and spinning a tale of our joint bliss. At one point, taking a break from fish tacos and parfait trays, we leaned over a balcony and confessed that the process was harder than we\u2019d thought it was going to be. Money was shorter; time was fleeting; nothing felt magical. It was easy to feel you were doing it all wrong.\u201cThank you for being here,\u201d I said. She and I may not have aligned with vendors\u2019 ideas of who they were supposed to serve, but we both belonged.Ignoring a person, a union or an expression of love will not make it go away. We all have the right to free samples, to be seen and to be overwhelmed by the reality of our love.As the vet and I made moves to part ways, we realized we didn\u2019t know each other\u2019s names.\u201cI\u2019m Eric,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m Jessica,\u201d she replied.\u201cCongratulations,\u201d we said at the same time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Bill Offers Last-Minute Breaks for Developers, Banks and Oil Industry", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe overhaul by Republican lawmakers of the nation\u2019s tax laws percolated for weeks with virtually no public input, and by the end it turned into a chaotic mad dash with many last-minute changes on Friday night and Saturday morning, some handwritten in the margins of the nearly 500-page bill.Far from simplifying taxes, the bill opened up a whole range of tactics to lower the amount owed to the Internal Revenue Service. \u201cBusiness owners or managers that plan well and pay for good advice will be able to achieve much more favorable rates,\u201d said Adam Looney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury Department official. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that is a loophole or the intent of the legislation.\u201dOne of the bill\u2019s biggest windfalls for the wealthy \u2014 cutting taxes on income received through so-called pass-through entities like partnerships, popular with real estate developers \u2014 got even more generous. The richest taxpayers will be taxed at a rate of about 29.6 percent on such income, a big cut from the current top federal income tax rate of 39.6.That expansion would cost the government $114 billion more than an earlier version of the proposal. The provision would lower rates for taxpayers simply if their businesses are organized as partnerships or other entities whose tax burdens flow to the individual. Half of that type of income goes to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, according to the Tax Policy Center. In total, that tax cut will cost the government about $476 billion over the coming decade.Not all types of income would be eligible for the newly reduced rate. Short-term capital gains, dividends, interest and annuity payments, for example, are excluded. But the list of earnings that do qualify was expanded from earlier Republican proposals in the Senate.Investments in mortgages held by real estate investment trusts would be able to take advantage of the lower pass-through rate instead of being taxed at ordinary income rates, which are higher.Thanks to an amendment offered by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, certain income from gas and oil operators could also qualify for the new, lower rate. Industry representatives said they would have been excluded from the intended benefits that the real estate investment trusts and other publicly traded industries were getting.\u201cThe Senate went out of its way to confirm that passive investors in these publicly traded investment vehicles get the benefit of the pass-through discount tax rate,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a professor of tax law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cThis is a working definition of a tax boondoggle.\u201dA provision to give multinational companies like Pfizer, Google and Apple a tax break on the profits they have accumulated in offshore tax havens was made less generous than earlier versions of the proposal. But the companies would still bring those earnings home at rates of 7.5 to 14.5 percent \u2014 well below the existing corporate income tax rate of 35 percent and also lower than the new corporate income tax rate, which the bill would cut nearly in half to 20 percent. This break will still save the companies roughly half a trillion dollars compared with current law, according to an estimate by the Zion Research Group.Banks and other financial institutions will still be able to avoid taxes by making payments to offshore subsidiaries. The lawmakers had initially intended to prevent the tax benefits from such actions, but the banks got a last-minute reprieve for some transactions. In calculating the companies\u2019 tax bills, the bill excludes payments related to derivatives, a big source of income for financial institutions.Some last-minute changes were smaller and more peculiar: The bill includes limits on how much interest companies can deduct from their taxes, but excludes from those restrictions interest paid by car dealerships.The bill extends so-called bonus depreciation \u2014 the ability to take big deductions related to certain corporate investments \u2014 at a cost of $34 billion, but pays for it by reinstating the corporate alternative minimum tax. The last-minute decision to scrap the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax left lawyers and accountants scratching their heads about the ultimate impact. Several experts said it appeared unintentional that the benefit of the tax credit for research and experimentation could effectively be lost. The provision is dear to many businesses.\u201cOops,\u201d said Mr. Looney of the Brookings Institution. \u201cThat\u2019s an easy mistake to make on a first pass, but which you\u2019d catch if you had more time.\u201dAt least one Republican proposal floated for weeks made it into the final bill, but seemingly in a form designed to punish taxpayers in Democratic states. Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska, introduced an employee credit for paid family and medical leave. But the final version doesn\u2019t apply to employers in states where such paid leave is either required \u2014 or will soon be required \u2014 by state law, as in New York, California, New Jersey and Rhode Island. It also doesn\u2019t apply to employees making more than $72,000 and will last only until the end of 2019.\u201cSo in sum, we\u2019ve got a short-term fertility incentive for lower/middle-income employees, as long as you don\u2019t live in too blue a state,\u201d Daniel Hemel, a professor of tax law at the University of Chicago, wrote on Twitter.While wealthy investors and business would receive numerous tax cuts \u2014 including eliminating the estate tax for all but a tiny sliver of the country\u2019s wealthiest households \u2014 the Senate moved to tighten deductions for lower- and middle-income wage earners. The bill, for example, prohibits employers from rewarding employees with gift cards so that a reward of, say, $25 or $50 in the form of a gift card doesn\u2019t escape being taxed.At the same time, a provision to fund the I.R.S. so that it could offer advice to low-income filers was rejected in the final bill.Although the bill expands the child tax credit by a year to 17-year-olds, that change ends at the end of 2024, a year before other individual tax cuts are scheduled to expire \u2014 so families with children born in 2008 will see that credit end when their children are still 16.In the early morning hours on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence cast a tiebreaking vote to pass an amendment to allow people to use up to $10,000 a year from tax-advantaged 529 savings accounts for private and religious schools and some home schooling. Under current law, 529 accounts can be used only for higher education.An earlier version of this article misstated Kinder Morgan\u2019s current status. It has been a corporation since 2014, not a pass-through entity that would benefit from a provision in the Senate tax bill aimed at pass-through income from gas and oil operators. The article also misstated the status of limits on how much interest companies can deduct from their taxes. The limits would be imposed by the Senate tax bill that was approved last week, although not on interest paid by car dealerships. They are not included in the existing tax code.Clifford Krauss and Erica Green contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The N.F.L. Goes Deep With Mobile and Verizon", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith television audiences for the N.F.L. getting smaller, the league\u2019s new digital rights deal with Verizon Communications represents the latest challenge to the traditional media partnerships that for decades have served as the lifeblood for North America\u2019s richest sports league.The deal, which will cost Verizon more than $2 billion during the next five years, gives the telecommunications giant the rights to stream games across its variety of digital media brands, including Yahoo Sports, Complex and go90. In addition, fans no longer have to be Verizon customers to gain access to the games, which they can watch regardless of which company is their mobile provider.CBS, NBC, ESPN and Fox currently pay the NFL some $5 billion a year for the rights to televise those games. Those rights help those networks garner top fees from pay television distributors and help those distributors convince subscribers not to cut off their cable subscriptions.Rick Cordella, executive vice president and general manager for digital media at NBC Sports, a unit of the pay television distributor Comcast, said the Verizon deal could help expand the reach for NBC\u2019s advertisers, since fans watching the Verizon stream will see NBC\u2019s inventory of ads.\u201cWe are selling one audience, no matter where they watch our content,\u201d Cordella said.Like previous agreements with Amazon, Twitter and Yahoo, the new Verizon agreement illustrates the N.F.L.\u2019s proclivity to push the envelope to broaden its reach, especially among younger viewers, who may not have a pay television subscription, even if it means potentially angering its television partners as they approach the start of negotiations for new deals.In a statement announcing the deal, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league was thrilled to get more deeply involved with digital distribution.\u201cLive N.F.L. action directly on your mobile device \u2014 regardless of carrier \u2014 will give millions of fans additional ways to follow their favorite sport,\u201d Goodell said.Hans Schroeder, an N.F.L. executive in charge of media, believes fans won\u2019t choose to watch on their phones instead of their televisions, but instead will add to the television audience. \u201cWe think this is a very complementary way of growing, engaging and reaching younger fans that will ultimately become longer term viewers,\u201d he said.Since 2010, Verizon mobile customers have been able to stream N.F.L. games for free through the N.F.L. Mobile app.The deal potentially allows Verizon, and the N.F.L., to reach more people, but also does away with what made the previous agreements so lucrative for Verizon: Exclusivity. When signing an extension of the mobile agreement in 2013, Verizon executives said that the number of subscribers the N.F.L. Mobile app helped retain, or add, contributed to the company\u2019s decision to re-sign.Now Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile customers will also be allowed to stream N.F.L. games, as long as they go to Verizon-owned apps or websites with their mobile phones.Over the past few years, Verizon has acquired a spate of digital media companies, including paying more than $9 billion combined to buy AOL and Yahoo, a sign of the company\u2019s growing ambitions at becoming a digital media powerhouse able to challenge the likes of Google and Facebook for advertising dollars.There are some protections for traditional broadcast partners built into the agreement, which does not extend to streaming on tablets or through smart televisions.For the N.F.L., the deal is surely a short-term win. Verizon is paying nearly double the amount of money each year and doesn\u2019t retain exclusivity over the games, though they are adding a number of sponsorship benefits. But long term it seems certain to allow for further erosion of pay television subscriptions, and it will challenge the N.F.L.\u2019s partners in legacy media, who are already facing two straight years of declining ratings.The N.F.L.\u2019s broadcast agreements all expire after the 2022 season. With ratings trending downward and digital rights giants, such as Netflix, Facebook, Amazon and Google, so far balking at paying hundreds of millions, or billions, for sports rights, the N.F.L. could soon be in for a round of tense negotiations.Advertisement"}

However, it has also drawn a range of objectionable material, from videos promoting conspiracy theories to violent extremists.More than 400 hours of videos are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and company executives have long said that monitoring that fire hose of content is difficult. They contend that computers \u2014 learning from the example of humans \u2014 are the answer.YouTube said it has taken down 150,000 videos for violent extremism \u2014 in large part because of machines flagging more videos for human reviewers to take down.The video service said it planned to take a similar approach to tackling videos unsafe for children and content featuring hate speech.When it comes to advertising, YouTube said it would take a \u201cnew approach.\u201d It plans to consider which channels and videos are eligible for advertising, applying stricter criteria with more human curation and oversight.

Pretty much everyone in Silicon Valley says that that\u2019s bogus and that consumers will lose, while big corporations like Comcast will have free rein to jack up prices for different types of internet services. I fall in the latter camp.So, what say you here? I assume you\u2019re with me, though since you like to be contrarian on occasion perhaps you\u2019re going to go for the pro-Pai argument?Moving on, I wanted to get into a slightly wonky, somewhat overlooked section of the internet: Patreon and the uproar among its creative community.If you aren\u2019t familiar, Patreon is basically a payments platform used by artists and creative types, where they can charge or offer subscriptions to people for the types of things they produce. It ranges from writers and humorists to artists, journalists, crafty people, gamers \u2014 really whatever service you think people will pay to receive. It\u2019s been growing, and has an indie flair to an ancient practice.

This time it seemed to go too far in the direction of its investors; perhaps now that it\u2019s been burned, it\u2019ll keep a closer eye on its indie artists.Yes, this is an extended way of saying, \u201cLook how smart I am.\u201d But also, it\u2019s more: Do you think we\u2019re basically creating artificial, overinflated value in these alternative currencies that really has no long-term staying power?

{"Headline": "How Big Tech Is Going After Your Health Care", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Daniel Poston, a second-year medical student in Manhattan, opened the App Store on his iPhone a couple of weeks ago, he was astonished to see an app for a new heart study prominently featured.People often learn about new research studies through in-person conversations with their doctors. But not only did this study, run by Stanford University, use a smartphone to recruit consumers, it was financed by Apple. And it involved using an app on the Apple Watch to try to identify irregular heart rhythms.\u201cIt\u2019s not inconceivable, by the time I graduate from medical school,\u201d Mr. Poston said, \u201cthat the entire practice of medicine can be revolutionized by technology.\u201dThe companies are accelerating their efforts to remake health care by developing or collaborating on new tools for consumers, patients, doctors, insurers and medical researchers. And they are increasingly investing in health start-ups.In the first 11 months of this year, 10 of the largest tech companies in the United States were involved in health care equity deals worth $2.7 billion, up from just $277 million for all of 2012, according to data from CB Insights, a research firm that tracks venture capital and start-ups.Each tech company is taking its own approach, betting that its core business strengths could ultimately improve people\u2019s health \u2014 or at least make health care more efficient. Apple, for example, has focused on its consumer products, Microsoft on online storage and analytics services, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, on data.Physicians and researchers caution that it is too soon to tell whether novel continuous-monitoring tools, like apps for watches and smartphones, will help reduce disease and prolong lives \u2014 or just send more people to doctors for unnecessary tests.But now they, and other companies, are more visibly focused on creating, or investing in, new kinds of technologies for doctors, patients and consumers.\u201cWe are creating devices that collect information, new molecular assays \u2014 and all of that is just to try to understand health at a deeper level,\u201d said Dr. Jessica L. Mega, Verily\u2019s chief medical officer.Apple is taking a different approach \u2014 using its popular iPhone and Apple Watch to help consumers better track and manage their health.\u201cApple is trying to drag medicine from where it currently takes place \u2014 in hospitals and clinics \u2014 and move it to the consumer side, to your phone,\u201d said Malay Gandhi, an executive in residence at Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm.In 2015, Apple introduced new software, called Apple ResearchKit, for health researchers. Stanford used it to develop an app to enroll volunteers in a heart study and track their physical activities, sleeping hours and fitness.Dr. Lloyd B. Minor, dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, said the app enabled researchers to smoothly enroll more than 54,000 patients \u2014 a large number for a study conducted by one medical center \u2014 and collect much more data than they could have otherwise.\u201cFor us, it was an eye-opener,\u201d he said.Stanford is also conducting the Apple Heart Study. It is intended to determine whether an app for the Apple Watch can accurately detect irregular heart rhythms \u2014 particularly those associated with atrial fibrillation, a condition that can lead to blood clots and strokes.If the app detects irregular heart rhythms, it will send participants a notification and offer them a free video consultation with a doctor. The study is not designed to assess whether people who used the watch app had a reduced incidence of stroke and cardiac death compared with people who did not use the app.Microsoft, already a major supplier of software and cloud services to medical centers, is also ramping up its health business.This year, the company announced an initiative, Healthcare NeXT, to create products for medical providers and patients using artificial intelligence and cloud services like speech recognition.\u201cWe\u2019re really focusing on what people in the health care world are doing today and how we can make it better,\u201d said Peter Lee, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for artificial intelligence and research.Facebook, too, has been expanding its business and research efforts in the health sector.And this year, Oculus, the virtual reality gear maker owned by Facebook, teamed up with Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles to develop V.R. simulations for doctors and medical students to practice handling high-risk pediatric medical emergencies.Dr. Topol of Scripps said tech companies had an opportunity to remake longstanding, cumbersome systems \u2014 like hospital alarms at a patient\u2019s bedside that go off dozens of times every day \u2014 and re-envision how health care is delivered.\u201cThere\u2019s not one tech company that isn\u2019t involved one way or another,\u201d Dr. Topol said. \u201cMany of the companies see this as somewhere between rescue and a great business opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What are your favorite tech tools for doing your job?Quick disclaimer: I might be the wrong person to be doing this. I\u2019m the Frugal Traveler, which means it\u2019s literally my job to be cheap. That means I\u2019m not plunking down lots of money on the latest and greatest tech toy.I do, however, use a lot of different online tools to do my job. Travel writing involves regular travel, just a little quicker than normal, like hitting a fast-forward button. You can\u2019t linger at that gorgeous beach or perfect cafe, because you typically have limited time and a long list of places to visit.Therefore, I\u2019m reliant on maps a good deal of the time, as I\u2019m frequently in transit. Google Maps is essential for saving locations, jotting quick notes and navigating. It\u2019s also worth noting that it still has basic functionality even when in airplane mode \u2014 a useful feature when you\u2019re in a different country. I wish I could tell you there was some secret maps app nobody knows about that\u2019s way better than Google Maps. There isn\u2019t.My experience is that there isn\u2019t a ton of difference between the various online travel agencies as far as finding hotels and flights. It happens sometimes, but it\u2019s rare to look up a flight on Priceline and then find the price is wildly different on Expedia. For hotels, pick one site \u2014 one that allows you to collect points or status, ideally, and stick with it.In my travels, I often find that the aphorism \u201cless is more\u201d holds true as it relates to technology. I don\u2019t have a super nice camera; I use an old Canon 20D. I have a newish laptop that I enjoy using at home, but when I travel for an extended period of time, I bring an older MacBook from 2010.What could be better?One thing I\u2019d like is more accurate reporting on flight status and delays. That has more to do with the airlines than the tools, but I find that aspect of travel tools to be woefully inadequate.Planning a trip itinerary can be challenging, especially in a country you\u2019ve never visited. What\u2019s your process? No one source of information is perfect. Firsthand information is best \u2014 personal experience, or friends or family \u2014 but that\u2019s not always possible. The internet becomes the well you draw from pretty frequently, but there are risks to taking reviews written by strangers (or paid shills) as gospel.What that means, ironically, is that you end up having to spend even more time online \u2014 to get an aggregate sense of what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not. I\u2019ll use TripAdvisor, Twitter, Lonely Planet forums, FlyerTalk, Reddit \u2014 you name it, I\u2019ll read it. The trick then becomes discerning which intel is solid.What tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily nonwork life?What are the most important gadgets that everyone should pack when traveling?The last essential is \u2014 ready? A paper clip. I don\u2019t leave the country without one. If you have an iPhone, you\u2019ll need it to swap out SIM cards.

{"Headline": "Warrantless Surveillance Can Continue Even if Law Expires, Officials Say", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration has decided that the National Security Agency and the F.B.I. can lawfully keep operating their warrantless surveillance program even if Congress fails to extend the law authorizing it before an expiration date of New Year\u2019s Eve, according to American officials.But with Congress focused on passing a major tax cut and divided over what changes, if any, to make to the surveillance program, lawmakers may miss that deadline. Hedging against that risk, executive branch lawyers have now concluded that the government could lawfully continue to spy under the program through late April without new legislation.Intelligence officials nonetheless remain intent on getting lawmakers to pass a durable extension of Section 702 by the end of the month \u2014 warning that even a stopgap short-term extension of several months, as some lawmakers have proposed, would risk throwing the program into a crisis in the spring.\u201cWe fully expect Congress to reauthorize this critical statute by the end of the year,\u201d said Brian Hale, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \u201cNot doing so would be unthinkable in light of the considerable value Section 702 provides in protecting the nation.\u201dThe expiring law grew out of the Bush administration\u2019s once-secret Stellarwind warrantless surveillance program after the Sept. 11 attacks. After it came to light, Congress enacted the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to legalize a form of the program.Under Section 702, the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. may collect from domestic companies like AT&T and Google the phone calls, emails, texts and other electronic messages of foreigners abroad without a warrant \u2014 even when they talk with Americans. The program has expanded to a broad array of foreign intelligence purposes, not just counterterrorism.If Congress fails to reauthorize the law this month, Mr. Hale acknowledged that the government believes it can keep the program going for months. Its reasoning centers on a legal complexity in how the program works: Under the law, about once a year, the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court sets rules for the program and authorizes it to operate for 12 months.Given that conclusion, the government is making no plans to immediately turn off the program on New Year\u2019s Day, no matter what happens in Congress, according to a United States official familiar with the Section 702 program who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic.The disclosure has significant ramifications for the debate over the program.Congressional leaders have discussed including an extension of the program in other must-pass legislation, like a spending bill to keep the government from shutting down. But lawmakers will face less pressure to jam through such a move, short-circuiting a full and open debate over reform proposals, if the alternative is not an immediate termination of the collecting of intelligence authorized by the law.Little consensus exists in Congress about what, if any, changes to make to the law as part of extending it. Lawmakers have submitted legislation spanning the gamut from making the law permanent without changes to imposing significant new limits to safeguard the privacy rights of Americans whose communications get swept up in the program, as well as a range of intermediary proposals.One key disagreement centers on what limits, if any, to impose on how government officials may search for, gain access to or use in court information about Americans that gets swept into the warrantless surveillance program. Some lawmakers want to impose a broad provision forcing officials to get a warrant before they may query the repository about an American. Some want a more limited requirement that officials get a court\u2019s permission to gain access to the results of such a query if it is for a criminal investigation but not a national security one. Some want to impose no new constraints.In an interview, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, declined to comment on the government\u2019s theory, but said he was open to making it possible to have a full and open debate over the proposed changes to the surveillance law early next year if time runs out this month.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before: wait until the last minute, and then say, \u2018crowded congressional calendar, dangerous world, we\u2019ve just got to go along with it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cAnything now that creates an opportunity for several months of real debate, I\u2019ll listen to.\"Either way, the United States official said the executive branch and the courts would still need a durable new version of the law well before the late-April deadline. The problem, the official said, is that it will take a significant amount of time to develop new procedures based on the new law, submit them to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, make changes the court wants and then work with communications companies to implement the new certifications.Mr. Hale declined to comment on those specifics, but said that a gap in the surveillance program\u2019s legal authorization would generate uncertainty.\u201cSo while the orders would be in effect for a short time after the end of the year, the fact is that we would need to be planning for the end of the program,\u201d Mr. Hale said, \u201cand that cannot be done in a matter of days \u2014 to effect that takes some time, and is not like turning on or off a light switch.\u201dPlanning to turn off the Section 702 program, the other official said, would include steps to mitigate that change as much as possible, including by systematically going through the list of more than 100,000 foreigners abroad who are being targeted under the program and triaging which are the most critical, then developing lengthy packages of information to submit to the surveillance court to seek individualized orders to wiretap them.But because of the resources such an effort would require and the higher legal standard the government would need to be able to meet, surveillance would ultimately cease on most of the Section 702 targets, the official added.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ohio, a Tax Bill With Uncertain Payoffs Is Met With Ambivalence", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCANTON, Ohio \u2014 The tax bill convulsing a bitterly divided Congress may seem like the ultimate high stakes political showdown in Washington. But on a rainy afternoon in a county that voted for Donald J. Trump, it feels like distant noise, an opaque battle in a faraway land whose meaning for everyday life is unknown.\u201cI heard a few things on the news, but you have trouble understanding it all,\u201d said Pat Turk, an instructor at the National Beauty College on Cleveland Avenue. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will change things that much for us,\u201d she said. \u201cTaxes go up. That\u2019s what they do.\u201dFor Republicans in Washington the bill is an outsize and perhaps ungainly political bet. They are casting its passage as a matter of electoral survival \u2014 a last chance to show that the party can get something big done in President Trump\u2019s first year while it still has full control. Democrats see it as a clarifying moment when middle-class Trump voters might resent that their support for an anti-establishment billionaire has yielded budget-busting tax cuts for the rich.But in two days of interviews here in Stark County, a small patch of middle-class towns about an hour\u2019s drive south of Cleveland, there was little evidence that anybody even noticed it was happening. Few expected a tax cut to be significant enough to matter very much. Most said that other issues, like jobs that paid living wages, were more important.\u201cWe are focusing too much on this tax thing, frankly,\u201d said Gerry Noble, an electrician who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cThere are other things he could do that would be a whole lot better.\u201dStill, with midterm elections looming that will decide control of Congress, and both parties certain to try to define public opinion on the law, it is possible to get a sense of the debate to come in the barely formed reactions to the bill here. And the only thing clear is that, for now, voters are gripped by ambivalence and confusion that could yield unpredictable political results.\u201cRight now it\u2019s tough for a citizen to get his arms around it with so much noise and vitriol,\u201d said Daryl Revoldt, a North Canton City councilman. \u201cWhen the dust settles it\u2019s going to come down to two things: What does my 1040 look like and do I see economic improvement in my area?\u201dStark County voted twice for Barack Obama, and some Democrats are eager to compete here by sounding populist themes. Many feel the law will be an albatross for Republicans.Geoff Garin, a Democratic consultant advising groups on the tax debate, said his polling had found voters approximately twice as likely to say the Republican proposals favored the wealthy as to say they favored the middle class. Mr. Garin said he had detected no significant enthusiasm for slashing corporate tax rates.\u201cVoters believe that the wealthy are the primary beneficiaries of the bill, and very few voters expect that they, personally, will get much out of it,\u201d Mr. Garin said. \u201cThe large majority of Americans don\u2019t think that either the wealthy or big corporations pay their fair share in taxes, and the majority want both groups to pay more, not less.\u201dBut voters here appeared hesitant to condemn the measure mainly because it helps the rich. Cutting the corporate tax rate might help bring jobs, they said. And many middle-class conservative voters are not as angry at income inequality as Democrats want them to be.\u201cThe rich pay a hell of a lot of taxes in the country,\u201d said Mac McLaughlin, 71, a retiree. \u201cThey are bad-mouthed, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201dBut views were complicated. Many modest-income Republican voters said the use of loopholes by the rich violated a basic sense of fairness \u2014 almost as if they were stealing from the system.\u201cLower taxes for the rich, is that what they\u2019re talking about?\u201d asked Al Brancifort, a machine tool retailer who voted for Mr. Trump, as he sipped coffee with friends at a Panera Bread. He still liked Mr. Trump, and did not know enough about the tax bill to say whether he liked it. But he was angry about loopholes used by the rich.\u201cI think everyone thinks taxes should be fairer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rich should pay their fair share.\u201dBut that sentiment did not necessarily translate into thinking the rich should pay higher rates.\u201cI don\u2019t think someone who makes more money should have to pay more in taxes,\u201d said Samantha Reo, 18, a trainee at the National Beauty College. \u201cMy meal shouldn\u2019t cost more just because I make more. That\u2019s not fair.\u201dThe greater sense of anxiety and anger about the tax overhaul among Republican voters appears to stem not from concerns about economic inequality, but rather about losing specific tax deductions. And Democrats say there may be room for them to exploit the issue in educated suburban areas, where more voters rely on write-offs for local taxes, mortgage interest and tuition benefits.Mr. McLaughlin, a registered Republican, was worried about the college loan deductions for his grandson. He said he regretted voting for Mr. Trump, but not because of the tax bill. He doesn\u2019t like his style, which he called abrasive, something that bothered him from the very beginning.\u201cI thought he\u2019d get in there and get good people around him, but everybody around him seems to get fired,\u201d he said.For wavering independent voters, many of them high earners with college degrees, the bill would repeal a number of cherished tax deductions, imperiling Republican lawmakers in upscale suburban districts. If the bill would grant a degree of tax relief to many voters in places like Stark County in the short term, it does not include an eye-catching, imaginative component to persuade lower- and middle-income people that it would change their lives for the better.Mr. Noble, the electrician, said he did not expect the tax bill to help his family. But more important than a modest tax cut, he said, was for the government to be helping to create living wage jobs and training programs and thinking about how profound changes in the economy, like automation, would affect working-class people.\u201cI have no jealousy for the wealthy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right for me to be jealous of what they\u2019ve got. What is right is to try to give everyone an even shake.\u201dHenry Olsen, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, described the bill as a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d for Republicans to show working-class voters that the party would champion their interests. He predicted Democrats would have an easier time demonizing the tax bill in 2018 than Republicans would have using it to stir voters.\u201cSome of them are going to see tax increases when they thought they were voting for tax cuts, and the ones who are going to see tax cuts are generally not going to see large ones,\u201d Mr. Olsen said of Republican-leaning voters. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me to see who\u2019s going to be excited about it when they go to the polling booth.\u201dThat was the case for Tyler Sheets, a 24-year-old electrician in Carrollton. Every year he trudges off to H & R Block to file his taxes. It is about as fun as a trip to the dentist. But he takes it as a given \u2014 unpleasant but unchangeable. It has little to do with why he voted for Mr. Trump, or whether he will in the future.\u201cNothing has really happened to make me think, man I need my taxes reformed,\u201d he said, during a break in his electrical code class on Thursday night.There was another obstacle. He said he no longer trusted most news media sources and had given up trying to follow the debate, which seemed to come with more outrage and vitriol than he could bear. He spends time on Google before an important decision like a vote, but had pretty much tuned out day-to-day politics.\u201cUntil you came in here,\u201d he said about the bill, \u201cI never heard anybody bringing it up.\u201dMike Cammel, 48, the owner of Camellone, a pizzeria in Canton, said that between his restaurant and four children, he has had no time to look into the bill. But it seemed to arouse a vague weariness in him, a sense that Washington was a distant world that would never really change things in favor of the little guy.\u201cIt needs to change, but whether these are the right changes, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said of the tax code. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to affect us that much. It\u2019s going to be status quo.\u201dThe bill, which could add $1 trillion to the deficit, presents numerous risks for Republicans. But Representative Jim Renacci, a Republican who represents Stark County and voted for a version of the tax bill in the House, said he expects voters will support it.\u201cMost people back home want a tax cut and want a tax break and think Washington\u2019s taking too much of their money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just concerned they\u2019re not going to get one.\u201dMs. Turk, at the beauty college, had a different view. Her daughter lives in Canada, where taxes are much higher, and she has come to appreciate the relatively lower rates in the United States. She voted for Mr. Trump, and she likes how he has been doing. But she doesn\u2019t hate taxes. She likes the services that they pay for, like schools and roads.\u201cSome people just want to fight it,\u201d she said, standing by a trainee who was learning how to do a permanent. \u201cThey say \u2018we pay too much in taxes!\u2019 That\u2019s not me. I guess I\u2019d have to say probably it\u2019s the least thing I\u2019m worried about.\u201dSabrina Tavernise reported from Canton and Alexander Burns from New York.

The telegraph allowed people to communicate globally, changing the way business was conducted and even making transnational romance a possibility. Many hoped the accelerated communication would inspire greater international harmony. Standage cites a toast by the British ambassador in 1858 to \u201cthe telegraph wire, the nerve of international life, transmitting knowledge of events, removing causes of misunderstanding and promoting peace and harmony throughout the world.\u201d The reality was less idyllic; people found ways to use the new form of communication to nefarious ends (like delaying messages or hacking private communication) and divisions were still perpetuated. But the telegraph\u2019s cultural impact is undeniable, and Standage discusses its enduring influence in this book.This brief primer presents the opposing view; Hazlett argues that government regulation stalls and suppresses innovation and that competing networks should be allowed to hash out the rules of managing web traffic among themselves.

{"Headline": "What the Tax Bill Fails to Address: Technology\u2019s Tsunami", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtLet\u2019s pretend you have just been picked to run a small island nation. Congratulations!But don\u2019t settle in to your throne quite yet. A potential catastrophe looms on the horizon. A huge tsunami is coming your way.Fortunately, there\u2019s hope. Yours is a wealthy island. You can\u2019t prevent the tsunami, but you can prepare your people for the onslaught, and perhaps even mitigate its worst effects. So you make an executive decision \u2014 the island will use a huge share of future income to equip each resident with the best-known defense against tsunamis: Every islander gets a parachute.Wait, how would that work?The above situation exactly describes the puzzlement among some people in Silicon Valley at the $1.5 trillion Republican tax bill that was approved by the House and Senate this week.To those who study how tech is altering society and the economy, the bill looks like the wrong fix for the wrong problem. The bill (the parachute) does little to address the tech-abetted wave of economic displacement (the tsunami) that may be looming just off the horizon. And it also seems to intensify some of the structural problems in the tech business, including its increasing domination by five giants \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 which own some of the world\u2019s most important economic platforms.But Gabriel Zucman, who studies taxes and inequality at the University of California, Berkeley, pointed out that the 10.5 percent rate would still be much lower than the rate paid by potential start-up rivals that mostly make their money in the United States (the corporate tax rate on domestic earnings in the new bill is 21 percent). This difference, Mr. Zucman said, \u201ccreates an uneven playing field, where big monopolies will pay lower taxes than new entrants, which could reduce innovation.\u201dApple, Google and Microsoft declined to discuss the effects of the bill.But some in Silicon Valley think the giants misplayed their hand in the legislation. In pursuing short-term tax advantages, they missed a chance to advocate policies that might have more broadly benefited many of their customers \u2014 and improved their images, too.\u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s failure to engage in the tax reform debate was a serious failing of long-term strategy,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a writer and researcher who studies economic and social issues related to the tech business. \u201cThey had a real opportunity to use tax reform as a way to address inequality \u2014 and as a result of this bill, inequality may increase, and public backlash against the tech industry may increase.\u201dThis gets back to that looming tsunami. Though many of the economy\u2019s structural problems predate the last decade\u2019s rise of the tech behemoths, the innovations that Silicon Valley has been working on \u2014 things like e-commerce, cloud storage, artificial intelligence and the general digitization of everything and everyone around you \u2014 are some of the central protagonists in the economic story of our age.Among other economic concerns, these innovations are implicated in the rise of inequality; the expanding premium on education and skills; the decimation and dislocation of retail jobs; the rising urban-rural divide, and spiking housing costs in cities; and the rise of the \u201cgig\u201d economy of contract workers who drive Ubers and rent out their spare bedrooms on Airbnb.In the long run, there\u2019s also the question of whether there will be enough work for everyone \u2014 or whether, as some have speculated, automation may replace large numbers of workers altogether.It\u2019s true that many of the policy ideas to address the economic effects brought about by tech would be expensive. Mr. Khanna\u2019s plan, for instance, is projected to cost $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion over a decade.In other words, it would cost as much as much as the Republican tax bill. But unlike that one, this plan might actually address the tsunami.An earlier version of this article misstated that Apple, Google and Microsoft had expanded their lobbying efforts to push for tax reform. The companies increased spending on their overall lobbying work, not only on tax issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Hotel Concierges Endangered by Apps? Don\u2019t Bet on It", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an age when so many travel tasks can be done with an app, is the hotel concierge \u2014 that font of local wisdom with the connections to land a hot last-minute reservation \u2014 about to be superseded?Not according to Joanna Husk, who has been a concierge at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for almost 28 years and is a member of Les Clefs d\u2019Or USA, the American chapter of the global trade association for hotel concierges.\u201cThere is no app that can get to know you quite like the human app,\u201d she said.Ms. Husk does use GoConcierge \u2014 software that helps hotel concierges manage their work, handling tasks like sending confirmation letters and itineraries to guests, and maintaining a record of all activities they have booked for guests. But it is a supplement to her work, not a replacement.She said, for instance, that she was recently asked by an East Coast executive to plan a day\u2019s visit in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley for nine people from China who were setting up a business on the West Coast. She had to arrange a luncheon and tour of the wine country for them after a morning meeting. With her knowledge of the wine country and Bay Area traffic patterns, she suggested that the group visit a vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains instead. The vineyard was a 20-minute drive from Silicon Valley and close enough to San Francisco for everyone to return by 7 p.m., change and relax before dinner.A Google search would not have been sufficient, she said. Nor can the internet always be a trustworthy source of information, because, as James Little, chef concierge of the Peninsula Beverly Hills, said, \u201cit contains a lot of information that\u2019s not verified and is from people who are not experts.\u201dThe services offered by a hotel concierge may seem a luxury. But that\u2019s the point. If they do their job well, concierges can help strengthen their hotels\u2019 bottom line, since skilled ones can \u201coften inspire the guest to come back to a hotel,\u201d said Noah Lemaich, director of brand standards for Sixty Hotels and former head concierge for Thompson Hotels.The question is whether web-based concierges offer the same advantages.Fran\u00e7ois Delahaye, general manager of the Paris hotel Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e and chief operating officer of the Dorchester Collection of luxury hotels, sang the praises of human concierges in a recent interview. \u201cIf the concierge can get tables at Le Jules Verne, L\u2019Ami Louis and other restaurants in Paris, it\u2019s not because of the tools they use, but because of the amount of business they bring, having contacts for a long time with the restaurant\u2019s headwaiter, ma\u00eetre d\u2019 and manager.\u201dStay Delightful offers what it calls a \u201cmessaging-based guest service solution\u201d that allows hotel employees to communicate and collaborate across departments and interact with guests, via text.The Ivy platform, from the travel technology company Go Moment, uses artificial intelligence to answer guests\u2019 questions, also by text. Ivy, for example, can send guests a hotel\u2019s Wi-Fi password, order drinks or towels to be sent to their room or help them check out electronically. It is used by hotels providing different levels of service, including those that do not have human concierges.Stay Delightful and Ivy also can notify guests of their ability to check in early or check out late, which they may have to pay an additional fee for, thus generating revenue for their hotel.In September, Cambria, an upscale Choice Hotels brand, began a pilot program at its two Chicago hotels that allows guests to contact local food and lifestyle bloggers via Twitter and Instagram for suggestions. Should the pilot go well, Choice will make the program available next year to guests at all Cambria hotels. Cambria hotels do not provide in-house concierge services.And a small niche player, What Should We Do?, offers suggestions for a wide range of activities in New York City, on a website and app, and charges travelers fees for some of its services.Hotel executives, concierges and executives of concierge tool companies all agreed the rise of texting and of social media and apps like Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and WeChat have greatly increased demands on concierges.Rainy Chan, who until recently was the general manager of the Peninsula Hong Kong, said the workload of the seven concierges employed there has tripled from 2007 to 2017. \u201cAlthough technology helps them find information a lot faster, it also changes the expectations of guests. They expect a faster response. And the concierges get very last-minute requests for recommendations.\u201d\u201cTen or 15 years ago, they only serviced guests in the hotel,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, because of technology, they get a lot of emails from people who are not staying, but who are coming soon and have questions about Hong Kong.\u201dMs. Chan said the concierges at her hotel take turns focusing exclusively on replying to email messages. Mr. Delahaye said the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e\u2019s 18-person concierge staff has a dedicated secretary to respond to guests\u2019 messages and help plan their itineraries. Both hotels use GoConcierge.Robert Marks is chef concierge at the Omni Hotel San Diego, which is connected to Petco Park, the Padres\u2019 baseball stadium, and president of Les Clefs d\u2019Or USA. Mr. Marks said he contacts certain guests, including members of Omni\u2019s frequent stay program and individuals chosen at random, a week before their arrival to see if they have any special needs. He also lets them know about arts and sports events, in case they want tickets. He and his staff also call guests, like those celebrating a birthday or anniversary or frequent visitors, upon their arrival and every night of their stay. His hotel is also a GoConcierge customer.Holly Stiel, a veteran San Francisco concierge who now teaches companies in and out of the travel field how to provide concierge services, said she believed that human concierges were here to stay. \u201cAs long as people place value and are willing to pay for personalization\u201d and other attentions, there will be a demand, she said. Mediocrity, she added, \u201cwill certainly be replaced by technology, but the true concierge artist can never be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Net Neutrality\u2019s Holes in Europe May Offer Peek at Future in U.S.", "Date": "2017-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast spring, Swedes got a tantalizing offer: If they subscribed to Sweden\u2019s biggest telecom provider, Telia Company AB, they could have unlimited access on their mobile phones to Facebook, Spotify, Instagram and other blockbuster apps.The issue is now working its way through the courts. As it does, the offer is still available.Such deals may be gaining momentum in the United States.The Federal Communications Commission is expected to vote on Thursday to roll back the net neutrality rules in the United States. While the European Union has such rules in place, telecom providers have pushed the boundaries at times in Sweden, Germany, Portugal and elsewhere, offering a glimpse at the future American companies and consumers may face if protections are watered down.For the European Union\u2019s sprawling market of over 500 million citizens, the rules have mostly helped prevent bad behavior.That\u2019s largely because unlike in the United States, Europeans have plenty of choices for internet access at home and on their mobile phones. France has four major mobile and internet operators and nine low-cost offshoots. Britain has more than 50. And there aren\u2019t dominant giants born of megamergers, like the ones between Comcast and NBC Universal, and Verizon and AOL.Even so, telecom operators in Europe have tried to take advantage of some of the gray areas in the rules.That doesn\u2019t necessarily bother consumers.\u201cFrom a user perspective, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem and I think most consumers don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue,\u201d said Magnus Haglunds, a Stockholm-based independent music producer who uses the Telia service. \u201cThere are those who may have to change from Apple Music to Spotify. But then they get free surfing on Spotify.\u201dWasn\u2019t net neutrality being compromised? \u201cIt\u2019s not Cuba,\u201d Mr. Haglunds replied. \u201cCuba has a problem,\u201d he said, citing the country\u2019s severe restrictions on the internet.A Swedish court ultimately overturned the decision on technical grounds after Telia appealed. Telia continues to offer the service in Sweden and other Nordic countries. But Sweden\u2019s administrative court is expected to issue a broader decision on zero rating rules this year.Critics of the rollback in the United States have cited zero ratings schemes in Europe, or versions of it, as an omen of how the web may be split.\u201cProviders are starting to split the net into packages,\u201d Mr. Khanna wrote.In Germany, a similar case involved a Deutsche Telekom offer called StreamOn, which allows users to access unlimited videos and music from specific partners like Netflix. The country\u2019s telecom regulator approved the deal, drawing criticism from consumer activists. StreamOn sought to address some of the concerns by expanding the offer to include around 50 partners.\u201cThis a battle for the next century,\u201d said Klaus M\u00fcller, the chairman of the Federation of German Consumer Organisations, a lobbying group. \u201cWe can either have oligarchical markets with huge players, or a big variety of companies with lots of competition, which would be good for consumers but bad for big business.\u201dHalf of the 2 billion searches done annually through Startpage are in the United States. If American I.S.P.s start charging companies to be in the internet\u2019s fast lane, Mr. Beens said he would not be able to keep up with deep-pocketed competitors like Google, Bing and Yahoo.\u201cPeople want privacy, but what if we can\u2019t pay the amounts of money that I.S.P.s are looking for?\u201d he said. \u201cIn the U.S., people would have a slower connection to our search engine. It could really harm our business model.\u201dPerhaps the biggest issue for Europe \u2014 and other parts of the world \u2014 is that countries watch what the United States does.\u201cThe U.S. set good standards for the globe, but now they could go backward,\u201d said Maryant Fern\u00e1ndez P\u00e9rez, a senior policy adviser at European Digital Rights, an association of civil and human rights organizations advocating an open digital environment.\u201cThe consequences are not very good internationally.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included a quotation that misstated the availability of the internet access in Cuba.

{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Protests Move Online, Yet Big Tech Is Quiet", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReddit, Etsy and Kickstarter were among the sites warning that the proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to roll back so-called net neutrality rules would fundamentally change the way the internet is experienced. Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site, cleared its entire home screen for a sparse white screen reading \u201cDefend Net Neutrality\u201d in large letters. Reddit, the popular online message board, pushed in multiple ways on its site for keeping the rules, including a pop-up box on its home screen.But the online protests also highlighted how the biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, have taken a back seat in the debate about protecting net neutrality, rules that prohibit internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing sites or for charging people or companies for faster speeds of particular sites. For the most part, the large tech companies did not engage in the protest on Tuesday. In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules.\u201cFirst, the major tech companies are very aware that Washington has turned hostile,\u201d Mr. Feld said. \u201cIn this environment, the big tech companies try to keep a low profile and play defense rather than take positions that draw attention.\u201cSo with the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations,\u201d he said.There also does not appear to be much chance of their winning the debate right now. The three Republican members of the F.C.C., who make up a majority of commissioners at the agency, have committed to roll back the landmark broadband rules created during the Obama administration.But consumers and the start-ups that participated in protests on Tuesday say they are gearing up for a long fight. They expect lawsuits to challenge the change, and plan to push Congress to pass a law ensuring an open internet.Here is how several of the biggest companies have handled the issue in recent months.It\u2019s a restrained approach compared with Google\u2019s aggressive lobbying campaign in 2006 when Sergey Brin, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, went to Capitol Hill to argue for the importance of net neutrality. In 2010, Google teamed up with Verizon to lay out a vision for how net neutrality could work, advocating against allowing internet service providers to provide fast lanes to people who pay more. However, the proposal was criticized by advocates of an open internet because it excluded wireless connectivity and new services from broadband providers.Apple is a newcomer to the net neutrality debate. It made its first filing to the F.C.C. on the issue in August. It espoused a position largely in line with other internet giants, arguing against the creation of fast lanes and emphasizing the importance of an open internet.Apple\u2019s public opposition to the proposed changes also reflects the growing network of services on offer from the company including Apple Music, a streaming music service that also offers video content, and potentially an internet video service to rival Netflix.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that all internet service providers should treat all data on the internet equally.\u201cEqual treatment is critical to innovation in a digital economy and to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the F.C.C. doesn\u2019t provide this basic protection, we urge Congress to intervene.\u201dDuring the last day of online protest in support of the rules this past summer, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s leaders, posted defiant statements to their personal Facebook pages.But the executives have been pretty quiet on the issue in recent months. The company\u2019s focus in Washington has been more concentrated on fallout from its handling of Russian-linked propaganda used during the 2016 presidential election.This week, Facebook offered a statement from Erin Egan, a policy spokeswoman, about the F.C.C. plans:\u201cFacebook has always supported the kind of strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Ms. Egan said. \u201cWe are disappointed by the F.C.C.\u2019s decision to remove these protections, and we stand ready to work with policymakers on a framework that will protect a free and open internet.\u201dAmazon representatives have been lobbying F.C.C. commissioners and staff in person, with visits on Nov. 29 and last Wednesday. The latter included a meeting between Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, and Darren Achord, an Amazon senior public policy manager.\u201cDuring the meetings, we stated that Amazon has long supported net neutrality protections to ensure our customers can enjoy an open internet, and we emphasized that the company remains committed to that position,\u201d Gerard Waldron, a lawyer who represents Amazon and participated in the meeting, wrote in an account filed with the F.C.C.\u201cWe stressed the need for enforceable, bright-line rules to protect the open internet and guard against anti-consumer and anti-competitive activities,\u201d he wrote, adding that Amazon opposed the commission\u2019s proposed change.Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Netflix, said this week that the company did not have anything to add to its earlier statements opposing the F.C.C.\u2019s actions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Russian \u2018Trolls,\u2019 Instagram\u2019s Pictures Can Spread Wider Than Words", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The enduring popularity of a provocative post on Instagram, created by a company with connections to the Kremlin, demonstrates why fighting propaganda on social media will be an uphill battle.The photograph in the post, of a smiling woman wearing a black hijab, seems innocent. But the text around it was crafted to push buttons.

What those people probably did not know was that it was created by the Internet Research Agency, or I.R.A., a so-called Russian troll farm that employed hundreds to influence discussions online by stirring debate in comment sections below online stories and creating provocative posts on social media.The account where the post first appeared was banned by Instagram this year, but other accounts continue to spread the image.A Facebook spokesman said the company takes disinformation seriously and was continuing its efforts to \u201cstop foreign interference.\u201d\u201cAs part of our investigation, we found and removed around 170 I.R.A. accounts on Instagram that were responsible for approximately 120,000 posts,\u201d the spokesman, Tom Reynolds, said.He added, \u201cOur review of this activity is ongoing, and we continue to monitor for and remove fake accounts.\u201dMr. Albright\u2019s research documented how the photo-friendly service was widely used by Russian trolls, and how it continues to be a hub for those images to be shared and shared again. He analyzed 28 of the 170 accounts that Instagram removed from its platform after discovering that they had been created by the I.R.A., which is based in St. Petersburg, Russia.Using publicly available information on sites that archive social media posts, Mr. Albright found 2.5 million recorded interactions with posts from the accounts, as well as 145 million likely interactions with people who had passively viewed them.Mr. Albright said that those figures were not the complete picture \u2014 he was not able to account for how many people had shared images on Instagram by taking screen grabs or through a variety of third-party apps that allow for reposting of images.This month, it was shared to a popular Instagram account called Republican.s, which says it represents \u201cthe Republicans and Conservatives of Instagram.\u201d It has more than 100,000 followers.An administrator of Republican.s declined to answer why the account had shared the image, or if the person running the account was aware of the image\u2019s Russian origin. When reached on Instagram, which allows users to send a message to any account they follow, the administrator said he or she had only recently taken over the account.The person responding to messages refused to answer any other questions about who he or she is or who previously controlled the account and managed its posts. No information was provided on the Instagram account other than a brief description.Mr. Albright said it was not unusual for accounts to share images without checking their source.\u201cInstagram has all the social aspects of Facebook, but it is more powerful for visual messaging than Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about sharing images from many different sources with a community. It\u2019s more focused on the conversations sparked by those images, on the controversy around them.\u201dNir Eyal, author of \u201cHooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products,\u201d said Instagram was expressly designed to make images quick and easy to share.\u201cInstagram is a much more intimate place than Facebook and Twitter,\u201d Mr. Eyal said. \u201cPeople on Instagram have a more targeted list of people they follow. It\u2019s a tight network of people who share images with each other.\u201dWithin Instagram, users often share one another\u2019s posts, a process known as \u201cregramming,\u201d or copy and post images they have spotted from other social media platforms. That makes it difficult to entirely eliminate an image from the site.The images created by the Russian accounts were designed to draw both interest and anger on divisive issues. In one image, a father and son hold guns, and the text asks whether all fathers wouldn\u2019t choose to protect their families, given the chance. In another, a young child, presumably a Syrian refugee, holds a jagged knife. The text around his head suggests that Americans are being killed for \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201dIn comments below the images, thousands weighed in on whether the United States should allow refugees from Syria to enter the United States. Mr. Albright said it was a typical example of how Instagram had become more than just a site for sharing images \u2014 and had become a hub for debate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: The Tax Bill\u2019s \u2018Spiraling Consequences\u2019", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.As Republicans in Washington work to combine their tax bills into one, economists and tax specialists on the West Coast are adding up the ways that the changes could hurt California.Among the most publicized is the capping of the mortgage interest deduction, which could make buying a home in California even less affordable than it is now. The abolishing of deductions for state and local taxes, which could sharply raise Californians\u2019 tax bill, is another.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Gonzalo Freixes, a tax expert at the U.C.L.A. Anderson School of Management. \u201cIt could have spiraling consequences \u2014 the economy, the real estate market, revenues to local governments \u2014 it goes further and further into things where it could have a negative impact.\u201dBut the sweeping tax bill extends well beyond headline changes.The House bill called for the elimination of the tax credit for electric vehicles, a potentially big blow for Tesla, which has large manufacturing facilities in California.Under the Senate bill, single filers earning $160,000 to around $200,000, of whom there are many in coastal California, would see their top marginal tax rate increase to 32 percent from 28 percent.Research universities like Stanford, Berkeley, U.C.L.A. and Caltech would likely be hit by the repeal of deductions for graduate students and a new tax on endowment income. Executives wanting to pursue a midcareer M.B.A. might reconsider; the House bill removes deductions for professional education courses.\u201cThese things have big consequences,\u201d said Ken Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business.\u201cIt makes the decision of staying in California much more difficult,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cIt\u2019s already difficult, it\u2019s already expensive. This adds one more negative.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to use that money to invest more in the U.S. than they already have,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Some readers wrote of how they were worried about rising rents and home prices from the lack of available housing in their neighborhoods. Others expressed concern over the loss of community they were witnessing as a result of rapid development.Here are a few of their responses.My generation, the millennials, have fought hard to eke out a life in our urban landscape. Until we allow for apartment buildings in single-family home-exclusive districts, gentrification will continue to ravage our neighborhoods, our friends, our support networks.\u2014 Victoria Fierce in OaklandThese higher-density homes and apartments have not decreased the value of the single-family homes. It\u2019s time to realize that being a renter is not a crime and a neighborhood can support many types of housing.\u2014 Voter in the 49th in CaliforniaI live around the corner from this house. People who have been here forever and can never afford to move are seeing an almost immediate turnover of their community. It\u2019s scary for them. When Kurt talked about his vegetables he wasn\u2019t being so literal; he was describing the loss of an old and interdependent network of supportive and caring folks: a neighborhood.\u2014 Daniel Rosenthal in BerkeleyThis agenda does not promote affordable housing, it promotes developer profits. The developer in this article was not content with building a $1.4 million home in Berkeley. No, they wanted to build three $1 million dollar homes on one lot, doubling their revenue, while diminishing quality of life for the neighbors.\u2014 Heather in San FranciscoTraffic is already impossible in the Bay Area.

His decision to step down ended a standstill arrangement between the company and the Icahn Group.\u201cThe CEO is the most important person in the company. We believe Xerox still has potential, but it will go the way of Kodak if there aren\u2019t major changes. The times have changed but not the old guard that controls the board,\u201d Mr. Icahn said.\u201cCorporate actions taken by Xerox, though commendable, are no match for the ravages of the digital world. Selling the company may be the logical next move.\u201dIn 2016, Shazam had about $54 million in revenue and $4.9 million in net losses, according to public filings in Britain, where the company is based. That performance was an improvement over 2015, when the company reported $47 million in revenue and $22 million in losses.Apple likely wants Siri to do what both Amazon and Google are working on: help the user figure out the world around them, and also sell them content. Siri should be able to extract valuable information for the user from what it hears and what it sees. It could also then let you add that song to your Apple Music playlist, watch the trailer, or even buy the movie on iTunes, and so on.

Its statement:\u201cElliott\u2019s value assertion for NXP is unsupportable and is clearly nothing more than an attempt to advance its own self-serving agenda.

{"Headline": "Inside China\u2019s Big Tech Conference, New Ways to Track Citizens", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWUZHEN, China \u2014 An artificial intelligence company touted a robot that could help doctors with diagnoses. A start-up displayed a drone designed to carry a single passenger 60 miles per hour.And in a demonstration worthy of both wonder and worry, a Chinese facial recognition company showed how its technology could quickly identify and describe people.If there were any doubts about China\u2019s technological prowess, the presentations made this week at the country\u2019s largest tech conference should put them to rest. The event, once a setting for local tech executives and leaders of impoverished states, this year attracted top American executives like Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google, as well as executives of Chinese giants like Jack Ma of Alibaba and Pony Ma of Tencent.The tracking was apparent both in the design of the event, which ended on Tuesday, and in the technology on display. Tight security checkpoints made use of facial recognition. Chinese armed police patrolled. And in the dark corners of the whitewashed walls of the convention hall, the red lights of closed-circuit cameras glowed.A fast-growing facial recognition company, Face++, turned its technology on conferencegoers. On a large screen in its booth, the software identified their gender, described their hair length and color and characterized the clothes they wore.Other Chinese companies showed what could be done with such data. A state-run telecom company, China Unicom, featured a display with graphics breaking down the huge amounts of data the company has on its subscribers.One map broke down the population of Beijing based on the changing layout of the city\u2019s population as people commuted to and from work. Another showed where foreign visitors roamed on its network.The people overseeing China Unicom\u2019s booth openly discussed the data, a sign of how widely accepted such surveillance and data collection have become in China.At Unicom\u2019s two other state-run rivals, a similar penchant for measurements and surveillance was also on display. China Mobile floated a camera on the prow of one of the many boats that drift through Wuzhen\u2019s canals, sending the images over its latest and faster cellular technology. China Telecom showed off its ability to measure the amount of trash in several garbage cans and detect malfunctioning fire hydrants.Investors and analysts say China\u2019s unabashed fervor for collecting such data, combined with its huge population, could eventually give its artificial intelligence companies an edge over American ones. If Silicon Valley is marked by a libertarian streak, China\u2019s vision offers something of an antithesis, one where tech is meant to reinforce and be guided by the steady hand of the state.Such developments underscore a nascent back-and-forth between China and the United States that will determine much about technology\u2019s future development and application.Speaking at a panel on terrorism, Mei Jianming, described as a chief expert on antiterrorism for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an intergovernmental group that includes China and Russia among other countries, labeled groups that speak out for the human rights of China\u2019s Islamic minority Uighurs as terrorists. He then said Beijing should do more to use its influence to push Twitter to change its terms of service and push back against such groups.\u201cWe should strengthen the capability of our propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the Chinese official side, our China Daily and Xinhua News have their own Twitter presence, but the effectiveness of their propaganda is not enough. It\u2019s clearly not enough.\u201dThe contradictions of using sites like Twitter to change opinions abroad, while blocking them domestically, were often evident but almost as often unremarked upon.One of the most clear discussions of censorship came not from a speaker at the conference, but from an official watching the conference\u2019s entry gate on the first day. A representative of the Wenzhou city government, he queried journalists about how they got around China\u2019s internet filters. It was not clear whether he was genuinely curious, or wanted to find out which tools were most effective so they could be later targeted.Follow Paul Mozur on Twitter: @paulmozurCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Wuzhen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Job Ads Raise Concerns About Age Discrimination", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was written through collaboration between The New York Times and ProPublica, the independent, nonprofit investigative journalism organization.A few weeks ago, Verizon placed an ad on Facebook to recruit applicants for a unit focused on financial planning and analysis. The ad showed a smiling, millennial-aged woman seated at a computer and promised that new hires could look forward to a rewarding career in which they would be \u201cmore than just a number.\u201dSome relevant numbers were not immediately evident. The promotion was set to run on the Facebook feeds of users 25 to 36 years old who lived in the nation\u2019s capital, or had recently visited there, and had demonstrated an interest in finance. For a vast majority of the hundreds of millions of people who check Facebook every day, the ad did not exist.Verizon is among dozens of the nation\u2019s leading employers \u2014 including Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Target and Facebook itself \u2014 that placed recruitment ads limited to particular age groups, an investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times has found.The ability of advertisers to deliver their message to the precise audience most likely to respond is the cornerstone of Facebook\u2019s business model. But using the system to expose job opportunities only to certain age groups has raised concerns about fairness to older workers.Several experts questioned whether the practice is in keeping with the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which prohibits bias against people 40 or older in hiring or employment. Many jurisdictions make it unlawful to \u201caid\u201d or \u201cabet\u201d age discrimination, a provision that could apply to companies like Facebook that distribute job ads.\u201cIt\u2019s blatantly unlawful,\u201d said Debra Katz, a Washington employment lawyer who represents victims of discrimination.The revelations come at a time when the unregulated power of the tech companies is under increased scrutiny, and Congress is weighing whether to limit the immunity that it granted to tech companies in 1996 for third-party content on their platforms.Facebook has argued in court filings that the law, the Communications Decency Act, makes it immune from liability for discriminatory ads.The precision of Facebook\u2019s ad delivery has helped it dominate an industry once in the hands of print and broadcast outlets. The system, called microtargeting, allows advertisers to reach essentially whomever they prefer, including the people their analysis suggests are the most plausible hires or consumers, lowering the costs and vastly increasing efficiency.Other tech companies also offer employers opportunities to discriminate by age. ProPublica bought job ads on Google and LinkedIn that excluded audiences older than 40 \u2014 and the ads were instantly approved. Google said it does not prevent advertisers from displaying ads based on the user\u2019s age. After being contacted by ProPublica, LinkedIn changed its system to prevent such targeting in employment ads.The database of Facebook ads collected by ProPublica shows how often and precisely employers recruit by age. In a search for \u201cpart-time package handlers,\u201d United Parcel Service ran an ad aimed at people 18 to 24. State Farm pitched its hiring promotion to those 19 to 35.Some companies, including Target, State Farm and UPS, defended their targeting as a part of a broader recruitment strategy that reached candidates of all ages. The group of companies making this case included Facebook itself, which ran career ads on its own platform, many aimed at people 25 to 60. \u201cWe completely reject the allegation that these advertisements are discriminatory,\u201d said Mr. Goldman of Facebook.After being contacted by ProPublica and The Times, other employers, including Amazon, Northwestern Mutual and the New York City Department of Education, said they had changed or were changing their recruiting strategies.\u201cWe recently audited our recruiting ads on Facebook and discovered some had targeting that was inconsistent with our approach of searching for any candidate over the age of 18,\u201d said Nina Lindsey, a spokeswoman for Amazon, which targeted some ads for workers at its distribution centers between the ages of 18 and 50. \u201cWe have corrected those ads.\u201dVerizon did not respond to requests for comment.Several companies argued that targeted recruiting on Facebook was comparable to advertising opportunities in publications like the AARP magazine or Teen Vogue, which are aimed at particular age groups. But this obscures an important distinction. Anyone can buy Teen Vogue and see an ad. Online, however, people outside the targeted age groups can be excluded in ways they will never learn about.\u201cWhat happens with Facebook is you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know,\u201d said David Lopez, a former general counsel for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission who is one of the lawyers at the firm Outten & Golden bringing the age-discrimination case on behalf of the communication workers union.Age discrimination on digital platforms is something that many workers suspect is happening to them, but that is often difficult to prove.Mark Edelstein, a fitfully employed social-media marketing strategist who is 58 and legally blind, doesn\u2019t pretend to know what he doesn\u2019t know, but he has his suspicions.Mr. Edelstein, who lives in St. Louis, says he never had serious trouble finding a job until he turned 50. \u201cOnce you reach your 50s, you may as well be dead,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone into interviews, with my head of gray hair and my receding hairline, and they know I\u2019m dead.\u201d\u201cHypothetically, had I seen a job for a social media director at HubSpot, even if it involved relocation, I ABSOLUTELY would have applied for it,\u201d Mr. Edelstein said by email when told about the ad.A HubSpot spokeswoman, Ellie Botelho, said that the job was posted on many sites, including LinkedIn, The Ladders and Built in Boston, and was open to anyone meeting the qualifications regardless of age or any other demographic characteristic.She added that \u201cthe use of the targeted age-range selection on the Facebook ad was frankly a mistake on our part given our lack of experience using that platform for job postings and not a feature we will use again.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Edelstein says he understands why marketers wouldn\u2019t want to target ads at him: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me a bit. Why would they want a 58-year-old white guy who\u2019s disabled?\u201dOne reason is that Facebook\u2019s sheer size \u2014 two billion monthly active users, versus LinkedIn\u2019s 530 million total members \u2014 gives recruiters access to types of workers they can\u2019t find elsewhere.Consider nurses, whom hospitals are desperate to hire. \u201cThey\u2019re less likely to use LinkedIn,\u201d said Josh Rock, a recruiter at a large hospital system in Minnesota who has expertise in digital media. \u201cNurses are predominantly female, there\u2019s a larger volume of Facebook users. That\u2019s what they use.\u201dThere are also millions of hourly workers who have never visited LinkedIn, and may not even have a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but who check Facebook obsessively.Deb Andrychuk, chief executive of the Arland Group, which helps employers place recruitment ads, said clients sometimes asked her firm to target ads by age, saying they needed \u201cto start bringing younger blood\u201d into their organizations. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that we wouldn\u2019t take someone older,\u201d these clients say, according to Ms. Andrychuk, \u201cbut if you could bring in a younger set of applicants, it would definitely work out better.\u201dMs. Andrychuk said that \u201cwe coach clients to be open and not discriminate\u201d and that after being contacted by The Times, her team updated all their ads to ensure they didn\u2019t exclude any age groups.But some companies contend that there are permissible reasons to filter audiences by age, as with an ad for entry-level analyst positions at Goldman Sachs that was distributed to people 18 to 64. A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Andrew Williams, said showing it to people above that age range would have wasted money: roughly 25 percent of those who typically click on the firm\u2019s untargeted ads are 65 or older, but people that age almost never apply for the analyst job.\u201cWe welcome and actively recruit applicants of all ages,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cFor some of our social-media ads, we look to get the content to the people most likely to be interested, but do not exclude anyone from our recruiting activity.\u201dPauline Kim, a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, unlike the federal anti-discrimination statute that covers race and gender, allows an employer to take into account \u201creasonable factors\u201d that may be highly correlated with the protected characteristic, such as cost, as long as they don\u2019t rely on the characteristic explicitly.In various ways, Facebook and LinkedIn have acknowledged at least a modest obligation to police their ad platforms against abuse.Earlier this year, Facebook said it would require advertisers to \u201cself-certify\u201d that their housing, employment and credit ads were compliant with anti-discrimination laws, but that it would not block marketers from purchasing age-restricted ads.Still, Facebook didn\u2019t promise to monitor those certifications for accuracy. And Facebook said the self-certification system, announced in February, was still being rolled out to all advertisers.LinkedIn, in response to inquiries by ProPublica, added a self-certification step that prevents employers from using age ranges when placing an employment ad, unless they affirm that the ad is not discriminatory.With these efforts evolving, legal experts say it is unclear how much liability the tech platforms could have. Some civil rights laws, like the Fair Housing Act, explicitly require publishers to assume liability for discriminatory ads.But the Age Discrimination in Employment Act assigns liability only to employers or employment agencies, like recruiters and advertising firms.The lawsuit filed against Facebook on behalf of the communications workers argues that the company essentially plays the role of an employment agency \u2014 collecting and providing data that helps employers locate candidates, effectively coordinating with the employer to develop the advertising strategies, informing employers about the performance of the ads, and so forth.Regardless of whether courts accept that argument, the tech companies could also face liability under certain state or local anti-discrimination statutes. For example, California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act makes it unlawful to \u201caid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing\u201d of discriminatory acts proscribed by the statute.\u201cThey may have an obligation there not to aid and abet an ad that enables discrimination,\u201d said Cliff Palefsky, an employment lawyer based in San Francisco.The question may hinge on Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for third-party content.Eric Goldman, professor and co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law, who has written extensively about Section 230, says it is hard to predict how courts would treat Facebook\u2019s age-targeting of employment ads.Mr. Goldman said the law covered the content of ads, and that courts have made clear that Facebook would not be liable for an advertisement in which an employer wrote, say, \u201cno one over 55 need apply.\u201d But it is not clear how the courts would treat Facebook\u2019s offering of age-targeted customization.\u201cDepending on how the targeting is happening, you can make potentially different sorts of arguments about whether or not Google or Facebook or LinkedIn is contributing to the development\u201d of the ad, said Deirdre K. Mulligan, a faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology.Julia Angwin and Ariana Tobin are reporters at ProPublica.

{"Headline": "Herbert Axelrod, a Hustler Who Built an Empire on a Fish Tale", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1927\u201cThe most profound change in my life,\u201d Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all. They were an exotic and beautiful new species.The rise of the cardinal tetra \u2014 Paracheirodon axelrodi, now one of the world\u2019s most popular aquarium fish \u2014 helped make Axelrod, in the words of the trade publication Practical Fishkeeping, perhaps \u201cthe single most influential fishkeeper the hobby and industry has seen.\u201d But Axelrod\u2019s tale of discovery is a myth: As he himself admitted early on, he had actually acquired the tetras not in the Amazon but from a dealer in Irvington, N.J. (The dealer got them from the discus monopolist. Nonetheless, after a technical yet dramatic dispute, an international commission named the fish for Axelrod.) Inventing a new origin story, Axelrod didn\u2019t just change the facts; he spun a personal legend, which he clung to as he self-promoted his way to pet-industry fortune. After all, it not only legitimized his \u201cdiscovery\u201d but also, accompanied by digressions about befriending Indians and swimming with piranhas, presented him as \u201cthe Indiana Jones of ichthyology,\u201d as one hobbyist put it, which he must have preferred to the P.T. Barnum of pet fish.Raised in North Jersey during the Depression, Axelrod supposedly spoke five languages by age 5 and swam across Lake Ontario at 10. He was also crazy about pet pigeons (which he collected, alongside fossils and rare violins, in adulthood too). The pivot to fish came in his 20s, when he studied at New York University, served in the Army and found time to publish tropical-fish handbooks and start Tropical Fish Hobbyist. In 1965, Sports Illustrated called him \u201can intrepid ichthyologist and explorer,\u201d trumpeting dozens of claims: He could recognize more than 7,000 kinds of fish by sight. He once landed at the Trinidad airport, approached a pool near the runway and, as onlookers gasped, netted a new species. \u201cHe was once censured by a professor,\u201d the magazine reported, \u201cfor performing a Caesarean on a guppy.\u201dGuppy surgeon or not, his importance was undeniable. In an era before web forums and Google, collectors turned to Tropical Fish Hobbyist and Axelrod\u2019s dozens of books: \u201cKoi of the World,\u201d \u201cThe Allure of Discus,\u201d \u201cTropical Fish for Those Who Care.\u201d His company, TFH Publications, became a dominant pet-book publishing conglomerate, which catered to gecko and gerbil fanciers alike and invested in tetra farms and chew toys. He smoked Cuban cigars and boasted of collecting sea slugs with Emperor Hirohito, spearfishing with King Leopold III and corresponding with Winston Churchill about goldfish. He also, reportedly, became pen pals with prisoners in Indiana, who, he claimed, had for decades hidden pet fish in vials strapped to their bodies.In his later years, Axelrod restyled himself as a philanthropist: After he sold TFH Publications in 1997 for $70 million and a $10 million loan, he became best known for collecting Stradivarius violins and other prestigious stringed instruments, many of which he gave to the Smithsonian or sold to the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. (A 2003 Times Magazine profile of Axelrod was headlined \u201cMedici of the Meadowlands.\u201d) But this narrative didn\u2019t last. In 2004, he was indicted on federal tax-fraud charges and accused of hiding money in Switzerland; separately, in one of many lawsuits he attracted, TFH\u2019s new owners sued him for misrepresenting its finances, and a Senate committee investigated whether he inflated the value of some of his instruments. He fled to Cuba \u2014 \u201cHerbert Axelrod sits in an oceanfront bungalow at the Hemingway Marina, a fugitive from justice, poring over photographs of hamsters,\u201d The Star-Ledger reported from Havana \u2014 and was later extradited from Germany. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison for tax fraud. Paradoxically, as a hobbyist observed on MonsterFishKeepers.com, Axelrod, confined like a tetra in a tank, ended up \u201cliving the life of a fish.\u201d\u201cI will be remembered as someone who disrespected the law,\u201d Axelrod lamented in 2005. But after his death in May in Switzerland, tributes rang out from admirers as disparate as the violinist Joshua Bell and the Australian Society for Fish Biology. And his name still adheres to more than a dozen species, including, of course, Paracheirodon axelrodi. For Axelrod, the tetra wasn\u2019t just a discovery or a pet. It wasn\u2019t just the profound beginning of fortune and notoriety. It was a symbol of our all-too-human foibles and obsessions, real and imagined, the stuff of emperors and prisoners and priests.Daniel Fromson is a copy editor for the magazine. He is the author of \u201cFinding Shakespeare,\u201d published by The Atavist Magazine.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J.

The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace. So, one October day in 1999, you write 30 words that will appear as a personal ad in The New York Review of Books. \u201cBefore I turn 67 \u2014 next March \u2014 I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part. He took it.Read more \u25beB. 1974John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1977Mirzakhani grew up in Tehran with dreams of becoming a writer. In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

{"Headline": "Stoking Fears, Trump Defied Bureaucracy to Advance Immigration Agenda", "Date": "2017-12-23", "News": "Trump\u2019s WayThe changes have had far-reaching consequences, both for the immigrants who have sought to make a new home in this country and for America\u2019s image in the world.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Late to his own meeting and waving a sheet of numbers, President Trump stormed into the Oval Office one day in June, plainly enraged.But so many foreigners had flooded into the country since January, he vented to his national security team, that it was making a mockery of his pledge. Friends were calling to say he looked like a fool, Mr. Trump said.According to six officials who attended or were briefed about the meeting, Mr. Trump then began reading aloud from the document, which his domestic policy adviser, Stephen Miller, had given him just before the meeting. The document listed how many immigrants had received visas to enter the United States in 2017.More than 2,500 were from Afghanistan, a terrorist haven, the president complained.Haiti had sent 15,000 people. They \u201call have AIDS,\u201d he grumbled, according to one person who attended the meeting and another person who was briefed about it by a different person who was there.Forty thousand had come from Nigeria, Mr. Trump added. Once they had seen the United States, they would never \u201cgo back to their huts\u201d in Africa, recalled the two officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive conversation in the Oval Office.As the meeting continued, John F. Kelly, then the secretary of homeland security, and Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, tried to interject, explaining that many were short-term travelers making one-time visits. But as the president continued, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Miller turned their ire on Mr. Tillerson, blaming him for the influx of foreigners and prompting the secretary of state to throw up his arms in frustration. If he was so bad at his job, maybe he should stop issuing visas altogether, Mr. Tillerson fired back.Tempers flared and Mr. Kelly asked that the room be cleared of staff members. But even after the door to the Oval Office was closed, aides could still hear the president berating his most senior advisers.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, denied on Saturday morning that Mr. Trump had made derogatory statements about immigrants during the meeting.\u201cGeneral Kelly, General McMaster, Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Nielsen and all other senior staff actually in the meeting deny these outrageous claims,\u201d she said, referring to the current White House chief of staff, the national security adviser and the secretaries of state and homeland security. \u201cIt\u2019s both sad and telling The New York Times would print the lies of their anonymous \u2018sources\u2019 anyway.\u201dWhile the White House did not deny the overall description of the meeting, officials strenuously insisted that Mr. Trump never used the words \u201cAIDS\u201d or \u201chuts\u201d to describe people from any country. Several participants in the meeting told Times reporters that they did not recall the president using those words and did not think he had, but the two officials who described the comments found them so noteworthy that they related them to others at the time.The meeting in June reflects Mr. Trump\u2019s visceral approach to an issue that defined his campaign and has indelibly shaped the first year of his presidency.Seizing on immigration as the cause of countless social and economic problems, Mr. Trump entered office with an agenda of symbolic but incompletely thought-out goals, the product not of rigorous policy debate but of emotionally charged personal interactions and an instinct for tapping into the nativist views of white working-class Americans.Like many of his initiatives, his effort to change American immigration policy has been executed through a disorderly and dysfunctional process that sought from the start to defy the bureaucracy charged with enforcing it, according to interviews with three dozen current and former administration officials, lawmakers and others close to the process, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private interactions.But while Mr. Trump has been repeatedly frustrated by the limits of his power, his efforts to remake decades of immigration policy have gained increasing momentum as the White House became more disciplined and adept at either ignoring or undercutting the entrenched opposition of many parts of the government. The resulting changes have had far-reaching consequences, not only for the immigrants who have sought to make a new home in this country, but also for the United States\u2019 image in the world.\u201cWe have taken a giant steamliner barreling full speed,\u201d Mr. Miller said in a recent interview. \u201cSlowed it, stopped it, begun to turn it around and started sailing in the other direction.\u201dIt is an assessment shared ruefully by Mr. Trump\u2019s harshest critics, who see a darker view of the past year. Frank Sharry, the executive director of America\u2019s Voice, a pro-immigration group, argues that the president\u2019s immigration agenda is motivated by racism.\u201cHe\u2019s basically saying, \u2018You people of color coming to America seeking the American dream are a threat to the white people,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Sharry, an outspoken critic of the president. \u201cHe\u2019s come into office with an aggressive strategy of trying to reverse the demographic changes underway in America.\u201dThose who know Mr. Trump say that his attitude toward immigrants long predates his entry into politics.\u201cHe\u2019s always been fearful where other cultures are concerned and always had anxiety about food and safety when he travels,\u201d said Michael D\u2019Antonio, who interviewed him for the biography \u201cThe Truth About Trump.\u201d \u201cHis objectification and demonization of people who are different has festered for decades.\u201dBut he remained conflicted, viewing himself as benevolent and wanting to be liked by the many immigrants he employed.\u201cWhen do we beat Mexico at the border? They\u2019re laughing at us, at our stupidity,\u201d Mr. Trump ad-libbed. \u201cThey\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs; they\u2019re bringing crime; they\u2019re rapists.\u201dDemocrats and some Republicans recoiled, calling Mr. Trump\u2019s messaging damaging and divisive. But for the candidate, the idea of securing the country against outsiders with a wall had intoxicating appeal, though privately, he acknowledged that it was a rhetorical device to whip up crowds when they became listless.Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, whom Mr. Trump consults regularly on the matter, said it was not a stretch to attribute Mr. Trump\u2019s victory to issues where Mr. Trump broke with a Republican establishment orthodoxy that had disappointed anti-immigrant conservatives for decades.But mindful of his campaign promise to quickly impose \u201cextreme vetting,\u201d Mr. Trump decided his first symbolic action would be an executive order to place a worldwide ban on travel from nations the White House considered compromised by terrorism.With no policy experts in place, and deeply suspicious of career civil servants they regarded as spies for President Barack Obama, Mr. Miller and a small group of aides started with an Obama-era law that identified seven terror-prone \u201ccountries of concern.\u201d And then they skipped practically every step in the standard White House playbook for creating and introducing a major policy.The National Security Council never convened to consider the travel ban proposal. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary at the time, did not see it ahead of time. Lawyers and policy experts at the White House, the Justice Department and the Homeland Security Department were not asked to weigh in. There were no talking points for friendly surrogates, no detailed briefings for reporters or lawmakers, no answers to frequently asked questions, such as whether green card holders would be affected.White House aides resorted to Google searches and frenzied scans of the United States Code to figure out which countries were affected.But for the president, the chaos was the first, sharp evidence that he could exert power over the bureaucracy he criticized on the campaign trail.\u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office the next day.At a hastily called Saturday night meeting in the Situation Room, Mr. Miller told senior government officials that they should tune out the whining.Sitting at the head of the table, across from Mr. Kelly, Mr. Miller repeated what he told the president: This is what we wanted \u2014 to turn immigration enforcement back on.Mr. Kelly, who shared Mr. Trump\u2019s views about threats from abroad, was nonetheless livid that his employees at homeland security had been called into action with no guidance or preparation. He told angry lawmakers that responsibility for the rollout was \u201call on me.\u201d Privately, he told the White House, \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen again.\u201dAmid the turbulent first weeks, Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to bend the government\u2019s immigration apparatus to his will began to take shape.The ban\u2019s message of \u201ckeep out\u201d helped drive down illegal border crossings as much as 70 percent, even without being formally put into effect.Immigration officers rounded up 41,318 undocumented immigrants during the president\u2019s first 100 days, nearly a 40 percent increase. The Justice Department began hiring more immigration judges to speed up deportations. Officials threatened to hold back funds for sanctuary cities. The flow of refugees into the United States slowed.Mr. Trump \u201chas taken the handcuffs off,\u201d said Steven A. Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies, an advocacy group that favors more limits on immigration.Mr. Obama had been criticized by immigrant rights groups for excessive deportations, especially in his first term. But Mr. Camarota said that Mr. Trump\u2019s approach was \u201ca distinct change, to look at what is immigration doing to us, rather than what is the benefit for the immigrant.\u201dThe president, however, remained frustrated that the shift was not yielding results.By early March, judges across the country had blocked his travel ban. Immigrant rights activists were crowing that they had thwarted the new president. Even Mr. Trump\u2019s own lawyers told him he had to give up on defending the ban.Attorney General Jeff Sessions and lawyers at the White House and Justice Department had decided that waging an uphill legal battle to defend the directive in the Supreme Court would fail. Instead, they wanted to devise a narrower one that could pass legal muster.The president, though, was furious about what he saw as backing down to politically correct adversaries. He did not want a watered-down version of the travel ban, he yelled at Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, as the issue came to a head on Friday, March 3, in the Oval Office.It was a familiar moment for Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. The president did not mind being told \u201cno\u201d in private, and would sometimes relent. But he could not abide a public turnabout, a retreat. At those moments, he often exploded at whoever was nearby.As Marine One waited on the South Lawn for Mr. Trump to begin his weekend trip to Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. McGahn insisted that administration lawyers had already promised the court that Mr. Trump would issue a new order. There was no alternative, he said.\u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d the president responded.With nothing resolved, Mr. Trump, furious, left the White House. A senior aide emailed a blunt warning to a colleague waiting aboard Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland: \u201cHe\u2019s coming in hot.\u201dOver dinner that night with Mr. Sessions and Mr. McGahn, Mr. Trump relented. When he was back in Washington, he signed the new order. It was an indication that he had begun to understand \u2014 or at least, begrudgingly accept \u2014 the need to follow a process.Still, one senior adviser later recalled never having seen a president so angry signing anything.As a candidate, Mr. Trump had repeatedly contradicted himself about the deportations he would pursue, and whether he was opposed to any kind of path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But he also courted conservative voters by describing an Obama-era policy as an illegal amnesty for the immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children.During the transition, his aides drafted an executive order to end the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. But the executive order was held back as the new president struggled with conflicted feelings about the young immigrants, known as Dreamers.\u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of those kids,\u201d Mr. Trump had pledged to Senator Richard J. Durbin during a private exchange at his Inauguration Day luncheon.The comment was a fleeting glimpse of the president\u2019s tendency to seek approval from whoever might be sitting across from him, and the power that personal interactions have in shaping his views.In 2013, Mr. Trump met with a small group of Dreamers at Trump Tower, hoping to improve his standing with the Hispanic community. Jos\u00e9 Machado told Mr. Trump about waking up at the age of 15 to find his mother had vanished \u2014 deported, he later learned, back to Nicaragua.\u201cHonestly,\u201d Mr. Machado said of Mr. Trump, \u201che had no idea.\u201dMr. Trump appeared to be touched by the personal stories, and insisted that the Dreamers accompany him to his gift shop for watches, books and neckties to take home as souvenirs. In the elevator on the way down, he quietly nodded and said, \u201cYou convinced me.\u201dAfter weeks of private meetings on Capitol Hill and telephone conversations with Mr. Durbin and Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican supportive of legalizing the Dreamers, Mr. Kushner invited them to dinner at the six-bedroom estate he shares with his wife, Ivanka Trump.But Mr. Durbin\u2019s hope of a deal faded when he arrived to the house and saw who one of the guests would be.\u201cStephen Miller\u2019s presence made it a much different experience than I expected,\u201d Mr. Durbin said later.Even as the administration was engaged in a court battle over the travel ban, it began to turn its attention to another way of tightening the border \u2014 by limiting the number of refugees admitted each year to the United States. And if there was one \u201cdeep state\u201d stronghold of Obama holdovers that Mr. Trump and his allies suspected of undermining them on immigration, it was the State Department, which administers the refugee program.At the department\u2019s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, there was a sense of foreboding about a president who had once warned that any refugee might be a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d or part of a \u201cterrorist army.\u201dMr. Trump had already used the travel ban to cut the number of allowable refugees admitted to the United States in 2017 to 50,000, a fraction of the 110,000 set by Mr. Obama. Now, Mr. Trump would have to decide the level for 2018.At an April meeting with top officials from the bureau in the West Wing\u2019s Roosevelt Room, Mr. Miller cited statistics from the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies that indicated that resettling refugees in the United States was far costlier than helping them in their own region.Mr. Miller was visibly displeased, according to people present, when State Department officials pushed back, citing another study that found refugees to be a net benefit to the economy. He called the contention absurd and said it was exactly the wrong kind of thinking.But the travel ban had been a lesson for Mr. Trump and his aides on the dangers of dictating a major policy change without involving the people who enforce it. This time, instead of shutting out those officials, they worked to tightly control the process.In previous years, State Department officials had recommended a refugee level to the president. Now, Mr. Miller told officials the number would be determined by the Department of Homeland Security under a new policy that treated the issue as a security matter, not a diplomatic one.When he got word that the Office of Refugee Resettlement had drafted a 55-page report showing that refugees were a net positive to the economy, Mr. Miller swiftly intervened, requesting a meeting to discuss it. The study never made it to the White House; it was shelved in favor of a three-page list of all the federal assistance programs that refugees used.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr. Trump cited the Center for Immigration Studies report, arguing that it was more cost-effective to keep refugees out than to bring them into the United States.\u201cUncontrolled migration,\u201d Mr. Trump declared, \u201cis deeply unfair to both the sending and receiving countries.\u201dCecilia Mu\u00f1oz, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s chief domestic policy adviser, said she was alarmed by the speed with which Mr. Trump and his team have learned to put their immigration agenda into effect.\u201cThe travel ban was a case of bureaucratic incompetence,\u201d she said. \u201cThey made rookie mistakes. But they clearly learned from that experience. For the moment, all of the momentum is in the direction of very ugly, very extreme, very harmful policies.\u201dAt times, though, Mr. Trump has shown an openness to a different approach. In private discussions, he returns periodically to the idea of a \u201ccomprehensive immigration\u201d compromise, though aides have warned him against using the phrase because it is seen by his core supporters as code for amnesty. During a fall dinner with Democratic leaders, Mr. Trump explored the possibility of a bargain to legalize Dreamers in exchange for border security.Mr. Trump even told Republicans recently that he wanted to think bigger, envisioning a deal early next year that would include a wall, protection for Dreamers, work permits for their parents, a shift to merit-based immigration with tougher work site enforcement, and ultimately, legal status for some undocumented immigrants.The idea would prevent Dreamers from sponsoring the parents who brought them illegally for citizenship, limiting what Mr. Trump refers to as \u201cchain migration.\u201d\u201cHe wants to make a deal,\u201d said Mr. Graham, who spoke with Mr. Trump about the issue last week. \u201cHe wants to fix the entire system.\u201dYet publicly, Mr. Trump has only employed the absolutist language that defined his campaign and has dominated his presidency.Privately, in the Oval Office, the president expressed disbelief about the visa program that had admitted the suspect, confiding to a group of visiting senators that it was yet another piece of evidence that the United States\u2019 immigration policies were \u201ca joke.\u201dEven after a year of progress toward a country sealed off from foreign threats, the president still viewed the immigration system as plagued by complacency.\u201cWe\u2019re so politically correct,\u201d he complained to reporters in the cabinet room, \u201cthat we\u2019re afraid to do anything.\u201dMatthew Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Some U.S. officials cast doubt on whether the Saudis hit any part of the incoming missile, saying there was no evidence that it had. Instead, they said, the incoming missile body and warhead may have come apart because of its sheer speed and force.The findings show that the Iranian-backed Houthis, once a ragtag group of rebels, have grown powerful enough to strike major targets in Saudi Arabia, possibly shifting the balance of their years-long war. And they underscore longstanding doubts about missile defense technology,  a centerpiece of American and allied national defense strategies, particularly against Iran and North Korea.\u201cGovernments lie about the effectiveness of these systems. Or they\u2019re misinformed,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, an analyst who led the research team, which shared its findings with The New York Times. \u201cAnd that should worry the hell out of us.\u201dSYRIAIRAQIRANJORDANSAUDI ARABIAEGYPTRiyadhOMANMissile610 milesRedSeaSUDANYEMENERITREAEst. launchlocationArabian SeaSYRIAIRAQIRANJORDANSAUDI ARABIAEGYPTRiyadhOMANMissile610 milesEst. launchlocationYEMENArabian SeaThe missile, seen in this video released by the Houthis, is believed to be a Burqan-2, a variant of the Scud missile used throughout the Middle East. It traveled about 600 miles.Mr. Lewis and the other analysts, based mostly at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif., were skeptical when they heard Saudi Arabia\u2019s claim to have shot it down.Had it failed in Riyadh as well? The researchers scraped social media for anything posted in that area and time frame, looking for clues.Just as the Saudis fired off missile defenses, debris began to fall in downtown Riyadh. Video posted on social media captured one particularly large section, which landed in a parking lot next to the Ibn Khaldun School.Other videos show scraps that fell at a handful of other locations clustered in a roughly 500-yard area along a highway.Saudi officials said the debris, which appears to belong to a downed Burqan-2, showed a successful shootdown. But an analysis of the debris shows that the warhead components \u2013 the part of the missile that carries the explosives \u2013 were missing.EngineMissile bodyPossible guidance kitEngineMissile bodyPossible guidance kitEngineMissile bodyPossible guidance kitThe missing warhead signaled something important to the analysts: that the missile may have evaded Saudi defenses.The missile, in order to survive the stresses of a roughly 600 mile flight, was almost certainly designed to separate into two pieces once near its target. The tube, which propels the missile for most of its trajectory, falls away. The warhead, smaller and harder to hit, continues toward the target.Burqan 2-HEngineMissile bodyWarhead was missingfrom debrisMissile bodyBurqan 2-HEngineWarhead was missingfrom debrisBurqan 2-HMissile bodyEngineWarhead was missingfrom debrisThis would explain why the debris in Riyadh only appears to consist of the rear tube. And it suggests that the Saudis may have missed the missile, or only hit the tube after it had separated and begun to fall uselessly toward earth.Some U.S. officials said there was no evidence the Saudis had hit the missile. Instead, the debris may have broken up under the pressures of flight. What the Saudis presented as evidence of their successful interception may have simply been the missile ejecting its tube as intended.At around 9 p.m., about the same time debris crashed in Riyadh, a loud bang shook the domestic terminal at Riyadh\u2019s King Khalid International Airport.\u201cThere was an explosion at the airport,\u201d a man said in a video taken moments after the bang. He and others rushed to the windows as emergency vehicles streamed onto the runway.Another video, taken from the tarmac, shows the emergency vehicles at the end of the runway. Just beyond them is a plume of smoke, confirming the blast and indicating a likely point of impact.There\u2019s another reason the analysts think the warhead flew past the missile defenses. They located the Patriot batteries that fired on the missile, shown in this video, and found that the warhead traveled well over the top of them.Saudi officials have said that some debris from the intercepted missile landed at the airport. But it is difficult to imagine how one errant piece could fly 12 miles beyond the rest of the debris, or why it would detonate on impact.The warhead passed over the Saudi missile defense unit.Estimated trajectory of warheadEstimated trajectory of missile bodyMissile defenseThe warhead passed over the Saudi missile defense unit.Estimated trajectory of warheadEstimated trajectory of missile bodyMissile defenseImagery of the emergency response and a plume of smoke also reveal information about the nature of the impact.A photo of the plume taken from a different location on the tarmac appears consistent with plumes produced by similar missiles, suggesting the explosion was not an errant piece of debris or an unrelated incident.Riyadh airportDaraya, SyriaBy identifying buildings in the photo and video, Mr. Lewis\u2019s team was able to locate the spots from which the images were taken, revealing the precise location of the plume: a few hundred yards off of runway 33R, and about a kilometer from the crowded domestic terminal.King Khalid International Airport Dark areas indicateground damage from vehiclesDomesticterminalDirection ofmissileNORTHEmergency vehicles seen on runwayAirportDark areas indicateground damagefrom vehiclesDomesticterminalDirection ofmissileNORTHKing Khalid International AirportDark areas indicateground damagefrom vehiclesDomesticterminalDirection ofmissileNORTHThe blast was small, and satellite imagery of the airport taken immediately before and after the blast is not detailed enough to capture the crater from the impact, the analysts said.But it does show ground damage from the emergency vehicles, supporting the finding that the warhead hit just off the runway.While the Houthis missed their target, Mr. Lewis said, they got close enough to show that their missiles can reach it and can evade Saudi defenses. \u201cA kilometer is a pretty normal miss rate for a Scud,\u201d he said.Even the Houthis may not have realized their success, Mr. Lewis said.

{"Headline": "The Return of the Techno-Moral Panic", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe story was a sensation, inspiring a \u201cNightline\u201d feature and drawing the attention of politicians. The full text of the Time article was entered into the Congressional Record by Senator Chuck Grassley, who urged his colleagues to act \u201cto help parents who are under assault in this day and age.\u201d With strong bipartisan support, Congress soon passed the Communications Decency Act, as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which broadly criminalized the transmission of \u201cindecent\u201d and \u201cobscene\u201d materials to underage internet users. (A Supreme Court ruling in 1997 essentially defanged it.)As moral panics about danger and depravity lost traction, popular tech criticism became nebulous and fretful, concerned with vague themes and forecasts. (\u201cIs Google Making Us Stupid?\u201d \u201cTinder and the Dawn of the \u2018Dating Apocalypse.\u2019\u2009\u201d) In the absence of coherent critiques, and in the context of a stunningly rapid adoption of smartphones, a righteously defensive posturing about the social consequences of tech went mainstream. Critics were easily dismissed as Luddites, unable to see the future through a misplaced nostalgia for the past. This assumption was frequently vindicated and started to feel a lot like wisdom. As the world truly moved online, abstract fears were repeatedly met with, and answered by, specific, irresistible and unthreatening products and experiences. We had learned our lesson.Our present panics tend to arrive just as new parts of our economy, culture and politics are reconstituted within platform marketplaces \u2014 shifts that have turned out to be bigger than anyone anticipated. Aggravation about \u201cfake news\u201d followed the realization that the business and consumption of online news had been substantially captured by Facebook, which had strenuously resisted categorization as a media company. Children\u2019s entertainment has migrated to new and unexpected venues faster and more completely than either parents or YouTube expected or accounted for. Twitter is now the most effective way to keep up with breaking news, a singular direct line to the president, and a conspicuously mismanaged experiment in centralized public discourse.In this way, these new moral panics do have something in common with Luddism, though not as it is now popularly and mistakenly understood. The original Luddites\u2019 complaint was with the way industrialists were using new textile manufacturing technologies to circumvent labor conventions and to thin their ranks as quickly as possible, not with the technologies themselves. They didn\u2019t so much propose solutions as much as they registered a loud and visceral complaint, smashing machines until they were put down by gunfire. Luddites have been reduced in the popular imagination to misguided fools obstructing the arrival of technologies that we now understand as both primitive and vital to the advance of civilization. Their message was inchoate but fueled by firsthand experience of material change rather than speculative, moralistic doomsaying or elite hand-wringing about what we might have lost.As the internet of 2017 has changed, so has the internet user. We are now in the majority, and our experience is defined by plenitude and freedom, still, but also by a growing sense of exploitation. We find ourselves aware of the power and unaccountability of the new marketplaces in which we socialize, communicate and do business. To cast our recurring panics as technophobic reruns is to misidentify what animates them most: Not fear, but helplessness.It would be a mistake to give credence to every noisy critique of a platform, and some of the inevitable panics about Facebook, Google and Twitter \u2014 not to mention Amazon \u2014 will be bolstered by sheer reactionary traditionalism. But in more cases, these panics will reveal themselves as concrete complaints, addressed to people and companies whose responsibility for the networks that connect us \u2014 for better and for worse \u2014 will finally start to catch up with their power.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at the magazine.Advertisement"}

Google\u2019s algorithms use search history and other data to tailor ads to the individual, something that is helping to create a highly partisan internet.A recent search for \u201cclimate change\u201d or \u201cglobal warming\u201d from a Google account linked to a New York Times climate reporter did not return any denial ads. The top results were ads from environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund.But when the same reporter searched for those terms using private browsing mode, which helps mask identity information from Google\u2019s algorithms, the ad for DefyCCC popped up.After being contacted by The New York Times in mid-December, Google said it had removed an ad from its climate search results, though it declined to identify which one. An ad from DefyCCC was still turning up at the top of searches days later. As of Wednesday, no ads at all were turning up for Times reporters and editors running these searches.The climate denialist ads are an example of how contrarian groups can use the internet\u2019s largest automated advertising systems to their advantage, gaming the system to find a mass platform for false or misleading claims.Google allows companies to bid on search terms, and displays paid content at the top of its search results in the same blue font used for unpaid content. (For example, a candy maker might bid on the term \u201cChristmas candy\u201d so that its ads pop up when someone searches for those words.) Google identifies ads in its search results with an icon below the link.\u201cWe have extensive policies that protect users, advertisers and publishers from harmful, misleading, and deceptive content,\u201d a Google spokeswoman, Elisa Greene, said in a statement. She said that last year the company had removed 1.7 billion ads and 100,000 publishers for policy violations in its ad network.Many media organizations have come under fire for giving a platform to climate change denialists in the interest of balance, and policies on paid advertisements vary.The climate denial ads on Google come amid a wider effort \u2014 backed by wealthy conservatives, fossil fuel companies and right-wing think tanks \u2014 to discredit the prevailing science on global warming and to prevent action.Beyond that, little is known about DefyCCC. Its domain was registered through DomainsByProxy, a service that allows owners to keep their personal information secret.We know. Global warming is daunting.

{"Headline": "Bitcoin Hasn\u2019t Replaced Cash, but Investors Don\u2019t Care", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Bitcoin first entered the public consciousness a few years back, a handful of large companies like Dell and Expedia announced that they would begin accepting the virtual currency. But there weren\u2019t many takers.These investors aren\u2019t using their tokens to buy computers or to book trips. Instead, they are hoarding Bitcoins as if it were virtual gold, a new way to store money outside the control of any government or company.\u201cI\u2019ve always been skeptical of directly competing with and replacing existing forms of payment,\u201d said Steve Lee, a longtime Google employee from San Francisco who is investing in virtual currencies. \u201cToday what Bitcoin is excellent at, and has mostly solved, is being your own bank.\u201dThe argument about what Bitcoin does well and not so well can seem like a semantic debate for computer nerds, with little relevance to the outside world.But disagreements within the Bitcoin community are being watched closely by central bankers and financial industry executives. The titans of finance are monitoring Bitcoin\u2019s successes and failures as they experiment with its technological concepts, like the ledger for recording virtual currency transactions, known as the blockchain.Many large institutions have said they hope to integrate blockchain technology into their designs for the world\u2019s future financial infrastructure, and those designs are likely to be influenced by what is learned from Bitcoin.Mr. Lee and others hope Bitcoin can be used for payments someday, but he thinks that will most likely come from software that is built on top of Bitcoin, not the Bitcoin network itself.Not everyone agrees with Mr. Lee\u2019s position. Many entrepreneurs and academics think virtual currencies will gain traction only if they are easy and cheap to send around. The disagreement has given rise to a host of Bitcoin competitors \u2014 including a separate virtual currency known as Bitcoin Cash.But the community that has developed around the original Bitcoin has increasingly been united around a vision that is focused on its goldlike qualities, rather than its ability to compete with PayPal or Western Union.\u201cThe reason people own Bitcoin is because it\u2019s a great store of value, possibly the greatest that has ever existed,\u201d said Jimmy Song, a developer who has contributed to the Bitcoin software. \u201cYou can send money to Africa in 10 minutes, but that\u2019s not the main reason people buy it.\u201dThe Bitcoin software created a decentralized network of computers that anyone with internet access could join, making it easy to send Bitcoins between addresses. And Bitcoin first gained public notice because of its use as anonymous digital cash on black-market websites like the Silk Road.But the number of people using Bitcoin to buy things was always small compared with the number of speculators buying it because of its scarcity. This was something the original software behind Bitcoin had also encouraged, by setting a limit of 21 million on the number of Bitcoins that would ever be released.The increasing value of Bitcoin made it even less attractive as a way to pay for things. Most people don\u2019t want to pay now with a dollar that could be worth twice as much next week.There are also limits on the Bitcoin system\u2019s capacity. A rule written into the Bitcoin software had established that the network could process only around five transactions per second \u2014 compared with the 25,000 transactions handled by Visa each second.This bottleneck led to a fight between people looking to use Bitcoin for different purposes. Many early followers believed the system could expand to handle more transactions without sacrificing its status as a virtual commodity. This camp proposed a change to the Bitcoin rules that would have doubled the capacity of the system in November.But Mr. Lee and other investors and programmers worried that quickly expanding the Bitcoin network would threaten Bitcoin\u2019s independence.\u201cTo be a global money, you can\u2019t have one bank or one country controlling the money, or even a handful of countries or banks,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIf decentralization is jeopardized, most things fall apart with Bitcoin.\u201dDecentralization is a result of Bitcoin\u2019s unusual design, which allows users to keep and monitor the records of every single Bitcoin transaction, without any central authority.If the number of transactions quickly increased, many Bitcoin aficionados believed, only large companies would be able to keep the records. What\u2019s more, they believed the design of Bitcoin wasn\u2019t well suited to competing with PayPal and Visa, because every transaction has to be recorded on thousands of computers around the world.\u201cAnyone who looked at Bitcoin and saw \u2018cheap payments\u2019 likely doesn\u2019t have much background in computer science,\u201d said Ben Davenport, a co-founder of the virtual currency start-up BitGo and an opponent of doubling the network.\u201cIf people can\u2019t engage in commerce, it\u2019s hard to imagine why they\u2019d want to store their money in Bitcoin in the first place,\u201d Mr. Pair said.Mr. Pair believes it is irresponsible to suggest that a virtual currency that has been around for less than a decade could pose a credible challenge to gold. The conceit of Bitcoin as a good place to store money, he added, will be less convincing when the price of Bitcoin goes down, as it has in the past.One alternative is Bitcoin Cash, which was created in August.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The Winklevoss Twins\u2019 unorthodox path to fame and Bitcoin fortune\u2022 There is a paucity of women in corporate America\u2019s c-suites.\u2022 Not every analyst is in love with Apple\u2019s stock price.\u2022 A four-year-old Bitcoin investment fund has posted a 25,004 percent lifetime return.\u2022 Apollo\u2019s low-priced deal to buy Qdoba.Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss made a risky bet five years ago: They took $65-million settlement with Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and loaded up on Bitcoin.That wager has paid off. Their Bitcoin stockpile was worth around $1.3 billion on Tuesday. The question now is whether their bitcoin fortune will prove fleeting.\u2022 They took their settlement with Mr. Zuckerberg in Facebook shares. The value of their stake grew to $300 million when Facebook went public in 2012.\u2022 They began buying Bitcoin in late 2012 when the price of an individual coin was below $10.\u2022 They have collected an additional $350 million or so of other virtual currencies, most of it in the Bitcoin alternative called Ethereum.\u2022 The brothers are also majority owners of the virtual currency exchange they founded, Gemini, which likely takes their joint holdings to a value well over $2 billion, or enough to make them each of them billionaires.And that\u2019s getting worse. Women hold only 23 percent of senior executive posts with a title that includes the word chief, down from 24 percent in 2016, according to an analysis by Korn Ferry of the top 1,000 American companies by revenue.Here is Breakingviews\u2019s take:A detailed breakdown presents an even bleaker picture. Women make up just 6 percent of the blue-chip group\u2019s chief executive officers, and 11 percent of its chief financial officers. Parity comes, perhaps predictably, in that most social of C-level jobs, chief human resource officers, where females hold 55 percent of positions.The overall decline is even more glaring in the wake of the #metoo movement afflicting media, technology, entertainment and political circles. More women in the higher echelons of the corporate ranks could help change a culture that turns a blind eye to, if not condones, bad behavior.The financial industry might be a test case. The sector outranked all others in the analysis with nearly 30 percent of C-suite jobs held by women. That\u2019s a better track record than more female-friendly industries like retail and consumer at 24 percent, yet even in finance women are largely kept out of the most senior roles. Only 5 percent of the industry\u2019s CEOs and 8 percent of its CFOs are female, among the lowest levels in the survey.What catalyst will propel Apple\u2019s market value above $1 trillion? The Republican tax cuts? The iPhone X? Growth in Apple\u2019s services business?While that question has been a favorite question of market watchers for years, it has become more relevant recently as Apple\u2019s market capitalization has crossed the $900 billion mark.But Nomura Instinet\u2019s Jeffrey Kvaal on Tuesday threw some cold water on those bets. In a report, the analyst lowered his rating on Apple\u2019s stock to neutral. Mr. Kvaal wrote:\u201cWe argue that the stock\u2019s gains for the iPhone X supercycle are in the late innings. We believe unit growth, if not quite [Average Selling Price] growth, is well anticipated by consensus and a historically full multiple.\u201dApple\u2019s stock has gained 55 percent this year and is up nearly 10 percent since it unveiled the iPhone X.\u201cBefore today, two cuts to neutral or the equivalent in June were the last ones, according to data collected by Bloomberg. One of those firms has since upgraded the shares. Analysts are still overwhelmingly positive on the stock, which has been the largest contributor to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s gains this year, with 36 firms rating it a buy, eight advising hold and 0 sell recommendations.\u201d\u2014 Stephen Grocer\u201cWhile Tuesday\u2019s findings won\u2019t lead to fines, they pave the way for Germany to order changes in the way Facebook does business when it issues a final decision as early as summer 2018. If upheld in European Union court, this new line of attack could eventually expand the boundaries of competition law across the bloc to encompass questions of online privacy.\u201cGermany\u2019s case turns privacy into a competition issue by arguing that Facebook is the only major social network in Germany, with more than 90% market share, leaving users no choice but to accept its take-it-or-leave-it terms of service\u2014which include consent for the collection of third-party data.\u201dThe investigation is the most recent example of European authorities going after big American tech companies. Here are a few:So far European regulators have been more aggressive than the counterparts in the United States. But the increasing size and power of these tech giants are raising concerns. Facebook, Google, and Twitter have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers this year over the manipulation of social media during the 2016 election by Russian operatives.At a hearing on Russia\u2019s involvement in the election this fall, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California told the executives of the three companies: \u201cYou have to be the ones to do something about this.

Over the past four years, the Pantera Bitcoin Fund exceeded that by nearly 1,000 times.But Dan Morehead, who founded the Pantera fund after an earlier career at Goldman Sachs, said that it was not an easy decision to create a Bitcoin-focused hedge fund in 2013, when Bitcoin was primarily known as a currency for online drug markets.\u201cThe first hard part was actually deciding to launch a crypto currency fund when everyone else thought that was crazy,\u201d he said on Monday.The digital currency flyaroundThe advisersFor Apollo: Deutsche Bank, PJ Solomon, Morgan Lewis & Bockius and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & GarrisonFor Jack in the Box and Qdoba: Morgan Stanley, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher-- Michael J. de la MercedMore from David George-Cosh and Jacque McNish of the WSJ:If the stock continues to rise, BlackBerry\u2019s two biggest shareholders, Pasadena, Calif.-based Primecap Management Corp. and Toronto-based Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., could support a potential sale, which would allow them to recoup an investment that has long performed poorly, people familiar with the matter said.

{"Headline": "\u2018Intelligent\u2019 Policing and My Innocent Children", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Last month I spoke at a gathering of African-American technology professionals. I\u2019m a transactional lawyer at a tech company and my husband is an engineer, so the industry is at the center of our lives. We have careers that allow us to help create products and tools our grandparents would never have thought were possible and to provide the kind of life for our family that they couldn\u2019t have imagined. And it\u2019s important to us to ensure that other people of color have a chance to contribute to the field and reap its benefits. With all those things on my mind, I left the conference energized and inspired by the ways in which tech is changing the world and the possibilities it holds for our community.At the same time, I\u2019m terrified for what these advances mean for my two young children. The same technology that\u2019s the source of so much excitement in my career is being used in law enforcement in ways that could mean that in the coming years, my son, who is 7 now, is more likely to be profiled or arrested \u2014 or worse \u2014 for no reason other than his race and where we live.Of course I\u2019m not alone in feeling that technology is both a gift and a curse. This tension exists for anyone who enjoys the real-time conversations on Twitter but loathes the trolls, loves Facebook but abhors fake news, or depends on the convenience Alexa offers but frets about violations of privacy.Yet in my life, because of the way artificial intelligence and machine learning are being increasingly used by law enforcement \u2014 the technology is seemingly growing up alongside my kids \u2014 it\u2019s especially acute.Unjust racial profiling and resulting racial disparities in the criminal justice system certainly don\u2019t depend on artificial intelligence. But when you add it \u2014 as many law enforcement agencies across the country, including those in major cities like Miami, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Atlanta and New York, have over the past couple of years \u2014 things get even scarier for black families.These downsides of A.I. are no secret. Despite this, state and local law enforcement agencies have begun to use predictive policing applications fueled by A.I. like HunchLab, which combines historical crime data, moon phases, location, census data and even professional sports team schedules to predict when and where crime will occur and even who\u2019s likely to commit or be a victim of certain crimes.The problem with historical crime data is that it\u2019s based upon policing practices that already disproportionately home in on blacks, Latinos, and those who live in low-income areas.It\u2019s no wonder criminologists have raised red flags about the self-fulfilling nature of using historical crime data.This hits close to home. An October 2016 study by the Human Rights Data Analysis Group concluded that if the Oakland Police Department used its 2010 record of drug-crimes information as the basis of an algorithm to guide policing, the department \u201cwould have dispatched officers almost exclusively to lower-income, minority neighborhoods,\u201d despite the fact that public-health-based estimates suggest that drug use is much more widespread, taking place in many other parts of the city where my family and I live.Those \u201clower-income, minority neighborhoods\u201d contain the barbershop where I take my son for his monthly haircut and our favorite hoagie shop. Would I let him run ahead of me if I knew that simply setting foot on those sidewalks would make him more likely to be seen as a criminal in the eyes of the law?The risks are even more acute (and unavoidable) for those who can afford to live only in the neighborhoods that A.I. would most likely lead officers to focus on.Without a commitment to ensure that the data being used to fuel A.I. doesn\u2019t replicate historical racism, biases will be built into the foundation of many \u201cintelligent\u201d systems shaping how we live. It\u2019s not that I want this technology to be rejected. There are ways to make A.I. work. But before it is used in law enforcement, it must be thoroughly tested and proven not to disproportionately harm communities of color.Until then my excitement about advances in tech will always be cautious. Innovation is at the core of the careers that allow me and my husband to provide a good life for our family. The same innovation, if not used properly, could take it all away.B\u00e4r\u00ed A.

{"Headline": "How Do You Vote? 50 Million Google Images Give a Clue", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat vehicle is most strongly associated with Republican voting districts? Extended-cab pickup trucks. For Democratic districts? Sedans.Those conclusions may not be particularly surprising. After all, market researchers and political analysts have studied such things for decades.But what is surprising is how researchers working on an ambitious project based at Stanford University reached those conclusions: by analyzing 50 million images and location data from Google Street View, the street-scene feature of the online giant\u2019s mapping service.For the first time, helped by recent advances in artificial intelligence, researchers are able to analyze large quantities of images, pulling out data that can be sorted and mined to predict things like income, political leanings and buying habits. In the Stanford study, computers collected details about cars in the millions of images it processed, including makes and models.\u201cAll of a sudden we can do the same kind of analysis on images that we have been able to do on text,\u201d said Erez Lieberman Aiden, a computer scientist who heads a genomic research center at the Baylor School of Medicine. He provided advice on one aspect of the Stanford project.For computers, as for humans, reading and observation are two distinct ways to understand the world, Mr. Lieberman Aiden said. In that sense, he said, \u201ccomputers don\u2019t have one hand tied behind their backs anymore.\u201dText has been easier for A.I. to handle, because words have discrete characters \u2014 26 letters, in the case of English. That makes it much closer to the natural language of computers than the freehand chaos of imagery. But image recognition technology, much of it developed by major technology companies, has improved greatly in recent years.The Stanford project gives a glimpse at the potential. By pulling the vehicles\u2019 makes, models and years from the images, and then linking that information with other data sources, the project was able to predict factors like pollution and voting patterns at the neighborhood level.In the end, the car-image project involved 50 million images of street scenes gathered from Google Street View. In them, 22 million cars were identified, and then classified into more than 2,600 categories like their make and model, located in more than 3,000 ZIP codes and 39,000 voting districts.But first, a database curated by humans had to train the A.I. software to understand the images.The researchers recruited hundreds of people to pick out and classify cars in a sample of millions of pictures. Some of the online contractors did simple tasks like identifying the cars in images. Others were car experts who knew nuances like the subtle difference in the taillights on the 2007 and 2008 Honda Accords.\u201cCollecting and labeling a large data set is the most painful thing you can do in our field,\u201d said Ms. Gebru, who received her Ph.D. from Stanford in September and now works for Microsoft Research.But without experiencing that data-wrangling work, she added, \u201cyou don\u2019t understand what is impeding progress in A.I. in the real world.\u201dOnce the car-image engine was built, its speed and predictive accuracy was impressive. It successfully classified the cars in the 50 million images in two weeks. That task would take a human expert, spending 10 seconds per image, more than 15 years.Identifying so many car images in such detail was a technical feat. But it was linking that new data set to public collections of socioeconomic and environmental information, and then tweaking the software to spot patterns and correlations, that makes the Stanford project part of what computer scientists see as the broader application of image data.\u201cThere has been an explosion of computer vision research, but so far the societal impact has been largely absent,\u201d said Serge Belongie, a computer scientist at Cornell Tech. \u201cBeing able to identify what is in a photo is not science that advances our understanding of the world.\u201d\u25a0 The system was able to accurately predict income, race, education and voting patterns at the ZIP code and precinct level in cities across the country.\u25a0 Car attributes (including miles-per-gallon ratings) found that the greenest city in America is Burlington, Vt., while Casper, Wyo., has the largest per-capita carbon footprint.\u25a0 Chicago is the city with the highest level of income segregation, with large clusters of expensive and cheap cars in different neighborhoods; Jacksonville, Fla., is the least segregated by income.\u25a0 New York is the city with the most expensive cars. El Paso has the highest percentage of Hummers. San Francisco has the highest percentage of foreign cars.Other researchers have used Google Street View data for visual clues for factors that influence urban development, ethnic shifts in local communities and public health. But the Stanford project appears to have used the most Street View images in the most detailed analysis so far.The significance of the project, experts say, is a proof of concept \u2014 that new information can be gleaned from visual data with artificial intelligence software and plenty of human help.The role of such research, they say, will be mainly to supplement traditional information sources like the government\u2019s American Community Survey, the household surveys conducted by the Census Bureau.This kind of research, if it expands, will raise issues of data access and privacy. The Stanford project only made predictions about neighborhoods, not about individuals. But privacy concerns about Street View pictures have been raised in Germany and elsewhere. Google says it handles research requests for access to large amounts of its image data on a case-by-case basis.Onboard cameras in cars are just beginning, as auto companies seek to develop self-driving cars. Will some of the vast amounts of image data they collect be available for research or kept proprietary?Kenneth Wachter, a professor of demography at the University of California, Berkeley, said image-based studies could be a big help now that public response rates to sample surveys are declining. An A.I.-assisted visual census, he said, could fill in gaps in the current data, but also provide more timely insights than the traditional census, conducted every 10 years, on hot topics in public policy like \u201cthe geography and evolution of disadvantage and opportunity.\u201d\u201cFor the first time in history, we have the technology to extract insights from very large amounts of visual data,\u201d Mr. Naik said. \u201cBut while the technology is exciting, computer scientists need to work closely with social scientists and others to make sure it\u2019s useful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re following today:\u2022 Disney\u2019s pursuit of Fox is nearing its conclusion.\u2022 The Fed still projects three rate increases next year.\u2022 How will Doug Jones\u2019s election affect the Trump agenda?\u2022 But Mr. Jones\u2019s arrival probably won\u2019t affect the tax bill.Reuters reports:Walt Disney Co\u2019s deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc will value the latter at over $40 per share, or $75 billion, a person familiar with the matter said.The deal, which is set to be announced on Thursday, will end more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at age 21 into one of the world\u2019s most important global news and film conglomerates.Under the terms of the all-stock deal, Fox assets that will be sold to Disney, including the Twentieth Century Fox movie and TV studio, cable networks and international operations will be valued at around $29 per share, the source said on Wednesday.That\u2019s the answer to the main question investors had ahead of the Fed\u2019s policy statement on Wednesday.Despite its improved outlook for the economy, the Fed remains cautious about raising rates too quickly. Two officials \u2014 Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis \u2014 voted against Wednesday\u2019s rate hike. The reason? Concerns about inflation.Fed officials predicted that inflation would stay below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target next year, and then stay at 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. Those were unchanged from September.Here\u2019s how Wall Street economists reacted:\u2022 Republicans will have a harder time passing legislation \u2014 from infrastructure spending to potential cuts to programs like Medicaid and Medicare \u2014 with a Senate majority of just one seat.\u2022 The Republican Party may split further between establishment figures like Mitch McConnell and dissidents in the vein of Mr. Moore whose allegiance aligns more closely alongside President Trump and shaking up the status quo.\u2022 Democrats now have a more plausible, though still difficult, path to regaining a majority in the Senate.The likely changes\u2022 A corporate tax rate of 21 percent, slightly higher than what lawmakers had originally proposed\u2022 A slight lowering of the top individual tax rate to 37 percent from 39.6 percent\u2022 Limiting the mortgage deduction to loans of up to $750,000, a compromise on levels set in the House and in the Senate proposalsWhat still needs work\u2022 Whether to scrap the corporate alternative minimum tax\u2022 A resolution on the estate tax\u2022 How to treat state and local tax deductions.The tax flyaround\u201cThis is a massive, out-of-the-blue idea with enormous ramifications,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst. \u201cDirect-to-consumer services like Netflix will face more challenges for market share. For Hollywood, it begs for more consolidation. There will be one or two fewer studios a year from now. What happens to CBS and Viacom?\u201dWhat was still being hammered out as of yesterday\u2022 The price that Disney would pay for the Fox businesses it would acquire\u2022 What role, if any, James Murdoch would take at Disney\u2022 What sort of protections the companies would need in case antitrust authorities raise objectionsThe F.C.C. is expected to vote tomorrow on rolling back the regulations. But Facebook, Google and their peers have been noticeably quiet. Why? They\u2019re already on the defensive on other issues.\u201cWith the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations.\u201dAndrew writes:If that\u2019s true, it means that employee cuts would be even more severe than I had anticipated. About 12,000 people would lose their jobs, more than the number of people Qualcomm employs at its headquarters.Why did the SEC call up Munchee and cause it to shut down? \u201cBecause Munchee was making reckless and unsupported claims about incredible returns that deceived investors and separated little old ladies from their hard-earned retirement ether,\u201d you might assume, but you\u2019d be wrong.Critics\u2019 corner Lumped together, the representation of African-Americans, Latinos, Asians and others in lower-, mid- and senior-level management positions in the financial sector increased from 17 percent to 21 percent in the period.Before diversity advocates cheer, they should read on.

Can you take the Al Franken thing, Sugarplum?\u201dMs. McKinnon answered: \u201cNo. And, in this climate, can you just call me Amy?\u201dMr. Thompson said to the boy, \u201cWell, Tyler, I guess you could say Al Franken is on Santa\u2019s naughty list this year.\u201dOther children asked Santa such hot-button questions as, \u201cIs President Trump on the naughty list?\u201d (Ms. McKinnon answered, \u201cNineteen accusers, Google it.\u201d) One adorable moppet endearingly struggled to ask for \u201can embassy that\u2019s still at Tel Aviv.\u201d (Hey, plenty of veteran \u201cS.N.L.\u201d performers, many years her senior, have trouble with the cue cards, too.)One girl told Mr. Thompson she didn\u2019t want any gifts at all \u2014 \u201cI just want everything to be O.K.,\u201d she said.In response, Ms. McKinnon delivered an inspirational speech. \u201cI know that things seem particularly insane right now,\u201d she said. \u201cLike truly, mind-bendingly insane. And we seem to have lost all perspective on what\u2019s naughty or nice.\u201d (The girl interjected, \u201cI know, I\u2019ve seen Fox News.\u201d)Ms. McKinnon continued:\u201cBut, as bad as things might seem, I promise you, Jenny, it will be O.K. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. Maybe not for another three years, 42 days and 24 minutes, Jenny, but most people in America are good people, and eventually good people will fix our country.\u201dIn other sketches from the night:Senator Al Franken announced his resignation this week, in the wake of sexual harassment allegations, and yet Uncle Bad Touch is up four points in Alabama. You see, the Democrats hold themselves to a higher standard to anyone else. Which is why they always lose. It\u2019s the same reason the Harvard football team sucks: because you\u2019ve also got to be a rocket scientist to play there. But to play for Alabama, you\u2019ve just got to be able to spell Bama. Democrats hope by forcing Al Franken to step down, they will paint themselves as the party of the moral high ground. Calm down, Democrats, you\u2019re still politicians. You\u2019re the party of morality the same way Don Jr. is the handsome Trump brother. Nobody actually likes you. Nobody likes Democrats. Nobody\u2019s at a party, like, \u201cYo, you know who I wish was here? Nancy Pelosi.

It\u2019s a confusing time to be a woman. And a drug addict. And a very heavy drinker.\u201dHaving seen Mr. Franken\u2019s speech on Thursday, Ms. Strong said:Looking ahead to the Alabama Senate election, Ms. Strong predicted that Mr. Moore would \u201cwin in a landslide, and they all pretend like it just happened overnight, they had nothing to do with it \u2014 like crop circles or clogged toilets.\u201dA sketch early in the show elicited some uncertain chuckles from the studio audience, as Mr. Franco and Mr. Thompson played corporate employees apologizing to their co-workers before being fired. Mr. Franco\u2019s character was a listless executive who had sexually harassed several female co-workers, while Mr. Thompson was a security guard who had also lewdly propositioned women \u2014 but got a pass because he came off as kindly and eccentric (and ended up being fired for other reasons).Later, during \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d Mr. Che joked:Advertisement"}

The prosecutor\u2019s office, Italy\u2019s white-collar criminal authority, says that Gucci declared profits in Switzerland that should have been declared in Italy. The Swiss tax authorities tend to tax companies at a more favorable rate.Even on such a list, however, Gucci\u2019s case stands out, because of the extremely large sum involved; the fact that the fashion brand is owned by Kering, the French luxury and sports lifestyle group that also owns Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, among other names; and Gucci\u2019s reputation as the fairy tale of fashion. (Kering declined to comment further.)It may be exactly that halo that caused the prosecutor\u2019s office to focus on the brand.\u201cThey could become the poster child of a new world order of tax avoidance,\u201d said Leopoldo Zambeletti, an independent strategic adviser and former banker at JPMorgan Chase. \u201cWhat better way to show you mean business than to take on the biggest, shiniest name?\u201dLuca Solca, head of luxury for the investment firm Exane BNP Paribas, was more sanguine. \u201cThe Italian tax authorities have been challenging a number of tax optimization frameworks \u2014 the case of Luxottica, Dolce & Gabbana and several others come to mind \u2014 with different levels of success,\u201d he said.Noting that Gucci had established significant operations in Switzerland, he added: \u201cI presume that this is one legitimate reason why their tax rate is lower.

{"Headline": "A Cute Toy Just Brought a Hacker Into Your Home", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 My Friend Cayla, a doll with nearly waist-length golden hair that talks and responds to children\u2019s questions, was designed to bring delight to households. But there\u2019s something else that Cayla might bring into homes as well: hackers and identity thieves.The doll is not alone. As the holiday shopping season enters its frantic last days, many manufacturers are promoting \u201cconnected\u201d toys to keep children engaged. There\u2019s also a smart watch for kids, a droid from the recent \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies and a furry little Furby. These gadgets can all connect with the internet to interact \u2014 a Cayla doll can whisper to children in several languages that she\u2019s great at keeping secrets, while a plush Furby Connect doll can smile back and laugh when tickled.But once anything is online, it is potentially exposed to hackers, who look for weaknesses to gain access to digitally connected devices. Then once hackers are in, they can use the toys\u2019 cameras and microphones to potentially see and hear whatever the toy sees and hears. As a result, according to cybersecurity experts, the toys can be turned to spy on little ones or to track their location.\u201cParents need to be aware of what they are buying and bringing home to their children,\u201d said Javvad Malik, a researcher with cybersecurity company AlienVault. \u201cMany of these internet-connected devices have trivial ways to bypass security, so people have to be aware of what they\u2019re buying and how secure it is.\u201dSarah Jamie Lewis, an independent cybersecurity researcher who tested toys ahead of the holiday season, said many of the products did not take basic steps to ensure their communications were secure and that a child\u2019s information would be protected. She said the toys acted as \u201cuncontrolled spy devices\u201d because manufacturers failed to include a process that would allow the gadget to connect to the internet only through certain trusted devices.And the BB-8 droid, which was released with \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d this month, also had an insecure Bluetooth connection, according to Ms. Lewis\u2019s tests.SinoPro, the Chinese manufacturer of the Q50 watch, and Genesis, the maker of the Cayla doll, did not respond to requests for comment. Sphero, the maker of the BB-8 connected droid, said the toy is \u201cadequately secure.\u201d Hasbro said the Furby Connect complies with the United States Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, and that it hired third-party testers to perform security testing on the toy and app.Toy manufacturers have long searched for ways to bring toys alive for children. While microphones and cameras introduced some level of responsiveness, those interactions were generally limited to a canned response preset by a manufacturer. Internet connections opened up a new wealth of possibilities; now the toys can be paired with a computer or cellphone to allow children to constantly update their toys with new features.The F.B.I. also recommended that connected toys be able to receive updates from the manufacturers so they are kept up-to-date. And if the toy stores data, parents should investigate where that data is stored and how securely the company guards the data of its customers.At a Target store this month in Emeryville, Calif., Sarah Lee, a 37-year-old mother of three, said she was rethinking her choices of presents for her children after hearing about the risks of connected toys.\u201cThat\u2019s so scary, I had no idea that was possible,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst hackers can do? Wait, no, don\u2019t tell me. I\u2019d just rather get my kids an old-fashioned doll.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the year when a cyberattack at VTech Holdings exposed the data of over 6.4 million people. The attack occurred in 2015, not last year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 New Year\u2019s Resolutions to Protect Your Technology", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech fixThe cybersecurity nightmares of 2017 highlight the need to protect yourself. Here are some resolutions for living a safer digital life this new year.If 2017 taught you anything about personal technology, it\u2019s that the onus is on you to protect your personal data and devices.Amid Uber\u2019s laundry list of scandals, which included sexual harassment accusations and an undisclosed security breach, there was an important revelation that everyone can learn from. It involved Unroll.me, a free service that unsubscribes you from junk mail.The Unroll.me episode also raised awareness of the sheer number of third-party apps that may be leeching off your personal information. There are probably apps and web services you don\u2019t remember downloading or subscribing to, and they could still have access to your data.At least once a year, it\u2019s worthwhile to do an audit on your third-party apps. On your smartphone, delete apps that you have not touched in several months. For a clean break, in some cases you will also have to visit the company\u2019s website and request that your account be deleted entirely.Also check your primary online accounts, like Facebook, Twitter or Google, to see which apps are hooked into them. Chances are you have used those accounts to quickly sign up for a web tool or app. The ones you never use may still be leeching off your personal data, so you should disable them.On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to the account. On your Google account page, you can find a similar apps list labeled \u201cConnected apps & sites.\u201d And on Twitter, go to the Apps page under \u201cSettings and privacy.\u201d On my neglected Facebook account, for example, I had 82 connected apps. After removing many unused or defunct apps, like LivingSocial, Words With Friends and Draw Something, I had 32 left.When you browse the web, a broadband provider helps route your device\u2019s internet traffic to each destination website. Every device you use has an identifier consisting of a string of numbers, also known as an IP address. When you are on the internet, a service provider can see which devices you use and which sites you visit.VPNs help cloak your browsing information from your internet provider. When you use VPN software, your device connects to a VPN provider\u2019s servers. That way, all your web traffic passes through the VPN provider\u2019s internet connection. So if your internet provider was trying to listen in on your web traffic, all it would see is the VPN server\u2019s IP address connected to the VPN service.The trend with these fancy new smartphones is to make the display take up as much of the face as possible. That means that a larger part of the body is composed of glass, which is susceptible to shattering. (The iPhone X even has a glass back so it can be charged wirelessly.) This trend is likely to continue, because people love having more screen.Advertisement"}

Microsoft\u2019s highest closing value in 1999, when translated into today\u2019s dollars, was roughly $901 billion.Apple\u2019s value has been rising for quite some time. Earlier in this decade, Apple passed Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company in the contemporary stock market.To put its current size in context, Apple is worth more than the entire G.D.P. of Turkey.But Apple\u2019s dominance is not just a question of inflation. Using another metric \u2014 Apple\u2019s weight in the current stock market \u2014 IBM and AT&T, in their halcyon days, were far more dominant than Apple is today.No surprise: When the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, Apple is the largest company on the list by a large margin, followed by Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Microsoft. In this list, all three hit their high point in November. Apple has been moving above and below its pinnacle since then, and its value was just above $895 billion at the close of trading Wednesday.The list is basically split between the hot markets of the last 25 years: the current one, which started in March 2009, and the stock market surge associated with the dot-com era and its aftermath. General Electric was in fourth place over all, based on its $594 billion market cap in August 2000.

That would have been enough to place it in third place, without taking inflation into account.But over extended periods, the compounding effects of inflation are powerful. That $647 billion translates into a nearly 40 percent increase in value in November 2017 dollars. It has probably gained slightly more since November, because inflation has remained positive.General Electric has been shrinking lately as it restructures. But in inflation-adjusted terms, its August 2000 market cap is still growing and it moved up one spot on the list, to third place. Cisco and Intel moved into fourth and fifth place, based on their soaring shares during the dot-com boom.Even more than the first list, the inflation-adjusted ranking provides a reminder of the stock market highs during these two exuberant periods \u2014 the dot-com era in 1999 and 2000, and the bull market that is still underway.Seven of the all-time biggest companies reached their peaks in October or November, the most current data in this ranking, and 12 of the companies did so from late 1999 to early 2001.Exxon Mobil is the only company to have achieved a top-20 market cap unaided by the momentum of one of these rising stock market eras. In inflation-adjusted terms, Exxon\u2019s peak occurred in July 2007, several months before its pinnacle in nominal 2007 dollars.Share of the total market since 1980 NO.

Using this metric, Apple in late 2017 does not tower over the rest of the stock market as much as many other companies did in previous eras.In fact, although Apple\u2019s market cap is far higher today than it was five years ago, Apple shares represented a larger share of the total stock market in September 2012 than they do now.The Apple of 2017 does not show up at all in either of the two Top 20 lists that Mr. Poukchanski produced, one starting in 1980 and one going all the way back to 1925.In December 1985, IBM\u2019s shares constituted 4.4 percent of the entire stock market, a higher percentage than any other company since 1980.That is a very high figure, given the enormous expanse of the universe covered by the Center for Research database, which included 6,225 stocks for December 1985. (By contrast, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has, as you might imagine, 500 stocks; the Dow Jones industrial average has 30.)In November, Apple\u2019s shares constituted only 2.5 percent of the overall stock market. In September 2012, they reached 3.2 percent of the total market, far more than today.In other words, many other stocks have become giants in the 2017 market: Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook and more.

In March 1928, General Motors accounted for 8 percent of the stock market. And in 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8 percent of the market of that day.One explanation for the outsize status of these companies in earlier times is that the stock market itself was much smaller: 6,715 listings in November compared with only 704 in May 1932 and 584 in March 1928. It was easier to be a big fish in those smaller ponds.That said, at the end of 1985, when IBM\u2019s market cap was far larger than any other company\u2019s, there were 6,225 publicly traded stocks in the market, nearly as many as today. So the size of the stock market isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation:  Companies like IBM and AT&T simply were more dominant than Apple is now.For example, the old AT&T was so big that Standard & Poor\u2019s excluded it from a predecessor to the S.&P. 500-stock index \u201cbecause S.&P. did not want to let the performance of such a large firm dominate the index,\u201d as Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in his book, \u201cStocks for the Long Run.\u201dConsidered a monopoly, the old AT&T was forcibly broken up in 1984. (A descendent of the company is embroiled in antitrust issues of its own, arising from its proposed merger with Time Warner).But a 1935 law during President Roosevelt\u2019s administration called for the abolition of such holding companies. After a lengthy court fight, U.G.I. transformed itself into a much smaller entity. On the list of the most dominant companies, it is an artifact of a bygone era.These questions may seem strange today, and those who are so inclined may celebrate as Apple sets new stock market records. But it is worth recalling that other companies played monumental roles in the stock market, until their day was done.Notes: All data as of Nov. 30, 2017.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Second Coming of the KKK\u2019", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Book Review PodcastLike the alt-right today, the Klan was never a political party, but it wielded sizable influence in politics. Klan members or Klan-endorsed politicians held the governor\u2019s office in Oregon, Texas and Colorado; it controlled mayor\u2019s offices from Portland, Me., to Portland, Ore. And lest we criticize the current president for being uniquely unable to condemn the alt-right, bear in mind that no president in the post-World War I era from Woodrow Wilson to Herbert Hoover would condemn the Klan either, for fear of losing public support.But the Klan\u2019s real power lay not in politics but in its reach into the everyday. Gordon paints a picture like something out of a Vonnegut novel, an America seen in a fun-house mirror: The Klan sponsored baseball teams (one played the Hebrew All-Stars in a 1927 game in Washington, D.C.), county fairs (she includes a striking photo of Klansmen in full hooded regalia riding on a Ferris wheel in Colorado), college fraternities and beauty pageants, in which young women competed for the title of \u201cMiss 100 Percent America.\u201dHere are the books mentioned in this week\u2019s \u201cWhat We\u2019re Reading\u201d:From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.Or if you\u2019re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series.On your Android phone or tablet:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Laptops in Class, Trump\u2019s Use of Twitter, Best 2017 Books and More: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationEvery week we use this feature to highlight students\u2019 well-informed and passionate opinions on current events and culture, but this edition, we think, features a particularly strong range of teenage thought._________Personally moving from middle school where there were no laptops to high school where everything we do depends on one was a huge transition. I\u2019ve noticed that I am so much more reliant on the laptop than anything else, in that short span of time I\u2019ve forgotten to spell, because I have relied on the computer to fix any mistake I might have made. I had google at my fingertips if I was unsure of a word. I didn\u2019t really need to know how to spell or not, because the computer would fix it for me. The things I learned in class don\u2019t fully stay in my mind, because I can type what they said word for word instead of rephrasing it into my own words when I write with pen and paper to make it more understandable to me. Laptops also cause so many distractions, because you have an abundance of things you could do instead of what you\u2019re supposed to be doing.When I take notes I tend to \u201cprocess and condense\u201d as that is much faster than writing word for word. It also forces you to process the information that you were just told and then summarize it. When I took notes on a laptop for a college course I took this semester at my high school I found that my notes were excessive and many things I wrote down were unnecessary. The students in the image definitely are making the same mistake that I did. They simply write down everything that the professor says, they don\u2019t think about it.I would tend to agree with Ms. Dynarski, laptops and tablets should be banned in classrooms. The best way to do that would probably be to force students to bring a notebook to class and maybe just have an area where they can temporarily store their device. If I were an educator I would definitely ban electronics in classrooms, I\u2019ve rarely if ever seen them put to good use.I believe that it should be up to the teacher or professor whether or not laptops should be used by students in class... While I believe that laptops are an amazing tool for the classroom, some students abuse this tool. They will use the laptops for games or social media and it can really affect how they perform in the class. I believe that the best solution to this issue is to have stricter punishments for those who mess around while using a laptop.I feel like if I had a laptop in my hands while my teacher is doing a lecture, I would not be as focused on the content and I would become easily distracted by the electronic. If I was sitting in class while taking notes on a laptop, how would the teacher be able to know if I am focused on the content they are teaching. The screen is faced toward me and I can get away with a lot more things.Students spend more time checking the emails, Facebook, snap-chat, and email because of all this they lose focus. By the time they look at the teacher, they are already lost.I would rather take notes with pen and paper. I think I take in the information better when I\u2019m writing than when I\u2019m typing. I also prefer pen and pencil because I can draw little pictures and other things to help me remember what I\u2019m writhing about. Also when I\u2019m trying to type fast, I usually make a lot of typos, which distract me and make me want to go back and fix the mistake. Then I\u2019d end up missing something important.I have a love-hate relationship with using computers to take notes. Though I am just in high school and have not been exposed to having to take as much notes as I will in college, I think that computers can help and hurt. I am a person dedicated to getting good grades. This means that when I am listening to a lecture I try to take in and record as much as I can. I tend to get overwhelmed with information and I am always scared I\u2019m going to miss something. Computers really help with this. They allow a person to write a lot faster and to have more notes to study later.However, I\u2019ve found that when I write things down, I remember them better. I hope to develop my skills of note taking so that I can take notes by hand but have the notes be condensed and make sense.I\u2019m a grad student who teaches playwriting, and I ban electronics in my classroom, partly because I need to practice spending focused time away from my screens. I tell my students that learning to be bored is a vital part of learning to write.I\u2019m an old professor. I was stunned the first time a student corrected me in class. He had checked something (on the Internet) that I\u2019d said and found it wanting. At first I was embarrassed, but when I reflected on it, I felt joy. Think about it: That student was actively engaged in truth-seeking! He cared about the subject and took personal, intellectual action. This is a very good thing.Students are not all alike, and people learn differently. Some would do best to stow their gadgets and just sit and soak it all in. Others should get real active with their laptop while the teacher is \u201cteaching.\u201d (Some people are not able to focus effectively if they are not doing something with their hands.)Teachers must: 1) get a thicker skin and not take it personally when students message with friends in class; 2) entertain a real discussion at the beginning of the course and negotiate agreements about gadgets \u2014 then remind students later about the agreements as appropriate \u2014 and 3) take on the challenge of making your classroom more interesting than Facebook. It can be done. But, you can\u2019t just stand up in front of class and talk and expect everyone to obediently soak in your wisdom. They can do that by watching a video in their bunny slippers in the dorm at midnight. You have to make the most of the situation \u2014 where you are present with them for an hour or two \u2014 to create something special and valuable._________If the world was ending, I would find a way to tell all those I care about how I really feel inside. I would stop hiding things or pushing things away because I don\u2019t want to deal with them. If the world was ending, I would cleanse my life of everything. I would lay everything on the table. Nothing would be left unsaid. I wouldn\u2019t travel the world or buy something expensive, I would stay where I was at the time. I would do everything as I usually do however I would actually appreciate it all for the first time.I would appreciate every teacher that gave me homework, that taught me about math or science. I would thank the lunch ladies for making me food everyday. I would thank the janitors for being so kind and keeping the school clean. I would thank my friends, the adiministrators, I would thank everyone because they all deserve it. I would tell the people I love that I love them and I would continue to say it just like I have everyday. I would stop holding all my grudges and finally let them go. I would spend every second with my pets and make sure that they know I truly care about them with all my heart even if I don\u2019t pet them every second or play with them when they want. I would write a letter. I would write down my last words to the universe, to the world, to myself. I would thank myself, say goodbye to myself, appreciate myself (for the first time) and then I would seal the letter and reflect. I would reflect on myself and find a way to be okay with ending this life.The world has given so much to me, and yet I feel as though I have experienced too little. The world has created so many opportunities and relationships for me. Therefore I would not be able to decide for what I wanted to say with my last words. I guess if I were to say something it would be \u201cI love you\u201d with no other context. There are so many things and people I am thankful for and I love the world for that. I love the people in my life. I love the opportunities and memories I have created. I would not say anything else but \u201cI love you\u201d and leave it to the reader to figure out what I was talking about.If the world was ending, I would say I am sorry. I would apologize for all of the nights I skipped with my parents to go out with my friends. I would apologize to my sister for not being as good of a role model as I should be. I would apologize to my friends for lying about why I do not want to hang out with them. I would also be honest. About everything. I would tell my crush that I liked him, and tell my friends that I am glad that I met them.I know it sounds cheesy, but if I found out the world was ending, the absolute first thing I would do is tell my mom, \u201cI love you.\u201d Here is the women who has sacrificed everything for me; her job, her social life, her freedom, her dreams. I know I don\u2019t say it enough or act like it, and it pains me to think about it, but I really do love my mom. She is my care giver, my therapist, my teacher, and most importantly, my best friend. I wouldn\u2019t want the world to end without my mom knowing how much she was appreciated and loved during her life on Earth. She would do anything for me so I would make sure I give her she the recognition she deserves before its too late.I would like to believe that my last words would be empowering and emotive. But I fear they would be just the opposite. My last words would be of regret and mourning for the things I could have seen and done. The ending of earth and it\u2019s entirety of the life it holds would mean that there would be no one to remember your last words, save for yourself and your loved ones as they lay with their last few breaths. This would mean that my last words wouldn\u2019t need to be anything big or metaphorical in any way. This could simply mean that I tell my friends and family that I love them one last time or that they meant a tremendous amount to me.Ideally, we would all like our last words before the world ended to be amazing and beautiful and enlightening, like in the movies, but frankly, I don\u2019t see a greater point to wanting anything more than a goodbye. I wouldn\u2019t want my last words to be anything more than a simple resolution of my life.THE END IS NEAR! THE END IS NEAR! No, actually, I would probably say one last goodbye to my friends and family, tell my crush how I really feel, tell my parents and siblings I love them, give my dog a final belly rub, etc. It would actually be very sad :\u2019(_________As President of the United States of America, Trump\u2019s use of the internet specifically Twitter is unjustified and completely inappropriate for someone in his level of power. Over the past few days, Trump has made many posts on Twitter degrading Muslims and videos of them doing bad things. What I don\u2019t understand about this is why Trump would do this. He made it clear in his presidential campaign that he didn\u2019t like Muslims but now that he actually is president, these actions are horrible for a man of his position.America is the land of the free, Right? If Muslims want to be in this country but get racially demoralized by some people up to the level of the POTUS, it truly questions whether or not America is truly the land of the free.One of the racist videos that he put out was \u201cMuslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!\u201d the fact that he would even think of posting this is absolutely absurd and questionable. What\u2019s odd though is that the Dutch Embassy came out and said that this video is unauthentic. So now our President is a racist and he spreads fake news. I would expect this behavior from someone like a white supremacist, not a POTUS.It is my firm belief that a president should not be allowed to use social media - not in the way President Trump is utilising the platform, at least. For centuries past it has been, and will continue to be, the duty and responsibility of the President to keep the states in the Union aligned with one another, and respected on an international level. Thus far in his term, Trump has fulfilled neither of his principle duties. By having the ability to post whatever he wants Mr. Trump is in fact \u201ccircumventing the press\u201d, but when this ability is used to slander a religion that accounts for approximately one fifth of the entire globe, he begins to cross a line.This line is the line commonly referred to as \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, and while many of his supporters applaud his use of social media to \u201cspeak his mind\u201d, I maintain that the English language aligned itself accordingly when it labelled the way a politician should act as \u201cpolitically correct\u201d. There is a reason that the word \u201ccorrect\u201d is included in this clever titling (thanks, English). A politician cannot simply disregard this principle, as it encompasses all that constitutes diplomacy, leadership, even basic credibility, and respect. Through his use of Twitter specifically, Trump is abolishing - or at least decomposing - many diplomatic ties, pitting the union against itself in a love-hate relationship, and is slandering his own credibility by making unsupported or unjust accusations against people and societies alike.I really think that Donald Trump is a cyberbully in charge. Since when do Presidents tweet about everything and everything regarding PEOPLE nonetheless. It would be understandable if the President would post things about participating in Community Service, or visiting third world countries or even thanking people for their contributions to society. But there is an outlier for everything, and Donald Trump is that outlier. According to the article, there were directed racially targeted tweets.When in America has it become okay for the President of the United States to openly insult another race? When in America has it become okay for the President to insult women, minorities, and people in general over social media? Or even display acts of domestic violence over social media? The current President of the United States is a child with a tablet. Unaware of the social cues and correctness and even common sense shared by society. But to make matters worse, he\u2019s a grown man and the leader of a once great nation. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d but how are your actions contributing to your statement? Your base of your campaign? Why share these videos of people committing crimes and place a label on them? For a president to make those types of statements about a group of people and claim to be \u201c more presidential than any president that\u2019s ever held this office\u201d is absurd.Obviously, social media must be used since it is most of the time the main source of communication in today\u2019s society. But that does not mean that the President should use it like a teenage girl tweeting in a fight.The President is suppose to be held to a higher standard than the average citizen. Therefore, he should only be using his Twitter to inform people politely rather than bashing other people or parties. Since his tweets have been so controversial the people in the head of his administration should have taken his twitter away from him during the election. Also, the President is someone who is a role model for so many people.Imagine all of the middle and high schoolers who are observing his tweets and think it is okay to subtweet mean things about other people. Not to mention that the First Lady\u2019s community service foundation for Melania Trump is cyberbullying, which is extremely ironic. How is she suppose to teach children that being mean through social media is not okay when the leader of our country does it constantly? Another issue with it is the fact that it is incrediably unprofessional when relating to foreign countries and deals. It simply makes America look worse than it already must look to other countries.I don\u2019t like that the leader of a global superpower uses Twitter to attack other leaders, dissenters, and make announcements of major policies. It\u2019s ridiculous that our leader, at 3 AM, tweets about alleged \u201cfake news\u201d....he does not seem to realize that his words have consequences, and that most of the time his ridiculous tweets only degrades America\u2019s status as a superpower. It is quite inflammatory and reckless, and it does allow transparency, but the effects it has are much more negative. For example, Libya is now using Trump\u2019s claims about \u201cfake news\u201d from CNN to dodge confrontation about a literal slavery crisis in Libya. The fact that his tweets are being cited as \u201cfacts\u201d from other nations and used to demote us creates a real negative impact on America\u2019s reputation.I do feel like President Trump can use the Twitter platform for good, but when he uses it to post racially charged videos like the one on Wednesday that was anti-muslim, it becomes a problem. All this post is doing is putting fear and hatred into the hearts of muslim citizens. Instead of being a truth teller like some believe, he is being counterproductive and dividing our nation even further.I do feel like President Trump is too reckless with his tweets, but he also tweets things that keep the US informed on certain things like some of his plans and ideas. An example of this is a tweet from him in Janurary, \u201cBusy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security. Top executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America,\u201d Tweets like this can keep American citizens in the light about what trump has been doing through his presidency. Twitter can also be a great platform for Trump to interact with the press. According to Sean Spicer, Trumps press secretary, Twitter town halls and Reddit forums may replace some typical presidential press interactions. In my opinion, Trump should be able to use Twitter to his advantage, but he should have someone moderating his tweets so any anti-muslim or inflammatory tweets won\u2019t be posted.I agree that many of his tweets contain useful information like you have mentioned, and also that some tweets he posts just create fear and hatred, and that sort of thing should never be posted by anyone, much less by the President. I definitely feel like it is a big problem and perhaps your idea of tweet-moderation could help with that issue.The Tweets are the only place Trump does not lie and show how much we need to see what he really thinks. What he thinks is what he he believes is absolute fact.I think that Trump\u2019s tweets are a good thing, it is the only way that Trump can give his own public opinion to America that is uncontrollable by the media. If the news knew what Trump would say they would not let him on the air. This way he can express the concerns that he has and tell us what he thinks. This is my own personal opinion._________I\u2019ve read a variety of books throughout 2017, but \u201cCarry On\u201d by Rainbow Rowell stands out not only as my favorite from this year, but of all time. The book is everything I want to be as a person; clever, funny, sweet, and interesting. The characters worm their way into your heart and soul, and yet manage to be believable. Each one flips a character stereotype on its head in a beautiful way. The \u201cchosen one\u201d of the story is horrible at magic, the \u201cevil British vampire guy\u201d is sweet and in love, the \u201csmart female best friend\u201d actually has flaws (wow!) and the \u201cbeautiful girlfriend of the main character\u201d is, in my opinion, vile. Despite my opinion, she is extremely realistic.Reading it in one seven and a half hour sitting during the summer was not my best decision. If I had known that it was a work of pure genius, I would have savored the book, tasted it like a five course meal, and finished it with a content sigh. Instead, I stayed up until 1:26 am and wasn\u2019t able to think about the book without internally shrieking for another week, but there are worse things, I suppose. There are worse things than falling in love with a book.Looking into 2018, I\u2019m looking forward to reading any new book by Rainbow Rowell, having read all of her past ones and loving each one of them. And while a part of my heart will forever remain tucked into the off-white pages of \u201cCarry On,\u201d I will keep my soul open, ready and waiting for a different book to sweep me off into a newer, brighter world.My favourite book of 2017 is The Silver Mask by Holly Black and Cassandra Clare. I like this book because the previous books that came out lead up to this part of the story and the wait made so much more fun to read. The book before this one ended with the death of the main protagonist\u2019s friend.I\u2019m not really someone who typically reads non-fiction book for fun, but the second half of the title, \u201cUnderdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants\u201d really appealed to me. The first chapter gave a summary of the famous biblical story, David and Goliath. Then Gladwell proceeded to analyze the story and explain to the readers why certain things happened and why people should have expected them to happen. The rest of the book was filled with relating real life stories, some of success and some of failure to all relating to his early analyses. He captured the audience by giving information many people didn\u2019t know about some historical events, college statistics and advances in medicine. Every single chapter was captivating and made me reconsider my outlook on life.It\u2019s almost redundant to say that Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 We Were Eight Years in Power is must read 2017 material. Redundant for Coates\u2019 weight as cultural commentator and author of 2015 required reading Between the World and Me. Redundant for the essays\u2019 relevance to our current nationally-held breath between lungfuls of Obama and Trump. Through a collection of his commentary from the Obama years, Coates recounts his own racial awakening in humble, intimate, and direct fashion. In a country where any conversation about race can become electric, Coates dismantles and dissects \u201cracial justice\u201d without justification or apology. I suspect that a book like this\u2014 a hot potato, a splash of cold water, a lightening rod, a call to \u201cwokeness\u201d\u2014 will become an important sign post from this era, a future time capsule that you don\u2019t have to wait to open and learn from.My favorite book of 2017 is \u201cAlways and Forever, Lara Jean\u201d by Jenny Han. This is the final book in the popular trilogy of \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before\u201d, a young adult fiction series. \u201cAlways and Forever, Lara Jean\u201d captures the essence of modern teen romance and pleases its readers with beloved characters, like Kitty Covey (Lara Jean\u2019s quick-witted little sister), and humorous conversations. The dreamy and kind-hearted Lara Jean, our protagonist, returns with bigger issues than her previous \u201clove letter fiasco\u201d. . What I admire the most is how she matured but never stopped viewing the world through rose-colored glasses. Han incorporates flowery language and allusions to 80s movies in the text to assure readers that Lara Jean is still the sweet and girly individual who loves to bake treats and daydream.\u201cAlways and Forever, Lara Jean\u201d is the perfect ending to a great series.My favorite book of the year was \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.\u201d It\u2019s part thriller, part social history, part whodunit. That the whole thing was true made it ever more compelling. Just a great, great read. Who knew that an American Indian tribe struck it rich on land that had been foisted on them, and then paid for it with their lives when white people (of course) got greedy. Yet there are also white folks in the book who were ethical and helped solve the crime. Ultimately, I felt like the book was a snapshot of the best and worst of people._________Most said that the men should be punished for their misdeeds, but agreed that their artwork could still be appreciated in spite of the reprehensible actions.I am a firm believer that art and artist should very clearly be separated. In Kevin Spacey\u2019s case, I agree he should be punished for everything he\u2019s done. That being said, I wholeheartedly believe everyone of these artist\u2019s work should remain in the same context as when they were published. I think if we can separate the idea of what the disgusting people have done with the art they have created it is possible to both enjoy the artistry and condemn their wrongdoings.The things that these men have done is horrendous, but their work should not suffer because of it. In the article I strongly agree with Camille Paglia when she says that art should be beyond the scope of punishment. Now, art does not always have to be separated from the artist, but in cases like this, with all of the TV favorites, it is okay to separate the artist from the work they created. When I watch a TV show I don\u2019t think, \u2018Wow the director/producer of this show is an amazing person\u201d. Peoples\u2019 actions are not always reflected in their art, and therefore their art cannot be held accountable.There will be a loss in the industry of talent, but men like Louis C.K., Nate Parker, and Kevin Spacey are being held accountable for their actions, and it is becoming understood that this behavior will no longer be tolerated. Since the #MeToo movement began, women have started to find their voice, and are able to speak out. Punishments for these men should not be individual because it allows for a possible bias based on their TV show. Overall, this inappropriate behavior of some men is not acceptable, and they should be held accountable for their actions, but their art should not have to suffer too.House of Cards is one of my favorite tv shows of all time, it\u2019s was intriguing, dark, and really connected with the viewer. Kevin Spacey played a pivotal role in that, his acting on screen, the way he gave power to the words he said in his personal speeches. They made me question his sanity and how far he would go for power. The character was psychotic, manipulative, dishonest, and had very murderous tendencies. In real life, Frank Underwood would\u2019ve been akin to a mix of Charles Manson and Richard Nixon gifted with the mind of Machiavelli. He was terrifying because he represented what one man could do if he played the system right. He was my favorite character and he made Kevin Spacey one of my favorite actors. So the first thought I had when Spacey was accused of sexual misconduct was What\u2019s going to happen to House of Cards?I still feel guilty when I remember that however good that show is it can\u2019t compare what the alleged victims might be going through. Yes, if the accusations should prove true, Spacey should be punished but one must also realize that punishing Spacey also, regrettably, punishes the producers, directors, and other actors of the show. Regardless of Spacey himself, the show has been someone\u2019s vision for years and suddenly a lifework is destroyed. The only solution left if Spacey actually did the deed is continuing the show without him and give support to all the victims.The censorship of an artwork based on the creator is as silly to me as wasting technological advances created by less-than-morally-just men in the past because of their actions. While it might make you feel better, we\u2019d be nowhere if we lived like that. Just like technology, art forms are always changing, advancing, and being redefined.With the acting industry in mind, I don\u2019t agree with Byers\u2019 statement that talent is being lost due to many men being punished for misconduct recently. Why? Because behind all the big names, there\u2019s so much untapped potential. It\u2019s less like a \u201cdrain of talent\u201d and more like a talent circulation. The circulation of new talent keeps art evolving, creators die and some kill their careers before old age has to. Spacey being a prime example.Men in Hollywood and even New York use their riches and power to get away with sexual assault. In recent months following accusations against Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K., Charlie Rose, Kevin Spacey, Matt Lauer, Anthony Weiner, Tyler Grasham, Bill O\u2019Reilly, James Toback, Ben Affleck, Chris Savino, Roy Price, Mark Halperin, Michael Oreskes, Lockhart Steele, John Lasseter, Al Franken, Eddie Berganza, Andrew Kreisberg, Jeffrey Tambor, Ed Westwick, Brett Ratner, Andy Dick, and many more men have lost their or resigned from their high power positions. While not all of these men are artists or have lost their jobs it has set a precedent about sexual assault. While writing this I learned of more men I had not known of before, and learned more about men I had know of.After learning of allegations against any men watching or listening to or reading about something they have created I feel uncomfortable with their work. To enjoy something created by someone who has abused and harassed women to get to his position of power is disturbing. As much as I would love to watch the television shows and movies created by these men for their art and not the artist I simply can not enjoy it knowing that the men who made abused and harassed the women in their workplaces. If we continue to associate these men with sexual assault, when we watch the art produced by them it becomes very hard to forget their inexcusable actions.To be honest, to me, it seems like a trivial and thoughtless concern to be worrying whether your favorite TV show will continue despite allegations against the producer. Judd Apatow, a producer and director quoted in the article, calls this a \u201cselfish instinct,\u201d and I wholeheartedly agree. There are far more important things in this world, such as reshaping our society to make all work fields safe from sexual harassment and prejudice, for one.I think firing these predators is a completely appropriate response and they do not deserve \u201credemption\u201d or a \u201crebound,\u201d mentioned by Ben Travers in the article, who queried if these people would be seen again in their sphere. But I think that there should be a finer line for the art that is created, and removing their creations should be up to the networks that circulate them. We do have the ability to look at things objectively, and appreciate genius impartially. Such as the fascination with psychopaths or serial killers; although psychologists may not condone how they make their name, their intelligence is an intriguing focus of study. Furthermore, I do believe that this flushout of predators from the arts industries does open up new doors for those swept under the rug by said domineering predators, as Mr. Travers says._________Yes, I want to go to the same college, as well as make some of the same decisions my parents make like religion, schooling, and even job. I to develop some of the same personality traits like kindness, patience, and humor. My parents are really wonderful and I want to follow in their footsteps.I think i might want to follow in the footsteps of my mom. She works with people of all ages who have disabilities. I love helping people and making their lives easier. I would not want to work and manage a hospital like my dad, but my sister does; she wants to be a surgeon.I think I already have fallen in the footsteps of my dad. My dad has been doing concrete his whole life and has owner his own business the past five years. I have worked with him the past four years and already know had to do many things on the job. I think I am very likely to take over my dads business when he retires.Concrete work will always be a demand and I already know the skill so I am very likely to pour concrete when I\u2019m older. Out of everyone in my family I think I take after my dad because I\u2019ve looked up to him for as long as I can remember and we like the same hobbies.When my parents first entered the work field, they searched for a job with the sole purposes of financial stability. They were more concerned with raising a family, rather than fulfilling their own goals or pursuing individual interests. My parents have positions as supervisors in manufacturing departments at companies that they have remained loyal to. I don\u2019t believe that I will ever pick up the exact same occupations that they have due to my different values and interests, which I have acquired outside of the household.Cain Miller\u2019s research on the relationship between parents and their children\u2019s occupation is very interesting. He says that boys are 2.7 times more likely to have the same occupation as their father than the rest of the population is. Perhaps kids take the occupation of their parents because they are pleased with the amount of income they bring in. However, I believe it has a lot more to do with their upbringing than economic reasons.Children often grow up to have similar interests with their parents because they spend so much time together and develop similar ways of thinking. It reasonably makes sense that children would have similar character traits because of this, and thus be suited for a similar job as their parents. But, some kids who have poor relationships with their parents would be unlikely to want a life like they had. Therefore, they will be more likely to choose a more unique job to avoid becoming like their parents.My mother is a teacher, which is a fine job. However, I do not like to explain how to do things. I am a very hands on learner, and I would want a job that allows me to use my strengths. In this way, I am different than my parents.I want to touch as many lives as I possibly can, and this desire could have sprung from growing up with a father that was constantly helping people. I don\u2019t like to think of my future as a statistic: \u201cYou\u2019re four times as likely to follow in your parents footsteps\u201d. To me that just makes me want to do exactly the opposite. I don\u2019t want my future to be predetermined from an online calculator, but in reality my father\u2019s previous jobs have definatley had an impact on what I want to do with my life.I personally don\u2019t want to end up like either of my parents. I don\u2019t want to be like my grandparents, my cousins, my aunts, or my uncles, either. It\u2019s nothing against them, but they\u2019re not who I want to be.I always wanted to be like Hikaru Sulu from Star Trek, and have, for years, modeled my life in a way that would facilitate me to study to go to the stars, to pilot spacecrafts, and to grow plants in space. I saw Sulu as a role model, someone I wanted to become, and made myself in his image.Let\u2019s get one thing straight: I am a people person. I always have been, and I always will be. This though, does not mean that I will follow in my mother\u2019s footsteps as a realtor, or my father\u2019s in public relations. My comforts do not always correspond to my interests....By being exposed to both of my parent\u2019s careers, I know that I do not want to find myself in a field where my pay is based on commission or success. Exposure, in the news, politics, and social issues, is the basis for all opinion, and I believe that the same goes for family life and values. As an individual, I believe that I want to be in a place where I am happy, not in a place where I would want to \u201ccarry on the family business\u201d, no matter how likely it may be. I am ME, so why not choose another path?My desire to enter into this field was not fueled by family conversations. My mom does not (and can\u2019t) gush about her patients over dinner. My dad\u2019s job in the produce industry never thrilled me. Look, I love potatoes, but inspecting them as my job? No thanks. My desire to enter this field was fueled by my own passions - hippotherapy, kids, and teaching. My desire to enter this field was inspired by my mom\u2019s 3-11pm shifts in the ER, where she drank cups of bitter hospital coffee (did I mention I inherited her love of coffee? I was practically drinking it straight out of the womb) and worried about raising us in between administering IV fluids and antibiotics._________Sometimes bad things happen to good people. That\u2019s what my mother told me as a young child, when my father died, and now that\u2019s what I tell myself as I see the crashing waves and the plume of darkness swallowing the sky whole. Maybe I should be afraid, maybe I should scream for help, or maybe keeping calm is what I should do. But when do we ever do what\u2019s best for us. I run from the swampy shoreline, through the tall grasses and short shrubs, towards the village I\u2019ve called home my whole life. Maybe it\u2019s the first rubble that comes with results, I\u2019m not sure but that\u2019s where it hits me. Soon the dusty sand hits my knees as I start to weep, even if I do live everything will be gone, and that\u2019s why instead of running in fear, I sit and wait for my fate.A boy was out fishing with his father when he heard the sirens roar, screaming at the top of its lungs. They had no motor, just paddles and an anchor, they paddled as fast as they could. Wondering how long they had till it would blow, a cloud of smoke so great it would smother them less than 30 seconds.They continued paddling, slowly, very very slowly. It took them 45 minutes to eventually reach the shore, but when they did they ran as fast as they could back to the house to get into the car to evacuate. They left the boat with no anchor, with the fish rotting, so they could get out alive. They did get out and haven\u2019t been back since the eruption, but hope to come back soon.Slowly, the empty boat drifted ashore, ash settling from the dull, grey sky. The slowly calming breeze started to coat the soft blue interior with dust. The oars were long gone, probably drifting out beside the volcanic isle that had caused all of this. The earth still rumbled softly, the bright green flora burnt and brown. Mother nature was a harsh woman, uncaring and merciless, but she could stop the waters from settling. Beneath them rested life as it slowly lost it\u2019s breath, squirming and struggling to pull itself from the murky depths. Bubbles, though meters apart, rose to the surface, signalling the end of an era._________Although there are plenty of charities, the best ones I think are nonreligious, and non-judgment based. My also favorite charities are foreign orphanages, as many foreign orphanages are lacking the qualities like heating, electricity, and other necessities. My favorite place to donate, is usually Russian orphanages, as I have very high regards for them. I sent about $200 to a Russian orphanage, and in return, they built showers for the many kids, and staff living in the facility.Part 1: I went to a private Catholic school for nine years. During those nine years they had many opportunities to give donations to charities and the poverty-stricken people of our community. Every Friday first thing in the morning the whole school would go to Mass. Everytime we each brought one or two canned goods which we put in a basket when we first walk in. It was amazing because everyone would bring in something to donate every Friday and it was so cool to the the basketball overflowing with canned goods and other foods. It makes a big difference to them because they don\u2019t have to worry about food that day and it just makes them feel better and that impacts their life.There are many charities that have gained importance after all of the trageties that happened this year. Many celebraties and famous people who have donated thousands of dollars to relief organizations, but the average American does not have that much money. A lot of people, in my experience, have felt hopeless in these situations since they knew the how badly people were affected but they couldn\u2019t donate money. They didn\u2019t realize that spreading the word is just as important as donating. Throughout all the disasters, I shared organizations so that people who were able to donate could. I shared organizations that I particularlly supported, including Hurricane Harvey aminal relief.I volunteer as frequently as I can. It is usually at a school for people with special needs. This is my favorite place to donate my time to. Working here has even developed my passion to want to become a special education teacher. I get to help these students feel like they belong.The students that I work with are very low functioning. Many of the students can\u2019t walk, speak, or even eat on their own. Every student sits in a wheelchair for the majority of their day. I am fortunate enough to be able to walk around and eat on my own and even hold a conversation with other people. Walking into the classrooms and knowing that I was able to make these kids happier is a really good feeling. I_________Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside the Opposition to a Net Neutrality Repeal", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor months, the founders, Tiffiniy Cheng and Holmes Wilson, have pushed the group\u2019s 1.8 million supporters to flood social media sites with warnings about how the change could favor big companies and hurt smaller ones. They have also supplied online tools to their followers, like one that makes it easier to call lawmakers and another to file comments directly to the Federal Communications Commission, the agency considering the repeal.For next week, just ahead of the agency\u2019s vote on the proposal, they have organized hundreds of internet companies to alter their websites \u2014 slowing them down, for example \u2014 to show what online experiences could be like without the rules.\u201cWe believe people care about this enough to take a stand,\u201d Ms. Cheng, 37, said while sitting inside the house, nearly surrounded in a tiny office by bookshelves stocked with medieval literature.But Mr. Pai and his two Republican colleagues have committed to passing the proposal at the agency\u2019s meeting next Thursday, in what would be a 3-to-2 party-line vote. Mr. Pai, who was nominated as chairman by President Trump, has said that the rules are unnecessary and that market forces would prevent internet service providers, like AT&T and Verizon, from blocking or slowing sites.\u201cWe want to raise the political costs on this issue,\u201d Craig Aaron, president of Free Press, said. \u201cWe want members of Congress to think of this as a third-rail issue that they have to support or else they will suffer in their elections.\u201dThe protests on Thursday mostly took place outside stores run by Verizon, where Mr. Pai used to work as a lawyer. At a strip mall in Shoreline, Wash., just north of Seattle, about 18 protesters turned up on a cold, sunny morning outside a Verizon store between a Costco and a teriyaki restaurant.Shasta Willson, a web developer who lives in Shoreline, said she ran a small literature publishing business and was concerned that the loss of net neutrality could turn the internet into something more like cable television, where access to certain online services are sold as part of content packages.\u201cI feel like this is the most important issue going on,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s some crazy stuff going on, but if we lose net neutrality you might not hear about any of it.\u201dIn the shadow of the New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan, 15 to 20 protesters chanted, \u201cSave the net\u201d and \u201cFree speech, equal access.\u201d Although demonstrators said they knew the rule change would almost certainly happen next week, they were hopeful that their actions could generate enough last-minute attention to bring about a reversal.\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a rear-guard action,\u201d one of the protesters, Maxine Rockoff, 79, said. \u201cBut I hope if we protest across the country, the folks in Congress will recognize it was a bad decision.\u201dFight for the Future was started in 2011 by Ms. Cheng and Mr. Holmes, friends from a math and science high school in Worcester. The two initially got $800,000 in seed funding from the Media Democracy Fund, a grant organization focused on media and telecommunication issues, to fight a bill meant to stop the piracy of movies and music online.The friends, who had long fought for artists\u2019 rights and free-speech issues, saw the bill, known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, as a way for big Hollywood studios to control the internet. They helped organize online protests, coordinating with hundreds of websites, including Wikipedia and Reddit, which went offline at the same time and raised broad awareness of action in Washington on an arcane legislative issue. The bipartisan bill, widely expected to pass, was killed after a public outcry.In 2015, the group used many of the same tactics to support the net neutrality rules that were passed.\u201cThey were so creative and brought something totally different to activism,\u201d said Marvin Ammori, the general counsel for Hyperloop One, a high-speed transportation start-up, and a board member of Fight for the Future.Fight for the Future is now has an annual operating budget of $1.5 million, a chief technology officer and staff dispersed around the globe. The Ford Foundation, the Knight Foundation, venture capitalists such as Brad Feld of Foundry Group and entrepreneurs like Craig Newmark of Craigslist.org support the group financially.The group does not take money from the biggest tech companies. Its biggest Silicon Valley donors include the search engine DuckDuckGo, which donated $25,000, and the reviews site Yelp, which donated $10,000 last year.Of the 23 million comments filed to the F.C.C. about net neutrality this year, two million were through a site that Fight for the Future helped run. The group said its tools allowed people to make more than 800,000 calls to Congress and 6.7 million emails to lawmakers.The potential repeal outraged Lesley Perg, a 44-year-old adult education instructor in St. Paul. She heard of Mr. Pai\u2019s plan in July and submitted her name, email and phone number to BattlefortheNet.com, a site run by Fight for the Future and its partners to see how she could fight back. She is among more than 1,500 volunteers, and for weeks she has put in four to eight hours a week in training organizers of demonstrations and congressional office visits.\u201cNet neutrality underlies everything I care about,\u201d said Ms. Perg, an avid knitter who is deeply involved with knitting communities online. \u201cEven though Pai has three votes, we need to put Congress in a tough spot and to prepare for this to go to the courts. This is a long game.\u201dThe group\u2019s approach has also attracted criticism.In August, Fight for the Future and the other groups put up billboards in the districts of three Republican House leaders that said the lawmakers had sold out to big internet service providers with their support of the F.C.C. plan. The three were Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who heads a communications subcommittee; Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader; and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.\u201cI think it is really unfortunate that this issue has been politicized,\u201d said Dan Lyons, an associate professor at the Boston College Law School. \u201cThis is a dry admin law debate: Is antitrust sufficient to control broadband providers and, if not, will additional prophylactic rules do more harm than good to innovation?\u201dIn an interview, Brendan Carr, a Republican commissioner at the F.C.C., said, \u201cThere is a lot of misinformation out there.\u201dEvan Greer, a director for Fight for the Future, said that to get members of Congress to speak out in favor of the issue, the group needed to deploy a range of efforts to make the government officials uncomfortable.\u201cBacklash is our middle name,\u201d she said.Last week, as Mr. Pai was giving speeches that mocked celebrities like Cher and Alyssa Milano for criticizing his proposal, the group was gearing up for a big online protest set for just before the vote. It needed to make net neutrality something that millions more Americans could care about.On a Google hangout, its leaders, designers and political directors were in a heated debate about their protest slogan. Even minute details, like the font they would use and the color on a banner meant to be shared on sites like Twitter and Facebook, drew pointed discussion.Even after several years promoting net neutrality, it was clear that their enthusiasm was undiminished. One design lit up Ms. Cheng.The design, she exclaimed, made her think: \u201cWe can stop the F.C.C.!\u201dNick Wingfield contributed reporting from Shoreline, Wash., and Zach Wichter from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Herbert Axelrod, a Hustler Who Built an Empire on a Fish Tale", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1927\u201cThe most profound change in my life,\u201d Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all. They were an exotic and beautiful new species.The rise of the cardinal tetra \u2014 Paracheirodon axelrodi, now one of the world\u2019s most popular aquarium fish \u2014 helped make Axelrod, in the words of the trade publication Practical Fishkeeping, perhaps \u201cthe single most influential fishkeeper the hobby and industry has seen.\u201d But Axelrod\u2019s tale of discovery is a myth: As he himself admitted early on, he had actually acquired the tetras not in the Amazon but from a dealer in Irvington, N.J. (The dealer got them from the discus monopolist. Nonetheless, after a technical yet dramatic dispute, an international commission named the fish for Axelrod.) Inventing a new origin story, Axelrod didn\u2019t just change the facts; he spun a personal legend, which he clung to as he self-promoted his way to pet-industry fortune. After all, it not only legitimized his \u201cdiscovery\u201d but also, accompanied by digressions about befriending Indians and swimming with piranhas, presented him as \u201cthe Indiana Jones of ichthyology,\u201d as one hobbyist put it, which he must have preferred to the P.T. Barnum of pet fish.Raised in North Jersey during the Depression, Axelrod supposedly spoke five languages by age 5 and swam across Lake Ontario at 10. He was also crazy about pet pigeons (which he collected, alongside fossils and rare violins, in adulthood too). The pivot to fish came in his 20s, when he studied at New York University, served in the Army and found time to publish tropical-fish handbooks and start Tropical Fish Hobbyist. In 1965, Sports Illustrated called him \u201can intrepid ichthyologist and explorer,\u201d trumpeting dozens of claims: He could recognize more than 7,000 kinds of fish by sight. He once landed at the Trinidad airport, approached a pool near the runway and, as onlookers gasped, netted a new species. \u201cHe was once censured by a professor,\u201d the magazine reported, \u201cfor performing a Caesarean on a guppy.\u201dGuppy surgeon or not, his importance was undeniable. In an era before web forums and Google, collectors turned to Tropical Fish Hobbyist and Axelrod\u2019s dozens of books: \u201cKoi of the World,\u201d \u201cThe Allure of Discus,\u201d \u201cTropical Fish for Those Who Care.\u201d His company, TFH Publications, became a dominant pet-book publishing conglomerate, which catered to gecko and gerbil fanciers alike and invested in tetra farms and chew toys. He smoked Cuban cigars and boasted of collecting sea slugs with Emperor Hirohito, spearfishing with King Leopold III and corresponding with Winston Churchill about goldfish. He also, reportedly, became pen pals with prisoners in Indiana, who, he claimed, had for decades hidden pet fish in vials strapped to their bodies.In his later years, Axelrod restyled himself as a philanthropist: After he sold TFH Publications in 1997 for $70 million and a $10 million loan, he became best known for collecting Stradivarius violins and other prestigious stringed instruments, many of which he gave to the Smithsonian or sold to the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. (A 2003 Times Magazine profile of Axelrod was headlined \u201cMedici of the Meadowlands.\u201d) But this narrative didn\u2019t last. In 2004, he was indicted on federal tax-fraud charges and accused of hiding money in Switzerland; separately, in one of many lawsuits he attracted, TFH\u2019s new owners sued him for misrepresenting its finances, and a Senate committee investigated whether he inflated the value of some of his instruments. He fled to Cuba \u2014 \u201cHerbert Axelrod sits in an oceanfront bungalow at the Hemingway Marina, a fugitive from justice, poring over photographs of hamsters,\u201d The Star-Ledger reported from Havana \u2014 and was later extradited from Germany. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison for tax fraud. Paradoxically, as a hobbyist observed on MonsterFishKeepers.com, Axelrod, confined like a tetra in a tank, ended up \u201cliving the life of a fish.\u201d\u201cI will be remembered as someone who disrespected the law,\u201d Axelrod lamented in 2005. But after his death in May in Switzerland, tributes rang out from admirers as disparate as the violinist Joshua Bell and the Australian Society for Fish Biology. And his name still adheres to more than a dozen species, including, of course, Paracheirodon axelrodi. For Axelrod, the tetra wasn\u2019t just a discovery or a pet. It wasn\u2019t just the profound beginning of fortune and notoriety. It was a symbol of our all-too-human foibles and obsessions, real and imagined, the stuff of emperors and prisoners and priests.Daniel Fromson is a copy editor for the magazine. He is the author of \u201cFinding Shakespeare,\u201d published by The Atavist Magazine.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen.

And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s Deal for 21st Century Fox Is Said to Be Close", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisney was closing in Tuesday on an all-stock transaction to cleave out most of the assets of 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by the Murdoch family, with an agreement possibly coming as soon as Thursday, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks \u2014 now down to the final details \u2014 were private.\u201cThis is a massive, out-of-the-blue idea with enormous ramifications,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst. \u201cDirect-to-consumer services like Netflix will face more challenges for market share. For Hollywood, it begs for more consolidation. There will be one or two fewer studios a year from now. What happens to CBS and Viacom?\u201dThat would leave Mr. Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox with three properties: Fox News, the relatively young FS1 cable sports channel, and a broadcasting unit formed by the Fox network and local TV stations. His plans for those operations were unclear, but almost all of them involve news, a business that has long been dear to Mr. Murdoch\u2019s heart. Analysts have suggested that they could be combined with the family\u2019s newspaper-focused company, News Corporation.Disney did not respond to queries on Tuesday. A Fox spokesman declined to comment.Behind Disney\u2019s interest in a deal is a zealous effort to dramatically lessen its reliance on traditional television, a business built on third-party cable and satellite subscriptions that surged for the last two decades but is now in decline. Instead, Disney has begun pivoting toward what it sees as a new growth engine: subscription streaming services that bring its movies and TV shows directly to consumers. Disney\u2019s first major streaming effort, ESPN Plus, will arrive in the spring. A second and still-unnamed offering, built around the company\u2019s Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar brands, will roll out late next year.Disney has sought the 21st Century Fox assets to bolster those efforts and add a third service to its streaming portfolio. That would be Hulu, which focuses on older viewers with programming that includes ABC shows and original programming like \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d Disney, which already has a stake in the service, would own about 60 percent of Hulu if it completes the deal with 21st Century Fox.By self-distributing content in a major way, Disney would help fortify itself against competition from Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Google. Those companies have built online entertainment operations that have become wildly popular, particularly with the young viewers coveted by Disney.Netflix has shrugged off the loss of Disney content by noting that it has aggressively moved toward making its own movies and shows. Next year, it will spend an estimated $7 billion on original programming. A Netflix spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday.But pulling off the acquisition of 21st Century Fox would be another matter entirely, dwarfing Mr. Iger\u2019s previous deals and creating complex integration challenges. Some executives who work at Fox\u2019s studio offices in Los Angeles have been complaining bitterly about the prospect of Disney management.The Murdochs were not seen as sellers as recently as October. \u201cThis potential about-face is startling,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said.One question that has not been resolved, and may not be by the time a deal is announced, is whether James Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s younger son and the current chief executive of 21st Century Fox, would join Disney. Were he to do so \u2014 and leave the family business \u2014 the younger Mr. Murdoch could potentially oversee the international broadcast operations, one of the people briefed on the matter said, though negotiations over any such role were still under review. Disney insiders have downplayed speculation that he could eventually take the chief executive reins from Mr. Iger.Though Comcast had also vied for 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets, the cable giant never gained as much traction. In a statement on Monday, Comcast conceded that it was out of the running. \u201cWe never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer,\u201d the company said.A deal between Comcast and Fox could have posed antitrust issues, especially at a time when the Justice Department has sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner. A deal with Disney was seen as potentially posing fewer problems, but deal makers have said that little is certain in the current regulatory environment.Analysts said that Disney\u2019s two biggest governmental hurdles would most likely involve the regional sports networks, which would add to ESPN\u2019s dominance, and the 20th Century Fox movie studio, which employs 3,200 people and has been controlled by Mr. Murdoch since 1985. Together, Disney and Fox last year controlled about 40 percent of the movie tickets sold in the United StatesBrooks Barnes reported from Los Angeles, and Michael J. de la Merced from London.Advertisement"}

In the children\u2019s books they devour at bedtime, happy, helpful robots pop up more often than even dragons or dinosaurs. The other day I asked Toby why children like robots so much.\u201cBecause they work for you,\u201d he said.What I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him is, someday he might work for them \u2014 or, I fear, might not work at all, because of them.You do not exactly need to be Marty McFly to see the obvious threats to our children\u2019s future careers.I know I am not the only parent wondering if I can robot-proof my children\u2019s careers. I figured I would start by asking my own what they want to do when they grow up.Toby, a people pleaser and born entertainer, is obsessed with cars and movies. He told me he wanted to be either an Uber driver or an actor. (He is too young to understand that those jobs are usually one and the same).My younger son Anton, a sweetheart, but tough as Kevlar, said he wanted to be a football player. Robot football may sound crazy, but come to think of it, a Monday night battle between the Dallas Cowdroids and Seattle Seabots may be the only solution to the sport\u2019s endless concussion problems.And again, all of this stuff is happening now, not 25 years from now. Who knows what the jobs marketplace might look like by then. We might not even be the smartest beings on the planet.Since Mr. Ford\u2019s book sent me down this rabbit hole in the first place, I reached out to him to see if he was concerned about all this for his own children: Tristan, 22, Colin, 17, and Elaine, 10.He said the most vulnerable jobs in the robot economy are those involving predictable, repetitive tasks, however much training they require. \u201cA lot of knowledge-based jobs are really routine \u2014 sitting in front of a computer and cranking out the same application over and over, whether it is a report or some kind of quantitative analysis,\u201d he said.Professions that rely on creative thinking enjoy some protection (Mr. Ford\u2019s older son is a graduate student studying biomedical engineering). So do jobs emphasizing empathy and interpersonal communication (his younger son wants to be a psychologist).\u201cIf you talk to the best Go players, even they can\u2019t explain what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cThey\u2019ll describe it as a \u2018feeling.\u2019 It\u2019s moving into the realm of intuition. And yet a computer was able to prove that it can beat anyone in the world.\u201dThe idea is all the rage among Silicon Valley elites, who not only understand technology\u2019s power, but who also love to believe that it will be used for good. In their vision of a post-A.I. world without traditional jobs, everyone will receive a minimum weekly or monthly stipend (welfare for all, basically).Computers, after all, are really good at some things and, for the moment, terrible at others. Even Anton intuits this. The other day I asked him if he thought robots were smarter or dumber than humans. \u201cSdumber,\u201d he said after a long pause. Confused, I pushed him. \u201cSmarter and dumber,\u201d he explained with a cheeky smile.He was joking. But he also happened to be right, according to Andrew McAfee, a management theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whom I interviewed a short while later.Discussing another of Anton\u2019s career aspirations \u2014 songwriter \u2014 Dr. McAfee said that computers were already smart enough to come up with a better melody than a lot of humans. \u201cThe things our ears find pleasant, we know the rules for that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m going to be really surprised when there is a digital lyricist out there, somebody who can put words to that music that will actually resonate with people and make them think something about the human condition.\u201dNot everyone, of course, is cut out to be a cyborg-Springsteen. I asked Dr. McAfee what other jobs may exist a decade from now.\u201cI think health coaches are going to be a big industry of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cRestaurants that have a very good hospitality staff are not about to go away, even though we have more options to order via tablet.\u201cPeople who are interested in working with their hands, they\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe robot plumber is a long, long way away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The people were usually delighted to be asked, the executive said, who noted that the data collection wasn\u2019t a surprise given that that\u2019s how Spotify provides users with its weekly recommendations and year-end lists.People and publications such as AdWeek and AdAge called the campaign \u201camusing,\u201d \u201cplayful\u201d and \u201chilarious.\u201d While that has largely continued this year, there has also been criticism that some of the messages veer too close to making fun of users.And the Netflix hubbub didn\u2019t seem to help.Netflix, which has more than 100 million members, emphasized that the use of data to better serve users was a main part of its business and that its behavioral data was collected anonymously.The company has frequently shared interesting information about viewers\u2019 habits in the past, said Jonathan Friedland, a Netflix spokesman. He added that last week\u2019s tweet might have inspired an intense reaction in part because \u201cit was brought down to an individual level as opposed to a broader trend level.\u201d But he pointed out that Netflix does not use customer data to sell ads on its platform, as Google and Facebook do, or sell it to other entities.Tidbits on Netflix viewing habits are \u201cfascinating to people,\u201d Mr. Friedland said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re breaching anybody\u2019s privacy, because the core proposition here is we know you and try to put the right\u201d films and TV series in front of you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Last Push for Obamacare Sign-ups \u2014 and Worries About Who Got Hurt", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPLAINFIELD, N.J. \u2014 Denise English was one of just two employees working six days a week to handle the crowd of people signing up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act at a neighborhood health clinic here, as the Friday deadline for open enrollment loomed.Most of the people who sat waiting wanted to speak to her co-worker, who speaks Spanish. But Ms. English \u2014 she speaks only \u201cun poquito\u201d \u2014 was doing her best, her phone open to Google Translate, as she tried to help clients like Ana Gonzalez and Celso Morales, who moved here from Puerto Rico in April, sign up for a subsidized health plan.\u201cObamacare,\u201d Mr. Morales said, using one of the few English words he knows.\u201cWithout question,\u201d said Dr. David Satcher, a former surgeon general of the United States, \u201cthe Affordable Care Act represents the biggest gain in coverage we\u2019ve seen for African Americans since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid\u201d more than a half-century ago.Steven T. Lopez, a health-policy specialist at UnidosUS, a Hispanic rights group formerly known as the National Council of La Raza, echoed that assessment. \u201cThe law has resulted in historic coverage gains for our community,\u201d he said.Just as the gains have helped blacks and Hispanics, the cutbacks are likely to hurt most in communities like this one, a small city in central New Jersey where blacks and Hispanics account for a majority of residents.\u201cWe know how much the one-on-one assistance meant to getting people enrolled, particularly in communities of color, and I think in communities where English is not the primary language spoken,\u201d said Maura Collinsgru, the health care program director for New Jersey Citizen Action, which joined other nonprofit groups in setting up a website, CoverNJ, to encourage enrollment despite the hurdles this year. \u201cThat\u2019s really where there was a great deal of effort put over the last several years \u2014 we have lost that almost completely.\u201dHispanics and African-Americans are still much more likely than whites to be uninsured. But the health law has markedly reduced racial and ethnic disparities in coverage.Among adults age 18 to 64, the uninsured rate for Hispanics is now about 17.9 percentage points higher than for whites, down from a difference of 26 percentage points in 2013, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. And the uninsured rate for blacks is 4.6 percentage points higher than for whites, compared with a gap of 10.4 points in 2013.Before the Affordable Care Act, large numbers of Hispanics were uninsured, in part because many had low-wage jobs that did not offer insurance. Even with the health care law, many Hispanics are ineligible for Medicaid and insurance subsidies because of their immigration status.Still, the overall rate of Hispanics without health insurance is down to 16 percent, from 24.4 percent in 2013. The rate of uninsured African-Americans has dropped only slightly less dramatically, to 10.5 percent from 15.9 percent in 2013, according to the Census Bureau.Dr. Satcher said the gains in coverage are also threatened by cuts in federal subsidies paid to insurance companies on behalf of low-income people and by provisions of the Republican tax bill that would, in effect, eliminate the requirement for people to have coverage.The effects of the federal cuts on minority residents are evident in the work of the Center for Family Services, which serves seven counties over 3,000 square miles in southern New Jersey.The nonprofit had its federal funding cut by 64 percent, reducing the number of navigators from 21 who spoke six languages between them to 6 who speak English and Spanish. As a result, it stopped doing enrollment at several locations in Camden, a poor and majority black and Hispanic city.\u201cWe\u2019re not reaching out to those communities because there\u2019s less of us,\u201d said Pamela Gray, a navigator with the group, one of five that received the federal funding in New Jersey. \u201cWe\u2019re still getting out there and doing events,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the less people, the less people you\u2019re able to serve.\u201dOver the past six weeks, the Black AIDS Institute, in partnership with a dozen other health care and civil rights groups, has held enrollment events in 18 cities including Atlanta; Richmond, Va.; Chicago; and Los Angeles. The goal, said Lestian McNeal, the program coordinator for the institute, was to \u201cfill the void in government support created by the Trump administration.\u201dThe groups sought out uninsured African-Americans, especially those at risk of developing AIDS. In some cases, Mr. McNeal said, \u201cenrollment assisters\u201d helped people find plans that were essentially free because financial assistance in the form of tax credits covered the entire premium.Across the country, many public libraries held open enrollment events, hoping to fill in the gap where there were fewer navigators.The Neighborhood Health center here has tried to make up for the loss of federal funds by going into local churches to remind people that open enrollment was coming to an end and setting up a makeshift enrollment center near a bustling pediatric clinic.But because of budget cuts, the center laid off three people who had done enrollment counseling \u2014 including one who spoke Spanish and one fluent in Creole.Without many television ads, Ms. English said, people seem to be getting their information about the Affordable Care Act from the news, where Republicans are repeatedly threatening to repeal the law and warning that insurance markets are collapsing.\u201cThe cuts to advertising, and the media, have put it in people\u2019s head that it\u2019s going to be too high and they can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Ms. English said. \u201cThen when we do tell them what it\u2019s going to cost, they would just be shocked. \u2018Oh, the media said it was going to be expensive.\u2019 We say, No, no, you just need to do it.\u201dMs. Gonzalez and Mr. Morales, who moved to New Jersey from Puerto Rico, came to sign up for coverage on the advice of one of his co-workers after Mr. Morales was told he has diabetes. The couple \u2014 she is 54 and he is 58 \u2014 qualified for Medicaid in Puerto Rico, but in New Jersey, their income is too high. They earn about $35,000 a year between her job at Target and his work laying stones for a construction company. With the Affordable Care Act tax credit, they will pay just under $200 a month to cover the two of them, a sum that seemed to please Ms. Gonzalez.Lisbeth Lopez, 23, whose parents came to the United States from Colombia, had seen ads for open enrollment on a Spanish language television station. She had coverage as a college student, but she graduated in May and has been unable to find work as a paralegal.\u201cI\u2019m hoping to get a job soon, but I have to start paying for health insurance,\u201d she said. While some of her friends think they can get by without it, she said, \u201cI just imagine what if something happens to me, where do I turn?\u201dShe had come with her brother, who was signing up, and her mother, who signed up two weeks ago. \u201cWe had to look for seats,\u201d her brother, Luis Valentin, said. And after two hours of waiting, there were still eight people waiting to be helped before them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "That Game on Your Phone May Be Tracking What You\u2019re Watching on TV", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first glance, the gaming apps \u2014 with names like \u201cPool 3D,\u201d \u201cBeer Pong: Trickshot\u201d and \u201cReal Bowling Strike 10 Pin\u201d \u2014 seem innocuous. One called \u201cHoney Quest\u201d features Jumbo, an animated bear.Yet these apps, once downloaded onto a smartphone, have the ability to keep tabs on the viewing habits of their users \u2014 some of whom may be children \u2014 even when the games aren\u2019t being played.It is yet another example of how companies, using devices that many people feel they can\u2019t do without, are documenting how audiences in a rapidly changing entertainment landscape are viewing television and commercials.The apps use software from Alphonso, a start-up that collects TV-viewing data for advertisers. Using a smartphone\u2019s microphone, Alphonso\u2019s software can detail what people watch by identifying audio signals in TV ads and shows, sometimes even matching that information with the places people visit and the movies they see. The information can then be used to target ads more precisely and to try to analyze things like which ads prompted a person to go to a car dealership.Some of the tracking is taking place through gaming apps that do not otherwise involve a smartphone\u2019s microphone, including some apps that are geared toward children. The software can also detect sounds even when a phone is in a pocket if the apps are running in the background.The spread of these technologies, combined with the proliferation of internet-connected TVs and tools that can identify video content through pixels and audio snippets, has resulted in some questionable practices.Companies gathering such data, especially through games, need to make their business practices clear to consumers \u201cbecause it\u2019s so inherently unexpected and surprising,\u201d said Justin Brookman, the director of consumer privacy and technology policy at the advocacy group Consumers Union, and a former policy director at the trade commission who worked on the Silverpush case.\u201cWhen you see \u2018permission for microphone access for ads,\u2019 it may not be clear to a user that, Oh, this means it\u2019s going to be listening to what I do all the time to see if I\u2019m watching \u2018Monday Night Football,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brookman said. \u201cThey need to go above and beyond and be careful to make sure consumers know what\u2019s going on.\u201dThrough its software, Alphonso can follow the ads that people see in friends\u2019 homes and elsewhere. The company has also worked with movie studios to figure out theater-viewing habits, Mr. Chordia, Alphonso\u2019s chief executive, said. Smartphone apps that are running Alphonso\u2019s software, even if they are not actively in use, can detect movies based on film snippets provided by the studios ahead of time.\u201cA lot of the folks will go and turn off their phone, but a small portion of people don\u2019t and put it in their pocket,\u201d Mr. Chordia said. \u201cIn those cases, we are able to pick up in a small sample who is watching the show or the movie.\u201d Mr. Chordia said that Alphonso has a deal with the music-listening app Shazam, which has microphone access on many phones. Alphonso is able to provide the snippets it picks up to Shazam, he said, which can use its own content-recognition technology to identify users and then sell that information to Alphonso.Founded in 2013, Alphonso initially focused on working with apps to capitalize on ads through so-called second-screen viewing, as people increasingly turned their attention to smartphones and tablets during TV breaks. Now, the company has broadened its focus to gathering troves of viewing data from companies like TiVo and directly from TVs and streaming devices through deals with manufacturers.The disparate viewing information is tied to IP addresses, which can be matched to characteristics like age, gender, income and more through big data brokers like Experian without using personally identifiable information like names and addresses.\u201cWe have to be really careful as we have more devices capturing more information in living rooms and bedrooms and on the street and in other people\u2019s homes that the public is not blindsided and surprised by things,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted TV ads. \u201cIt\u2019s not what\u2019s legal. It is what\u2019s not creepy.\u201dOn the other hand, many people have had issues recognizing audio through apps like Shazam if there is too much background noise, so it\u2019s not clear how much information Alphonso\u2019s apps can pick up on a daily basis.\u201c\u2018It\u2019s not normally, I don\u2019t think, going to be expected that an application is going to be listening for what you\u2019re watching,\u201d Mr. Brookman said. \u201cBut you\u2019re not necessarily expecting your TV to be watching what you\u2019re doing either.\u201dNiraj Chokshi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Provides Hedge Against Tech Backlash", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAuthorities worldwide are growing worried that Facebook, Google and Amazon are eroding privacy, using data to push rivals out of business and even affecting elections. This is one tech battle Apple can sit out. As a security-minded purveyor of hardware, it\u2019s likely to avoid the worst of the blowback.Europe will be the eye of the tech storm in 2018. The European Commission has already fined Google $2.8 billion for favoring its own services and burying rivals in search results. Regulators are deciding whether the Alphabet\u2019s Android mobile operating system gives it another means of unfairly promoting its businesses. A bigger fine and reduced mobile revenue from Google search could result.Fining Google for favoring its own products sets an unwelcome precedent for other tech firms. European Union authorities could forbid Amazon\u2019s listing of own-label products ahead of competitors\u2019 offerings.The biggest danger comes in May when companies must comply with Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. It requires that they seek explicit consent before using personal data. It\u2019s probable many customers will not agree, which means Google could find it harder to customize Gmail ads and Facebook might not be able to use WhatsApp information to sell ads on other sites and apps. Customers also have the right to delete their data or port it elsewhere \u2014 reducing the ability of Amazon and Google to lock in cloud customers.Parts of Europe\u2019s agenda may be adopted elsewhere. And lawmakers in the United States are mulling putting big internet firms under the oversight of the strict Federal Communications Commission, rather than the lax Federal Trade Commission.Apple is the biggest tech giant, worth nearly $900 billion, yet it stands curiously apart. The company sells lots of expensive phones, but it\u2019s no monopolist. The iPhone\u2019s combined share of the five biggest European markets is under 20 percent, says Kantar Worldpanel. The company also uses privacy as a selling point. It does not gather personal information to sell to advertisers, places similar restrictions on app developers and fights government attempts to unlock suspects\u2019 phones. Apple\u2019s inability to master social media means its business does not affect elections either.Apple is not carefree. The company\u2019s attempts to slither out of paying taxes make it a target in its own right. At worst, though, the result is probably a fine. Its rivals are looking at major, forced changes in their business models.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s my No. 1.\u201dMr. Wayne, 54, was born in Jamaica and earned a degree in journalism from the University of Georgia before moving to New York. In 1984 he started his own magazine, R.O.M.E., a do-it-yourself collection of interviews he photocopied on paper and bound together with tape. He met Andy Warhol and, after the artist died, became an associate editor at Mr. Warhol\u2019s Interview.Later, Mr. Wayne caught the eye of the media scion S. I. Newhouse Jr. and was named one of the first contributing editors at Allure magazine. But it was at Vanity Fair that Mr. Wayne (who calls himself G. W.) found his niche as a celebrity chronicler. \u201cI interviewed Fabio,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was my very first interview at Vanity Fair.\u201dMr. Wayne met a man in Pushkin Square \u2014 a boxer in training, he said \u2014 who he invited to his hotel. The writer decided to stay a few extra days. \u201cMartha Stewart\u2019s jaw dropped,\u201d Mr. Wayne said. \u201cShe said, \u2018Why are you staying? Are you kidding me?\u2019\u201d She had a point. Violence erupted in Moscow after Boris Yeltsin, the president, sought to disband the Russian parliament and seize control. \u201cI turned on CNN after having the best sex with this Russian boxer and there is a coup taking place in the country,\u201d Mr. Wayne said.We decided to turn the celebrity tables on Mr. Wayne and ask him some of the same questions he asked notable luminaries, among them Carrie Fisher, Ivanka Trump, Anna Wintour and his old boss at Vanity Fair, Graydon Carter. Many were lifted from \u201cAnyone Who\u2019s Anyone: The Astonishing Celebrity Interviews, 1987-2017,\u201d a collection spanning Mr. Wayne\u2019s 30-year career. We didn\u2019t tell Mr. Wayne until the end of our interview that the questions were his. (His answers are edited for context and space.)

You are asking the wrong person.LH: Have you ever done drugs? (Farrah Fawcett)GW: I\u2019ve dabbled in some things, not everything. Growing up in a country like Jamaica, people think that you smoke marijuana, ganga, like a ganga head. The first time I did marijuana was in college. I think marijuana is the weed of wisdom. It heightens your creative abilities. That is basically what I do. I\u2019ve never tried the hard stuff. I\u2019ve tried Molly once. Ecstasy.LH: Who is the phoniest person in Hollywood? (Joan Rivers)GW: That\u2019s a tough one. Can I think about that and get back to you?LH: No. You have to tell me now.GW: Angelina Jolie. That is just my personal opinion.

I would love to be in a committed relationship. But I\u2019m very picky.LH: What girls do you think are next in line for the title of world supermodel? (Donatella Versace)GW: Without question, Kaia Gerber. She is exquisite. I saw that full page Omega ad she just did, the campaign for a new watch. She is stunning. She is like her mother, Cindy Crawford, plus more. She is the future. No question.LH: Is it true you write all of your books in longhand? (Jackie Collins)GW: I do.

So if you come to my apartment, which is the size of this table, you\u2019ll find nothing but filing cabinets and magazines. Filing cabinets with my notes.LH: Tell me a little about your childhood. Was it privileged? (Anna Wintour)GW: Yeah. I was a lucky kid. My parents gave me the best of everything, to be honest. My father worked with a Canadian company, a conglomerate. My mother sold real estate. And she drove a Peugeot. And nobody in Jamaica drove a Peugeot. I went to boarding school. It was called Munro College, where a lot of Rhodes scholars went.I was on the quiz team. We won twice. The quiz competition in Jamaica is a big deal.

In the golden age when Donald and Ivana were together, he was amazing. Donald was a lot of fun. And I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the strangest thing, what has happened.

Who knew that he would become this Islamaphobic, homophobic racist? I just can\u2019t imagine where this all came from. Is it because of Steve Bannon, who has completely got his mind? It is disappointing to see that.LH: Do you pack heat? (Geraldo Rivera)GW: No. But maybe I should get some mace.LH: Do you watch television? (Milton Berle)GW: I love television.

I like to write when it\u2019s 11 p.m. to about 2 o\u2019clock in the morning. I need my eight hours of sleep. You ask me what my vice is? It\u2019s sleeping. I like to get my beauty rest.

{"Headline": "The Reckoning: Women and Power in the Workplace", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "Essays and art from Jenna Wortham, Ruth Franklin, Vivian Gornick, Parul Sehgal, Heidi Julavits, Paula Scher, Olivia Locher, Amber Vittoria and more.As revelations of sexual harassment break, women have been discussing the fallout and how to move forward. Here, women from across the working world take on this complicated conversation.By Jenna Wortham\u201cRevolution will come in a form we cannot yet imagine,\u201d the critical theorists Fred Moten and Stefano Harney wrote in their 2013 essay \u201cThe Undercommons,\u201d about the need to radically upend hierarchical institutions. I thought of their prophecy in October, when a private document listing allegations of sexual harassment and abuse by dozens of men in publishing and media surfaced online.The list \u2014 a Google spreadsheet initially shared exclusively among women, who could anonymously add to it \u2014 was created in the immediate aftermath of reports about sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein. The atmosphere among female journalists was thick with the tension of watching the press expose the moral wrongs of Hollywood while neglecting to interrogate our own. The existence of the list suggested that things were worse than we even imagined, given all that it revealed. It was horrifying to see the names of colleagues and friends \u2014 people you had mingled with at parties and accepted drinks from \u2014 accused of heinous acts.A few days after the list appeared, I was in a van with a half dozen other women of color, riding through the desert on our way to a writing retreat. All of us worked in media; most of us had not realized the extent to which harassment polluted our industry. Whisper networks, in which women share secret warnings via word of mouth, require women to tell others whom to avoid and whom to ignore. They are based on trust, and any social hierarchy is rife with the privilege of deciding who gets access to information. Perhaps we were perceived as outsiders, or maybe we weren\u2019t seen as vulnerable. We hadn\u2019t been invited to the happy hours or chats or email threads where such information is presumably shared. The list was F.T.B.T. \u2014 for them, by them \u2014 meaning, by white women about their experiences with the white men who made up a majority of the names on it. Despite my working in New York media for 10 years, it was my first \u201cwhisper\u201d of any kind, a realization that felt almost as hurtful as reading the acts described on the list itself.As a young business reporter, no one told me about the New York investor known for luring women out to meals under the guise of work. I found out the hard way. I realized he was a habitual boundary-crosser only after The New York Observer reported on him in 2010. Most recently, after I complained in a media chat room about a man who harassed a friend at a birthday party, everyone chimed in to say that he was a known creep. I was infuriated. That information never made its way to me, and worse, it was taken as a given. Was keeping that secret hidden worth the trauma it caused my friend?The list\u2019s flaws were immediately apparent. It felt too public, volatile and vulnerable to manipulation. But its recklessness was born out of desperation. It detonated the power and labor dynamics that whisper networks reinforce. Information, once privileged to a select few, became decentralized and accessible to all. And the problem of sexual harassment no longer belonged solely to women to filter and share.Once the list leaked beyond its initial audience and men became aware of it, it was effectively shut down. But who knows what would have happened if it lasted longer? Maybe a better mechanism for warning and reporting harassment could have been finessed; it\u2019s clear we still need one. Even now, amid the torrent of reports of sexual misconduct, women of color are conspicuously absent. It\u2019s still not safe enough for many of us to name our abusers in public.But during the initial hours after the list\u2019s publication, when it still felt secret, for women only, I moved through the world differently. The energy in the air felt charged, like after the siren goes off in the \u201cPurge\u201d movies. A friend compared the feeling to the final scenes of \u201cV for Vendetta.\u201d She liked seeing women as digital vigilantes, knowing that men were scared. I did, too. I wanted every single man put on notice, to know that they, too, were vulnerable because women were talking. Maybe, within that, we glimpsed the possibility of a new world order, like the one Moten and Harney gestured at. The list was not long for this world, but it might have lived long enough to prove its point.By Ruth Franklin\u201cMy natural tendency is to observe, not to ask questions,\u201d I wrote in my journal during the spring of my senior year of high school. I had just started a six-week internship at a local newspaper, and it wasn\u2019t going well. At 16, I knew I wanted to be a writer, and journalism seemed the obvious route. But my natural shyness held me back.One day at the diner where all the reporters hung out, my supervisor introduced me to a colleague. \u201cThis is a famous man,\u201d she said with more than a touch of sarcasm. Thirty-two years old and stocky as a bantam rooster, he had shaggy black hair and intense eyes. I recognized his byline \u2014 he had just published an article about an elderly eccentric that detoured through his own obsessions, from the bluesmen of the Mississippi Delta to the traces of his childhood.We talked about ghosts and the poetry of Octavio Paz. He gave me one of his own short stories to read and seemed to care what I thought. Soon I was accompanying him around town in his cluttered hatchback on the hunt for local characters. I thought I had finally found a model to emulate. \u201cMaybe I have reporter potential after all,\u201d I wrote.On those car rides, we talked about writing but also about our personal lives. I was an alienated teenager, feverish to graduate and leave my family behind. He was divorced with young kids and working hard to support them. Sometimes when we were sitting next to each other, he pressed his arm against mine. On a picnic in a city park where more than a few passers-by recognized him, he confessed that he was infatuated with me. All that restrained him, he said, was my age. His sexual energy was palpable and a little bit terrifying. I wasn\u2019t attracted to him physically, and I told him so. But I was entranced by his independent-mindedness, his nostalgic longing for an earlier age, even his affectations. More than that, he seemed to believe in my potential as a writer.He often recommended books and movies, but one in particular sticks with me: \u201cManhattan,\u201d perhaps the most notorious depiction of one of Woody Allen\u2019s favorite paradigms, the pairing of an older man and a much younger woman. The parallels between our situation and this fable of romance between a divorced writer (Isaac) and a high school student (Tracy) couldn\u2019t have been more obvious. But I was struck by the movie\u2019s falseness. The script requires Tracy to be the ardent one, continually pressing Isaac for a commitment he won\u2019t offer. (Indeed, midway through the film he dumps her, to his later regret, for a journalist closer to his age.) Yet Mariel Hemingway portrays Tracy as perfectly blank, her moonlike face virtually without expression, even in the most emotional scenes. The film is only about Isaac: his needs and desires. If Tracy is entertaining questions or doubts beneath the surface, we\u2019re not privy to them.At the time, I would have sworn that what was happening between me and this reporter was consensual. Now, more than 25 years later, I understand more clearly how incompletely the idea of consent conveys the complexity of such a dynamic. Yes, I flirted with him and enjoyed the power of knowing that he desired me. But in the end I needed him more than he needed me, because he offered something I wasn\u2019t finding elsewhere. For a brief period, he gave me confidence. As his behavior became more aggressive \u2014 putting his hand on my leg, asking to kiss me \u2014 I started to pull away. He reacted with anger and petulance, and things between us curdled. A few years later, he depicted me in a story published in a popular anthology as a spoiled, haughty Jewish-American princess who is the subject of crude sexual fantasies.The stories we tell ourselves aren\u2019t just entertainment; books and movies \u2014 still more often by men \u2014 work to establish archetypes for romantic relationships. They constitute our personal and cultural mythology and are essential to the way we understand our world. A man whose interest is piqued by a 16-year-old girl has a ready-made formula for how that relationship might proceed. The very fact that such a model exists offers tacit permission for him to treat his wants as valid. For the girl who tries to enter the story on her own terms, there are two models: the receptive vessel or the Lolita-like temptress. Ambivalence and fear simply don\u2019t enter into it.I\u2019m now more than 10 years older than this man was when we met. I\u2019ve worked in journalism for close to two decades. But I spent the early years of my career anxious, questioning, in search of a validation that I couldn\u2019t define. That wasn\u2019t only his fault \u2014 I was primed to respond to him the way I did by things that happened long before he came around. Still, the power imbalance in our relationship led me, however unconsciously, to continue seeking legitimation in a man\u2019s eyes. I don\u2019t regret those afternoons driving around town, listening to him ask questions, watching him take notes: They\u2019re part of my story as a writer. But I wish that he, as the adult in the room, had looked past his emotions to consider what would have been best for me, an impressionable teenager who admired him and craved his instruction and his approval, if not his affections. And I wish that my intellectual formation hadn\u2019t had to be so inextricably entwined with a man\u2019s assessment of my value.By Meghan O\u2019RourkeWhen I became sick with a mysterious illness nearly a decade ago, doctors kept telling me nothing was wrong. I lived for years in a fog not only of pain but also of self-doubt, questioning my own perceptions. It is difficult to articulate how distorting this fundamental distrust of your own subjectivity is, how distorting it was to accommodate myself to a hobbled, painful reality. When my illness was finally named by a physician, my world changed: It could be addressed. And just as important, I no longer felt that my grasp on reality was tenuous.The conversations I\u2019ve had with my female friends in the weeks since widespread allegations of sexual abuse and harassment have come out \u2014 by text messages, over drinks, while minding young children toddling in and out of the kitchen \u2014 have circled around a contradiction: We knew, and yet we didn\u2019t know; we were sure, and yet we doubted ourselves. For years, we lived in a climate of uncertainty created by the routine institutional denial that harassment was taking place, actions that went unnamed and dismissed, the scores of \u201copen secrets\u201d in plain sight yet not seen. Then, overnight, it seemed, a shift in our accounting took place. We\u2019d been returned to a shared reality.We think of our perceptions as being uniquely our own \u2014 the very stuff that makes us distinctive individuals. But perception is more dependent on a fine social web of recognition than we like to think. And when it came to sexual harassment, we were, in a sense, all guilty of participating in what social psychologists call the bystander effect, in which people are less likely to offer help to someone in distress if there are other people present, especially if the others are passive. In one striking 1968 study, subjects filled out a questionnaire in a room slowly filling with smoke. When alone, 75 percent of subjects reported smelling smoke. But when \u201ctwo passive confederates\u201d of the experimenters were planted in the room and behaved as if nothing were wrong, only 10 percent of the subjects reported smelling the smoke or left the room. (Shockingly, nine of 10 subjects \u201ckept working on the questionnaire they were given, rubbed their eyes and waved smoke out of their faces,\u201d the Socially Psyched website recounts.)In groups, we watch to see what others do and follow suit. By its nature, sexual harassment depends on a social agreement about where we draw lines and how we interpret injury. It wasn\u2019t until the 1980s that \u201cunwelcome sexual advances\u201d and the creation of a \u201chostile or offensive work environment\u201d came to be considered illegal under the federal protections that derive from Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which legislates against discrimination on the basis of sex, race and religion. \u201cUnwelcome,\u201d \u201chostile\u201d: These adjectives are by definition descriptive \u2014 dependent on a consensus of shared reality, evaluated legally on a case-by-case basis. And a shared reality is, sadly, just what so many of us know that we don\u2019t have, even now. In an encounter between two people, the shadows of subjectivity always determine how the light looks: bright and revealing, or dark and eerie. And when it comes to encounters in the workplace, there are genuine questions of scale, lines in the sand to draw \u2014 what is just a clumsy pass? What is actual harassment?This moment of reckoning has helped women who have been victimized \u2014 even in subtle ways \u2014 name what had been happening to them; at the same time, it has made the most culpable bystanders feel less certain \u2014 a productive redistribution of uncertainty, possibly. Many people, especially men, are asking themselves if they are complicit in what has been taking place and examining their own past behavior to see whether they have ever made a woman uncomfortable. There are, after all, two kinds of uncertainty: the self-doubt created by withheld truths and the self-doubt created by a genuine need to re-evaluate. It may not be such a bad thing if more men walk through the world feeling that they don\u2019t have all the answers.As told to Kathy Dobie by a Police DetectiveIn the 20-plus years I\u2019ve been on the job, our department has truly changed. When I first came on the job, it was awful. In the \u201980s and early \u201990s, the male police force really did not want women there; women were \u201cruining the L.A.P.D.\u201d That sentiment was very strong. And if I had made a formal complaint, I would have been called your typical woman, you can\u2019t trust her, she\u2019s gonna roll on you, and then nobody wants to work with you, and it\u2019s just the kiss of death.There\u2019s definitely a cultural shift that makes the men hired today who are in their 20s quite different. At the patrol level, I think guys and gals get along just fine. The biggest issue we have in terms of sexual harassment is that even though there are procedures for reporting, nobody really wants to do anything. Supervisors, the ombuds office, everyone just wants it to go away. \u201cWell, you know, he didn\u2019t mean anything by it; let\u2019s just move on.\u201d So things fester and then blow up. I\u2019ve seen it over and over again. If you look at the lawsuits against the L.A.P.D., I think half the complaints are internal, not some outside person who got roughed up by the police. So they\u2019ve been trying to teach us to report anything we see. The problem is nobody wants to be a rat.I actually think the higher you rise among the ranks, the more likely you are to encounter harassment, because coveted positions are at play. If you look at our top-cop management, it\u2019s still very male, and those guys have been around for a couple of decades. They came on in the \u201970s or early \u201980s, so they\u2019re still carrying those attitudes. I\u2019ll give you an example: There was a captain who got a woman promoted from Detective II to Detective III \u2014 a very coveted position. It was discovered through an internal-affairs investigation that she had performed sexual acts on him. That, to me, smells a lot like Hollywood: Hey, if you really want this part, you do certain things to me, and I can make it happen. Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Roy Moore or a captain at the L.A.P.D. \u2014 what do they all have in common? They have the ability to make or break lives. They hold the key to things that other people want, so I think that\u2019s the common denominator; the psychology of that man is the same.By Zoe HellerI\u2019m disappointed that the story has remained focused so squarely on the villainous doings of the metropolitan elites. I was never under any illusion that this was the beginning of the end of the patriarchy, but I had hopes that there would be more of a ripple effect, that we would begin hearing about sexual harassment and abuse in the farm industry, in fast food, in retail, in hotel housekeeping. It\u2019s delightful that the chickens are coming home to roost for powerful old guys in the entertainment industry, and yet for large sections of the country, I suspect, the toppling of Harvey Weinstein and others has played less as a \u201cMatrix moment\u201d \u2014 a sudden unmasking of the country\u2019s sexist power structures \u2014 than as an old-fashioned morality tale about debauched big-city snoots finally getting their comeuppance.An argument that has kept cropping up in recent weeks, one that will be familiar to those who have followed the debates about campus rape, is that even in the absence of force or explicit threat, the suggestive comments or sexual advances of a male colleague are implicitly coercive. A woman\u2019s ability to register her opprobrium, or to say \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d is always compromised by her fear of repercussions, or by her youth, or simply by her female impulse to placate. The danger with this a priori assumption of women\u2019s diminished agency is that it ends up exaggerating female vulnerability. It casts women as fundamentally fragile beings, whose sexual assent, like that of minors, cannot be trusted to indicate true consent. It presents female passivity as natural. There\u2019s no doubt that women, particularly younger ones, have a tendency to go along with things they don\u2019t want to \u2014 to say yes when they really mean no \u2014 but that propitiatory tendency is not some incorrigible feature of the female character, any more than predation is the incorrigible inclination of men. And we do women a disservice by treating it as if it is. This is not about blaming the victim; it\u2019s about pointing out to the potential victim that she has more power than she knows.Several times in recent weeks, I\u2019ve read and heard people asserting that older women like me, women who came of age before the Anita Hill hearings in 1991, are generally more accepting of sexual harassment and less sympathetic to women who complain about it. (This, it\u2019s claimed, is because we grew up with lower expectations of male behavior and feel that the young should endure as stoically as we did.) I would characterize the generational divide differently. I think older women are, by and large, more reluctant to squander women\u2019s hard-won right to sexual autonomy by characterizing themselves as helpless and in need of special protection. I think they are more likely to see \u201cpower dynamics\u201d between individuals as complicated, fluid and not necessarily reducible to age and status differentials. I think they are also \u2014 although this is less a generational difference than a function of age \u2014 much better at telling men where to get off.By Vivian GornickFor many of us, it is dismaying to behold, in a movement meant to correct for social injustice, the development of what can seem like vigilante politics; the dismay, in fact, is being accorded disproportionate attention, as though its existence is more important than what gave rise to it. But if we stop for a moment to think rather than react, we soon come to realize that the courageous demand that begins with a visionary\u2019s declaration of rights can, and usually does, descend quickly into the maddened belligerence characteristic of those who cannot stop rehearsing a grievance that feels very old and reaches far into the past. That is the course history has usually taken, and for the moment, we in America are all trapped in its turmoil.My generation of second-wave feminists discovered how hard it is to build a case for women\u2019s rights from the inside out, how few approached with a wholeness of mind and heart the prospect of equality for women. Those of us in the 1970s and \u201980s who said (and kept on saying) that the subordination of women had now become intolerable were often denounced as witches, bitches and worse: denatured fanatics staring into a vision of the future that would upend the world as we knew it. Our radicalism lay in declaring the risk well worth taking: a calculation society as a whole is never willing to act on; it must be driven to it. But we feminists were persuaded that the American democracy was not only healthy enough but also mature enough to give up the idea that men by nature take their brains seriously and women by nature do not. We were convinced that what today we saw by the hundreds would tomorrow surely be seen by the thousands, and the day after that by the millions. Only people of serious ill will or intellectual deficiency or downright political greed would oppose the obvious. And after all, how many of them could there be?The silence imposed by that invisibility! For better or worse, only liberationist politics \u2014 loud, brash and bullying as it sometimes seems \u2014 has ever broken it. The pity of it all is that the silence returns as the inequities once again get swept under the rug, where they fester, and wait for the next moment when the rug will turn into a rock under which these wormlike suppressions have morphed into snakes that come out hissing, should the rock be turned over.As told to Yamiche Alcindor by a Capitol Hill AideI think women on Capitol Hill right now are just kind of breathing a sigh of relief that people finally can talk about these things and not have to suffer when they come forward. A lot of people are saying, \u201cI wonder who\u2019s going to be next,\u201d because everyone knows that this is just the beginning. We really feel as if a purge is coming. I don\u2019t think that a lot of people necessarily know who, but as soon as a name comes out, then you start to hear people saying, like: \u201cOh, yeah. I heard that guy was creepy.\u201dThey asked me to pitch in and just talk to survivors who call Representative Jackie Speier\u2019s office. It\u2019s such a gut punch when you hear the name of the member of Congress who harassed them. Al Franken was hard. It hurts the most when it\u2019s men who have built their political careers advocating for women and then show such disdain for actual female human beings. I think it also just really shows how important it is to have women elected to office, promoting more women to senior staff and having more women involved in Capitol Hill positions and in the political process.By Jazmine Hughes and Collier MeyersonI\u2019ve also had long talks with friends who have been named; they\u2019re promising but depressing. They admit to rehabilitation, but also to guilt. They\u2019ve changed, but they had to have something to \u201cchange\u201d away from. Everyone\u2019s trying to get better \u2014 but what does better look like? How do we measure penance?Would I invite \u201cthat person\u201d to a party? If I have an investment in the man, I\u2019d go to my community and speak with them about what they\u2019re comfortable with.This email exchange has been edited and condensed.By Parul SehgalWhen I was a child, I lived near a notorious landfill called Smokey Mountain. It jutted out of the heart of Manila \u2014 a ziggurat of decomposing plastic bags, high as a 10-story building. Squatters made their homes on its slopes and perished in the frequent fires. From time to time, I recall the city promising to raze it and put in proper housing but never making good. Smokey Mountain flourished for years.It was my early object lesson in selective blindness. You can ignore anything if you put your mind to it, apparently \u2014 even two million metric tons of smoldering trash. Anywhere you look, there\u2019s a Smokey Mountain of a kind, a site of shame or suffering that we refuse to reckon with \u2014 even as it bursts into flames.The recent statements from men accused of sexual harassment are among the stranger documents of shame I have encountered: putative apologies garlanded with self-congratulation, bristling with rage. Some sound like grotesque inversions of award-acceptance speeches, dutifully acknowledging family and friends, casts, crews, networks and agents. Others attempt clumsy deflection. Kevin Spacey, accused of assaulting numerous young men, takes the opportunity to come out of the closet and, horrifyingly, equates his alleged crimes with being gay. Louis C.K. repeatedly mentions how much his victims admired him in his open letter \u2014 and invokes his penis so insistently that it feels as if he\u2019s covertly indulging his exhibitionism all over again. Jeffrey Tambor responds to charges of sexual harassment and aggression on the set of \u201cTransparent\u201d with further aggression. Many claim that the behavior is in the past and seem irritated to have to answer for it. After all, as Mark Halperin protests, he\u2019s mostly cured now.These statements of the men seem especially shabby when compared with the majestic testimonies of the women who have come forward. In their interviews, essays and op-eds, they relive moments of terror and humiliation and shame, even as they are forced to establish their credibility and, in some cases, account for their silence over the years. Intense introspection marks these statements. The women audit themselves to a fault and reckon painfully with what speaking out might cost them. In a column in The Hollywood Reporter, the screenwriter Jenny Lumet described being sexually assaulted by Russell Simmons \u2014 and her fear of going public now: \u201cI have built a life in the past 25 years and a reputation in my industry. I need no one to have this visualization of me. I will, like the others, lose work because of this.\u201d She wrestles with guilt \u2014 \u201cAs a woman of color, I cannot express how wrenching it is to write this about a successful man of color\u201d \u2014 and worries about the effect of this story on his children. It\u2019s an extraordinary piece of writing. In response, Simmons offered little more than a limp admission of his thoughtlessness before turning to his real task: buoying up his shareholders.But in this way these statements \u2014 even when garbled, terse or self-serving \u2014 are revealing. You can glimpse how the men have learned to live with \u2014 and avert their eyes from \u2014 their own cruelty. You can see how they continue to insulate themselves from fully understanding the suffering they have caused. How much easier it is to cop to \u201cthoughtlessness\u201d or \u201cinsensitivity\u201d (another favorite word of the accused) \u2014 to hurting someone\u2019s feelings, essentially \u2014 than to acknowledge the realities women enumerate: panic, revulsion, rage, depression, decades of lost work. There\u2019s a profound dissonance between the gravity of the events the women describe and the men\u2019s mild interpretations.Odysseus, of course, finds his way home. Which is what many of the women coming forward fear. \u201cThere seems to be a formula for redemption: Apologize, put your head down, remove yourself from the public eye, come back up after enough time has passed, align yourself with the people that you\u2019ve wronged and then resume your place back in line exactly where you were kicked out,\u201d the actress Olivia Munn, one of at least six women who have accused Brett Ratner of sexual misconduct, told The Los Angeles Times. The public censure, the shows being canceled, the outrage, she says, is just pruning; \u201cthe disease still remains in the tree.\u201dSmokey Mountain was eventually shut down in 1995. It\u2019s still inhabited, but more sparsely. You can take tours now and imagine it in its heyday. A few miles away, a new dump thrives. It\u2019s twice the size.As told to Kathy Dobie by a BartenderI\u2019m 32, and I\u2019ve been a bartender for 10 years, five in New York City. There\u2019s always been a sort of warning system that bartenders have for everything from people who drink too much to sexual predators. Even in a city as big as New York, everyone in the industry knows one another. Bartenders and waiters take care of people \u2014 that\u2019s our job. So it\u2019s important that we take care of one another.When I was 21, at my first official bartending job, the owner had already been sued for sexual harassment, I heard. One night, I went into his office to take him the money from the register, and he patted my butt on my way out. I immediately put on a stern face and said, \u201cNo!\u201d as if he were a dog. From that day forward, he never tried anything like that. My experience in the industry has been that if you assert yourself and make your boundaries clear, they will be respected. It\u2019s actually a largely liberal industry, and that sense of community, of fairness, of gender equality, I think it\u2019s felt a little more strongly in this industry than others, because more often than not you work as a team, men and women together. I felt that if somebody were to act inappropriately toward me, I could immediately go to a co-worker, a co-owner, and it would shame them. My industry\u2019s not like the entertainment industry. There\u2019s only so many big-time producers, but there are enough bars and restaurants in the world to employ everyone. I know people are not always as fortunate as I am. I\u2019ve never been in a position where if I were to quit on the spot, I would go hungry the next day, or worked in a small town where there\u2019s nowhere else to go. I don\u2019t have to pick from the bottom of the barrel. But there\u2019s a lot of bottom of the barrel out there.By Laura KipnisWhen Henry Kissinger famously said that power is the ultimate aphrodisiac, what he actually meant, I think, is that power makes an unattractive man more alluring. Attractive men don\u2019t need aphrodisiacs: Physical attractiveness is its own aphrodisiac. In Kissinger\u2019s formulation, power is a fungible currency \u2014 interchangeable with beauty, and sufficient quantities of it offset shortfalls in physical appeal.The question is whether Kissinger\u2019s premise has reached its expiration date.Or that\u2019s what I found myself wondering following the first round of sexual-harassment revelations, as conversations with friends inevitably turned, often with dark hilarity, to the physical hideousness of so many of the accused men. Of course, the hilarity was tinged with a bit of guilt, voices were lowered \u2014 because we weren\u2019t in high school, right? Having been subject to the brutality of appearance rankings ourselves, we should refrain from imposing them on others, right? Still, surveying the photo arrays of the accused, you suspected that these were not the sought-after guys in high school. Now, old and smug, bloated with power and fine cuisine, their physical unloveliness gave the unfolding story a pleasing Grimm-like quality: They\u2019d acted monstrously, and they looked the part.As friends shared their own episodes of harassment and gross come-ones, I noticed a theme emerging, something I hadn\u2019t considered. Being hit on by someone you judged unattractive was regarded as more insulting than being encroached on by someone decent-looking. A friend who\u2019d had to physically fight off a drunken but not uncomely movie star with whom she\u2019d shared a limo described the ordeal with amused outrage, but a mild overture from an aging, balding editor who looked like a potato in horn rims (her description) left her fuming. It was a sudden glimpse into a complicated set of internal sociosexual calculations that I suspect we all perform. Clearly it\u2019s the harassing behavior itself that\u2019s wrong, but being harassed by someone from a different attractiveness echelon compounds the affront. Perhaps it risks lowering you in your own esteem \u2014 does he think he\u2019s in my league? \u2014 yet you feel guilty for making such reckonings.Everyone knows the principle of \u201cassortative mating,\u201d even those who aren\u2019t familiar with the phrase. It refers to the tendency to pick mates who are similar to ourselves in characteristics like class and education, and also, of course, attractiveness. There\u2019s nothing random about such choices, and obviously I\u2019m saying nothing a user of Tinder or Grindr would find surprising. The more attractive you are \u2014 or perceive yourself to be \u2014 the more attractive you want your mate to be, other things being equal.But other things aren\u2019t always equal: power and money allow people \u2014 male people, mostly \u2014 to jump the queue, so to speak. At least that rogues\u2019 gallery of unattractive harassers suggests this has been the operative fantasy. In the worst cases, it\u2019s a fantasy that power overrides consent, in the way that handsomeness or charisma wins female favor, \u201csweeps a girl off her feet.\u201d Like how being a rock star must feel \u2014 and were the harassing men rock stars in their imaginations, I wondered? \u201cHe\u2019s a rock star,\u201d people now say fawningly about every C.E.O. with a good fourth quarter. Do some of them start to believe it, misidentifying every woman they meet as a compliant groupie?When I decided to crowdsource the attractiveness question on Facebook, my female friends were eager to weigh in. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for female humans to express their distaste for such male flesh,\u201d one wrote. \u201cMen like these have long lived with the assumption their flesh is tolerable, and some may believe it\u2019s desirable.\u201d Someone who knew one of the accused harassers long ago recalled him as exceedingly brilliant but exceedingly homely; bent on seducing women to get back at the girls who ignored him in his youth. For the women, talking about male appearance leveled the playing field; letting men experience the same kind of vulnerability women have long endured felt like a small victory.Many of my male friends, however, were bristling, especially male progressives. They never thought about women in terms of appearance, more than a few said righteously. I was accused of body shaming, as well as superficiality, to which I retorted, summoning my inner Oscar Wilde, \u201cNothing is less superficial than appearance.\u201dHere\u2019s something else I found curious, but no one was exactly saying: there were not a lot of good-looking men among the accused harassers. Do those guys refrain from harassing women, or is it that they\u2019re less likely to get reported? Apparently men themselves believe it\u2019s the latter. A male Facebook friend directed me to an old \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch titled \u201cSexual Harassment and You.\u201d Shot in black and white, in the style of a 1950s educational film, it depicts two different men, one an ungainly dork (Fred Armisen), and the other a handsome stud (Tom Brady), coming on to two female co-workers. The dork is threatened with harassment charges; the stud gets dates and phone numbers. I noted that the writer and director were both male.\u201cMale power\u201d has acquired a sleazier connotation than in Kissinger\u2019s heyday. If some men have operated on the principle that women\u2019s bodies were there for the plucking, regardless of niceties like consent, at least they\u2019ve been getting away with it somewhat less lately. Which is not to say there isn\u2019t still plenty of transactional sex and mating; plenty of \u201carm candy\u201d at the side of powerful unsightly men. It\u2019s not as though women haven\u2019t been complicit in propping up these arrangements. Let\u2019s be honest: We, too, have been known to leverage what we have, where we can. The question, obviously, is whether female versions of power would be less sleazy than male versions have been, especially because we keep hearing that the solution to the sexual-harassment problem is to put more women in positions of power. But even if men act out sexually more than women typically have, do we gain anything by playing the women-as-men\u2019s-betters card? Moral smugness isn\u2019t a great look, either. According to my informants, attractiveness matters plenty to women; we do our share of ranking and assessing, inequitable as that may be. The point is not assuming that your attractions are reciprocated. And that whatever obliviousness certain guys have displayed on that front ends \u2014 right around now.As told to Jaime Lowe by a SoldierI was a service member in the Army for nearly a decade. It seemed that men pulling women on top of their laps was not uncommon. It happened to me only when I was off duty, but always by my superiors. I lost count of how many times my ass was slapped or I was brushed up against. Stuff like that became so exhausting and conflicting. Conflicting because a lot of the time it was with guys I trusted and worked really well with.In the winter of 2011, my unit was in Kuwait. One time during a break, I went behind a shipping container to smoke a cigarette, and I was chatting with a sergeant from our company. About a month later, I was talking to an acquaintance who worked with this sergeant, and he just started joking about the time I gave the sergeant a blowjob behind the shipping container. I found out that the sergeant had been spreading rumors about very specific sexual acts that I had supposedly performed on him and others in the company. It was mortifying, and everyone seemed to know.I decided to make an informal complaint about it, and then I felt ostracized by members of my unit. It felt as if the unit was trying to protect this guy and not me. I was questioned, and some of the queries focused on the fact that I was always seen with men or that I encouraged a certain culture. Basically, I was being accused of asking for it because I told a dirty joke every now and again. I could tell what was happening, so I ultimately filed a formal complaint. That was extremely nerve-racking. It meant I was under an even bigger microscope. There were those who wanted to send me back home or to another base or to another unit altogether. They were just going to leave him there and uproot me. Remove the victim from the situation instead of the person causing the problem. There\u2019s a good-old-boy network.People in power are willing to ignore bad behavior because it\u2019s convenient or because outstanding performers in the unit are being protected. These guys are wonderful at their jobs, but some can be monsters behind closed doors.By Heidi JulavitsIn mid-November, my daughter began to notice the men. She had heard the reports about Harvey and Louis and Kevin and Al, and now she had a question. \u201cWhy have no women been accused of sexual misconduct?\u201d she asked.I was on autopilot and responded from an unthinking place: \u201cThese abuses are often a function of a power inequity, and many more men are in positions of power than women.\u201dWas my response an explanation? A justification? A brushoff? Did it imply an essentialist reading of gender? Was it, at a bare minimum, useful? At 13, my daughter will have her first job next summer. Substantive engagement with a soon-to-be underling about the dynamics of workplace power abuse seemed fairly critical.Around this time, I started to mishear the news. Sound waves entered my inner ear; men became women. I misheard, \u201c[Name of famous female writer that sounds like Roy Moore], Alabama\u2019s Republican candidate for the Senate, is alleged to have made sexual advances toward a woman who was 14 years old at the time.\u201d I heard, \u201c[Name of famous female writer that sounds like Roy Moore] forcibly kissed her when she was a high school student.\u201d In the absence of anything to laugh about, this misheard news made me giddy. Why? Women commit such abuses; it\u2019s no joke whatsoever. Maybe my brain wanted to hear fake news to complicate a secret message that I could not help worrying other people might be hearing and believing: Men abuse power, and women do not. Men have overbearing sex drives they cannot control, and women do not.Such thinking quickly lends itself to other \u201cthinking,\u201d like the thinking displayed by James Damore, the writer of the \u201cGoogle Employee Memo.\u201d Among his messages: The reason so few women work in tech is because women are biologically different from men, and we need to accept that women are gregarious (rather than assertive); women prefer aesthetics to ideas; women seek a work-life balance rather than professional status. The sum being: Women will never be as good as men at, for example, coding.I am not delivering such messages \u2014 at least not intentionally. But I recalled what I heard when I was a girl, when my mother and her friends actively fought for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. I understood \u201cequal rights for women\u201d to mean that women, historically, were not allowed to do what men were allowed to do and that women should be allowed to do all those things. I did not find this message controversial.But combined with the response I gave to my daughter, and the recent habits of my inner ear, I sensed another potential perversion of meaning. Men and women were equal. Men were not hornier than women or slimier than women. I might have been reassuring my daughter that when she assumed a position of power, she would be able to balance the scales; she and her female friends could sexually abuse powerless people, of any gender, with unrepentant (until caught) vigor.I decided to ask my daughter why she thought men were disproportionately guilty of sexual harassment in the workplace. She wondered if the preponderance of men in the news might be connected to the fact that, she had heard or read somewhere, a majority of all murders were committed by men. Then she paused. She thought about what her \u201cthinking\u201d implied. \u201cTo say that is a stereotype,\u201d she said. \u201cThat women don\u2019t murder or rape or harass, and men do. Because really no one should do any of those things.\u201dRight. No one should do any of those things. Somewhere along the way, baked into the acceptable standards of behavior for people in power, is a thing that nobody should do. And yet it became an entitlement. My daughter and I talked about power; was power to blame? Was power an unavoidably corrupting force? But to claim that power always corrupts risked excusing the individual offenders.We finally settled on one useful point for future thinking and action: For the first time during my lifetime, and also by implication, during hers, victims were proving more powerful than the power that created them. The next step would seem to involve the nonvictims in the redefinition of how power works. Because in the current system, it could be argued that there are three types of people: people in power, victims and nonvictims. Recently, I witnessed a nonvictim learn about the decades of power abuses perpetrated by a friend and colleague. \u201cI just wonder if I\u2019ve been complicit,\u201d the nonvictim worried. To which I wanted to reply: There can be nonvictims only so long as there are victims. If you do not call out your friend\u2019s behavior, then yes, you can count yourself complicit.On Thanksgiving, my family played a game of charades. Many people were involved, ages ranging from 8 to 85. I asked my son, who is 8, to contribute a clue. He gave me \u201csexual harassment.\u201d I asked him if he knew what it was. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s when you touch somebody, and they don\u2019t want you to touch them.\u201d Good enough. I put \u201csexual harassment\u201d in the salad bowl; I felt it had earned its cultural place alongside \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d and \u201cKim Kardashian.\u201d Maybe, too, I considered it a bit of an experiment. Who would pull the clue? Would a man\u2019s performance of \u201csexual harassment\u201d be more easily identifiable to the group over a woman\u2019s? Maybe it mattered only that the action be legible to all genders, no matter the body performing it.The person who pulled the clue was a man in his 60s. He approached the other team. He waggled his tongue; he exaggeratedly pretended to grab the bodies of the opposition in all the appropriately inappropriate places. Everyone knew immediately what he was doing. Men and women, girls and boys, all called out his actions, correctly, by name.Emily Bazelon moderates a round table with Anita Hill, Laura Kipnis, Lynn Povich, Soledad O\u2019Brien, Amanda Hess and Danyel Smith to talk about how \u2014 or if \u2014 real change is possible.By THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINEDec. 12, 2017Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Your Mother\u2019s Maiden Name Is Not a Secret", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionResolutions to shake laziness, get organized and gain control of finances are ritually adopted each January and abandoned soon after. But there\u2019s one common bad habit that consumers and billion-dollar businesses alike should have quit long ago and can\u2019t afford to carry into 2018: the use of weak website security questions.Security questions are astonishingly insecure: The answers to many of them are easily researched or guessed, yet they can be the sole barrier to someone gaining access to your account. The cryptology and security expert Bruce Schneier once described them as an \u201ceasier-to-guess low-security backup password that sites want you to have in case you forget your harder-to-remember higher-security password.\u201dStill, this technology has persisted despite the availability of two-factor authentication, and on sites that we use frequently and that contain important, sensitive data \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, eBay, PayPal and many banks and airlines.There has been no shortage of incidents demonstrating these questions\u2019 vulnerabilities. In 2005, Paris Hilton\u2019s T-Mobile account was hacked by a teenager who, like anyone who searched \u201cParis Hilton Chihuahua\u201d on the internet, knew the answer to \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite pet\u2019s name?\u201d In 2008, Sarah Palin\u2019s Yahoo account was hacked by a college student who reset her password using her birth date, ZIP code and the place where she met her spouse. In 2014, after nude photos of several Hollywood actresses were leaked, Apple reported that their iCloud accounts had been hacked through \u201ca very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions.\u201dIf you aren\u2019t famous enough to be a target, you may still be a victim of a mass data breach. Whereas passwords are usually stored in hashed or encrypted form, answers to security questions are often stored \u2014 and therefore stolen \u2014 in plain text, as users entered them. This was the case in the 2015 breach of the extramarital encounters site Ashley Madison, which affected 32 million users, and in some of the Yahoo breaches, disclosed over the past year and a half, which affected all of its three billion accounts.The Equifax breach this year may have revealed some users\u2019 security questions and answers outright, and it certainly gave thieves enough personal information to answer common questions. TransUnion evidently did not heed this warning: Users wishing to freeze their credit files in the wake of the Equifax breach have to create an account, and to do so they must choose a security question, such as \u201cWhat city were you born in?\u201dAccording to Troy Hunt, a cybersecurity expert, organizations continue to use security questions because they are easy to set up technically, and easy for users. \u201cIf you ask someone their favorite color, that\u2019s not a drama,\u201d Mr. Hunt said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to give you a straight answer. If you say, \u2018Hey, please download this authenticator app and point the camera at a QR code on the screen,\u2019 you\u2019re starting to lose people.\u201d Some organizations have made a risk-based decision to retain this relatively weak security measure, often letting users opt for it over two-factor authentication, in the interest of getting people signed up.Security questions ask for something you know about yourself, and to be even moderately secure, they should ask for something only you know. It\u2019s exceedingly difficult to design questions that do this. Many security questions ask for biographical information that is publicly available, whether in open records or via social media: where you were married, your first phone number, your paternal grandfather\u2019s middle name.Aside from these questions\u2019 vulnerability to a little research (to say nothing of nosy parents or malicious exes), none of them are relevant to all adults. How many of us can answer the premillennial \u201cWhat city were you in to celebrate the year 2000?\u201d or \u201cWhat year did you take out your first mortgage?\u201d And how many Indian- or Brazilian-born users went to a high school without a mascot, or grew up on a street with no name? How many of our mothers never changed their names?The other main type of security question asks for a subjective answer. Such questions imagine lives punctuated by distinct firsts and bests and filled with enduring favorites, but favorites and bests and even firsts can change when people maintain accounts for decades. At some point, both factual and subjective security questions become archaeological. \u201cIn what month did you meet your significant other?\u201d requires a framing question: Whom were you with when you set up this account?A 2015 study by Google engineers found that only 47 percent of people could remember what they put down as their favorite food a year earlier \u2014 and that hackers were able to guess the food nearly 20 percent of the time, with Americans\u2019 most common answer being pizza. (Google has been phasing out security questions in recent years.) Even when people remember their answers, they sometimes forget their precise form. This hazard has prompted some websites to offer a fixed set of answers. To \u201cWhat is your favorite type of reading?\u201d United Airlines offers a pull-down menu with 19 options, including blogs, cookbooks, professional development and self-help, but nothing like literary fiction (the death of the novel?).As long as security questions are going to be used, professional consensus holds, they should have many possible answers, and each of those possible answers should be simple, stable, memorable and not easily researched or guessed. But questions that are sufficiently general to apply to most people almost never fulfill these requirements: \u201cWhat is your favorite season?\u201d \u201cWhat is your favorite fabric?\u201d \u201cWho is your favorite person in history?\u201dEven exceptions that look good at first fall short. \u201cWhat is the last name of the teacher who gave you your first failing grade?\u201d includes an assumption about academic records; strangely, it appears on the LSAT registration website, whose users\u2019 transcripts are likely to be too unblemished to furnish an answer. \u201cWhat was the name of the boy/girl you had your second kiss with?\u201d is impossible in its Proustian hyperspecificity. Then there\u2019s the State Bank of India\u2019s vertiginous \u201cWhat is the website that you rarely visit?\u201d which reads like a Zen koan whose purpose is to make you reflect on the unknowability of the answer.What would a truly powerful security question be? The ideal is a science-fiction scenario where your future self calls your past self, and your past self asks your future self to prove it\u2019s you. When given the chance to write their own questions, though, most people choose not an intimate secret but something more like \u201c1+1=?\u201dThe temporary solution, Mr. Hunt says, is to create false answers and to keep them somewhere safe, whether in a password manager (which can generate and store a random string for each answer field) or even on a piece of paper. Security questions pit \u201cusability against security,\u201d said Mr. Schneier, the cryptology and security expert, and the former usually wins.Security questions are premised on a paradox: Our experiences are at once universal and particular to us. Yet it seems we are all lazy in exactly the same way.Anne Diebel is a senior investigator at the private investigations firm QRI.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: iNaturalist", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationOne Christmas, when I was about 8, I received a modern bestiary, a large photo-dense encyclopedia of animals. I had loved animals from toddlerhood \u2014 and had begun assembling a small menagerie that would eventually include fish, a rabbit and a fire-bellied toad \u2014 but I was not yet acquainted with the staggering diversity of wildlife around the world. I would cradle that book on my lap for hours at a time, memorizing facts about the planet\u2019s creatures, silently reciting their common and scientific names. Ever since, I have made it a point to learn the names of wildlife I encounter, seeking whatever tools might help me: hefty field guides to mushrooms, pocket-size pamphlets of backyard birds, archives of wildflower photos that let you search by petal color and bloom time.So when I heard reports that a free app called iNaturalist could identify just about any wild animal, plant or mushroom on sight, I immediately downloaded it. iNaturalist is straightforward to use: Take a picture with your smartphone and click \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d A few seconds later, iNaturalist gives you a list of likely species, along with photos and short descriptions. I have tried the app on more than 140 wildflowers, birds, insects and amphibians in Oregon, Washington and California; it correctly identified nearly all of them. (It sometimes has trouble with really large organisms that are difficult to capture in one shot, like trees.)iNaturalist is a novel hybrid of artificial intelligence and ceaseless human curiosity. In 2008, Ken-ichi Ueda and several other students at the University of California, Berkeley, founded iNaturalist as an online community for biologists, citizen scientists and people who simply enjoyed observing wildlife. Members helped one another identify species, eventually amassing a database of more than six million labeled photos. When the iNaturalist app was introduced, it was essentially a mobile version of the website. But it has been updated several times, and the current version employs a neural network trained to recognize species using images from the rich library compiled by human users.This past May, a couple of months before I discovered iNaturalist, my partner, Ryan, and I went hiking with my family in the hills west of San Jose, where clumps of trees and chaparral mottle pillows of golden grass. As we walked, Ryan and I tried to identify what we saw: over there, a cabbage white butterfly; this was definitely some kind of oak; a Western scrub jay \u2014 or was that a Steller\u2019s? Bemused, perhaps slightly annoyed, my father interjected: \u201cWhy is it so important to know the names?\u201dI\u2019ve been mulling over his question. Learning the names of wild things changes the way we look at nature and the way we think about it. Consider bees. Most people know two types: honeybees (the genus Apis) and bumblebees (the genus Bombus). There are in fact thousands of distinct bee species flying around us all the time \u2014 small as gnats or larger than horseflies, fuzzed in hair as orange as Cheddar or armored in metallic green. Some, like the familiar honeybee, are highly social. Many others are solitary. Some construct elaborate hives, while others nest in dry grass, wood or dirt. Most of us are oblivious to this winged panoply, even in our own backyards, because our perception is circumscribed by our ecological illiteracy. Learning the names of our many wild neighbors is an exercise in perspective and empathy, transforming the outdoors from a pastoral backdrop into a world of parallel societies inhabited by diverse creatures, each with its own character and career.More than an identity, a creature\u2019s name is also a password. It gives you access to entire realms of knowledge about the natural world that would otherwise be inaccessible, because you did not know the right phrase when you went knocking. \u201cSmall brown bird\u201d does not have much purchase on Google or in a library, but \u201chouse sparrow\u201d (Passer domesticus) will open every relevant portal. The name of the rose is the key to its whole story, to its evolutionary arc and cultural entanglements, to the names and narratives of its many cousins. One discovery inevitably leads to another.While walking my dog one day, I encountered a field of weeds with flowers like tiny indigo windmills. I had no idea what they were. iNaturalist identified them as common chicory (Chicorium intybus), which I then learned is the wild ancestor of endive and radicchio. Another day, while gardening, I noticed a particularly furry bee. iNaturalist informed me that it was in fact a fly that evolved to mimic bees, part of a much larger family of flies (Bombyliidae) costumed as bees for defense against predators.The bee impostor had been resting on a flower that is abundant in my neighborhood, a lacy white parasol that browns and curls as it ages, forming a woolly bowl resembling a hummingbird\u2019s nest. Before downloading iNaturalist, Google helped me narrow down the flower\u2019s identity: wild carrot (Daucus carota) or poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). The two are often confused. Based on further research, I was pretty sure it was the former; wild carrot has a more compact flower and a fuzzier stem. When iNaturalist concurred, it felt like a nod from an expert. On one walk, Ryan dug a specimen from the ground. We inhaled its noticeable aroma, earthy and mildly sweet. Convinced, Ryan even took a tiny bite of its pale root. \u201cNot bad,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely tastes like carrot.\u201dFerris Jabr is a writer based in Portland, Ore.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bling Bling Had the Rings, the Pilot Her Heart", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsIn the weeks before the wedding of Sarah Ward and Jonathan Rupp in Cumming, Ga., the bride had become concerned about her ring bearer.Onassis had grown long in the tooth at the age of 21 and for a horse that old, the condition is not just an expression. Onassis\u2019 teeth had grown so long that it was hard for him to chew. He\u2019d take a bite of hay and the food would fall right from his mouth. He was the same attractive Dutch Warmblood with a white face and white stockings that had carried Ms. Ward to the top of junior equestrian competitions around the country years ago, but now he was losing weight.Ms. Ward knew that traveling to the ceremony, a destination affair on a quaint renovated former dairy farm, would be hard on Onassis. Still, she hoped that he, one of the few who had been with her through the events of her life that had led to this day, would be at her wedding.As some personal lives are measured in past relationships and former beaus, Ms. Ward\u2019s life could be measured in horses.There was the horse she rode when she was 4, the one she had to stop riding because of a compulsive need to wash her hands. (She has since been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder and has it mostly under control these days.) Next was Happy, the horse her father, Bob Ward, bought her just before her 13th birthday. Happy was the one that she fell in love with, and who made her fall in love with riding \u2014 the rituals of bridling and saddling, the thrill of galloping and jumping. He was unpredictable and difficult, however, and once threw her late mother, Diane Ward, so hard that it seemed to permanently affect her short-term memory.There were more horses \u2014 Bling, Voltaire, Onassis, Ludwig Storgaard \u2014 and spills leading to a torn anterior cruciate ligament, a neck brace, too many concussions to count. Along with that came more ribbons, more prizes, more rankings. By 2008, when she and Onassis traveled to the Pennsylvania National Horse Show, she finished at the top of her class, taking home grand junior hunter honors.\u201cIt was an incredible experience. I\u2019ve never felt so proud of my horse,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t really remember it because I was concussed, but I\u2019ve seen video. People always focus on football and the concussions suffered there, but it has really affected my memory.\u201dLaseter\u2019s is a casual place in Vinings, Ga. On that night, it was full of regulars, including Mr. Rupp, 34, a commercial charter pilot, and his old friends from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The bar is one of those places you don\u2019t just know everybody\u2019s name and what they like to drink, you know their birthdays and their old stories. You watch their lives unfold. This new woman in her dirty riding gear caught his eye. He was seven years older, wearing a blue, checkered button down and dark jeans, drinking a glass of red wine. They stayed at the bar talking until it closed.\u201cI wasn\u2019t entirely sure if he was just being nice or friendly,\u201d Ms. Ward said. \u201cUntil he, like, tried to lean in to kiss me, but he was too polite to do it. I literally said, \u2018Are you going to do this or what?\u2019 \u201dSo he kissed her. They went out for dinner in the weeks after, walked around Piedmont Park in Atlanta. They met again at Laseter\u2019s, and again. The bar of regulars could not help but notice. Jennifer Crowe, the D.J. in charge of trivia nights, observed the romance from a distance, leaning in to whisper about it with friends.\u201cThis is perfect,\u201d they said.\u201cBut of course,\u201d they said.The next chapter of Ms. Ward and Mr. Rupp\u2019s romance was spurred not by a horse, but an opossum. Two weeks after they had met, one of Ms. Ward\u2019s dogs, a rescued coonhound, killed the marsupial in her backyard and left a mess. It was midnight. She couldn\u2019t bear to clean it up. She texted Mr. Rupp, asked for help, and he was soon there with a headlamp and a shovel, wearing hiking boots.Diane Ward had died from a gunshot wound to the head one night in 2009. On the 911 call the night of the incident and in the years since, Bob Ward has maintained that this was an accident. \u201cI love my dad and support my dad,\u201d Sarah Ward told Mr. Rupp.Mr. Rupp did not respond the way that others had. \u201cHe was patient,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t judge me. He didn\u2019t judge my family, not once, and he let me tell him in my own time, which was very important to me. He\u2019s the only person that\u2019s done that.\u201dIn the following months, they began a mutual tutelage. He brought her to the hangar in the mornings and got her in the cockpit. He explained the flight deck, the instruments, the pitch and bank, the push and pull, the endless buttons and lights and instruments. Once, he took her up and let her take the control column. \u201cI pulled so far back that the plane went,\u201d she said before making the whizzing sound of a nose dive. \u201cI felt like I was going to crash into a bridge.\u201dHe told her about growing up in Minnesota, watching the takeoffs and landings at airports, how he\u2019d always known he\u2019d be pilot, how he went up for his first flight as a teenager, and moved to Florida to attend Embry-Riddle. It wasn\u2019t so different from her experience with horses.\u201cWe balance each other so well,\u201d Ms. Ward said. \u201cHe\u2019s good in crowds, I hate crowds. He didn\u2019t grow up with animals, and he even loves my stupid dogs. We\u2019re never anxious about the same thing at the same time.\u201dShe brought him to the barn and showed him how to bridle and saddle. He took to grooming and riding Moose. He would leave for days to fly and then return to cook dinner at her place. He picked up a recipe for steak and salsa verde. She liked his simple, comforting take on pasta carbonara. Some weekends, he\u2019d drive her down to Florida so she could see her father in prison. Mr. Rupp was such a constant presence that Mallory, who lived with Sarah at the time, did not hint lightly that they needed their own place.As the day of the ceremony approached, it became clear that Onassis would have to sit this one out. Bling Bling, a horse Ms. Ward describes as Onassis\u2019 best friend, stepped in to take his place.A little after 4 in the afternoon, 70 or so guests had arrived at West Milford Farm. The groomsmen waited in charcoal suits, gathered in an old dairy barn converted into a warm, glass greenhouse. The crowd assembled outdoors, filing into folding chairs past a bucket of carrots, treats for the ring bearer. Bling paced nervously, tearing clumps of grass from the turf. Gusts of wind blew in hard and cold from the far green pastures. The ceremony began.Lily Citron, a former riding student of Ms. Ward\u2019s, led the horse down an aisle spread with flower petals. He behaved, kept his head down, and lined up patiently with the groomsmen until he caught sight of the bride in her white Vera Wang dress, her long train following behind her in the flower petals. He neighed and neighed, his high whinny carrying with the wind.At the end, Robert Grant, a Universal Life minister, asked: \u201cDo you, Jonathan, swear to take the reins with Sarah and love her forever and ever?\u201d and \u201cDo you, Sarah, promise to always fasten your seatbelt and love Jonathan forever and ever?\u201d They said, \u201cI do.\u201dMr. Kennedy continued reading: \u201cYou don\u2019t need me giving my permission to marry, although Jonathan being the gentleman that he is did ask me. So dear Sarah, your parents have always respected your decisions, now go forth with your flying groom and God\u2019s blessing with a mandate to love and nurture each other. Your children will learn by example and you will then understand how your mother and I always felt about you and your sister. Signed: A father\u2019s love is unwavering, Dad.\u201dMs. Crowe, the same D.J. who had been there that night at Laseter\u2019s when the couple first met, hurried over to her booth to press play. The bride and groom danced and, as they did, the groom wiped away the bride\u2019s tears.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Top Ideologue Calls for Tight Control of Internet", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWUZHEN, China \u2014 Little heard from but hugely influential, the professor-turned-Communist theoretician who has been a major adviser to three Chinese leaders finally stepped out of the shadows on Sunday.Known as the brain behind President Xi Jinping, Wang Huning made his first major speech since joining the Politburo Standing Committee, the seven-member group that rules China, at a conference created to show off the country\u2019s technological strengths to the world.Well known for his icy remove and support of authoritarianism, Mr. Wang called for security and order on the internet as part of five proposals he made to guide the future of cyberspace. He also emphasized China\u2019s technological prowess, and said more should be done by the government to guide the development of new industries like artificial intelligence and quantum computing.Mr. Wang stepped onto the world stage before an audience that included Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, along with an all-star cast of Chinese tech entrepreneurs, such as Jack Ma of Alibaba.Mr. Wang, 62, had emerged as the ideological counselor to Chinese leaders and the wordsmith of Mr. Xi\u2019s more authoritarian style before being tapped to join the Standing Committee at a Communist Party congress in Beijing two months ago. A close confidant of Mr. Xi and the two previous Chinese presidents, Mr. Wang was promoted despite never having governed a province or run a state ministry.On Sunday, Mr. Wang praised China\u2019s president for his \u201cdeep understanding\u201d of internet governance. He said the international community had \u201cwarmly received\u201d Mr. Xi\u2019s ideas about the internet, including the concept of cybersovereignty \u2014 a Chinese policy term used to argue that countries should be free to control the internet within their borders, even if it means censoring.\u201cGlobal cyberspace governance has no onlookers \u2014 we are all participants,\u201d he said, adding that \u201call parties\u201d should have a say over how the internet is managed across the world.The speech echoed arguments that Mr. Wang has made before. In the 1990s, as a professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, he wrote that because China was so large and poor, it needed a stronger hand from the government to push through economic development. He said that such authoritarian rule was necessary for China to restore its national greatness after what the Communist Party has often described as a century of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers.This has made Mr. Wang a longtime skeptic of calls for China to allow greater democracy despite his extensive experience abroad, including in the United States. And while he has said he admires the strength of the United States, Mr. Wang has also been deeply wary of American power.His speech on Sunday showed how China\u2019s vision of the internet attempts to wrestle with such tension. Chinese leaders have long lauded the economic power of the internet, while being deeply cautious about its democratizing and internationalizing influence.In his speech, Mr. Wang highlighted China\u2019s openness and the need for equal access to the internet. Yet China has led the way in cutting its internet off from the world with filters and blocks known as the Great Firewall of China. It has also blocked internet access in areas where members of minority groups live, to limit the potential for unrest.While many major foreign websites are blocked in China, the wireless connections at the conference allowed open access to the global internet. A promotional video that was shown before Mr. Wang\u2019s speech showed the web connecting China to the world, ignoring the existence of the Great Firewall.For the format of his talk, Mr. Wang followed the lead of Mr. Xi. His offering of five proposals appeared to have been inspired by a speech by Mr. Xi at the second World Internet Conference, when the president offered five ideas for developing the internet.Mr. Lu\u2019s successor, Xu Lin, was present at the conference, which also included more prominent foreign chief executives than in the past, including Sundar Pichai of Google and Mr. Cook of Apple. Analysts say Mr. Xu has been ordered to consolidate the administration\u2019s power, and also turn the conference into a higher-profile event.In his speech, Mr. Cook highlighted Apple\u2019s contribution to China\u2019s economy, saying that Chinese developers have earned more than 112 billion renminbi, or $16.9 billion, by selling apps to Apple users, more than developers from any other country.An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Wang Huning, the Standing Committee member. He is 62, not 63.Carolyn Zhang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Al Franken: From \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 to Congress", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, said on Thursday that he plans to resign \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d amid mounting accusations of sexual harassment against him.Mr. Franken, 66, is from St. Louis Park, Minn. Raised in a middle-class household where education was emphasized, he went on to attend Harvard University. In 1969, he met Franni Bryson, his wife of more than 40 years, at a college mixer.A comedian who spent years at \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Mr. Franken reinvented himself as a politician before being felled by a string of harassment allegations in recent weeks.After college, Mr. Franken and a childhood friend, Tom Davis, moved to Los Angeles to try their hand at stand-up comedy. Soon, they caught the attention of Lorne Michaels, who hired them as two of the first writers for \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which began in 1975.After a hiatus from the show in the early 1980s, Mr. Franken\u2019s star rose in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s with memorable recurring roles, including as the smarmy self-helper Stuart Smalley and as an intrepid journalist known as the one-man mobile-uplink unit.\u201cI\u2019d like to thank Fox\u2019s lawyers for filing one of the stupidest briefs I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d he said at the time.In March 2004, Mr. Franken began hosting the flagship show on the now-defunct liberal talk-radio network \u201cAir America Radio.\u201dOver three hours each day, he would heap scorn and ridicule on Republicans. He mocked Bill O\u2019Reilly \u2014 his radio show was initially called the \u201cThe O\u2019Franken Factor\u201d \u2014 and poked fun at President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Around that time, he had even begun hinting at a Senate run.The Minnesota Supreme Court ended eight months of legal challenges over the results of the November 2008 election and ruled that Mr. Franken had defeated the Republican incumbent, Norm Coleman. Mr. Franken was sworn in a few days later, on July 7.He was re-elected in November 2014.In May that year, Mr. Franken pressed executives from Google and Apple during a congressional panel about location information the companies received from cellphones.Mr. Franken took aim at proposed telecommunications mergers during his time in Congress, relishing his role as a congressional opponent to media conglomeration. He opposed the Comcast-NBC Universal merger, which got federal approval in 2011, and the unsuccessful merger of AT&T and T-Mobile.Mr. Franken, for his part, should have a good sense of Comcast \u2014 he said the company was his provider in both Minnesota and Washington, and added with a laugh: \u201cIt\u2019s great. The service is wonderful.\u201d Moments later, he doubled back to explain his tone. His chuckle, he said, \u201cwas more ironic than sarcastic.\u201d\u201cI would like your views on the relative advantage of doing assessments and using them to measure proficiency or to measure growth,\u201d he asked her.During her response, Mr. Franken cut her off. \u201cIt surprises me that you don\u2019t know this issue,\u201d he replied.By Wednesday, several more women had come forward to accuse Mr. Franken of making unwanted sexual advances.While Mr. Franken had hoped for vindication from a congressional investigation, he said on Thursday that his remaining in the Senate would be a distraction.\u201cThis decision is not about me. It\u2019s about the people of Minnesota,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear that I can\u2019t both pursue the Ethics Committee process and at the same time remain an effective senator for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hidden Player Spurring a Wave of Cheap Consumer Devices: Amazon", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtA few weeks ago, Wyze Labs, a one-year-old start-up in Seattle, sent me its first gadget to try. It\u2019s a small, internet-connected video camera, the kind you might use for security or to keep tabs on your dog or your baby.On the surface, the camera doesn\u2019t sound special. Like home internet cameras made by Nest or Netgear, the Wyze device can monitor an area for motion or sound. When it spots something, it begins recording a short clip that it stores online, for access on your phone or your computer.That future? We\u2019re going to get better products for ludicrously low prices, and big brands across a range of categories \u2014 the Nests and Netgears of the world \u2014 are going to find it harder than ever to get us to shell out big money for their wares.There\u2019s a hidden hero in this story \u2014 or, if you\u2019re a major brand, a shadowy villain. It\u2019s Amazon.To understand Amazon\u2019s role, let\u2019s take a closer look at how Wyze piggybacked off Amazon. Nest\u2019s and Netgear\u2019s comparable indoor cameras sell for around $200 each, while Wyze\u2019s device goes for $20 plus shipping if you buy directly from the company\u2019s website. The only other place to purchase the WyzeCam is on Amazon, where members of the company\u2019s Prime service can get it for $30 including two-day shipping.Wyze did not create a home internet camera for a tenth of the price of rivals by skimping on quality. Though the camera comes in extremely spare packaging, it otherwise offers many features you would expect in big-brand devices, including tough security. (Although all internet-connected devices pose some security risk, Wyze said its devices and the data they recorded were locked down with encryption.)Wyze\u2019s low prices are instead born of two ideas, both connected to Amazon. The company\u2019s three founders all worked at the retail giant, and they said they had been inspired by Amazon\u2019s high-volume, low-margin approach to sales.To hit the $20 price, Wyze licensed the camera\u2019s hardware from a Chinese company, then created its own software. It also cut out just about every middleman, including most retailers. And it\u2019s banking on long-run success. While Wyze is just breaking even on its first camera, its founders believe internet-connected home devices will be a growth category. They plan to establish a trusted brand with the first camera, then release a succession of products that they hope to sell in large numbers, at low prices.But how do you establish a brand online? That\u2019s the second place Amazon comes in.Though they snubbed every other retailer, Wyze\u2019s founders recognized that they needed an Amazon storefront to help them establish an instant presence next to the big guys. Customer rankings and reviews on Amazon have become just about the most important factor in how consumers buy electronics products; because Amazon pages come up high on search results like Google\u2019s, a positive rating on Amazon can effectively make a brand \u2014 and a negative rating can break one.\u201cThat\u2019s why we had to sell on Amazon,\u201d said Yun Zhang, Wyze\u2019s chief executive. \u201cYou just can\u2019t ignore them.\u201dIn an earlier time, you might have dismissed companies like these as \u201cChinese knockoffs.\u201d After all, like Wyze, most of them use commodity parts and global manufacturing efficiencies to create low-priced versions of relatively uncomplicated products.But knockoffs get a bad rap because they are of indeterminate quality: Even if it\u2019s selling at a good price, who wants to risk buying a no-name portable smartphone charger if it might blow up in your face? Allen Fung, the general manager of Sunvalley\u2019s American division, said that what was unique about Amazon was that its store encouraged low prices while heavily penalizing companies that made shoddy products.\u201cIt\u2019s not a race to the bottom,\u201d Mr. Fung said. \u201cSellers are forced to create better products at lower pricing, and sellers who aren\u2019t able to do that just get weeded out.\u201dMr. Fung recently spent a couple of hours providing an in-depth look at how he manages his company\u2019s brands on Amazon. To win a certain product category \u2014 portable chargers, say, or children\u2019s night lights \u2014 the company is obsessive about monitoring customer feedback, including the rate at which its products are returned. Sunvalley recently hired a team of customer service agents to respond to complaints. It has also hired industrial designers to improve the look of its devices \u2014 which also helps it stand out from other commodity devices on Amazon\u2019s results page.Sunvalley also spends heavily on Amazon ads (these show up as \u201csponsored\u201d results on Amazon\u2019s search page), and sometimes it will sell products at a loss during one of Amazon\u2019s daily or seasonal deals to get a boost that lifts all of its products in the website\u2019s search rankings.All of these investments are costly and time-consuming, and competition on Amazon is intense. Mr. Fung said Sunvalley\u2019s gross margins were under 25 percent, which is quite low for consumer electronics.\u201cIt\u2019s really tough,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real process of natural selection there.\u201dThis process is not going to affect just the consumer electronics business. Mr. Fung said his teams regularly looked to Amazon as a kind of product road map \u2014 they look for categories dominated by high-priced items from well-known brands, and then try to create better, cheaper versions. Sunvalley has expanded into home appliances like lamps and humidifiers, as well as into cosmetics.Amazon, which charges a fee for third-party companies to sell through its platform, is not a passive actor in this trend. It has long encouraged businesses to set up shop on its site. The company said that half of its products came from small businesses, and that in 2016, more than 100,000 businesses exceeded $100,000 in sales through its system. It also started a lending program to allow those businesses to scale up; last year, its loans exceeded $3 billion.\u201cAs this takes off, it really makes you start to question, you know, what is a brand in the Amazon age?\u201d said Scot Wingo, executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm.It\u2019s an intriguing question, and one that raises fears of Amazon\u2019s rise. While the growth of high-quality, low-priced brands on Amazon seems unquestionably good for consumers, the trend does produce economic losers.The classic worry about Amazon is that it puts local retailers out of business. Now another worry is that by exposing global brands to the harsh reality of low-priced competitors, it may put them out of business, too. Mr. Wingo said global brands across a variety of categories \u2014 electronics, apparel, home improvement \u2014 regularly approached his company looking for a way to compete with low-priced rivals on Amazon.He has had to let them know there\u2019s no easy solution, he said.\u201cThere is this erosion of what it means to be a traditional consumer product brand,\u201d Mr. Wingo said. \u201cIn a way, Amazon is providing all this information that replaces what you\u2019d normally get from a brand, like reputation and trust. Amazon is becoming something like the umbrella brand, the only brand that matters.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This is true not just of theater but of love and also of the Broadway titan Harold Prince\u2019s new memoir, \u201cSense of Occasion\u201d \u2014 which is to a large degree his old memoir, annotated and updated considerably, but left with its fine patina essentially undisturbed.I didn\u2019t realize this until I paid $50 cash for a copy of Prince\u2019s out-of-print 1974 book \u201cContradictions\u201d to a rabbi who produced it from a plastic shopping bag in his ophthalmologist\u2019s Upper West Side waiting room. Everything about this transaction recalled a vanishing Manhattan.But other pots are forever percolating. \u201cI have plans,\u201d he declares in the last of 19 new chapters in \u201cSense of Occasion,\u201d a title that refers not to his impending 90th birthday but to the feeling of hushed anticipation that precedes every curtain\u2019s rise.Secondary to these plans is his life story, which Prince tells with an economy of emotion that recalls the producing he did to leverage himself into directing. You keep strict accounts but get on with it.He doesn\u2019t discuss being adopted, by a stockbroker and his wife who nudged him into orchestra seats rather than baseball bleachers, but does mention a nervous breakdown at age 14, after a serious reduction in the family\u2019s circumstances during the Great Depression. Gone was the Pierce-Arrow motor car, the apartment near the Museum of Natural History. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t find a life in the theater, how the hell would I live?\u201d young Hal worried.Watching the creators of \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d trying to focus its theme, Prince learned the importance of metaphor. \u201cWell, it\u2019s about this milkman marrying off his five daughters. \u2026 Well, it\u2019s about the tough life of a Jew in Christian Russia.\u201dJerome Robbins: \u201cBut what\u2019s it really about?\u201dSheldon Harnick: \u201cForgodsakes, it\u2019s about tradition!\u201dAnd the rest is royalties.There are a few tantalizing glimpses of Prince\u2019s 55-year marriage to the former Judy Chaplin (daughter of Saul, the Academy Award-winning arranger and composer). She was a ballerina and pianist whom he met in Paris, and whose ambitions he regrets curtailing. There\u2019s also a perhaps inevitable cameo from Donald J. Trump. But those seeking gossip about, say, Patti LuPone on the set of \u201cEvita\u201d will be disappointed. This is a record of work.Where Abbott sought to entertain, Prince has striven to elevate. And the most important characters in his book and his world are not himself or the star actors, but his collaborators, who have always included the audience.

{"Headline": "Stop the Manipulation of Democracy Online", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Surreptitious techniques pioneered in Moscow and Beijing to use the internet to drown out dissent and undermine free elections broke into view during the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States. But Russian efforts to influence the American election are part of a larger, profound challenge to democracy worldwide.Online manipulation tactics played an important role in at least 17 other elections over the past year. From the Philippines and Ecuador to Turkey and Kenya, governing parties used paid commentators, trolls, bots, false news sites and propaganda outlets to inflate their popular support and essentially endorse themselves.In the Philippines, members of a \u201ckeyboard army\u201d said they could earn $10 a day operating social media accounts that supported Rodrigo Duterte or attacked his detractors in the run-up to his May 2016 election as president. Many of those social media fabricators have remained active under his administration, amplifying the impression of widespread support for his brutal crackdown on the drug trade.During the 2017 election season in Kenya, political camps set up teams of paid bloggers, social media influencers and bots to shape public opinion online. Overt disinformation, propaganda and hate speech targeted individuals and organizations affiliated with the opposite political camp via Twitter hashtags, Google Ads and Facebook sponsored posts.In the lead-up to presidential elections in Ecuador, social media accounts belonging to politicians, journalists and opposition activists were hijacked and used to disseminate messages against the opposition\u2019s vice-presidential candidate.Efforts by government authorities to shape and control online discussions go well beyond elections and have grown each year since Freedom House began tracking the problem in 2009. When it examined internet freedom in 65 countries in 2016 and 2017 (representing 87 percent of global internet users), its Freedom on the Net project found governments in nearly half of the nations deploying some form of manipulation to distort online information to stay in power and undermine the opposition.The practice has become significantly more widespread and technically sophisticated. Bots, propaganda producers and fake news outlets exploit social media and search algorithms to integrate seamlessly with trusted content, posing a devastating new threat to democracy. The dangers undermine elections, political debate and virtually every other aspect of governing.In Turkey, 6,000 people have been enlisted by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party to manipulate discussions and counter opponents on social media. The government of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico relies on an estimated 75,000 automated accounts \u2014 Pe\u00f1abots \u2014 to overwhelm political critics on Twitter. In Iran, the government has long created internet sites that mimic those of legitimate news organizations like the BBC; these fakes are filled with conspiracy theories and anti-Western propaganda.Unlike direct censorship, like shutting down mobile service, online content manipulation is difficult to detect and is far more difficult to combat, given the sheer number of people and bots deployed. The fabrication of grass-roots support for government policies creates a closed loop in which the authorities essentially use social media to endorse themselves, making the views of citizens irrelevant.Restoring trust in social media and the internet requires defensive actions against the manipulation armies. A first step is for the United States and other democracies to ensure that political advertising is at least as transparent online as it is offline, an issue now being debated in Congress. Online political ads should be required to indicate who sponsored them; social media companies should have to make this information available and indicate the source of the payment for such ads.As we have seen in recent weeks, big tech companies also face pressure from Congress and European governments to more aggressively weed out hate speech and to take other steps to remove online sludge. There is indeed room for smarter curation of news feeds and search algorithms \u2014 with more human oversight.But these approaches, unless handled skillfully, also risk narrowing political debate and undermining internet freedom, as witnessed in Germany, where popular social media companies are now required to take down offending information quickly or risk fines of up to 50 million euros.The problem is likely to get more complicated. More and more data is being collected about Americans\u2019 political views, personal habits and sensitive financial and health information, while that data is becoming harder to keep secure from hackers and hostile governments.Those forces are part of the weaponization of the internet used so skillfully by Russian operatives and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Online manipulation also becomes easier if perpetrators are able to identify a subgroup of people most susceptible to their message and most likely to share it with others in their network, a task made easier by the data-collection practices of popular social media companies.There is no panacea; constant vigilance and education are required to attack this problem. Young people and other web users must be taught to take seriously the demands of cybersecurity. High schools should be including media literacy as part of history and social science curriculums.Most of all, students and others must be put on alert that there really is fake news \u2014 false information deliberately planted by malevolent actors \u2014 and that they need to be on guard against propaganda masquerading as truth.The future of democracy may well rest on our ability to tell the difference.Michael J. Abramowitz is the president of Freedom House.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Engaged in \u2018Illegal\u2019 Spying on Rivals, Ex-Employee Says", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, Uber secretly spied on key executives, drivers and employees at rival ride-hailing companies as part of a larger intelligence-gathering operation that spanned multiple countries, according to a letter made public in a federal court on Friday.The 37-page letter, written on behalf of Richard Jacobs, a former Uber security employee, detailed what he described as the formation of separate internal teams designed \u201cexpressly for the purpose of acquiring trade secrets\u201d from major ride-sharing competitors around the world.Those teams then worked to infiltrate chat rooms and scraped websites for data on competitors, according to the letter. Uber security employees occasionally impersonated drivers to gain access to chat groups, illegally recorded phone calls, and secretly wiretapped and tailed executives at rival companies over the course of 2016, the letter said.\u201cUber has engaged, and continues to engage, in illegal intelligence gathering on a global scale,\u201d Mr. Jacobs wrote.Mr. Jacobs\u2019s letter surfaced last month when the United States attorney\u2019s office in Northern California alerted the federal judge in the Uber-Waymo case to its existence. The letter was submitted into evidence because it also detailed allegations that Uber employees potentially conspired to steal trade secrets from Waymo. The judge, William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, then delayed a trial in the case so Waymo\u2019s lawyers could gather more information on the claims.At the time, Mr. Jacobs appeared in court about his letter. In his testimony, he walked back some of its claims, including those pertaining to Uber\u2019s alleged theft of Waymo\u2019s trade secrets. Uber had privately settled a lawsuit by Mr. Jacobs for millions of dollars this year.The document nonetheless paints a picture of Uber\u2019s other competitive tactics, which Mr. Jacobs said had been carried out by Uber\u2019s security team with Mr. Kalanick\u2019s knowledge. At the time, the team was led by Joe Sullivan, the company\u2019s chief security officer.\u201cWhile we haven\u2019t substantiated all the claims in this letter \u2014 and, importantly, any related to Waymo \u2014 our new leadership has made clear that going forward we will compete honestly and fairly, on the strength of our ideas and technology,\u201d Matt Kallman, a spokesman for Uber, said in a statement after the letter\u2019s release.On Friday, Mr. Sullivan and others on the security team disputed Mr. Jacobs\u2019s letter, saying it was \u201cnothing more than character assassination for cash,\u201d according to a statement from Matthew Umhofer, an attorney for four Uber security employees. \u201cJacobs took the good work my clients did and twisted it into something it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Umhofer said.In his own statement, Mr. Sullivan said, \u201cFrom where I sat, my team acted ethically, with integrity and in the best interests of our drivers and riders.\u201dThrough a spokeswoman, Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How 2017 Became a Turning Point for Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThis was a terrible year for the tech industry.Yet underneath this apparent success was a momentous shift in how the tech business deals with the world. Five or 10 years from now, we will come to regard 2017 as a turning point.Why? Because this year, for the first time, tech giants began to grudgingly accept that they have some responsibility to the offline world. The scope of that responsibility, though, is another matter entirely.Let me explain how this is all playing out.Think of these platforms as the roads, railroads and waterways of the information economy \u2014 an essentially inescapable part of life for any business or regular person who doesn\u2019t live in a secluded cabin in the woods.For years, despite their growing power, tech platforms rarely garnered much scrutiny, and they were often loath to accept how much their systems affected the real world. Indeed, the online ethos has been that platforms aren\u2019t really responsible for how people use them. It might as well be the slogan of Silicon Valley: We just make the tech, how people use it is another story.In 2017, that changed. At first grudgingly and then with apparent enthusiasm, platform companies like Facebook began accepting some responsibility for how they are affecting the real world. They did not go as far as some critics would have liked \u2014 but in many significant ways they offered a shift in tone and tactics that suggested they were rethinking their positions.Many tech titans were obviously unprepared for the serious questions that began coming their way a year ago. When the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked about his site\u2019s role in the 2016 election just days after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory, he responded with a line from tech\u2019s old playbook: It was a \u201cpretty crazy idea,\u201d he said, that misinformation on Facebook had \u201cinfluenced the election in any way.\u201dNow that tone is gone. Mr. Zuckerberg has apologized for his glibness. And during Facebook\u2019s last earnings report to investors, he put the company\u2019s social mission at the top of his agenda. \u201cProtecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d he said.Sure, all this could just be marketing. But I\u2019m inclined to believe the shift represents a new way of navigating the world, for a few reasons.First, employees are demanding a new way. The highly paid workers of Silicon Valley were lured on the promise of changing the world, and in the past year many became demoralized about their companies\u2019 apparent impact. In some cases they\u2019re pushing their bosses to change.Not this time.If the big shift of 2017 is that tech companies now accept some responsibility for how their platforms impact the world, the big mystery of 2018 and beyond is what, exactly, that responsibility will look like.Mr. Zuckerberg said he was willing to risk the company\u2019s profitability to improve its community. Facebook has been testing new ideas for making its News Feed less divisive and less prone to misinformation, and for promoting what the company calls \u201cmeaningful\u201d social connections. Facebook is also testing systems that it said would more stringently police advertising, in the hope of preventing foreign actors from using its ad network to influence an election.But what if these early efforts don\u2019t mitigate the problems? What if Facebook finds that offering people a less polarized News Feed dramatically reduces engagement on its site, affecting its bottom line? Or what if the changes disproportionately affect one political ideology over another \u2014 would Facebook stick with a kind of responsibility that risks calling into question its impartiality?I don\u2019t mean to offer a barrage of hypotheticals just for the fun of it. My point is that these issues would probably be pretty hard to solve.\u201cJust as the packaged food industry did in the 1950s, Facebook and Google have lured users with convenience, while feeding them a diet certain to cause lasting harm,\u201d Roger McNamee, the musician and venture capitalist, told me. \u201cThe problem cannot be addressed by hiring; it can only be fixed by changing the algorithms in ways that will materially reduce profitability.\u201d\u201cI would give tech a C grade,\u201d Ms. Pao, who is now the chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, wrote in an email. \u201cLeaders are doing the bare minimum to address problems and are far from doing all that is necessary to solve the problem.\u201dShe said she hoped for a far more vigorous effort that ushered in a complete overhaul of the culture of tech companies, and that held leaders accountable.\u201cIt means firing all the people involved in the failures, from the C.E.O. to the H.R. leaders to the board members in some cases,\u201d she wrote.Ms. Pao\u2019s and Mr. McNamee\u2019s comments underline the real problem for the industry. Once you accept that you\u2019re on the hook for fixing problems caused by the thing you built, people will start to expect that you really will fix them \u2014 even if the solutions are expensive or otherwise conflict with your business interests.So, yeah, 2017 was a terrible year for the tech industry. If the fixing does not actually happen, 2018 might well be worse.Advertisement"}

D. Vance, author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d the best-selling book about the industrial decline of the Midwest, Mr. Case told him, \u201cI really love the book but there is a part of it I don\u2019t love.\u201dMr. Vance listened patiently.\u201cIt helped frame the problem but it didn\u2019t really offer up a solution,\u201d Mr. Case told him.\u201cWell, it is interesting you say that,\u201d Mr. Vance replied, \u201cbecause that\u2019s really what my next chapter is going to be.\u201dBut until now, at least to some skeptics, it seemed like a do-gooder vanity project.How could these two men significantly change the dynamic among serious investors on the coasts to reorient their focus on cities, many of them suffering from the erosion of manufacturing, in the Rust Belt and elsewhere?It turns out that while they were publicly crisscrossing America, they were also privately holding meetings with some of the wealthiest individuals and families in the country, urging them to not only invest in a new fund but become partners with some of the companies that will benefit from it.On Tuesday, the fund, called Rise of the Rest, will disclose its investors, which has turned into a Who\u2019s Who of American business. Among them are:All told, it may be the greatest concentration of American wealth and power in one investment fund.The idea \u2014 far grander than the money itself, which is only $150 million to start, pocket money for most of the investors \u2014 was to assemble a dream team and create a network effect for entrepreneurs in the middle of the country to align with the biggest names in business.The fund, said Mr. Vance, was meant to construct an ecosystem like the one in Silicon Valley that will provide support and connections to entrepreneurs in small towns.\u201cPeople tend to follow their networks,\u201d said Mr. Vance, who was recruited to the effort by Mr. Case. \u201cWhile the network in Silicon Valley is obviously something that is great, it can also have an exclusionary effect that prevents investors from looking at and finding opportunities that exist outside of their networks and outside of their geographies.\u201dMr. Case and Mr. Vance hope to seed investments in start-ups in underserved cities and then bring in some of their big names to invest even more money in them. \u201cWe\u2019ll be curating interesting companies,\u201d Mr. Case said.In other words, if they discover a nascent but promising e-commerce company in Allentown, Pa., they will not only invest in it, but they might also help it establish a relationship with one of the fund\u2019s investors \u2014 Mr. Bezos, for example \u2014 who might invest even more.Mr. Case was quick to say that the new enterprise should not be considered a social impact fund, which has become the hot nomenclature for investors seeking to do good. Some consider social impact investing a sort of pseudophilanthropy because the returns aren\u2019t always the main goal.Mr. Case said he would only succeed in changing the way investors think about the rest of the country if he can produce significant financial success stories.\u201cWe\u2019re fans of impact investing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we actually didn\u2019t position this as an impact fund. First and foremost, our goal was to generate top returns.\u201dMr. Schmidt of Alphabet said he was sold on the idea from the moment he first heard about it. \u201cI felt it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a large selection of relatively undervalued businesses in the heartland between the coasts, some of which can scale quickly.\u201dAnd while it isn\u2019t an altruistic investment, he said he hoped the effort creates \u201cmore jobs, more wealth, better products and helps our society deal with a lot of jarring employment changes.\u201dOne of the great questions about American capitalism is why big investors, who are always looking for opportunities and are often willing to fly halfway around the world to find them in places like China and India, put so little effort into finding investment in the middle of the country. California, New York and Massachusetts attract 76 percent of all venture capital money, according to the National Venture Capital Association.One answer may be that the nation\u2019s top talent is drawn to the coasts, but Mr. Breyer said he has seen that changing.\u201cEntrepreneurs are now creating start-ups in lots of places,\u201d he said. \u201cThe confluence of social networking technologies and cloud services makes it easier and less costly than ever before to develop and bring new technologies to market\u201d for entrepreneurs outside of centers like Silicon Valley.One example of a company that could be a model for the fund is one that Mr. Case has already invested in: 75f in Burnsville, Minn., which works to make commercial buildings more comfortable and energy-efficient.Critics may argue that the fund is a marketing exercise for elites trying to fix a problem of their own making. And there may be some truth to that. But like most great entrepreneurs, these investors have a genuine interest in finding the next Facebook or Google, and they get excited about the prospect of discovering a needle in the start-up haystack.And they recognize that the next big idea may come from someplace totally unexpected \u2014 somewhere not on either coast or in one of the other pockets of entrepreneurship.\u201cThere\u2019s still more talent (engineers, execs) \u2014 and resources (funding), but the costs and competition for talent and housing are extreme\u201d in Silicon Valley, Mr. Doerr wrote in an email, suggesting perhaps that it may be a less attractive location than before.\u201cIn the end, don\u2019t think of \u2018the Valley\u2019 as some ZIP codes in California,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a state of mind that can be anywhere, for everyone. Increasingly, for all of the rest of us.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the name of the city where the company 75f is based.

{"Headline": "What if You Couldn\u2019t See This Page?", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHONG KONG \u2014 To taste a future without net neutrality, try browsing the web in Beijing. China\u2019s internet, provided through telecom giants aligned with the Communist Party, is a digital dystopia, filtered by the vast censorship apparatus known as China\u2019s Great Firewall. Some sites load with soul-withering slowness, or not at all. Others appear instantly. Content vanishes without warning or explanation. The culprit is rarely knowable. A faulty Wi-Fi router? A neighborhood power failure? Commercial sabotage? A clampdown on political dissent? To most Chinese netizens, the reason matters little. They simply gravitate to the few sites that aren\u2019t slowed or blocked entirely: the Chinese counterparts of Facebook, Google, and Twitter. But these Chinese platforms come with heavy government surveillance and censorship by corporate and party apparatchiks. For the Communist Party and its commercial allies, this is win-win, cementing respective monopolies on political markets and consumer power.The Trump administration\u2019s plan to dismantle net neutrality regulations has brought this nightmare scenario to America\u2019s digital doorstep. With the Federal Communications Commission scheduled to vote on the issue today, the threatened rollback not only imperils fair play and free speech; it will also empower foreign entities with substantial market-making power, like China\u2019s government, to meddle in American public discourse on a scale dwarfing Russia\u2019s recent cyber-chicanery. Worse, abolishing net neutrality gives American corporations the means, motive and opportunity to become accomplices in selling out our freedom of speech.As the incentives and opportunities to self-censor accumulate, content providers will gravitate to producing and promoting whatever reaches the most customers worldwide, even if that means pleasing Chinese cyber-commissars who control access to a billion of them. Content providers \u2014 companies like Facebook and LinkedIn \u2014 are not, after all, common carriers. They do not control the pipes, or carry a unique public trust in the eyes of the government. As private businesses, they are not bound by the First Amendment. Self-censorship is simply good business.For those telecom conglomerates that have current or potential business before the Chinese government, the temptation to take behind-the-scenes guidance on content \u201cmanagement\u201d as a quid pro quo for market access may prove irresistible. China already exports its cutting-edge internet censorship technologies, honed in the world\u2019s largest natural laboratory for \u201copinion guidance,\u201d to authoritarian countries around the world. These technologies are masterpieces of subtlety and sophistication, offering a world-class censorship experience amenable to consumers and commissars alike. They rarely resort to the \u201chard\u201d censorship of crude deletion, but rather give a suite of \u201csofter\u201d monitoring and management tools to steer public discourse and discourage all but the most dogged netizens from accessing undesirable content. For those who stick to domestic and approved Chinese sites, the browsing experience is speedy and seamless, the sutures where unwanted content has been excised barely visible.In the future, if the article you\u2019re reading loads slowly, or not at all, you might not know the reason.

{"Headline": "Ajit Pai Nears His Biggest Win With Net Neutrality Repeal", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Small tech companies, consumer groups and many celebrities have been up in arms for weeks about a proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to dismantle landmark rules that guarantee an open internet.But in one speech, Ajit Pai, the chairman of the agency, called the complaints \u201chysteria\u201d and \u201chot air.\u201d In another, he dismissed criticism that by pushing the change, he was doing the bidding of companies like Verizon, his former employer. He joked that his nightmare scenario would be refereeing a dispute between Verizon and Sinclair Broadcasting, another company he has been accused of helping with his policies.\u201cHow do you choose,\u201d he said, \u201cbetween a longtime love and a newfound crush?\u201dThe agency was expected to vote on Thursday to dismantle the so-called net neutrality rules, which prohibit internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for higher quality delivery to consumers. It would also dial back the stance established during the Obama administration that broadband should be regulated like a utility. The three Republican commissioners, including Mr. Pai, have said they will vote for the proposal, outnumbering the two Democratic commissioners.Passing the plan would be the biggest victory in Mr. Pai\u2019s eventful 11-month tenure as the head of the F.C.C. Under his leadership, the agency has already opened the door for more media mergers, curtailed a high-speed internet program for low-income families and allowed broadband providers to raise rates to business customers.\u201cAjit Pai has the potential to be one of most consequential commissioners in the agency\u2019s history,\u201d said Gus Hurwitz, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska College of Law, who is an expert in telecom policy and who supports Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal.Even Mr. Pai\u2019s detractors acknowledge that Mr. Pai has been efficient at moving his agenda. Mark Cooper, a staff member of Consumer Federation of America, said Mr. Pai has far outpaced his recent predecessors, even if Mr. Cooper does not agree with those efforts.\u201cIn every way,\u201d Mr. Cooper said, \u201chis decisions are bad for consumers and good for big corporations.\u201dMr. Pai declined to be interviewed for this article. But in a statement, the F.C.C. said that he \u201chas been focused on making the agency more transparent, closing the digital divide, and updating the Commission\u2019s rules to reflect the modern communications marketplace.\u201dThe agency added that \u201cthe F.C.C. has modernized its rules across a wide range of areas to encourage more competition and innovation.\u201dMr. Pai\u2019s deregulatory fervor began well before the presidential election and his nomination by President Trump.The child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, Mr. Pai was lauded by Republicans and Democrats when he was appointed in 2011 by President Obama to the F.C.C. Lawmakers and public interest groups hoped the young nominee would bring a greater appreciation for how communications was shifting online than past commissioners.But for five years as a minority member of the F.C.C., Mr. Pai consistently voted against regulations such as those limiting business broadband prices and a broadband subsidy for low-income Americans. He complained that the agency\u2019s Democratic leaders, including Tom Wheeler, were too heavy-handed with companies.The biggest offense, in his opinion, were the 2015 net neutrality rules, which included the declaration that broadband would be subject to more utility-style rules. He said the regulations would burden the fast-growing high-speed internet market. In dissenting comments during the debate over the rules, he echoed the arguments of telecom companies that the F.C.C.\u2019s net neutrality rules made it hard for telecoms to expand their networks, leading to less innovation in business plans and would eventually harm the economy.He also accused the White House of presidential interference in the activities of the F.C.C., an independent agency. Mr. Pai said that the agency had taken its direction only after President Obama posted a video in favor of the net neutrality rules.Mr. Pai\u2019s consistent opposition attracted supporters from free-market think tanks and conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh and Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser who recently praised the proposal to scrap net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai became a frequent guest on Fox News and other conservative media and was praised in the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal.Supporters of net neutrality argue that telecom companies want to become the gatekeepers of the internet, deciding whether sites have access to fast or slow connections. But Mr. Pai has responded by saying the bigger threat is from the big tech companies. Google, Twitter and Facebook, he argues, can deprive consumers of free expression.He says Twitter, for example, sometimes wrongly suspends users just because they do not share the same views as the company.\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves,\u201d Mr. Pai said last month at an event sponsored by the R Street Institute, a free markets think tank. \u201cWhen it comes to an open internet, Twitter is part of the problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens When the Richest U.S. Cities Turn to the World?", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the economy has changed, so have the relationships between places, to the disadvantage of smaller cities and rural areas.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Well before anyone thought of this place as the center of the tech economy, the Bay Area built ships. And it did so with the help of many parts of the country.A changing economy has been good to the region, and to a number of other predominantly coastal metros like New York, Boston and Seattle. But economists and geographers are now questioning what the nature of their success means for the rest of the country. What happens to America\u2019s manufacturing heartland when Silicon Valley turns to China? Where do former mill and mining towns fit in when big cities shift to digital work? How does upstate New York benefit when New York City increases business with Tokyo?The answers have social and political implications at a time when broad swaths of the country feel alienated from and resentful of \u201celite\u201d cities that appear from a distance to have gone unscathed by the forces hollowing out smaller communities. To the extent that many Americans believe they\u2019re disconnected from the prosperity in these major metros \u2014 even as they use the apps and services created there \u2014 perhaps they\u2019re right. Such a picture, Ms. Sassen said, \u201cbreaks a past pattern where a range of smaller, more provincial cities actually fed the rise of the major cities.\u201d Now major cities are feeding one another, and doing so across the globe.\u201cThese links have been broken,\u201d Mr. Longworth said. Of course, some remain. And antipathy toward prosperous big cities is not a new theme in history. \u201cBut this is different: This is deeper,\u201d Mr. Longworth said. \u201cIt is also, as far as we can see, permanent, simply because the economy that supported the earlier relationships has gone away and shows no sign of coming back.\u201dThe Rise of Global Cities\u201cBig changes have been happening over the last 30 years,\u201d Ms. Giannone said. \u201cNow we\u2019re actually seeing the impact of them.\u201dThose changes have come from multiple directions \u2014 from globalization, from computerization, from the shift in the United States away from manufacturing toward a knowledge and service economy. These trends have buffeted many smaller cities and nonurban areas. The uncomfortable political truth is that they\u2019ve also benefited places like San Francisco and New York.For all of the talk of how globalization has cost America manufacturing jobs, it has created American jobs, too \u2014 but the high-paying ones have tended to go to such cities.Ms. Sassen argues that a global economy has created new kinds of needs for companies: accountants specializing in Asian tax law, lawyers expert in European Union regulation, marketers who understand Latin America. Global cities must connect to other global cities to tap these resources, which have become more valuable to them than lumber and steel.Inventors in these global cities are also increasingly connecting to one another. Using the addresses of patent co-inventors, Mr. Mudambi has traced a steep rise starting in the early 1990s of global connections from a few American metro areas, which are today among the most prosperous in the country.Inventing \u2018New Stuff\u2019 Before Anyone Can Catch UpBut these kinds of ties aren\u2019t truly spreading the Bay Area\u2019s prosperity. Server farms don\u2019t create mass middle-class employment. Using Google isn\u2019t the same as having a hand in engineering it.To put it more harshly, when global cities need other communities today, Ms. Sassen said, it\u2019s often to extract value out of them. New York bankers need Middle America\u2019s mortgages to construct securities. San Francisco start-ups need idle cars everywhere to amass billion-dollar valuations. Online retail giants need cheap land for their warehouses. The rest of the country may receive the innovations that flow out of global cities, and the benefits to consumers are real. \u201cBut by the time that\u2019s done, the cities have already invented something new and made themselves richer again,\u201d Mr. Storper said. \u201cBefore anywhere else can catch up, San Francisco has already leapt ahead again with new stuff they\u2019ve invented.\u201d\u201cThe Torontos, Ottawas and Waterloos in countries like Canada and the U.S., they will link with Shenzhen in China, they will link with Munich and Stockholm in Europe,\u201d Mr. Bathelt said. \u201cAnd other places will be kind of left out.\u201dIn the international network that emerges, global cities stand out.

{"Headline": "Janet Benshoof, Women\u2019s Champion on a Global Scale, Dies at 70", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJanet Benshoof, a lawyer who spent much of her career defending a woman\u2019s right to an abortion, then expanded her work to champion causes for women around the world, including those raped in war zones, died on Monday in Manhattan. She was 70.Her son David Benshoof Klein said the cause was uterine serous carcinoma, a rare and aggressive form of endometrial cancer.Over 40 years, she pursued her advocacy at three organizations in New York City: as director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s reproductive freedom project and as the founder and president of the Center for Reproductive Rights and, most recently, the Global Justice Center.Ms. Benshoof (pronounced BEN-shawf) plotted the legal strategy for abortion and sex-education cases in state courts and the United States Supreme Court, and trained judges in Iraq to prosecute rape and sexual violence cases under international law.She told the court that the two-parent requirement was \u201cout of step with the reality of family life\u201d and that it had been imposed \u201cregardless of whether the minor lives in a no-parent, one-parent or two-parent household, regardless of whether she is mature, or whether it would be in the best interest to have a private abortion, regardless of whether she has ever met the absentee parent.\u201dThe court ruled, 5-4, that the Minnesota law was constitutional because the state gave minors an alternative to the two-parent requirement by allowing them to seek authorization for an abortion in a judicial hearing.The continuing fight to preserve abortion rights took Ms. Benshoof far afield. In 1990 she learned that the legislature in Guam, a United States territory in the Pacific, had passed a law banning abortion, except if the mother\u2019s life or health was believed to be in imminent danger. She promptly bought a Fodor\u2019s travel book and headed for the airport.Once in Guam, she told reporters that pregnant women there who were seeking an abortion should fly to Honolulu. She was arrested and arraigned for soliciting women to have abortions, a crime in Guam punishable by a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.Joseph Ada, Guam\u2019s governor, was displeased by Ms. Benshoof\u2019s flouting of the law. \u201cIt\u2019s her right to question it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut she\u2019s making a mockery of our abortion law. That\u2019s not nice.\u201dThe charges were eventually dropped, and the law was struck down by a federal district judge, who ruled that Roe v. Wade, which made abortion a constitutional right, \u201capplied with equal force and effect to Guam.\u201d\u201cJanet would have flashes of brilliance that few lawyers I knew had,\u201d said Ms. Kolbert, who is director of the Athena Center for Leadership Studies at Barnard College. \u201cOnce in a while, she\u2019d come up with a way of approaching a case that the rest of us wouldn\u2019t have.\u201dMs. Benshoof suggested that instead of having the introduction to the A.C.L.U. petition address each provision of the law separately, as was commonly done, it should raise only a single all-or-nothing question.The question posed by Ms. Kolbert and her co-counsel, Linda Wharton, reflected their belief that the court\u2019s rulings since 1973 had eroded Roe and their fear that Clarence Thomas\u2019s confirmation as a justice in 1991 gave the court five votes to overturn the decision.\u201cHas the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade?\u201d the lawyers asked.In 1992, the court affirmed Roe, 5-4, but still upheld most of the state\u2019s restrictions.But having anticipated that Roe would be overturned, Ms. Benshoof and the rest of the abortion-rights staff had left the A.C.L.U. before the court\u2019s ruling to form what was then called the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy.One of her signature achievements at the center resulted in the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval in 1996 of the use of the morning-after pill as an emergency contraceptive to prevent unwanted pregnancies. The center had filed a citizen\u2019s petition with the agency two years earlier asking companies to label the pill as a post-intercourse contraceptive.\u201cThe F.D.A. has stood idly by as drug manufacturers routinely suppress required information about safe and effective emergency contraception,\u201d Ms. Benshoof told The Washington Post in 1994 at the time that she filed the petition with the F.D.A. \u201cMillions of women are being hurt.\u201dJanet Lee Benshoof was born on May 10, 1947, in Detroit Lakes, Minn. Her father, Lowell, was a county prosecutor, and her mother, the former Helen Genevieve Kohler, was a teacher.She graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science from the University of Minnesota and later from Harvard Law School, where she met her first husband, Richard Klein.After Harvard Law, she spent five years at South Brooklyn Legal Services, where she supervised class-action litigation for low-income people. She then joined the A.C.L.U., where her clients included abortion doctors.One of them, Dr. Barnett Slepian, was murdered in his home in Buffalo 1998 by an abortion opponent.Ms. Benshoof\u2019s work also led the European Union in 2015 to recognize that abortion is protected care under the Geneva Conventions for girls and women who are raped in conflict. The action was a rebuke to the Helms Amendment, a 1973 United States law originally sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms, which prohibits the use of foreign assistance for abortion.In addition to her son David, she is survived by her husband, Alfred Meyer; another son, Eli Klein; a stepson, Nick Rose-Meyer; two step-grandchildren; and a sister, Lou Ann Garvey. Her marriage to Mr. Klein ended in divorce.Ms. Benshoof\u2019s marriage to Mr. Meyer was officiated by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a longtime friend.Five days before Ms. Benshoof died, Justice Ginsburg sent her a letter that read, in part: \u201cMartin Luther King said the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. To make that so it takes people of your commitment, will and grit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The F.C.C. Wants to Let Telecoms Cash In on the Internet", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe chairman of the Federal Communications Commission wants to let Comcast, Verizon and other broadband companies turn the internet into a latter-day version of cable TV, in which they decide what customers can watch and how much they pay for that content.Net neutrality prevents those companies from having companies like Amazon pay a fee to get their content delivered more quickly than their rivals\u2019, and from having the firms throttle other services and websites, even blocking customer access to, say, Netflix or an online newspaper.Under Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, telecom companies would effectively be allowed to sell you a basic internet plan that might include only limited access to Google and email. For Facebook and Twitter you might need a slightly more expensive deluxe plan. The premium plan might include access to Netflix and Amazon. Oh, and by the way, media businesses eager to gain more users could pay broadband companies to be included in their enhanced basic or deluxe plans.That might sound like a far-fetched scenario. But there is reason to fear that some version of that awful vision could become a reality, because most Americans have just one or two choices for broadband access at home. People have access to four national wireless companies, but those connections tend to be slower and less useful for data-intensive applications than wired service provided by cable and telephone companies.Instead of making sure that broadband companies can\u2019t take advantage of their gatekeeping power over the internet, Mr. Pai wants to let them do whatever they want. All they would be required to do is be \u201ctransparent\u201d about what they are doing. In other words, they could simply tell customers what to expect in endless contracts filled with legalese and printed in tiny type. Mr. Pai further argues that the Federal Trade Commission would then make sure that companies were living up to their promises, essentially abdicating any responsibility the Federal Communications Commission has for the most important communications system in the country.Broadband companies are delighted by Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, which the three-vote Republican majority on the commission is expected to adopt at its meeting on Dec. 14. And they are quick to say that customers have nothing to fear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Acting Studios Are Struggling. Does It Matter?", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "Schools that trained actors like Robert De Niro and Jessica Lange are facing rising costs, competition from colleges, and shifting cultural attitudes.Supported byThe three friends would all go on to win Academy Awards, helping to establish the classic blueprint for pursuing an acting career in New York: Move here, hone your craft at a gritty acting studio, do a handful of plays, conquer Hollywood.Things have changed since the heyday of theater-trained movie stars and the independent acting schools that shaped them. Many small studios, threatened by rising rents, decrepit buildings, well-funded university programs, and instant internet stardom, are now struggling.Just ask Mary Boyer, who moved to the city from the Midwest in 1973 to pursue an acting career. She eventually became a teacher and a director, opening her own school in 2003. But by 2008, Boyer\u2019s 150 students had dwindled to about 50.\u201cThe economy changed,\u201d Ms. Boyer said, \u201cand what actors and audiences wanted sort of changed all at the same time.\u201d She noticed more students expecting \u201cinstant gratification.\u201d Her \u201ccraft of acting\u201d courses, what she felt most passionate about, were not filling up. Auditioning classes became her new staple.\u201cI just could not keep doing it,\u201d Ms. Boyer said. The lease for her school was up for renewal, and she had realized two things: her rent would continue to increase, and the only way to survive would be to teach more audition classes. \u201cMy creative soul was crumbling,\u201d she said.A symbolic example of the neighborhood\u2019s changing priorities is the fact that the tech giant Google, now the Atlantic\u2019s landlord, has plans to raise the school\u2019s rent to market rate next year when the school\u2019s 12-year lease expires.\u201cWe\u2019ve moved around Chelsea all this time, and it\u2019s just heartbreaking for the school to have to leave the neighborhood,\u201d said Mary McCann, the Atlantic\u2019s executive director.A successful alumni network will no doubt help the Playhouse face the daunting task of maintaining the 1920s-era property it owns.\u201cIt\u2019s like driving a 1947 Chevy,\u201d said Ms. Moller Kareman of the Playhouse, which has been on East 54th Street since Irene and Alice Lewisohn, its founders, bought the two adjacent buildings in Midtown in 1947. The Playhouse has five floors, including a light-filled dance studio designed by Martha Graham, as well as a 99-seat theater.\u201cWe are all afraid of the roof caving in,\u201d said Ms. Moller Kareman, who had to pay $20,000 to fix the building\u2019s out-of-commission elevator when she was first hired. \u201cThe elevator guys said we don\u2019t even have parts for this anymore,\u201d she recalled.\u201cWhen Herbert Berghof died in \u201990, I think it was still $5 a class,\u201d said Edith Meeks, HB\u2019s current artistic and executive director. But even by 2004, when Ms. Hagen died, HB had only marginally increased tuition. Modest, incremental fee hikes were just not \u201cenough to catch us up to the real expense of running a nonprofit and managing three buildings in the 21st century,\u201d said Ms. Meeks.So in 2013, for the first time in its history, HB streamlined its curriculum and significantly raised its bargain-basement prices as part of a \u201cone-time adjustment-to-market,\u201d said Ms. Meeks, who confirmed that enrollment is stable but nowhere near the numbers it had in the 1960s. \u201cWe were super affordable, and now we are affordable.\u201dThe change was made with a heavy heart, said Ms. Meeks, who admitted that young actors are affected by New York\u2019s real estate and job market just as much as the institutions training them. \u201cThey commute from farther and farther away to study with us at HB; many of them have crushing college debt and they struggle to stay employed and to have enough flexibility to continue their creative work,\u201d she said.For acting schools that pay rent, the situation is even more tenuous.The Atlantic Acting School moved into the Chelsea neighborhood 26 years ago, when \u201cno one wanted to be there\u201d and \u201crent was cheap,\u201d said Ms. McCann. With a pedigree that includes the playwright David Mamet and the actor/director William H. Macy \u2014 not to mention a thriving children\u2019s program, a connection to a professional theater with 12 Tony Awards, and even a coveted affiliation with N.Y.U. \u2014 it would seem that the school would have a rosy outlook.\u201cWe can\u2019t afford market rate,\u201d said Ms. McCann, the school\u2019s executive director.So, over the last two years, Mr. Lawson and his team have been looking for an affordable space, but the specifics for what the school needs \u2014 at least 20,000 square feet of office and open studio space at an affordable price \u2014 have proved to be a daunting challenge.And yet the Atlantic hopes to have a deal in the Hell\u2019s Kitchen area, according to Mr. Lawson, who reported that his team is currently considering two options. The rent, he said, will be difficult but doable, something between what the Atlantic is currently paying and \u201cChelsea market rate.\u201d Google, meanwhile, has offered the Atlantic a new lease for its theater, housed in the basement of 111 8th Avenue, for reduced rent.The T. Schreiber Studio, also in Chelsea, has survived by keeping its classrooms and administrative areas but letting go of its theater.In the mid-90s, Schreiber was riding high on the success of at least two former students, Edward Norton and Peter Sarsgaard. Around the same time, the school was offered the opportunity to buy its East 4th Street building, which was located across the street from the experimental theater La MaMa, next door to New York Theater Workshop, and included a theater space, offices, dressing rooms and a downstairs class area, for $90,000. But the money simply wasn\u2019t there, said Sally Dunn, its managing director.Instead, the now-49-year-old acting school moved to Chelsea right when it was becoming hot, said Peter Jensen, its artistic director. \u201cYou could just see all the hotels going up,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, student interest in the traditional scene-study class \u2014 what Mr. Norton and Mr. Sarsgaard cut their teeth on at Schreiber \u2014 was leaning more toward on-camera, commercial and casting classes, said Mr. Jensen. The whole nature of pursuing acting in New York was evolving, while the costs of teaching the trade were rising.But that might not be as easy or as affordable as hoped. Over the last decade, the city has also lost approximately 50 small performance venues, and according to Ms. Dunch, the arts fundraising expert, this \u201cspace crunch\u201d affects the entire nonprofit theater industry, including acting studios.Main stage productions at Barrow are happening again, some to critical acclaim. That said, the school\u2019s revenue is beginning to plateau and there\u2019s no more space for expansion. The annual rent is around $300,000, with 3.5 percent increases each year, and the booming Hudson Yards development nearby threatens to raise market rates even more. \u201cWith the rising cost of everything, it\u2019s scary,\u201d said Mr. Serrell. \u201cWe\u2019re a $2.1 million company; we\u2019re still scratching our heads. It\u2019s terrifically challenging, but we\u2019re determined to figure it out.\u201dPerhaps the answer is to leave Manhattan. The Atlantic looked in Brooklyn, but \u201cit\u2019s not any less expensive,\u201d said Ms. McCann. Even the actor and Renaissance man James Franco, who in 2014 opened a branch of his acting and film school, Studio4, in Fort Greene, couldn\u2019t work his magic: the studio announced it was closing on Oct. 1.\u201cI knew I wanted to be in Brooklyn \u2014 three-fourths of my students live here,\u201d said Mr. Knickerbocker, who opened his school in 2015.\u201cI had this restless itch to make something of my own,\u201d said Mr. Knickerbocker, a high-profile acting coach whose clients include Sam Rockwell and Emmy Rossum. \u201cI have that corny thing from \u2018Field of Dreams,\u2019 if you build it, they will come.\u201dSo far, they have come. After taking out a home equity line of credit and some money from his retirement account (\u201ccompletely against the advice of my lawyers and accountants\u201d), he has about 100 students. Mr. Knickerbocker \u201cwanted to have a studio that would be an affordable alternative to an M.F.A. program,\u201d he said. The two-year conservatory, with an optional third year, costs about $8,000 annually.Although students are treated to regular Facebook Live events with movie stars and solo performance workshops, the focus remains on traditional stagecraft and acting technique. And the students are into it. Caleb Lane, 35, in his second year, was a working actor in Los Angeles who \u201cleft the business\u201d to train in New York. \u201cI have a lot of famous friends who couldn\u2019t name one Tennessee Williams play,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople here are more interested in the long game.\u201dThe Knickerbocker invites casting directors and agents to a performance featuring its graduating conservatory actors, as do the T. Schreiber Studio and the Neighborhood Playhouse. But the Knickerbocker showcase does not take place on a stage. In a sign of the times, it is virtual. \u201cWe write and produce three- to four-minute films with these people, and put them online for casting directors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe write it to their sweet spots, shoot it with two cameras, edit it and score it.\u201dMeanwhile, in Toledo, Ms. Boyer is embracing, somewhat, the changing tides of the acting school business. While she is establishing her theater there, she is continuing to coach her most loyal New York students through Skype.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Navigation Apps Are Turning Quiet Neighborhoods Into Traffic Nightmares", "Date": "2017-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEONIA, N.J. \u2014 It is bumper to bumper as far as the eye can see, the kind of soul-sucking traffic jam that afflicts highways the way bad food afflicts rest stops.Suddenly, a path to hope presents itself: An alternate route, your smartphone suggests, can save time. Next thing you know, you\u2019re headed down an exit ramp, blithely following directions into the residential streets of some unsuspecting town, along with a slew of other frustrated motorists.Scenes like this are playing out across the country, not just in traffic-choked regions of the Northeast. But one town has had enough.With services like Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps suggesting shortcuts for commuters through the narrow, hilly streets of Leonia, N.J., the borough has decided to fight back against congestion that its leaders say has reached crisis proportions.In mid-January, the borough\u2019s police force will close 60 streets to all drivers aside from residents and people employed in the borough during the morning and afternoon rush periods, effectively taking most of the town out of circulation for the popular traffic apps \u2014 and for everyone else, for that matter.\u201cWithout question, the game changer has been the navigation apps,\u201d said Tom Rowe, Leonia\u2019s police chief. \u201cIn the morning, if I sign onto my Waze account, I find there are 250,000 \u2018Wazers\u2019 in the area. When the primary roads become congested, it directs vehicles into Leonia and pushes them onto secondary and tertiary roads. We have had days when people can\u2019t get out of their driveways.\u201dEven before the proliferation of navigation apps, Leonia was no stranger to traffic. Ringed by Interstate 95, and in the shadow of the George Washington Bridge, Leonia sits next to some of the most congested roadways in the country.Since Waze uses crowd sourcing to update its information, some people \u2014 frustrated at the influx of outside traffic \u2014 have taken to fabricating reports of traffic accidents in their communities to try to deter the app from sending motorists their way. One suburb of Tel Aviv has even sued Waze, which was developed by an Israeli company.Waze defends its practice of rerouting motorists from congested highways through residential streets in nearby communities. And the company says it shares free traffic data with municipal planners nationwide who might, for instance, want to monitor the effectiveness of a new time sequence for a traffic signal.Terry Wei, a spokeswoman for Waze, said the app benefited from a community of local volunteer editors who ensure that the maps stay up-to-date and reflect the local law. \u201cIf a road is legally reclassified into a private road,\u201d she said, \u201cour map editors will make that change. It is our goal to work holistically with our community of drivers, map editors and city contacts to improve the driving experience for all.\u201dWhile a number of communities have devised strategies like turn restrictions and speed humps that affect all motorists, Leonia\u2019s move may be the most extreme response.Leonia plans to issue residents yellow tags to hang in their cars, and nonresidents who use the streets in the morning and afternoon will face $200 fines. Its police department has already alerted the major traffic and navigation apps to the impending changes, which will take effect on Jan. 22 from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., and from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., seven days a week.Chief Rowe said the borough had tried closing only a handful of streets in the past, posting temporary signs and alerting the navigation apps, but with little success. Traffic either got pushed onto nearby streets or drivers simply disregarded the signs.\u201cIt\u2019s basically all or nothing,\u201d Chief Rowe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very extreme measure for very extreme traffic. Would I prefer not to do this? Of course. But I would rather try something and fail than not try anything.\u201dBorough officials say their measure is legal, although it may yet get tested in court. Some traffic engineers and elected officials elsewhere say the move may set a precedent that could encourage towns to summarily restrict public access to outsiders.\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope,\u201d said Samuel I. Schwartz, the former traffic engineer for New York City known as Gridlock Sam, and the author of the early 1990s book \u201cShadow Traffic\u2019s New York Shortcuts and Traffic Tips.\u201d \u201cWaze and other services are upsetting the apple cart in a lot of communities. But these are public streets, so where do you draw the line?\u201dLeonia\u2019s council, which voted unanimously this month in favor of the new ordinance, was careful to keep open three major roadways that are controlled by either the county or state.Mr. Schwartz pointed out that the state has ultimate authority over local roads. \u201cI\u2019d rather they put up temporary barriers,\u201d he said. \u201cTo give people summonses who might be lost or might be frantic trying to get to an appointment on time \u2014 I do worry about this type of strategy. Every town can decide that we don\u2019t want certain people to come through our community.\u201dFort Lee\u2019s mayor, Mark Sokolich, warned Leonia that its traffic-fighting strategy better not make things worse in his town. \u201cIf their initiative visits gridlock upon Fort Lee and, in particular, creates problems with our emergency service vehicles getting to and from where they need to go, they will hear from us,\u201d he said.But for residents like Melissa Soesman, a 44-year-old native of Leonia, the change cannot happen soon enough. The slender road she lives on, Irving Street, becomes a parking lot at least two or three times a week during the morning rush. On Tuesday, her son was a half-hour late to his college class because his car, which was parked on the street, was hemmed in by traffic.Some mornings, Ms. Soesman has to plead with drivers to make room for her to pull out of her driveway onto Irving Street. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific, and it\u2019s all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will see that you are trying to get out, but they won\u2019t let you. People are cranky; it\u2019s the morning. By the time they are up here, who knows how long they have been sitting in traffic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Alabama\u2019s Election Could Reshape Washington\u2019s Policy Battles: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re following today:\u2022 What\u2019s at stake in Alabama\u2022 Will Republicans enact their tax plan by year\u2019s end?\u2022 What does Apple spend its cash on? Not acquisitions.\u2022 Is Broadcom making a jobs promise it can\u2019t fulfill?\u2022 Republicans have a two-seat majority in the Senate. Alabama hasn\u2019t had a Democratic senator in 25 years, but the controversy around Roy Moore has made a once-safe seat potentially up for grabs.\u2022 Even if the tax legislation is signed into law this year \u2014 we\u2019ll get to the state of play in a moment, though there\u2019s a chance things don\u2019t get wrapped up before the holidays \u2014 Republicans still have plenty of other issues, from health care to infrastructure spending, that will have to get through the Senate.Having Doug Jones, Mr. Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, in the Senate would make that effort more difficult. (So could having a Republican senator who feuds with Mitch McConnell and other G.O.P. leaders.)That point was one of six observations that Goldman\u2019s economic team put out Tuesday. Here are a few others:The answer? Not very, especially for a company with more than $250 billion in cash on its balance sheet and a market value within spitting distance of $1 trillion.Apple has disclosed only 11 acquisitions valued at $4.5 billion in its history, according to Thomson Reuters.To put that into perspective, we asked Thomson Reuters to pull some numbers. (One note on the data below, deal values include completed acquisitions and ones that are currently pending.)\u2022 The most acquisitive company? General Electric, which has made 1,206 acquisitions valued at $311 billion. Of course, G.E. has been around for more than a century, while Apple went public in 1980. So how does Apple compare with other tech companies?\u2022 Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, HP and Intel each have made acquisitions valued at more than $50 billion.\u2022 Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which was founded in 1998, has done 223 deals valued at $29 billion. Facebook? The social media giant, which has been around since 2004, has pulled the trigger on 65 deals with a value of $23 billion.\u2022 Apple, in fact, doesn\u2019t even rank in the top 100 most acquisitive tech companies.More from Andrew\u2019s column:Mr. Tan of Broadcom has boasted that he plans to spend $3 billion \u201cin research and engineering.\u201d Mr. Tan has been given high marks for managing the portfolio of Broadcom assets effectively, but he has never been known for industry-changing innovations.Qualcomm has its own headacheWhile some analysts and investors think Qualcomm might raise its bid for NXP as a way to deter Broadcom \u2014 which doesn\u2019t want the NXP deal to become any more expensive \u2014 Qualcomm says that for now it\u2019s sticking by its $110-a-share offer.Under the terms, Interstate will become the exclusive supplier of car batteries to Advance, one of the biggest auto parts sellers in the United States starting this spring.Interstate believes that the partnership could bolster its sales significantly, while Advance is hoping that a product alliance with a well-regarded parts maker would help stanch a 43 percent drop in its stock price over the past year.From a statement by Scott Miller, Interstate\u2019s C.E.O.:This alliance places us where our professional and retail customers are making purchasing decisions, allowing Advance Auto Parts and independent Carquest stores to serve as convenient, one-stop shops to meet our customers\u2019 needs.The department\u2019s long-awaited study of the Senate Republicans\u2019 proposed overhaul runs to about 489 words in length (including the title and footnotes) and, in the reckoning of even conservative commentators, does not actually detail the legislation\u2019s economic effects.The reaction from analysts\u2022 It\u2019s \u201can odd way to analyze a tax bill,\u201d said Scott Greenberg at the Tax Foundation.\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t believe in magic,\u201d said David Brockway, a staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation during the Reagan administration.The tax flyaroundThat clears the path for Disney to buy the Fox television and movie studios, stakes in the international broadcasters Sky and Star and other significant divisions. As we said yesterday, a deal could be struck this week, though it\u2019s unclear whether an announcement would specify a role at Disney for James Murdoch. (If he does get one, it probably would involve overseeing the international broadcast businesses.)A lighter takeThe short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse. No cooperation. Misinformation. Mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem. So we are in a really bad state of affairs right now, in my opinion.Regulators have already tightened the reins on at least one digital currency matter: The food review app Munchee canceled its initial coin offering yesterday after the S.E.C. issued a warning about the forthcoming deal.The Bitcoin flyaround\u201cThose who bought bonds in the hopes of windfall profits should not be protected at the expense of the island, its economy and its future. And they should certainly not be bailed out by U.S. taxpayers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "From Ancient Myths to Modern Day, Women and the Struggle for Power", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesAccording to Aristotle, women\u2019s voices were proof of their wickedness. Virtue expressed itself in deep, full-throated sounds \u2014 the noise of the lion, the bull and (no surprise here) the human male. Women\u2019s speech, however, its pitch and prattle, was considered dangerous, even unsanitary. The very sound of their voices, it was believed, could sink the state.Has much changed? Beard points to Margaret Thatcher taking elocution lessons to deepen her voice, and to the trusty pantsuit favored by female politicians. Women are still regarded as interlopers in public life; when they seek power, drag is a must. Beard draws straight lines from the attitudes of the classical world to the sexism that attended Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign; the harassment women face online; the bomb threats that followed one scholar\u2019s suggestion that Britain might feature more women on bank notes.As if anticipating the recent outpouring of women describing their experiences of sexual harassment, she also recounts the many myths in which women are physically prevented from testifying to the violence done to them: Their tongues are torn out, they\u2019re turned into trees or animals.\u201cWhen it comes to silencing women, Western culture has had thousands of years of practice,\u201d Beard writes.Beard reminds us that histories of oppression are also always histories of subversion. \u201cOvid may have emphatically silenced his women in their transformation or mutilation, but he also suggested that communication could transcend the human voice, and that women were not that easily silenced,\u201d she writes. She reminds us that Philomela, whose tongue was cut out after she was raped, wove a tapestry portraying the crime and her assailant. She tells the story of Fulvia, the wife of Mark Antony, who visited the corpse of Cicero, who had poisonously inveighed against her husband. She plucked the pins from her hair and stabbed them into his tongue. In both stories, the traditionally female activity (weaving) or adornment (the hairpin) is used to strike at the male monopoly over language \u2014 and in the case of Fulvia, \u201cthe very site of the production of male speech.\u201dWe also must interrogate our notions of power, Beard says, and scrutinize why they exclude women; we must examine how our conceptions of authority, mastery and even knowledge are inflected by gender. \u201cYou cannot easily fit women into a structure that is already coded as male; you have to change the structure,\u201d she writes.Lest this seem hopelessly utopian, she points to those doing this very work, including the founders of Black Lives Matter: Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi. In promoting decentralized leadership and emphasizing the movement over personalities, these three women are recasting power, \u201cdecoupling it from public prestige,\u201d transforming it from a possession one can seize to an attribute that can be shared.What alternatives remain, after all? \u201cIf women are not perceived to be fully within the structures of power, surely it is power that we need to redefine rather than women?\u201d Beard points out. It\u2019s either that \u2014 or pass around the hairpins.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Antidote to Digital Dehumanization? Live Theater", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "An award-winning playwright argues that the in-the-moment interplay between actors and audience can help us cope with an increasingly virtual world.Supported byThe living presence of the audience is what strikes me as so singular about the theater, why I love working in the theater so much and why I believe in the particular importance of our beloved form right now.But first, let me say: I am not hopeful about where we are as a nation \u2014 as a species (if I can be so presumptuous). I\u2019m not hopeful, because I am increasingly of the mind that even my hope is being monetized. That which is most enduring, most noble, most human about me \u2014 my urge for something brighter, more vivid, more loving, more alive \u2014 all of this is being used against me.The attention-finance complex has given us devices to which we are tethered by more than compulsion. Our pleasure principle \u2014 long prey to the manipulations of capitalism \u2014 has been turned against us, irretrievably yoked to ends that are not ours, ends we cannot fully comprehend.Transformed into economic subjects, our humanity is being redefined; we are valuable only insofar as our economic behavior can be predicted and monetized. Indeed, the technology has enabled the very movements of our mind to become a steady stream of revenue to someone, somewhere.Somehow we are sold the story that this narrowing of the world into streams of monetized information is actually about liberation. That it represents a new era in human communication. The triumph of democracy. A victory over centralized power. All of these strike me as little more than hopeful memes sold over the very platforms they are intended to legitimize.Indeed, the great fracture begun in earnest more than 30 years ago \u2014 the collapse of a vision of collective well-being \u2014 this fracture has finally been completed. We are little more than data points in a society that isn\u2019t really that anymore. It\u2019s a marketplace, nothing more than the sum of its sold and purchased parts.A bleak vision, yes. And yet, this bleakness must also be something of a defense. My defense against the financed colonization of my desire and, yes, of my hope. A way to defend, to preserve the stirrings of the real hope inside me, what to work for, what to work toward.Which brings me to the other side of the live performance equation \u2014 the actor\u2019s body.A living being before a living audience. Relationship unmediated by the contemporary disembodying screen. Not the appearance of a person, but the reality of one. Not a simulacrum of relationship, but a form of actual relationship.The theater is an art form scaled to the human, and stubbornly so, relying on the absolute necessity of physical audience, a large part of why theater is so difficult to monetize. It only happens when and where it happens. Once it starts, you can\u2019t stop it. It doesn\u2019t exist to be paused or pulled out at the consumer\u2019s whim. It can\u2019t be copied and sold. In a world increasingly lost to virtuality and unreality \u2014 the theater points to an antidote.A living actor before a living audience. The situation of all theater, a situation that can awaken in us a recollection of something more primordial, religious ritual \u2014 the site of our earliest collective negotiations with our tremendous vulnerability to existence. The act of gathering to witness the myths of our alleged origins enacted \u2014 this is the root of the theater\u2019s timeless magic.Because whether we like to admit it or not, we herding social animals are programmed at some very profound level to think and feel as one. To me, this is why the great lie of American individualism \u2014 that my experience is the most important thing, and should be protected and enabled at all costs \u2014 why this thinking is so pernicious. It isn\u2019t really true to what we really are.But the theater is \u2014 in its essence.Indeed, at its best, it\u2019s the experience of us as one mind, one heart, one body. That live performance can synchronize the heartbeats of an audience is no surprise to any of us who ply our trade in the theater. Certainly not to any writer or director or designer who has lived through four weeks of previews trying to get those heartbeats to sync up.This sense of oneness with an audience, of losing all sense of time, of absorption in the travails and triumphs of the living actors \u2014 this is the daily antidote. For which I write. About which I dream. And from which so much of my truest hope is mined.Ayad Akhtar is the author of \u201cDisgraced,\u201d which won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and \u201cJunk,\u201d playing on Broadway through Jan. 7.

{"Headline": "The Biggest Tech Failures and Successes of 2017", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet\u2019s face it: Technology this year was one big \u201cfail\u201d after another. And the biggest loser from all of this was you.It\u2019s easy to count the ways that tech did you wrong, especially when it came to information security. On the other hand, there was also plenty of good technology this year that worked well and offered benefits for your money. So here\u2019s a review of the tech in 2017 that needed the most fixing, and the tech that was actually fixed.Epic failures this year exposed your personal data to hackers, wasted your money on unnecessary or ethically dubious products and fed you misinformation.Hackers exploited a weak point in website software to gain access to sensitive information like Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license numbers for as many as 145 million Americans. What\u2019s worse is that nobody opted in to Equifax \u2014 if you have any credit, you are probably part of the breach and vulnerable to identity theft.Equifax\u2019s top executives resigned after the scandal, but the company has yet to disclose what it will do to prevent another breach.Juicero, a Silicon Valley start-up that raised about $120 million from investors, went belly up this year. It makes the list of this year\u2019s tech failures because it created a kind of product that most of us never needed in the first place.Juicero\u2019s product? It sold a $700 juicer with a twist: The fresh produce came packaged in proprietary bags, which the juicer could press with four tons of pressure to create the juice. Because the produce came in neat packages, it could be easily discarded, sparing enthusiasts the cleanup of a typical juicer (a chore that you can easily handle with a dishwashing machine).Remember all those hate tweets that you saw about Hillary Clinton? Many of them may have been fake. Facebook and Twitter have said they are stepping up efforts to disable fake accounts. But the damage has been done. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and the social media sites did very little to prevent fake accounts from being created in the first place.On the bright side, there were high-quality products that improved your mobile life and mobile security, your gaming experiences, and your home automation.When Apple Watch debuted in 2015, it wasn\u2019t a practical product for you to buy. The smart watch was sluggish, it required an iPhone to operate, battery life was dismal and the $10,000 price tag of the 18-karat gold model was outrageous. An initial glitch caused the watch to occasionally lose cellular connection, but Apple quickly fixed the problem with a software update. More important, the new smart watch has exceptional battery life; in my tests, I had about 40 percent of battery life left, on average, after a full day of use. In addition, apps and features like the stopwatch and Siri work quickly. This is the first smart watch that feels like a mature, well-executed product that you can buy with confidence.For the last few years, your living room game console probably wasn\u2019t a Nintendo. The Japanese game company\u2019s previous console, the Wii U, was a flop. People are loving it. Nintendo has sold 10 million Switch consoles since March. In comparison, the company sold 3.9 million Wii U systems in that console\u2019s first 10 months.Year after year at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, start-ups have prophesied that everything in your home will be connected to the internet and automated with magical algorithms. That vision is finally becoming a reality. Advertisement"}

When he and his then-wife Marcie Goodman, the executive director of the Cleveland International Film Festival, got their first Weimaraner in the early \u201990s, they took one look at that magnificent gray coat and named him Spalding Gray. \u201cHe was our fur child,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cHe had the best nature and soul I\u2019ve ever experienced in a dog.\u201dOf such moments, history is made.The ColorWait.

John Williams was at a New York City fund-raiser for the Moth, the nonprofit performance group dedicated to storytelling. That night Gray was being honored posthumously and his widow, Kathleen Russo, was there to accept the award. Mr. Williams sidled up to Ms. Russo, and shyly told her his story of superfandom, which led to his dog\u2019s moniker, which led to the paint color. Ms. Russo, now the producer of NPR\u2019s \u201cHere\u2019s the Thing\u201d with Alec Baldwin and director of the audio podcasts program at Stony Brook University\u2019s Southampton campus, was tickled. She is also a practical sort. Eventually she thought, well, even though the paint was technically named after a dog, the company could at least say thank you to her husband\u2019s memory \u2014 in the form of a paint job on her home.Which is how I ended up in Sag Harbor, eating mozzarella and basil with Ms. Russo, her partner, the artist David Olson (who calls himself Dave O), and an indignant dachshund named Gertrude Stein. The house, built in 1840, is a warren of small pine-floored rooms in a blaze of different colors and odd configurations. The widow\u2019s walk was being turned into a meditation room; photographs of Gray and his children, now grown, occupied every wall and corner. (Marissa is a television producer, Forrest a composer, and Theo is a filmmaker; all, Russo notes, have found different ways to be storytellers.)The outside of the house was being painted as we ate on the terrace. It is a place that has great meaning in Ms. Russo\u2019s life, then and now. She and Spalding had purchased it in 2001. Ordinarily a frugal man who took a long time to make any kind of financial decision, he had seen this place, fallen in love and made an offer on the spot. Then came the trip to Ireland and the dark days that followed. Though he had written and performed himself out of depression many times in the past, this time he was a changed man; in the accident Gray\u2019s head and Ms. Russo\u2019s head banged together violently, and Gray was left with a traumatic brain injury that exacerbated his depression. Gray\u2019s love for the house turned into a brooding obsession. He saw signs and portents everywhere, beginning with the fact that their official moving day was Sept. 11, 2001. (Ms. Russo had the movers come back the next day.) His own mother had moved from a house she loved shortly before she killed herself. \u201cHe would repeat daily, \u2018If only we were in the old house I would be whole again,\u2019\u201d Ms. Russo recalled. \u201cHe gave that old house a lot of power, in his mind.\u201dMany grieving women would have given the house that power too, and sold it after a husband\u2019s tragic death. But first of all, Ms. Russo\u2019s three children loved it. And then, there is something about Ms. Russo, some combination of compassion and contrariness, that made her love those blameless walls even more. They told a story. And it was pretty clear, given whom she loved, that she was a sucker for a good story.Spalding Gray, the dog and the human, are long gone. Spalding Gray the color is flourishing. Ms. Russo looks at the home that is spalding gray, the color of a Weimaraner, with deep satisfaction. \u201cMy Spalding would have loved this whole weird series of coincidences,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would have written a piece about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An 8th Planet Is Found Orbiting a Distant Star, With A.I.\u2019s Help", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesWith eight planets whirling around its sun, our solar system has held the galactic title for having the most known planets of any star system in the Milky Way.But on Thursday NASA announced the discovery of a new exoplanet orbiting a distant star some 2,500 light years away from here called Kepler 90, bringing that system\u2019s total to eight planets as well. The new planet, known as Kepler-90i, is rocky and hot. It orbits its star about once every 14 days.The finding was made using data collected by NASA\u2019s Kepler Space Telescope, a planet hunter that has spotted more than 2,500 confirmed exoplanets since its launch in 2009. Unlike those previous discoveries, the new exoplanet was detected with the help of an artificial intelligence researcher at Google using a machine learning technique called neural networking.\u201cThis is the first time a neural network specifically has been used to identify a new exoplanet,\u201d said Christopher Shallue, a software engineer at Google who helped make the finding.NASA\u2019s Kepler mission has discovered more than 1,000 confirmed planets orbiting distant stars.The technology, which is loosely inspired by the human brain, is designed to recognize patterns and classify images. It can learn to tell the difference between something simple like a cat and a dog, and also to distinguish exoplanets from cosmic noise.For the project, the computer looked at a small chunk of data gathered by Kepler from 2009 to 2013. Of the 150,000 stars represented in Kepler\u2019s collection, the computer combed through 670 star systems for signs of exoplanets.Astronomers spot exoplanets when the celestial bodies move, or transit, in front of their stars. The interaction causes a dip in brightness that creates a detectable signal. So far, the data set has about 35,000 such signals. The astronomers trained the program on a set of about 15,000 signals, and it identified planets correctly 96 percent of the time.The neural network learned what was a planet and what was not a planet and was able to find the exoplanet Kepler-90i, as well as a second exoplanet named Kepler-80g around a different star system. Next, the researchers plan to explore more star systems studied by Kepler.\u201cWe plan to search all 150,000 stars in the Kepler data system,\u201d said Mr. Shallue.Andrew Vanderburg, an astronomer at the University of Texas, Austin, said that Kepler-90i is about 30 percent larger than Earth and about as hot as the planet Mercury, reaching about 800 degrees Fahrenheit.Like the other seven planets in its system, it is packed close to its star. It resembles a miniature version of our solar system, he said, where the most distant known planet is about as far away from its star as the Earth is from our sun. But there could be additional, more distant planets not yet detected because planets close to their stars may be easier for astronomers to find.\u201cThe bad news is we\u2019re not quite as special as we thought we were,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the good news is we may have a lot of cosmic company.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of cool to see which one will be proven next,\u201d said Jessie Dotson, Kepler\u2019s project scientist at NASA.Advertisement"}

Real estate developers and technology companies could see big tax cuts, while low-income households and people buying health insurance could lose out.With the bill finally headed to a vote this coming week, taxpayers are scrambling to determine whether the legislation renders them winners or losers.Under current law, that income is taxed at rates as high as 39.6 percent. Under the bill, much of that income could be taxed at a rate as low as 29.6 percent, subject to some limitations. Real estate also avoided new limits on interest deductions and retained its ability to defer taxes on the exchange of similar kinds of properties. The benefits of lower rates on pass-through income will extend to Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner\u2019s partners at real estate investment trusts as well. At the last minute, lawmakers added language to make it easier for real estate owners to avoid some of the pass-through provision\u2019s restrictions and maximize the tax benefits even more.Want to know how the tax bill will affect you? Answer these questions to find out.Plus, American companies will no longer owe full corporate taxes on future profits they say they earn abroad, providing more incentive to push income into tax haven subsidiaries.

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Repeals Net Neutrality Rules", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeveral public interest groups including Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition also promised to file a suit. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents big tech firms such as Google and Facebook, said it also was considering legal action.\u201cWe are helping consumers and promoting competition,\u201d Mr. Pai said. \u201cBroadband providers will have more incentive to build networks, especially to underserved areas.\u201dHis plan for the net neutrality rules, first outlined early this year, set off a flurry of opposition. The issue has bubbled up occasionally for more than a decade, with the debate getting more intense over the years as digital services have become more ingrained in everyday life.Critics of the changes say that consumers will have more difficulty accessing content online and that start-ups will have to pay to reach consumers. In the past week, there have been hundreds of protests across the country, and many websites have encouraged users to speak up against the repeal.In front of a room packed with reporters and television cameras from the major networks, the two Democratic commissioners warned of consumer harms to come from the changes.Mignon Clyburn, one of the Democratic commissioners, presented two accordion folders full of letters protesting the changes, and accused the three Republican commissioners of defying the wishes of millions of Americans by ceding their oversight authority.\u201cI dissent, because I am among the millions outraged,\u201d said Ms. Clyburn. \u201cOutraged, because the F.C.C. pulls its own teeth, abdicating responsibility to protect the nation\u2019s broadband consumers.\u201dBrendan Carr, a Republican commissioner, said it was a \u201cgreat day\u201d and dismissed critics\u2019 \u201capocalyptic\u201d warnings.\u201cI\u2019m proud to end this two-year experiment with heavy-handed regulation,\u201d Mr. Carr said.During Mr. Pai\u2019s speech before the vote, security guards entered the meeting room at the F.C.C. headquarters and told everyone to evacuate. The commissioners were ushered out a back door. The agency did not say what had caused the evacuation, other than Mr. Pai saying it had been done \u201con advice of security.\u201d The hearing restarted a short time later.Despite all the uproar, it is unclear how much will eventually change for internet users. Major telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast, as well as two of the industry\u2019s major trade groups, have promised consumers that their experiences online would not change.Mr. Pai and his Republican colleagues have echoed the comments of the telecom companies, which have told regulators that because of the limits to their business imposed by the rules, they weren\u2019t expanding and upgrading their networks as quickly as they wanted.\u201cThere is a lot of misinformation that this is the \u2018end of the world as we know it\u2019 for the internet,\u201d Comcast\u2019s senior executive vice president, David Cohen, wrote in a blog post this week. \u201cOur internet service is not going to change.\u201dBut with the F.C.C. making clear that it will no longer oversee the behavior of broadband providers, telecom experts said, the companies could feel freer to come up with new offerings, such as faster tiers of service for online businesses willing and able to pay for it. Some of those costs could be passed on to consumers.Those experts also said that such prioritization could stifle certain political voices or give the telecom conglomerates with media assets an edge over their rivals.These critics of Mr. Pai, who was nominated by President Trump, said there isn\u2019t enough competition in the broadband market to trust that the companies will try to offer the best services. The rule changes, they believe, give providers incentive to begin charging websites to reach consumers.\u201cLet\u2019s remember why we have these rules in the first place,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, the trade group. \u201cThere is little competition in the broadband service market.\u201dDozens of Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, have pushed for Congress to pass a law on the issue.One Republican commissioner, Mike O\u2019Reilly, said he supported a law created by Congress for net neutrality. But he said any law should be less restrictive than the 2015 rules, protecting the ability of companies to charge for faster lanes, a practice known as \u201cpaid prioritization.\u201dAny legislative action appears to be far off, however, and numerous online companies warned that the changes approved on Thursday should be taken seriously.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have net neutrality protections that enforce tenets of fairness online, you give internet service providers the ability to choose winners and losers,\u201d Steve Huffman, chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. \u201cThis is not hyperbole.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Road to Recovery ", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the aftermath of the death of our son, we felt sad, and proud \u2014 and empty. So, as a family, we tried to find ourselves on the open road.In January, our son died at the age of 5, suddenly but not unexpectedly. He had been born with a complicated heart condition that required multiple surgeries and frequent medical attention. His short life had been filled with miracles, and he had a calm spirit that balanced the normal-kid energy of his two brothers.The five of us often took road trips together in our aging but usually-reliable \u201998 Outback, the boys singing along with the Blues Brothers in the back seat. Down to the beach in blazing sun; out to their grandparents in snow and slush; back home to Brooklyn on the interstate after months at a hospital miles away.In the aftermath of his death, we felt sad, and proud \u2014 and empty.Therapists we spoke with told us the various ways that people deal with loss. My wife was an \u201cattender,\u201d immersing herself in the reality of our son\u2019s death and confronting her grief head-on.I was a \u201cdistractor,\u201d busying myself with a million little things to avoid sinking into the depths of despair. Work was an obvious outlet, but not enough. I organized our small apartment. I helped our older son build a computer. And I planned a crazy road trip. Because all I really wanted was to get away, preferably at 65 miles an hour.My wife had mentioned once that she wanted to see Mount Rushmore. That seemed pretty far away, so Mount Rushmore it would be. And then I read that there would be a total solar eclipse in late August, viewable only from a 70-mile wide strip of land far from our home.So I asked work for a month off in late summer, and they said yes. I asked my wife if she wanted to go, and she didn\u2019t say no. And, being the distractor I was, I started to plan.The route was shaped by some basic rules. We would drive no more than three or four hours a day, a pace which would get us to Rushmore and back in five weeks while giving us time to experience America along the way. We would try to only visit places we had never been before. And to avoid the frantic rush that comes from feeling a need to \u201csee it all,\u201d we picked out just one thing to do in each place we visited.Google Maps made it easy to estimate driving times, but I still went to AAA and picked up every free paper map I could find. Whenever I felt pangs of grief, I pulled out a map and immersed myself in the blank canvas of a country I\u2019d never really seen.The path I traced stretched from our home in Brooklyn across the Midwest through South Dakota, then back through Nebraska and Missouri to the Great Smoky Mountains before heading home through the Carolinas and Virginia. We would be on the road for 37 days.Every detail was entered into an ever-expanding spreadsheet that I used to record where we would sleep each night, what we could do each day, and how far we\u2019d have to drive in between. I\u2019d open it whenever my emotions got the better of me, add another row or columns, and lose myself in daydreams of the open road.All told, our route would span 17 states and 6,150 miles. In addition to Rushmore and the eclipse, we experienced:An ear-shattering Nascar truck race at Pocono Raceway; our first ever glimpse of a \u201cbutter cow\u201d at the Ohio State Fair; a bus tour along the length of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway; a visit to Lincoln\u2019s home in Springfield, Ill.; minor-league ballgames in Davenport, Iowa, and Omaha, Neb.; a game of catch at the \u201cField of Dreams\u201d movie site; a tour of the Winnebago factory; a peek at South Dakota\u2019s famous Corn Palace; five days taking it easy in the Black Hills; a five-hour day trip to Devils Tower, Wyo.; a rafting trip down Nebraska\u2019s Niobrara River; two nights in a vintage Union Pacific caboose outside of Omaha; a tram ride to the top of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis; a birthday celebration for our older son at a Nashville honky-tonk; tenting in the Great Smoky Mountains; and camping three hundred yards from the surf in a state park south of Myrtle Beach, S.C.The planning paid off. It was an incredible adventure.Along the way, our sons collected stuff: dirty stuff like bottle caps, and cool stuff, like Junior Ranger badges from national parks, monuments and historical sites. (Our older son had just finished fourth grade, so these visits were free under the \u201cEvery Kid in a Park\u201d program.) By filling out a small activity book, they\u2019d earn a small plastic badge after a special swearing in from a park ranger. They each amassed 17 badges along the way, including a special \u201ceclipse explorer\u201d badge that they were especially proud of.But an excruciatingly long day in Charleston (\u201cwe can get three badges here!\u201d) tempered our rush for badges. Fort Sumter was amazing; Fort Moutrie somewhat interesting; but while helping fill out yet another word search on the porch of the historic but relatively unexciting Charles Pinckney National Historic Site, I vowed never again to stop in a national park for a badge alone.Of course, there were a few stops that the kids didn\u2019t enjoy so much. After an embarrassing tantrum erupted at Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Stockman House in Mason City, Iowa, I taught them to just say, \u201cI\u2019m not old enough to appreciate this\u201d whenever they didn\u2019t like something.This became a running joke, especially at mealtimes. (Older and wiser, my wife and I tried all sorts of new things \u2014 from Iowa Maid-Rites to stewed bison to Missouri barbecue. Our sons, still picky eaters, stuck to hamburgers.) Unfortunately, they\u2019d forgotten all about it by the time we reached the National Quilt Museum, in Paducah, Ky. \u2014 deciding to roll on the floor in mock pain until we dragged them out of the gallery, mortified.It was probably the most useful item we brought on the entire trip. We got through the first four books, 50 hours in all (leaving another 67 for our next trip). Our older son had read them already, but as the miles flew by he was just as rapt as the rest of us. The only problem: if we stopped before a chapter ended, the boys would refuse to leave the car, begging us to turn it back on by crying \u201cHawwy Potttoooo!\u201d in mock baby voices.I\u2019d also created some Spotify playlists to keep us company, including an assortment of energetic road songs: The Muppets\u2019 \u201cMoving Right Along,\u201d Willie Nelson\u2019s \u201cOn the Road Again,\u201d Waylon Jennings\u2019 \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard Theme,\u201d and Johnny Cash singing \u201cI\u2019ve Been Everywhere.\u201d We played this every time we set out, and by the end of the trip, we were all singing it together; yelling extra loud each time Cash mentioned a place we\u2019d visited, too.We also had playlists for each state, which we\u2019d play every time we crossed a border. These always began with the local university\u2019s fight song, followed by an eclectic assortment of songs I\u2019d found online. The boys were less enthusiastic about some of them, many of which sounded like advertising jingles (I\u2019m looking at you, \u201cSweet Virginia Breeze\u201d).But there were a few offbeat hits, such as Bobby Vinton\u2019s \u201cPennsylvania Polka,\u201d Patsy Cline\u2019s \u201cBlue Mooo-oo-n! Of Kentucky\u201d and Groucho Marx\u2019s charmingly ridiculous \u201cOmaha, Nebraska\u201d (\u201cin the foothills of Tennessee \u2026 I\u2019ll meet you on the corner of Delancey Street and Avenue B\u201d). We sang these too, and even after returning home, we still do. They are the best souvenirs we have.In the months after our son\u2019s death, travel was a constant reminder of our loss, his absence distracting and disorienting. Whenever we went somewhere new, we wished he could be there to discover it with us.To ease the pain, we decided to collect stones wherever we went, inscribing each with the place and date and setting it aside in a small canvas bag. When our son\u2019s tombstone was finally set, we\u2019d bring the bag to the cemetery and stack them above his grave, according to Jewish tradition.The ritual of finding stones helped us evoke his memory and acknowledge his absence. By the time we returned home, we\u2019d collected 12 pounds of assorted rocks and pebbles, as well as a crab shell and broken sand dollar that the boys found on the beach in South Carolina.But sometimes we\u2019d leave a place having forgotten to pick one up \u2014 we were simply having too much fun \u2014 and I\u2019d be racked with guilt, almost like we\u2019d left him behind.This wasn\u2019t true the previous summer, which we mostly spent inside hospitals \u2014 clean and sterile, devoid of nature. Even flowers and plants, dangerous to some patients, were forbidden.One doctor would insist our son get outside as much as possible, even when he was sickest. Wheeled outside in a hospital bed, with nervous fellows carefully monitoring his ventilator, he would gaze at his brothers playing recklessly in the summer sun, free from the hospital\u2019s oppressive weight.He was eventually transferred to another hospital, where we discovered a small herb garden in a distant ward, a 20-minute walk from his room. It quickly became his favorite place to visit.There was something about fresh air that helped wounds heal.So, hoping for clear skies and nice weather, we\u2019d invested in a good tent and comfortable sleeping pads for our first trip without him. (The first tent we\u2019d bought barely fit into our living room \u2014 so we decided to get a larger model instead. What sort of vacation would it be if our tent was smaller than our apartment?)We spent half our nights under the stars, and I wish it could have been more. I slept better outside, and sitting around the campfire provided rare moments of peace, quiet and reflection.The boys enjoyed it too, but didn\u2019t mind being inside either. They loved hotel waffles, jumping in the pool (if there was one), and sneaking a few minutes of \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d on the Cartoon Network while we showered.But hotels, with their air conditioning, white walls, and generic art, reminded me too much of hospitals. More often than not, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep on the perfectly clean, starched sheets.After all, part of this trip was figuring out how to be together \u2014 as a family of four (rather than five), each of us wrestling with grief in their own way.As we crossed the Midwest, on the first leg of the trip, we\u2019d ask each other after each activity: \u201cdo you think he would have liked this?\u201d The consensus: he would have liked the rabbit pavilion at the Ohio State Fair, but not sure about the cow made of butter; he would have been bored at the Lincoln home in Springfield; he would have loved exploring the corn at the \u201cField of Dreams\u201d site in Iowa.But by the time we\u2019d reached South Dakota, I\u2019d tired of the question. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what we think, right?\u201d I exploded one night. \u201cBecause we\u2019ll never know.\u201d Still, I knew it was our way of remembering him, imagining him there with us \u2014 even though a trip like this was unthinkable, even when he was alive.Our boys let out anger as well, every so often \u2014 like us, their sadness mixed with normal mood swings and the exhaustion of being stuck with three other people in cramped quarters, miles from home. Being outdoors helped, open space a literal breath of fresh air, a blank canvas where they could pretend to be bison or use sticks to cast Harry Potter spells.Along the way, among the many things we saw, were constant reminders of our grief \u2014 still fresh, and raw, and real.Sometimes those reminders were direct, and blunt, such as the tombstone on display at the Lincoln presidential museum in Springfield that remembered the Lincolns\u2019 son Eddie, who died just before his fourth birthday. In the next room, reenacted in dramatic detail with period decorations and wax figures, was the White House deathbed of their eleven-year-old son Willie.Sometimes the reminders were unexpected, like the small tree I found along a nature walk in Pennsylvania\u2019s Black Moshannon State Park. As soon as I spotted it, standing by itself in a grassy patch, I knew exactly what it was; my parents had planted a similar one in a park near our home a few months before. Sure enough, a small plaque below the tree was inscribed in memory of a young boy, from his grandparents.And sometimes the reminders were just subtle enough to gently evoke painful memories. For me, it was the bright Emergency Room signs we\u2019d see when driving into an unfamiliar city late at night, the streets empty. For my wife, it was the maps; the thin red roads reminding her of our son\u2019s unique circulation, running every which way from his imperfectly formed heart.I wanted something tangible we could open in the future, with our two sons, and remember: the times we spent together, the things we saw, the meals we ate, the emotions we felt.The binders are bursting with new memories \u2014 our Great American Road Trip \u2014 and except for two laminated family photos we brought along from when our son was alive, no hint of the undercurrent of sadness that ran through it.In all honesty, the trip was probably a few days too long. There comes a time when the momentum turns: you\u2019re heading for home, and no matter what you\u2019ve planned it feels like a diversion rather than a destination. The last stretch back, through a slow drizzle across Roanoke, Va. (transportation museum), the Shenandoah Valley (livestock auction), and Harrisburg, Penn. (mini golf), was fun enough, but we all felt the gravitational tug of home.For me, returning was heartbreaking. We stopped for gas in a particularly gritty part of New Jersey (not as cheap as it used to be) and everything I\u2019d left behind started rushing back.I started the New York playlist at the top of the Outerbridge Crossing, Frank Sinatra crooning his lungs out in the jostling traffic; and whether by perfect planning or blind luck the Beastie Boys\u2019 \u201cNo Sleep Till Brooklyn\u201d kicked in just as we hit the Verrazano-Narrows and left Staten Island.And as we climbed the span, and I saw the city arise out of the gray fog, I burst into tears.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Concerns About Net Neutrality Are Overblown", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCritics worry that getting rid of neutrality regulation will lead to a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d internet: Internet service providers will start charging fees to websites and apps, and slow down or block the sites that don\u2019t pay up. As a result, users will have unfettered access to only part of the internet, with the rest either inaccessible or slow.Those fears are vastly overblown.Service providers have also blocked sites that competed with their own services. In 2004, the Madison River Telephone Company in North Carolina blocked Vonage to protect its own phone service from competition; it was fined by the F.C.C. for violating network neutrality rules. In 2012, AT&T let only some of its customers use the phone app FaceTime; after there were complaints to the F.C.C., it allowed all customers to use it.These incidents are troubling for anyone who wants on open, neutral internet. But keep two things in mind. First, these are rare examples, for a reason: The public blowback was fierce, scaring other providers from following suit. Second, blocking competitors to protect your own services is anticompetitive conduct that might well be stopped by antitrust laws without any need for network neutrality regulations.But even today, service providers can and do throttle peer-to-peer sites, as a necessary network management technique \u2014 something explicitly allowed by the rules. Some university networks also slow peer-to-peer traffic, so that other kinds of traffic are not slowed down. This has nothing to do with service providers slowing down websites that have not paid a fee.So why am I not worried? I worked for a telecommunications company for 25 years, and whatever one may think about corporate control over the internet, I know that it simply is not in service providers\u2019 interests to throttle access to what consumers want to see. Neutral broadband access is a cash cow; why would they kill it?Even if they wanted to, service providers would have a hard time extorting money from huge companies like Google and Netflix, because each service provider needs Google and its billions of users a lot more than Google needs it. Service providers could try to go after smaller websites, but they don\u2019t have much money to pay.And there\u2019s still competition: Some markets may have just one cable provider, but phone companies offer increasingly comparable internet access \u2014 so if the cable provider slowed down or blocked some sites, the phone company could soak up the affected customers simply by promising not to do so.Recently, net neutrality proponents have pointed to Portugal as an example of their nightmare scenario. A mobile carrier there offers various internet packages \u2014 one optimized for users who like video, others who like email and so on. What the carrier does not do is offer only those things, precisely because no consumer is likely to buy just video or just email (and in any case, Portugal is governed by the European Union\u2019s net-neutrality rules).The internet did not start out as a neutral invention. Instead, neutrality was an organic outcome of a competitive market. In the early days of the commercial internet, AOL and @Home had \u201cwalled gardens\u201d of content that users could get to more easily, but over time service providers stopped favoring sites and just gave customers fast, neutral internet connections. No government policy created that outcome.The good news is that we will soon have a real-world experiment to show who is right and who is wrong. The United States will get rid of its rules, and the European Union and Canada will keep their stringent regulations. In two years, will the American internet be slower, less innovative and split into two tiers, leaving Canadians to enjoy their fast and neutral net?Or, as I suspect, will the two markets remain very similar \u2014 proving that this whole agonized debate has been a giant waste of time? Let\u2019s check back in 2019. \u2610Ken Engelhart, a lawyer specializing in communications law, is a senior adviser for StrategyCorp, an adjunct professor at Osgoode Hall Law School and a senior fellow at the C.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How the media landscape has changed.Procter & Gamble has appointed the activist investor Nelson Peltz to its board following a certified recount of shareholder votes cast at its annual meeting in October, Reuters reported.At its annual shareholder meeting two months ago, Procter & Gamble said its preliminary count of proxy votes showed that it had fended off an effort by Mr. Peltz to win a seat on its board. But last month, Trian Fund Management, the investment firm controlled by Mr. Peltz, announced that a vote count by the independent inspector of elections showed that he had, in fact, been elected.Procter & Gamble waited to make Mr. Peltz a director while it looked into the election results from the independent election inspector IVS Associates.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said Friday he would vote yes after winning a more generous child tax credit in the final bill and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who voted against the initial Senate bill over deficit concerns, said he would support the legislation despite the cost of the tax cuts.The markets, which have risen and fallen with the fate of the tax bill in recent weeks, rose Friday as passage looked more certain.\u2022 The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq closed at records.\u2022 The Russell 2000 jumped 1.6 percent, its best day since Nov. 16, according to Bloomberg.\u2022 The dollar rose for the ninth time in 10 sessions.Jared Kushner\u2019s legal team is looking for a crisis public relations firm.In a statement to the Post, Mr. Lowell \u201cconfirmed he was looking for a firm that would handle media for all high-profile clients that receive attention from the press.\u201d\u201cMy law firm and I are considering hiring an outside consultant to handle the time-consuming incoming inquiries on the cases in which I am working that receive media attention.

The change would allow families with no tax liability to claim up to $1,400 in tax refunds per child, up from $1,100 in the version that passed the Senate earlier this month.The news pushed stocks higher Friday on optimism the tax legislation would be enacted. Stocks have risen and fallen in recent weeks on the prospects for the tax bill.On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index were up 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.

{"Headline": "Where There\u2019s Smoke, There Are the Traffic Reporters of Los Angeles", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFlying high above the fires charging across Los Angeles on Thursday afternoon, Mark Kono, an airborne traffic reporter, noticed that the 101 freeway was suddenly crammed with cars.He slowed the Airbus AS350 he was flying down to 60 knots. From above, he could see charred power lines that had fallen onto the highway and crews scrambling to de-electrify them. He readied his live shot and descended to an altitude of 1,500 feet.Into the smoke.\u201cYou could breathe that smoke coming through the air vents. You\u2019d feel like if you were to cough you would be coughing ash,\u201d Mr. Kono said a few hours after he and Rich Prickett, the camera operator, filed their report for KTLA Morning News. \u201cBut if we can get the shot, we\u2019ll do it.\u201dAs flames have ravaged Los Angeles, traffic reporters have emerged as lifelines through the chaos, stars in an urban, multi-fire battle that could compete with a disaster film plotline from a Hollywood studio. Their profession, sidelined in the age of apps and built-in navigation, is boosted by the thing technology still does not have \u2014 human judgment.Reporters have spent days navigating people home and keeping them out of harm\u2019s way, with guidance beyond the turn-by-turn. Where a road might appear open on an electronic map, it might in reality be under a miasma of smoke too painful for breathing. A side street may seem passable, but just out of sight, a fire could be barreling down.Unlike a pileup or a road closed for construction, the blazes are also a breaking news event, throwing traffic reporters into the same mix as their news anchor counterparts, said Sioux-z Jessup, a traffic anchor.\u201cWhat\u2019s really challenging is that there are so many fires burning right now, and I am trying to get the most accurate information to the most amount of people,\u201d Ms. Jessup said. Along with street closings and alternate routes, she said, she has spent days posting tips on Twitter, like the safest kind of gas mask to wear. \u201cYou want to give them the evacuation centers, and the school closures, and the wind conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to provide anything that they need.\u201dAt 3:10 p.m. on Thursday, Ms. Jessup went live on the air. \u201cFolks, we have now six fires burning in Southern California,\u201d she said, facing the camera. She rattled off the closings, followed by a list of evacuation centers and the number of structures and acres threatened by a fire that had erupted that morning.The conditions have introduced tremendous reporting challenges. The buffeting winds of up to 60 miles per hour that have fed the fire have grounded some traffic aircraft. Only the hardiest helicopters (more expensive ones usually operated by television stations) can withstand the current air conditions, said Desmond Shaw, who reports for both radio and TV. It has been too dangerous to fly the Cessna he reports from for KNX 1070 radio since the fires ignited. Like many of his colleagues, he must cover the story from the ground this time.The news feeds flickering on viewers\u2019 screens across the state \u2014 stark pictures of amber flames licking across mansions, horse farms and highways \u2014 belie what the reporters went through to capture them, Mr. Shaw said. \u201cThe shot is steady, but you\u2019re not seeing the chopper getting knocked around because of the stability controls the camera has,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cMeanwhile you\u2019re getting knocked around by turbulence like crazy.\u201dLos Angeles is a city of gridlock. But the fires, which have consumed more than 100,000 acres and are still raging, create an entirely different traffic scenario. \u201cYou can Google and look in Hollywood and see these are the closures for the Oscars,\u201d said Ginger Chan, a KTLA traffic anchor. \u201cThe difference is it\u2019s fluid, it\u2019s changing, the wind can shift, it can pick up.\u201dMs. Chan said officials from the Los Angeles Police Department had warned reporters on Wednesday that app-based GPS risked taking drivers into fire-affected areas. \u201cFor people who are not familiar, they are kind of trusting this blindly,\u201d said Ms. Chan, who is married to Mr. Kono, the traffic pilot. \u201cYou\u2019re running into a situation that will change on a dime, and then it\u2019s putting you in areas that could be danger zones.\u201dOn Thursday afternoon, Ms. Chan was picking up her twin 3-year-old children at school after a workday that began at 1:30 a.m., extended hours for round-the-clock fire coverage. Few of the city\u2019s veteran traffic reporters said they had ever dealt with so many simultaneous fires.\u201cIt\u2019s indescribable,\u201d said Scott Burt, an airborne traffic reporter for the radio station KNX 1070 News Radio. \u201cI have seen this before, to a certain degree, but not probably this extreme.\u201dThe work is taxing, but rewarding, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, to help people,\u201d Mr. Burt added. \u201cAnd who doesn\u2019t at work like a good challenge?\u201dAdvertisement"}

There is the panoply of home hubs and A.I. assistants that promise to make everyday life easier: Google Home can be your butler, D.J. and personal assistant. Amazon Echo can switch on the thermostat, share the local news and answer the kids\u2019 burning questions.I\u2019m not opposed to connected devices. These products can be silly, yes, but they can also be delightful and useful. Smart appliances and A.I. assistants can make us more efficient, encourage healthier lifestyles and connect us to the things we love. Saying \u201cAlexa, play \u2018Silent Night\u2019 \u201d is easier than rooting around for that dusty Bing Crosby vinyl.But connected devices also bring the worst parts of the web more intimately into our lives: hacking, surveillance, harassment. These are knotty issues with dire consequences. They\u2019re bad enough when confined to adults\u2019 desktops and tablets. What happens when they permeate our kids\u2019 toys?Complicating all this is the lackluster state of online privacy and security protections. In the United States in particular, we don\u2019t have very many rules or regulations defending consumers\u2019 online privacy. There aren\u2019t universal trust marks that clearly articulate a product\u2019s security or how consumers\u2019 personal data is used. And there\u2019s limited accountability. Sometimes, a company\u2019s privacy error results in little more than bad P.R.In the short term \u2014 this holiday season \u2014 avoid products where the risks outweigh the value, especially when they\u2019re for your kids, who aren\u2019t in a position to agree to take any risk at all. Does your elementary school student really need a toothbrush with location tracking?Next, do your due diligence. Ask important questions: What personal data is collected, and how is it stored? Is it encrypted? Can the device be updated if a security vulnerability is detected? You can find answers on manufacturers\u2019 websites, in privacy policies and on product forums.If you don\u2019t like the answers you find or if you simply can\u2019t find them, select a gift that takes your privacy and security more seriously.

Invading Our Lives", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Cade Metz, a technology reporter for The Times based in San Francisco, discussed the tech he is using.You write a lot about artificial intelligence. What is the strongest A.I. product that people can use right now?It is very good at recognizing what you say, and it responds in a voice that sounds more human than most computer noises we are used to. Researchers at a Google A.I. lab in London built a system that learns to speak by analyzing recordings of human voices and identifying the patterns that make them human.But it still doesn\u2019t sound exactly like a human. And though the Google Assistant \u2014 like other digital assistants from the likes of Amazon and Apple \u2014 does a decent job of responding to some questions and commands, it is a long way from not just recognizing but actually understanding conversational speech.That is the story of A.I. over the last five years. The improvements have been enormous. But there is still a very long way to go.Do you use it at all to help you do your work?At least in my own head, this makes good sense. I don\u2019t cover a consumer technology company. I cover the people and the ideas that are driving the next wave of technologies. And I took at where these technologies will take us \u2014 for better or for worse.But here is what I would like: a service that automatically transcribes my recorded interviews. There are services that use humans to do this, but they\u2019re expensive. Speech recognition technology has improved to the point where machines should be able to quickly and accurately do this for me on the cheap.What are the potential pitfalls of so much A.I. in our lives?The other worry is that the rise of certain technologies \u2014 including autonomous cars and other robotics \u2014 will significantly shift the job market. This is sure to happen at some point, but experts disagree on when.Tech companies have hyped up virtual reality for the last few years. But VR is still mostly a gaming accessory. Do you think it will ever be used by everyday people?Like A.I., V.R. is overhyped. The difference is that A.I. is changing the everyday world in very real ways. Look at the Amazon Echo, the autonomous cars now being tested in places like the Phoenix area, the enormous improvements of widely used services like Google Translate. V.R. is, as you say, still mostly a gaming accessory.But everyday use? That is not happening anytime soon \u2014 especially for people like me, who wear glasses and don\u2019t like heavy equipment strapped to our heads.What tech product do you love using in your daily life?Apple\u2019s iTunes. And the Amazon Kindle app. And Stitcher, a podcast app that reliably delivers everything from Revisionist History to archived episodes of Desert Island Discs. I also like my headphones.The beauty of technology is that you can read, watch and listen to anything you want when you want it. Almost.This fear is blown way out of proportion. But that might be a good thing. Though the Skynet scenario is unlikely to be a problem for many, many years \u2014 the far more immediate worry is the coming shift in the job markets from automation, and that is still years away \u2014 we certainly don\u2019t want Skynet catching us unawares.Advertisement"}

In a very simplified world, cutting the tax rate by 1 percentage point adds almost $2 to the S&P 500\u2019s earnings per share, according to Citigroup estimates. Based on a tax rate falling from 35 percent to 21 percent, that\u2019s $28 of extra earnings per share \u2013 or $280 billion in total, according to a Breakingviews analysis.

In an effort to answer that question, one of our producers, Lynsea Garrison, reached out to Derek Black.Derek had been on track to become a powerful figure in the American white nationalism movement \u2014 his father was the creator of Stormfront, the internet\u2019s first and largest white nationalist site, and his godfather was none other than David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Derek was called the \u201cleading light\u201d of the movement. But he rejected that destiny, turning away from his family and upbringing. If anyone might help explain the movement\u2019s recent emboldening, and the perception by its members that, after decades on the fringes, they had an ally in the country\u2019s highest office, it seemed it would be Derek.Lynsea was skeptical that he\u2019d agree to talk; she had tried to book him for interviews in the past, on behalf of other news organizations, and he had said no. But the scene in Charlottesville had shaken him as much as it had our listeners. He was ready to talk.On today\u2019s episode:We listen to the original interview and, afterward, speak with Derek in our New York studio about what\u2019s happened to him \u2014 and the movement he was poised to lead \u2014 since we last spoke.Background reading:If you don\u2019t see an audio player on this page or to subscribe to The Daily for free, follow the instructions below.From your mobile device:From a desktop or laptop:Click the \u201cplay\u201d button above to start the show.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "IFAt the November New York Times DealBook conference, executives indicated in a survey that A.I. is becoming a much bigger priority. In the survey, 64 percent said they plan to invest in A.I. over the next three years.Still, while executives know that A.I. is critical, 35 percent said their top challenge is understanding exactly what an A.I. solution involves, while 22 percent said budget is an obstacle to implementation. Even so, more executives know that if they don\u2019t adopt A.I., their companies are at risk of being left in the digital dust.\n To get a better idea of how these technologies are reshaping the business world, we spoke with three business leaders about their approaches to A.I.We\u2019re looking at it. It\u2019s possible it could help us value some of the lower valued items we sell.  Researching a particular item often involves finding and organizing data from the past, and A.I. could empower our specialist staff to be much more efficient in their estimating.Within the next year or two. We\u2019ve hired a data analyst and a data scientist, and we have a technical team ready to start automating pieces of the process. It can be transformative. Routine manual processes are already being done in many different businesses by machines, and the price of those machines is falling rapidly. Cognitive routine processes are also moving to machine learning rapidly. You\u2019ve seen this with banks, credit card processing and real estate decisions. There are very few businesses where some portion of the employment base is not doing some version of manual or cognitive routine tasks.Some larger companies may be saying \u201cWe do this the best, and we can do it the old way.\u201d Sotheby\u2019s is not, so is this a lesson for other big, legacy brand names?\nI struggle to come up with an industry that\u2019s more than 10 years old that isn\u2019t facing some version of material disruption. In March next year it\u2019ll be our 274th birthday. You don\u2019t last that long unless you have a very strong business model, but you also have to keep innovating. What we\u2019re trying to do now is embrace technologies and accelerate that rate of innovation.Typically, if I buy a couch, someone shows me the couch and then leaves me to my own devices to figure out the rug, and end table, and lamps that go with it. It\u2019s similar in the clothing world, where we usually buy just a shirt, but we all wear a whole outfit every day. So, we take all the information a brand has and, through machine learning, create new outfits out of every product in their catalogue. We use a lot of natural language processing to parse through the text associated with a product to determine information about it that may not be available to others.We work with major corporations, and it is often hard for them to move fast or do anything different. So, we said let\u2019s work with whatever data or processes you already have. Most retailers have product feeds, which is a giant file that has all their products and all their attributes listed out. We\u2019ll get a copy. Once we get that file, the machine learning processing happens. We calculate outfits in real-time, on the fly, when a customer visits a product page online. This has made our clients happy and increased their revenues considerably.We\u2019re not replacing jobs. We\u2019re helping the merchandisers who hated doing this. It lets them use their skills for something only a human can do. That\u2019s the positive promise of A.I. \u2014 it might replace some tasks, but hopefully you can shift what you\u2019re doing to the more high-level tasks that only a human can do within your company.The threat they\u2019ll be disrupted. In some organizations, like universities, change is not a friendly partner. What we can see is places just going out of business because they can\u2019t adapt, and in some cases they don\u2019t have the resources to adapt. But there is potential, because there are venture capitalists who can begin building organizations that can do this.It can \u2014 I think around disease, for sure. But it may be dealt with by businesses instead of philanthropy. The people who really should deploy A.I. are those such as governments, but that\u2019s not a general practice yet. They\u2019d need to work with a company like Intel that can help speak out on the potential for disruption, help build leadership groups in the business community and then make available its skills and technology to develop solutions.Some organization are trying to figure out ways to help people that have questions related to their jobs. They see A.I. as an opportunity to answer those questions, without having workers fight their way through all the different personnel programs or H.R. people inside of a company. An organization can essentially build a set of services that are really not available otherwise, all based on A.I.   The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Lenders Collect Invasive Data and Offer Billions. Beijing Is Worried.", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Bai Shichao has a debt problem that is bigger than his paycheck \u2014 and that\u2019s a problem for the rest of China, too.Mr. Bai, a 30-year-old Beijing deliveryman, has borrowed heavily from China\u2019s growing ranks of online cash lenders. In a country that lacks reliable ways to tell who might be a good borrower, these lenders use artificial intelligence and oddly personal data \u2014 like tracking how fast prospective borrowers type on their phones \u2014 to determine who will pay them back.With Mr. Bai, they have failed. First he borrowed to start a business. When that went bust, he borrowed to bet on coal, rapeseed oil and sugar on China\u2019s futures markets. Soon Mr. Bai began borrowing from one lender to pay another.Today, Mr. Bai is more than $5,000 in debt, on a paycheck of less than $600 a month.\u201cIt\u2019s like gambling,\u201d said Mr. Bai, a university dropout who has cycled through a series of menial jobs like security guard and waiter. \u201cYou start to gamble. Soon you get addicted to it.\u201dWith more than $100 billion worth of loans and rising worries among Chinese consumers about privacy, Beijing is moving to rein in a freewheeling, well-funded boom in online personal loans.In November, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, stopped companies and people from starting new online cash lending platforms. In early December, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said it would crack down on unlicensed cash loan companies and put a lid on high-interest loans.China\u2019s small loans are piling up. More than 8,600 companies offer some form of small loan, and about $145 billion of those debts remain unpaid, according to the People\u2019s Bank of China. Other estimates run as high as $392 billion, according to the Boston Consulting Group. The government does not track default rates among online lenders, which disclose little on their own.\u201cWe are worried that in an environment where there is no effective credit system, people tend to overborrow, especially when capital comes in,\u201d said Bai Chengyu, an executive at the China Association of Microfinance, who is no relation to Bai Shichao.These lenders originally emerged as a solution to that problem: how to lend to people with no credit history. By most estimates, that could total about one billion people.China turned to the fast-moving technology sector. Today, thousands of Chinese apps offer cash or financing, often within seconds, based on a wide array of sometimes deeply personal information. China\u2019s biggest internet companies and financial names are funding the effort.Two years ago the central bank asked China\u2019s most successful internet companies \u2014 including affiliates of the sophisticated online giants Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group \u2014 to create their own credit ratings systems. Since then, it has declined to issue licenses that would formalize those systems, and officials have indicated in local news reports that the plan has fallen short of expectations.Last month, an internet financial association affiliated with the People\u2019s Bank of China announced plans to start a system that would crunch data from China\u2019s big tech firms. Few details were provided.The new online lending platforms also raise issues of privacy, a new but growing area of public concern in China. Many platforms that track smartphone use have access to data like location services, phone contact lists and call logs that can be used to track and harass delinquent borrowers.\u201cThe government has struggled a lot because they realize that consumers\u2019 personal information is everywhere,\u201d said Liu Yue, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group in Beijing. \u201cBut they don\u2019t really know how to change that because the data is already being used.\u201dMr. Bai of the China Association of Microfinance added that \u201csome cash loan companies use all kinds of soft violence to press customers to pay their loans back.\u201dLast month, Guangdong Province in southern China warned that more than a dozen apps had security loopholes that allowed companies to steal user information. Some of this information was then used to harass borrowers and their friends and families.One of those was an app called Paipaidai. Its parent company, PPDAI Group, recently listed its shares in New York. The Guangdong authorities said the app sends out users\u2019 contacts without permission. The practice \u201cseriously exposed users\u2019 privacy,\u201d the authorities said.One Paipaidai borrower, a man named Lin in a small town in Fujian Province called Quanzhou, said he had racked up about $75,000 in loans from 30 different platforms for living expenses and an investment in a shoe store. Mr. Lin, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of reprisal from debt collectors, said he received multiple calls a day from them.Mr. Lin showed images of text messages from one called Yongsheng Outsourcing that threatened to \u201cuse whatever method to deal\u201d with debt that he owed to Paipaidai. When contacted by The New York Times, a person at that number declined to say whether he worked for Yongsheng or Paipaidai.Paipaidai did not respond to requests for comment.Bai Shichao, the food deliveryman with the growing debt problem, tapped some of China\u2019s most closely watched and best-funded online lending services during his borrowing spree.One of those was a company named Smart Finance. Its app \u2014 Yongqianbao, or \u201cuse wallet\u201d in Chinese \u2014 helps it build a credit rating system based on 1,200 data points related to user behavior. Yongqianbao then connects potential borrowers with lenders. Backed by the venture capital vehicle of Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google China and a prominent start-up investor in China, it has approved 1.5 million loans a month.Its algorithms look for correlations between behavior and repayment history \u2014 and some of those are unusual. Yongqianbao considers how quickly people type on their phones, how often they eat takeout or how much power is left on their smartphone batteries when they apply for the loan. It also evaluates whether the borrower took the time to read the Yongqianbao user agreement. Approval can come in eight seconds or less.\u201cIt is hard to determine how the machine knows,\u201d said Jiao Ke, a former Baidu product manager who created Smart Finance, \u201cbut it is much more accurate\u201d than a traditional loan officer.Even borrowers like Mr. Bai who don\u2019t pay back \u2014 what Mr. Jiao calls a \u201ccontrolled delinquency\u201d \u2014 help the company by providing data, the company says.Smart Finance uses repayment behavior data to help strengthen its credit rating system, \u201cbut there is still a long way to go,\u201d said Carrie Fang, a spokeswoman for Smart Finance.Mr. Bai said he received a $270 loan from Yongqianbao in September. Thanks to the high interest rate, the balance had grown to more than $330 by mid-November.In exchange for loans, he has given lending platforms considerable personal information \u2014 and they are now using it. First they called the people he listed as emergency contacts, he said. Then they started calling other people on his phone contacts.Some debt collectors sent him texts saying they could trace his location through his phone. \u201cIt is meant to threaten you,\u201d Mr. Bai said. That ability could not be independently verified. In addition to the thousands that he owes to cash lenders, Mr. Bai owes more than $2,000 for rent and other personal debts.Mr. Bai said he now realized that it was not worth trading his privacy for quick cash. \u201cBut at that time, whenever I saw a cash loan service,\u201d he said, \u201cI wanted to borrow.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kirsten Gillibrand, Long a Champion of Women, Finds the Nation Joining Her", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor much of the year, Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s critics \u2014 sensing a presidential aspirant in their midst \u2014 had assumed that the New York senator could not hear enough about herself. For one day at least, it appeared she had.What, exactly, had the president said about her? her son asked.\u201cHe thinks mommy is doing a bad job,\u201d she recalled telling him, taking care to censor.After a Senate career spent elevating victims of sexual harassment and assault as a defining political focus, Ms. Gillibrand has assumed her place at the head table of the Democrats\u2019 anti-Trump movement. The reason is simple: Her cause became the country\u2019s. And she has made sure to stay out front in the reckoning.Ms. Gillibrand was the first in her caucus to say Senator Al Franken of Minnesota should resign. She was the first prominent Democrat to say President Bill Clinton should have left office for his own sexual misconduct in the 1990s. She called for Mr. Trump to step down, citing his \u201cnumerous\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d accusers. Then came Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter counterpunch, which was widely viewed as innuendo-laden and which Ms. Gillibrand denounced as a \u201csexist smear.\u201dYet Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s strengthening hand in national Democratic politics owes to more than mere circumstance. Circumstance does not transform an upstate congresswoman, who once boasted of keeping guns under her bed and pushed English as the official language of the United States, into an avatar of progressivism in 2017.Ever since her long-shot entrance into a 2006 House race against an entrenched Republican in a conservative district, Ms. Gillibrand has been underestimated. Colleagues in the House once derided her as \u201cTracy Flick,\u201d the hyper-ambitious blonde played by Reese Witherspoon in the movie \u201cElection.\u201d And when David A. Paterson, New York\u2019s governor at the time, made her the shock pick to fill Hillary Clinton\u2019s Senate seat in 2009, she was immediately seen as vulnerable, especially from the left.\u201cShe had very middle-of-the-road points of view,\u201d Mr. Paterson said. \u201cIt just kind of appeared that she sort of flipped. I think in retrospect, it would have been better to evolve.\u201dThat knock has not stuck, and she appears to be looking at the next rung of the political ladder. While Ms. Gillibrand and her political team play down all talk of 2020, saying she is focused on her own 2018 re-election and those of her fellow Senate Democrats, she has for months been doing the type of spadework endemic to past presidential candidates: expanding her fund-raising network, courting key constituencies like black voters and polishing her image nationally.Long a talented fund-raiser, Ms. Gillibrand has cultivated a flourishing network of small donors, raising nearly $3 million in the first three quarters of 2017 from people who gave less than $200, more than she had in the previous eight years combined from such donors. Google searches for \u201cGillibrand 2020\u201d are sometimes topped by ads for her campaign website reading, \u201cJoin the Resistance \u2014 Stand with Kirsten Gillibrand.\u201d\u201cShe was taking on powerful men and calling out sexual harassment and assault long before there was a hashtag,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada.Ms. Gillibrand has also seemed eager to make inroads with black audiences who are central to any Democratic presidential candidate. She has appeared recently on the programs of two figures in the African-American community: DeRay Mckesson, the influential Black Lives Matter activist, and Zerlina Maxwell, a former aide to Mrs. Clinton who now heads progressive programming at Sirius XM.Ms. Maxwell said Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s team reached out after Mrs. Clinton appeared on her show this fall. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Democrat and you want to run for president in 2020 and you\u2019re not really engaging black voters, you\u2019re going to lose,\u201d Ms. Maxwell said.This week, Ms. Gillibrand was engaging everyone, with an assist from Mr. Trump.Her Twitter response, which she drafted in a minuteslong phone call with her aides as she stepped out of a bipartisan Bible study (\u201cYou cannot silence me,\u201d it began), became the most widely shared missive of her career.By the next day, it had more than six times as many retweets as Mr. Trump\u2019s initial blast.\u201cI think the entire world is now ready for this conversation,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said in an interview. \u201cAnd I think it really was brought on by the election of President Trump.\u201dMs. Gillibrand is not universally beloved in the Capitol, where her near-blanket opposition to even uncontroversial Trump administration nominees was met with eye rolls from some peers.Her moment at center stage follows notable turns from some other members of the so-called 2020 caucus, as some on Capitol Hill have labeled the presidentially curious.That Ms. Gillibrand would become the latest female lawmaker with an elevated profile in the Trump age is little surprise to Democrats.\u201cMisogyny is such a core aspect of Trump,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a former top aide to Mrs. Clinton and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cIt makes it quite natural for female politicians on the left to be his foil because standing up to him on those issues is so core to taking him on in general. Male politicians are trying to keep up.\u201dMs. Gillibrand evinces an aw-shucks political persona, but she was born into a deeply political family, the daughter of a prominent Albany lobbyist and the granddaughter of Dorothea \u201cPolly\u201d Noonan, a key aide to the longtime Democratic kingmaker in town, Mayor Erastus Corning.Mr. Paterson\u2019s choice in 2009, which he considers a signal achievement of his tenure, came down to a simple calculation: He was deciding between Ms. Gillibrand and Andrew M. Cuomo, then New York\u2019s attorney general and now its governor, he said. And only one of them had a certain future with or without his help.\u201cAndrew Cuomo was destined to go beyond where he was,\u201d he said, \u201cKirsten Gillibrand, not necessarily.\u201dIn the years since, it has been a testament to Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s political skills that she managed her shape-shifting without, for the most part, alienating a Democratic base that can be fickle about such things, or attaining a reputation as a politician with no core. The Republican National Committee flooded inboxes with 4,000 words of prepackaged research on Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s fluid positions in an effort to change that this week.\u201cThere have been some criticisms of her for being opportunistic,\u201d said Michele Jawando, a former chief counsel to Ms. Gillibrand in the Senate. \u201cBut she lives her life with deep empathy and compassion for other people. It\u2019s not a farce. It\u2019s not a fake thing.\u201dHer latest flourish: saying Mr. Clinton should have resigned as president, despite the fact that he has campaigned and raised money for her and that Mrs. Clinton wrote the forward to Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s book.Her fans do not much care. She keynoted the anti-Trump Women\u2019s Convention in Detroit this October. The late-night comedian Samantha Bee wrote on Twitter that she hoped Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet would be Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s \u201csuperhero origin story and ignite her 2020 campaign.\u201d (Later, Ms. Gillibrand filmed a brief segment for Ms. Bee\u2019s show.)\u201cI\u2019ve been stopped by people on the street, like, literally nonstop in the last 48 hours,\u201d she said in the interview.At the same time, supporters say, Ms. Gillibrand has earned a reputation for aggressively pursuing Republican colleagues to sign onto her efforts, from changing procedures for reporting sexual assault in the military to rolling out a host of Republican co-sponsors this week for a bill to overhaul sexual harassment procedures in Congress.One of her best-known fights, legislation to provide benefits to 9/11 emergency responders, placed her in the company of sharply divergent constituencies.She also became friendly with emergency workers like John Feal, who lost part of his foot after helping to clear debris at ground zero.

{"Headline": "Tracking Dolphins With Algorithms You Might Find on Facebook", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesKeeping track of dolphins is a slippery, patchy process. First, you must procure time on a ship or aircraft, which is expensive. After that, what you see depends on uncontrollable factors like weather, ocean conditions and whether the creatures happen to be hanging out at the sea\u2019s surface.As an alternative, researchers have tried deploying underwater sensors to eavesdrop on the clicks dolphins use for echolocation, which can give clues about the aquatic mammals\u2019 numbers, distributions and behaviors. Sifting through all these data, however, becomes a new headache.\u201cI tried for many years to really wrap my head around patterns in the dolphin signals,\u201d said Dr. Frasier, who is now an assistant project scientist at Scripps. \u201cI could get somewhere, but it took a long time and was kind of subjective.\u201dShe wondered if she could leverage the machine learning techniques used by Google and Facebook \u2014 \u201ctools literally designed for big data,\u201d she said \u2014 to improve on the painstaking process.Next, the program grouped together five-minute chunks with similar average click rates and frequency profiles. It worked much like the online algorithms that recommend social media contacts, music or advertisements to us, though in a much simpler way, Dr. Frasier said.While it previously took her three weeks to analyze a year\u2019s worth of recordings from a single site, the algorithm took about four days to sort through two years of data from five sites.Through an \u201cunsupervised\u201d process \u2014 meaning the authors did not train the algorithm to recognize any particular categories beforehand \u2014 the program came up with seven discrete click clusters.They surrounded the divers and started clicking \u2014 they seemed to be saying hello. Read and then take a swim with whales in a virtual reality feature.She and her collaborators also speculated that two of the other click types possibly belonged to short-finned pilot whales and false killer whales, both members of the oceanic dolphin family that live in the Gulf of Mexico.For now, the researchers can\u2019t rule out the possibility that their click types come from other factors, such as dolphins altering the sounds they make based on context, or signals being captured differently at varying distances and angles from the sensors, Dr. Frasier acknowledged.But she\u2019s passionate about this technology\u2019s future. Improving scientists\u2019 ability to track dolphin populations is not just a matter of helping dolphins, she said. Along with other marine mammals, dolphins reflect overall ocean health, meaning researchers can use them as a window into understanding changing ocean conditions.\u201cMy goal is that we free ourselves up to ask more interesting questions,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can spend less time manually picking through data and assigning labels, we can start looking at the bigger picture.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But, uh, I guess the opposite of that.All of this seems completely unsustainable to me. And by the time our readers read this newsletter, I can\u2019t even fathom what the price is going to be.I\u2019m not a fortune teller, but even though the market is very volatile, Bitcoin has achieved a level of stickiness in the culture that will keep its price fairly high. Like all network technologies (as well as currencies), Bitcoin gets its utility from the number of people who are committed to it. There are lots of people and technologies around the world now hooked into it, and they are slowly coming up with uses for it, giving it a kind of built-in momentum.In other words, even though it may crash in the short run, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s near its ultimate price.I do wonder, though, what it will take to bring Bitcoin truly mainstream. I\u2019m a tech-savvy person, and even I need to read an entire Wikipedia article just to figure out what I\u2019m buying with a Bitcoin and how to spend it.

{"Headline": "The Alt-Right Created a Parallel Internet. It\u2019s an Unholy Mess.", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIf you\u2019ve lost sleep worrying about the growing power of the alt-right \u2014 that shadowy coalition that includes white nationalists, anti-feminists, far-right reactionaries and meme-sharing trolls \u2014 I may have found a cure for your anxiety.Just try using its websites.More than a dozen \u201calt-tech\u201d companies have now emerged, each promising a refuge from political correctness and censorship. There is Gab, a kind of alt-Twitter social network that began last year, whose early adopters included prominent figures like Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website. There is WrongThink (alt-Facebook), PewTube (alt-YouTube), Voat (alt-Reddit), Infogalactic (alt-Wikipedia) and GoyFundMe (alt-Kickstarter). There is even WASP.love, a dating site for white nationalists and others \u201cwishing to preserve their heritage.\u201dRecently, I spent several days testing a number of these alt-tech services. I created accounts, explored their features and interfaces, and interviewed users of each site about their experiences. (With my wife\u2019s permission, I even created a WASP.love profile and advertised myself as a New York journalist looking to interview lovelorn white supremacists. Oddly, I got no takers.)What I found on these sites was more pitiful than fear-inspiring. Sure, some alt-tech platforms were filled with upsetting examples of Nazi imagery and bigoted garbage. But most were ghost towns, with few active users and no obvious supervision. As technology products, many are second- or third-rate, with long load times, broken links and frequent error messages. A few had been taken offline altogether.If the alt-right\u2019s ideology harks back to 1940s Germany, its web design might transport you to 1990s GeoCities. Even the movement\u2019s own adherents have grown frustrated. One Gab user, who claimed to be using the site while temporarily suspended from Twitter, complained in a public post about the site\u2019s technical inferiority.\u201cI\u2019m an investor in Gab,\u201d wrote the user, who goes by the username @AnewThomasPaine. \u201cI believe in the idea, but I\u2019m disappointed in the platform.\u201d In another message, he wrote: \u201cI barely use it as there are few active users, and few essential features even after a year.\u201dGab\u2019s founder, Andrew Torba, declined to comment on the site\u2019s progress, telling me in a Gab message that \u201cI don\u2019t do interviews with fake news outlets.\u201dInstead, I spoke with Cody Wilson, a developer in Texas who is behind another alt-tech service. Mr. Wilson\u2019s product, a crowdfunding site called Hatreon, was meant to give alt-right personalities and others a way to raise money for projects deemed too risqu\u00e9 for mainstream crowdfunding platforms such as Patreon and Kickstarter.Hatreon got off to a fast start, with more than 400 creators raising about $25,000 per month on the platform. But lately, it has fallen into disrepair. According to Mr. Wilson, a major credit card company, which he declined to name, kicked Hatreon off its network last month, preventing many users from funding projects on the site and all but killing the company\u2019s prospects for growth. Today, visitors to Hatreon are greeted by a message saying that \u201cpledging is currently disabled while we upgrade our systems.\u201dMr. Wilson, who does not describe himself as alt-right, said he has accepted that building a viable alt-tech business might be impossible, given the practical constraints.\u201cI don\u2019t understand how any of them plan to be profitable,\u201d he said.Far-right activists have been trying to build alternative tech platforms for years, with little success. A decade ago, white nationalist websites with names like New Saxon and PodBlanc sprang up to compete with Myspace, Friendster, and the other social giants of the era. But most of those sites fizzled when their creators ran out of money or got into legal trouble. And none came close to reaching a large mainstream audience.But Mark Pitcavage, who studies right-wing extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, told me that alt-tech companies face several structural barriers. Not only do they have to build a compelling product and attract users \u2014 a steep challenge even in the best of circumstances \u2014 but they must do it without access to mainstream funding sources, such as venture capital firms and angel investors, which provide much of the fuel for other tech start-ups. They also rely on finding companies that are willing to host their services and process their payments.\u201cBeing on the internet is a group venture,\u201d Mr. Pitcavage said. \u201cYou rely on an internet service provider, a domain name service, a credit card processor. It\u2019s a very common thing for one or more of these entities not to want to do business with a white supremacist group.\u201dThere is also a talent shortage among alt-tech companies, many of which rely on volunteers, and few of which can afford to pay the kinds of salaries demanded by top-tier programmers.\u201cSpeaking frankly, you\u2019re not getting 10x engineer talent with these people,\u201d said Mr. Wilson of Hatreon, using a popular Silicon Valley term for a star employee. \u201cNo one\u2019s lining up for this.\u201dAlt-tech is also a victim of the same market forces that have held back other small tech start-ups. Much of the internet\u2019s basic architecture is controlled by a handful of gatekeepers \u2014 Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon among them. Those companies run back-end services that allow developers to build reliable products, the app stores that allow them to reach a mass audience, and the advertising platforms that allow them to make money. Without the support of Silicon Valley\u2019s giants, it\u2019s nearly impossible to compete, no matter what your political views are.\u201cIf someone with sufficient money and determination magically materialized, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible, but even then it wouldn\u2019t be easy,\u201d Mr. Pitcavage said.The good news for the alt-right\u2019s detractors, then, is that the movement\u2019s vision of a flourishing parallel internet seems doomed to fail.The bad news is that, without a functional alternate ecosystem, it may be harder to quarantine the views of neo-Nazis and other noxious ideologues to little-used corners of the internet, far from the vast majority of users. Facebook, Twitter, and other mainstream services will continue to be the dominant venue for ideological battles, and keeping these platforms free of hate and misinformation will remain those companies\u2019 responsibility. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re up to the challenge.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Missed Out on China. Can It Flourish in India?", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJODHPUR, India \u2014 Every month, about four million more Indians get online. They include people like Manju, a 35-year-old seamstress in this city of ancient palaces, who got her first internet phone last week.\u201cIt\u2019s all finished,\u201d she complained on Monday when a Google researcher came to visit to ask about her online habits.Google, which missed out on the rise of the internet in China, is determined not to make the same mistake in India. It has marshaled some of its best developers, designers and researchers to figure out how to adapt or completely rethink products like YouTube to serve the needs of mobile internet users with smaller budgets but big aspirations.\u201cWe have to figure out how to build the right products for them,\u201d said Caesar Sengupta, the Google vice president who oversees Next Billion Users, its unit dedicated to creating products for emerging markets like India, Brazil and Indonesia. \u201cThis is a very high priority for Google.\u201dMany of the new Indian users have basic phones, which make it difficult for them to run certain apps or to store big files like videos. Data plans are limited, and despite a telecom price war that has cut the price of a megabyte of data by as much as 97 percent, some customers are unable to afford more data when they run out.Google\u2019s Android software and apps like the Chrome browser, Maps and YouTube are often included with smartphones. But Facebook also makes products that vie for the attention of Indian consumers and advertisers.In fact, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram \u2014 all Facebook products \u2014 occupied three of the top six spots this year when the research firm App Annie measured how Indians spent their time online.Arjun Vishwanathan, associate director of emerging technologies at IDC India, said that search, Google\u2019s core expertise, was \u201cculturally not that important to Indians.\u201d\u201cWhere Google scores is its ability to keep it simple and keep it convenient while letting the consumer decide what she wants to do without being in her face,\u201d he said. Google also has vast amounts of data about its users that can be valuable in developing new products and targeting ads, he said.All of the work is backed by an extensive research effort by Google in India and other developing countries to examine how people really use their phones, what needs are unmet and how the company\u2019s apps are received.Datally was a product of such research. When a user opens it, a big screen pops up and shows how much mobile data the person has used, measurable by day, week or month. It also shows which apps are using the data and allows users to block some or all of them. A recent tweak added a feature for finding nearby Wi-Fi hot spots.Ted McCarthy, a Google user experience researcher, was in Jodhpur on Sunday and Monday to gather feedback on Datally and another app, a voice-controlled virtual assistant that is made to work on a $23 feature phone. He quizzed Indians about their internet use, their habits, even how they commuted to work, collecting information to take back to the team.One of the interview subjects, Deepika Panwar, 22, works in a bookkeeping job while trying to start a clothing and jewelry business. Most of her salary, Ms. Panwar said, goes to her parents to help support her younger brother and sister. She spends 179 rupees a month, or about $2.77, for a cellphone line with one gigabyte of data.She said her monthly data pack was often gone in 15 days as she browsed YouTube for fashion videos, used WhatsApp or surfed the web.When Mr. McCarthy showed her Datally, Ms. Panwar quickly grasped what it was about. \u201cIt is showing me what each application is doing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be a great help to me.\u201dThe interviews confirmed to Mr. McCarthy that Datally\u2019s fundamental premise was sound: The tool would be useful to people with data constraints. But they also revealed a couple of problems. The app\u2019s Wi-Fi finder had few public hot spots to suggest. And the technical language on the sign-up screen \u2014 with a warning that the app was creating a virtual private network to monitor network traffic \u2014 stymied potential users.On Monday, Mr. McCarthy visited Manju and showed her the Google Assistant on her new Reliance Jio feature phone. The app allows her to speak commands to the phone in Hindi or English.Language has been a particular barrier for internet adoption in India. The voice-driven assistant has been very popular in India, with 28 percent of all Google searches conducted by voice.At first, the app had trouble understanding her. But before long, she had it answering her questions.\u201cI just say it, and it\u2019s there,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Four Questions About American Greatness", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThank you for the honor you do me with this degree. I\u2019d like to think that somewhere in the great upstairs my rabbinical forbears from Vilna are smiling on this occasion.My topic this evening concerns the future of the United States \u2014 or, as some of my more pessimistic friends in the Never Trump camp are prone to frame the question: \u201cWhat future?\u201dIt is prompted by the reflection that tonight is this 93rd year for this event, and thus by a sense of curiosity about where the world might be 93 years hence.I hope that my youngest child will have just celebrated her 101st birthday. And I predict the Jets will be no closer to winning a Super Bowl.What about the rest of America?Suppose it\u2019s the year 2110, and a history professor at Yeshiva\u2019s Business School is asking her students to name the inventions or innovations that defined the economic terms of the 21st century, much in the way that airplanes, the Model-T, and penicillin defined the 20th century, or the steam engine and locomotive defined the 19th.What answers might her students give?Let me suggest three.Here\u2019s another innovation few of us could have imagined: mobile apps.If you had used the term \u201cmobile app\u201d a little over a decade ago, hardly anyone outside of a few computer labs would have known what you meant. It\u2019s a $100 billion industry and a ubiquitous feature of our lives. It has challenged longstanding urban monopolies, created job opportunities for hundreds of thousands of marginal workers, changed the way we deliver and read the news, and will revolutionize everything from the way we get pizzas to medical diagnoses.Finally, we might add gene therapies to the list.Now, suddenly, the advent of gene therapies has opened the prospect that many cancers may be manageable or curable after all. Though we are still at the touch-wood stage, it is no longer far-fetched to envision a horizon where many more of us will push through the diseases that now get us in our 60s, 70s and 80s \u2014 so that we can enjoy healthy and productive lives for much longer (at least until dementia or something else gets us).All of these innovations \u2014 and others our future students could mention, from driverless cars to artificial intelligence \u2014 have downsides and risks. So does every other significant innovation in history, starting with fire and the wheel.And so the interesting question is: Why?Every good teacher knows that a great education depends on asking the right questions. Since we are living in a time in which the president of the United States has made an issue of American greatness, it behooves us to ask: Well, just what is it that makes a country great?I would argue the answer depends on how we choose to answer a few basic questions. So allow me to propose four of them.Do we recognize its inherent value and potential? Or do we tend to see people, especially immigrants, as liabilities: likely criminals, costly additions to the welfare rolls, threats to our cultural integrity, would-be terrorists, and so on?Because the subject of the DACA program for illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children has been in the news this year, I\u2019ve done some research on this subject for my column. A few findings:It is no secret that it is becoming increasingly difficult to express a controversial thought in many parts of the United States today.All this has been accompanied by multiple efforts, on campuses and in corporate life, to criminalize or aggressively marginalize certain types of speech in the name of such worthy goals as civility and inclusiveness.Yet what begins as soft censorship rarely ends there. What starts as an effort to deter outrageous speech inevitably has the effect of quashing genuinely original thinking. Just as the path to scientific discovery is a matter of trial-and-error, so too the road to an original idea, a great book, or a transformative social movement will always be littered with foolish thoughts, indelicate statements, and all kinds of verbal rubbish that may offend all kinds of powerful people.The United States has always been a land of invention \u2014 technical, political, and social \u2014 because it has given wide latitude to indelicate statements the ultimate value of which is often far from immediately apparent.We have also thrived because we have a cultural disposition in favor of the gadfly, the contrarian, the upstart, the entrepreneur, the late bloomer, the disrupter, the activist, the social nuisance. We have an inner sense that ripe fruits always start as sour ones, and so we nurture them.This is not how it is done in China, with its explicit forms of censorship and prescribed opinions. It is not how it is done in much of Asia, which often suffers through excessive deference to the opinions of elders. It is not how it is done in parts of Europe, with its polite political fictions.But it is how we have done it in the United States. It is why we\u2019ve been able to maintain an international edge in the \u201cThink Different\u201d category. And the question is whether we can maintain that edge knowing that it is ultimately our tolerance for the opinions that offend us most that\u2019s the most vital ingredient in the preservation of our national institutions and the perpetuation of our national greatness.Several years ago, the great historian Bernard Lewis made an important observation about the destiny of nations.\u201cWhen people realize things are going wrong, there are two questions they can ask,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOne is, \u2018What did we do wrong?\u2019 and the other is, \u2018Who did this to us?\u2019 The latter question leads to conspiracy theories and paranoia. The first question leads to another line of thinking: \u2018How do we put it right?\u2019\u201dLewis is an expert in the Middle East. Why are so many countries in that part of the world such failures? Why have they squandered their national energies on hating their neighbors, instead of thinking a little more critically about their own behavior? What might Syria, Iraq or Libya have looked like today if they had respected their Jewish citizens instead of scapegoating and persecuting them, both out of appreciation for their contributions and as a guarantee of tolerance for other ethnic or religious minorities?True, there\u2019s a point at which self-criticism can become neurotic, paralyzing and perversely self-satisfied. But it\u2019s also true that individuals, communities and nations that habitually ask \u201cWhat did we do wrong?\u201d instead of \u201cWho did this to us?\u201d are also the individuals, communities and nations that, in the long run, succeed.Lately, I\u2019ve wondered: In which camp do we Americans fall? For many years there has been a grievance culture on the left, with a habit of turning statistical inferences into allegations of systemic biases, and treating bad personal habits as syndromes or diseases beyond the control of moral discipline.Now that\u2019s been joined by a grievance industry on the right, which seems to think that every factory closure in Ohio is the result of devious trade negotiators in Beijing, and that everything else wrong in the world is the fault of Goldman bankers, Beltway \u201ccucks\u201d and the Fake News Media.This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Truman Doctrine. That doctrine put an end to our disastrous national experiment in blind and self-defeating isolationism by promising that America would come to the economic and military aid of embattled nations facing insurgency or aggression.In the following year, Truman came to the military rescue of a blockaded outpost of freedom, West Berlin, and he came to the moral rescue of another embattled outpost, Israel. In both cases \u2014 as, later on, in our defense of South Korea Truman put our national values ahead of our narrow self-interests.He didn\u2019t ask, \u201cWhat do we get out of this deal?\u201d He asked: \u201cWhat is right?\u201dHow extraordinary have been the moral and strategic dividends of these investments in principle! In West Berlin, Truman created what would soon became the world\u2019s most visible rebuke to Communism and, not by accident, the scene of its demise. By fighting for South Korea, he saved its people from the Orwellian despotism that rules on the other side of the 38th parallel.And by recognizing Israel he gave Jewish civilization a chance to reclaim its roots, the Jewish people the possibility to stand up against its enemies, and a Jewish democracy the opportunity to wrestle with, and perfect, itself.For America, the dividends have been even greater. We have had 70 years of unparalleled material prosperity and technological advances. Seventy years of global leadership and trendsetting. Seventy years without another great war.And we have been able to do it because, for all the vicissitudes of the Cold War and globalization and the war on terrorism, Americans have broadly understood that great nations, like great institutions and great citizens, lead by example: by inspiring rather than coercing loyalty; by a decent respect for the opinions of mankind; by steadfastness of purpose and evenness of temperament; by the understanding that a policy of magnanimity and benevolence will, if nothing else, provide us with the friends, and the self-belief, needed in times of adversity.In short: Do we understand that our greatness ultimately depends on putting our values first? That we do best when we define our interests according to our values, rather than \u2014 in the style of every fallen empire defining our values according to our interests?So those are my Four Questions. How we answer them matters a great deal to how we fare in the future. It\u2019s a responsibility that rests especially heavily on the shoulders of educators. Because the questions I\u2019m asking are only secondarily about policies, over which honorable people can disagree. They are primarily about habits of mind and virtues of character: about hospitality and openness; intellectual independence and tolerance; forgiveness and responsibility; magnanimity, courage, and fair play.I believe a university such as Yeshiva, with its proud embrace of religious wisdom with secular knowledge, can meet that responsibility.Not a generation ago we were the strangers in this land, just as we had ourselves been strangers in Egypt. We know what it means to be the foreigners. And we know how much we have contributed on our road to our American belonging.We are the children of Abraham, the original idol smasher and iconoclast: We know what it is to hold fast to unpopular ideas in the face of opprobrium and persecution \u2014 and to see those ideas vindicated in time.We are the people of King David, a man of many flaws. We know what it means to struggle, fail, and try again.And we are the followers of Moses, who also put values first as he steered his people through a wilderness toward a promised land he would never enter. We believe that our morality is a long-term investment, whose benefits only our children may reap, but is the wellspring of our self-respect and survival.In short, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have something to teach. In this country, our country, we have been granted the opportunity, the means, the privilege and even the power to teach it. Let\u2019s not miss our chance.Thanks once again for your time, and for this high honor. I\u2019ll treasure it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Makes $52.4 Billion Deal for 21st Century Fox in Big Bet on Streaming", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In a move that will reverberate from Hollywood and Silicon Valley to TVs and smartphones around the world, the Walt Disney Company said Thursday that it had reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox, the empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch, in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $52.4 billion.Disney has already announced an ambitious plan to introduce two streaming services by 2019. With this deal and the wealth of movies, TV shows and sports programming it provides, the company will now have the muscle to challenge Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook in the fast-growing realm of online video.\u201cThe pace of disruption has only hastened,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive and chairman, said in an interview. \u201cThis will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy, which is our highest priority.\u201dBut lately, as most of Hollywood has, 20th Century Fox has struggled to keep pace with the changing way younger audiences view content \u2014 namely on an internet-connected device. Some analysts interpreted Mr. Murdoch\u2019s sudden willingness to sell as his reading the writing on the wall: The business climate is going to become tougher for old-line Hollywood.Not included in the acquisition: Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and the FS1 sports cable channel. In the news release announcing the Disney deal, Mr. Murdoch said he would spin those businesses and a handful of other properties, including the 20th Century Fox lot in Century City, which Disney is not buying, into a newly listed company. Mr. Murdoch also still controls his newspaper-focused company, News Corporation, which has holdings that include The Wall Street Journal.The deal got its start with a casual get-together over the summer at Moraga Vineyards, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s Bel Air winery. There, Mr. Iger and Mr. Murdoch chatted about the way technology was roiling the media business, according to Mr. Iger, who came away thinking \u2014 to his surprise \u2014 that Mr. Murdoch might be open to a merger discussion. Mr. Iger said he called him a few weeks later in August to propose more serious talks.There was at least one due-diligence meeting at Mr. Murdoch\u2019s apartment in Manhattan with senior management. As the agreement was being completed on Tuesday, Mr. Iger had lunch with Mr. Murdoch in London. (Mr. Iger was in town for a premiere of \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi,\u201d which arrives in theaters on Friday.)\u201cI know a lot of people are wondering, \u2018Why did the Murdochs come to such a momentous decision?\u2019\u201d Mr. Murdoch said on a conference call with investors. \u201cAre we retreating? Absolutely not. We are pivoting at a pivotal moment.\u201dMr. Murdoch\u2019s older son, Lachlan, 21st Century Fox\u2019s executive chairman, added that the move was \u201cabout returning to our roots as a lean, aggressive challenger brand\u201d that would be \u201cfocused at the beginning on must-watch news and live sports.\u201dThere has been speculation that Mr. Murdoch\u2019s other son, James, who is chief executive of 21st Century Fox, would join Disney in a senior role. Mr. Iger told investors on a conference call that that had not yet been decided.\u201cHe will be integral to helping us integrate these companies over the next number of months,\u201d Mr. Iger said. \u201cOver that time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not.\u201dThe Murdochs declined an interview request.Mr. Iger is buying 21st Century Fox\u2019s minority stake in Hulu, resulting in majority control of the streaming service by Disney, which previously owned 30 percent. Comcast and Time Warner also have stakes in Hulu.The Disney-Fox merger is happening as the Justice Department fights AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner in court. Mr. Iger acknowledged that antitrust regulators would heavily scrutinize Disney\u2019s purchase but expressed confidence about winning their approval. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that President Trump had spoken with Rupert Murdoch and \u201ccongratulated him\u201d on the deal.\u201cIf they look at it from a consumer point of view,\u201d Mr. Iger said, \u201cthey should quickly conclude that the aim of this combination is to create more high-quality product for consumers around the world and to deliver it in more innovative, more compelling ways.\u201dWhen Mr. Iger announced Disney\u2019s streaming strategy in September, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to launch big, and we\u2019re going to launch hot.\u201d At the time, his comment was viewed in Hollywood as old-fashioned showboating.Not anymore.To augment ESPN Plus, Disney is adding 21st Century Fox\u2019s chain of 22 regional cable networks dedicated to sports, including the YES Network, which carries New York Yankees games.As part of the deal, Disney will also get the FX and National Geographic cable networks, and stakes in two behemoth overseas television-service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India. That component of the deal would seem to contradict Disney\u2019s push to lessen its reliance on traditional television, a business built on third-party cable subscriptions that is now in decline as people turn to streaming services for home entertainment.With the acquisition, \u201cDisney goes from being a juggernaut to being a megajuggernaut,\u201d Steven Cahall, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.Mr. Cahall and other analysts said the acquisition would likely prompt other entertainment companies to join forces as a competitive maneuver. Speculation immediately surrounded Viacom and CBS, which share common ownership; Lionsgate, which owns Starz; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which controls rights to the James Bond franchise; and Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has struggled with low box office market share.But pulling off the acquisition of 21st Century Fox dwarfs those deals and will create complex integration challenges. Some executives who work at Fox\u2019s studio offices in Los Angeles have been complaining bitterly about the prospect of Disney cost-cutting. Disney said it expected the acquisition to yield at least $2 billion in total cost savings.And though Mr. Iger played down any antitrust issues, others in Hollywood have already disagreed.\u201cThe antitrust concerns raised by this deal are obvious and significant,\u201d the screenwriters\u2019 union, the Writers Guild of America West, said in a statement on Monday, calling media consolidation a \u201crelentless drive to eliminate competition.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Porch Pirates\u2019 Steal Holiday Packages as They Pile Up at Homes", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 It is a season for giving and, according to law enforcement officials in Washington County, Ore., taking as well.Two weeks ago, its Sheriff\u2019s Office ran a sting operation to catch porch pirates, thieves who swipe packages from Amazon and other companies from doorsteps. Detectives from the department\u2019s property crimes unit put several electronics items worth more than $500 in a box, dropped in a tracking device and \u201cbaited\u201d a volunteer\u2019s front porch in the town of Aloha.Sure enough, a pirate struck just after 2 a.m., and deputies traced him to a home two blocks away. In an apparent effort to cover up his deed, the 27-year-old suspect microwaved the tracking device, so he was charged with evidence tampering in addition to theft.Porch pirates have darkened people\u2019s doorsteps for years. Law enforcement agencies say they think the crime is on the rise, along with the growth of online shopping. \u201cThere\u2019s more packages for them to grab,\u201d said Angela Sands, a spokeswoman for the Police Department in Lincoln, Neb.And the rewards are especially attractive during the holiday season. United Parcel Service plans to deliver 750 million packages this season, up from 500 million five years ago.\u201cOne of the outcomes is you\u2019ve got one of the easiest ways to steal something ever,\u201d said Nirav Tolia, chief executive of Nextdoor, a social network for neighborhoods that has become a popular outlet for residents to gripe about stolen boxes.It is yet another sign that the endless capacity of technology to improve lives has led to endless criminal innovation as well.Mike Armstrong, a general contractor in Memphis, has earned a reputation on his neighborhood\u2019s Nextdoor forums as something of a vigilante. By his own estimate, Mr. Armstrong has confronted suspected package thieves more than a dozen times over the last four years, once on his own porch with the aid of his surveillance system.He said his neighbors call him the \u201cstrong arm of the law,\u201d a play on his last name.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like this sick perversion I have, catching thieves,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said.Technology is also amplifying awareness of the problem, while serving as a deterrent. Internet surveillance cameras from Google\u2019s Nest and Ring have made it easier for residents to capture video of package thieves in the act. Ring makes internet-connected doorbell cameras that start at $179. Homeowners can speak through the device to visitors \u2014 or bad guys \u2014 at their front doors using a smartphone app, even if they are not home.YouTube, Facebook, Nextdoor and other social media are popular places for frustrated residents to share the footage. Camera companies like Ring have used the videos as marketing.Law enforcement agencies are stepping up their efforts to deter package thieves. On Cyber Monday, postal inspectors and police officers in the Portland, Ore., area put out 21 bait packages. They made four arrests and recovered a stolen vehicle, according to Sgt. Christopher Burley, a spokesman for the Portland Police Department.Steve Gaut, a UPS spokesman, said public perception of the problem was rising, \u201cdriven by the greater use and affordability of home surveillance technology and the pervasiveness of social media and related user-generated social content.\u201d The company does not think there has been a significant increase in the per-capita incidence of package theft, he said, but many victims never report their problems to the company.Amazon, by far the nation\u2019s largest online retailer, said the vast majority of packages made it to customers without being stolen, but declined to provide specifics. The company typically replaces deliveries that are reported stolen.Walmart, the nation\u2019s second-largest online retailer, did not respond to requests for comment.Steven Kenworthy, a graduate student at Ohio State University in Columbus, expected a large box from Amazon with a $400 electric skateboard to arrive at his home in June. Amazon told him its carrier had delivered the item, but there was no trace of it.\u201cSome rascal snagged my package,\u201d Mr. Kenworthy said. He went on his neighborhood\u2019s Nextdoor discussion forums and found reports of missing packages and suspected thieves tailing FedEx trucks through the area.\u201cEverybody\u2019s problems start feeling like your problems,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were talking about how it was every single day packages would go missing.\u201dAmazon sent him a replacement skateboard at no charge within two days, he said.Mr. Kenworthy said he had no intention of installing a camera outside his home because he thought it would make him feel more violated.\u201cIt\u2019s going to make me mad,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Net Neutrality Was Repealed and How It Affects You", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to repeal Obama-era net neutrality rules, which required internet service providers to offer equal access to all web content without charging consumers for higher-quality delivery or giving preferential treatment to certain websites.Many consumer advocates have argued that if the rules get scrapped, broadband providers will begin selling the internet in bundles, not unlike how cable television is sold today. Want to access Facebook and Twitter? Under a bundling system, getting on those sites could require paying for a premium social media package.\u201cThe internet, the speed of it, our entire business revolves around that,\u201d David Callicott, who sells paraffin-free candles on his website, GoodLight, said last month.\u201cIt\u2019s basic economics,\u201d Mr. Pai said in a speech at the Newseum in April. \u201cThe more heavily you regulate something, the less of it you\u2019re likely to get.\u201d\u201cDid these fast lanes and slow lanes exist? No,\u201d he said in the speech. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the special interests pushing Title II weren\u2019t trying to solve a real problem but instead looking for an excuse to achieve their longstanding goal of forcing the internet under the federal government\u2019s control.\u201dSeveral internet providers have made public pledges in recent months that they will not block or throttle sites once the rules were repealed. The companies argue that Title II gives the F.C.C. too much control over their business, and that the regulations make it hard to expand their networks.He wrote that the biggest American internet companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 \u201ccontrol much of the online infrastructure, from app stores to operating systems to cloud storage to nearly all of the online ad business.\u201dMeanwhile, most American homes and smartphones connect to the internet through a \u201chandful of broadband companies \u2014 AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon, many of which are also aiming to become content companies, because why not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Under Criminal Investigation, Justice Dept. Confirms in Letter to Court", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Federal investigators are pursuing at least one criminal investigation into Uber, according to a court document released on Wednesday.The document, which was submitted by the United States attorney\u2019s office in the northern district of California, does not specify what the agency is investigating, but it is the first public confirmation by the Department of Justice of a federal inquiry into the San Francisco-based ride-hailing company. In the past, The New York Times and others have reported the existence of federal inquiries into Uber over various issues, but authorities have not said anything publicly about them.As part of the case, the Department of Justice submitted to the judge, William Alsup, the letter that was made public on Wednesday. In the letter, dated Nov. 22, the department informed the judge that there was additional evidence that Uber had not turned over in the case, referring to claims from Richard Jacobs, a former Uber employee, that Uber had been secretly gathering intelligence on competitors.\u201cIn the course of a United States\u2019 pending criminal investigation, the government interviewed a former Uber employee named Richard Jacobs,\u201d said the letter.Mr. Jacobs appeared in court last month to testify about his evidence, which he had written in a letter to Uber executives.

The two had a child together. When the affair was disclosed to Google\u2019s human resources department, the woman, a paralegal, was moved into the sales department.

I mean, of course we will \u2014 we\u2019re talking about a culture that has systematically sidelined women. It\u2019s going to get ugly.But on the other hand, while men may be shocked at the heinous acts being reported, the response I\u2019ve heard from women friends is shock that men are actually being held accountable for these acts. For years this activity has occurred in many industries \u2014 maybe all industries \u2014 and countless women have been caught in power dynamics beyond their control. The fact that a wave of accountability has arrived is surprising, perhaps, but also long, long overdue.This looks very bad! After all, this case is about stealing trade secrets. The judge delayed the trial and harshly rebuked Uber. \u201cI can no longer trust the words of the lawyers for Uber in this case,\u201d he said. \u201cIf even half of what is in that letter is true, it would be an injustice for Waymo to go to trial.\u201dMike, you\u2019re the Uber expert. Is this as terrible as it looks? How does Uber survive this case now?To upset a judge the way Uber has done, by not disclosing particularly damning evidence, has really hurt it. I have to believe that will be hard to come back from. And the trial hasn\u2019t even started yet!Moreover, this really has Uber in a tight spot as it tries to sell secondary shares to new investors, who are pressing the company to have a lower valuation so that they can get in for cheaper. It\u2019s probably the world\u2019s worst timing.So, yeah. Another bad week for Uber. But when has it been different? Not since 2014, perhaps?That said, Snapchat hampered itself and its growth with its seemingly intentional inscrutability for so many years.

{"Headline": "Hillsong Unites Believers and Those Old Agnostics John, Paul, George and Ringo", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than a thousand worshipers attended a Pentecostal singalong whose set list included Beatles hits like \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love\u201d and \u201cHere Comes the Sun.\u201dThe Beatles did not have a great relationship with Jesus Christ.Hillsong, a Pentecostal megachurch that was founded more than 30 years ago in Sydney and spread on the back of a hugely successful Christian recording label, has between 9,000 and 10,000 members in New York \u2014 most of them young, racially diverse and screamingly fashionable.On Sunday, more than 2,300 of them packed the 2,200-seat Hammerstein Ballroom for the first of two evening services, after which was to come a musical production.Within the next hour, they would witness a production that used the Beatles\u2019s oeuvre to tell the story of the three kings who visited the baby Christ, a kind of mash-up of \u201cAcross the Universe\u201d and the nativity story. Most of them had no idea.Karen Ruiz was one of many millennial faithful in the crowd who did not know what to expect. Originally from Colombia, Ms. Ruiz, 27, was raised evangelical and intent on finding a religious community when she moved to New York.\u201cI just Googled churches in New York, and this was the first option that came up,\u201d she said.It stands to reason that someone at Hillsong has mastered SEO. The church has made inroads with digitally-savvy young professionals in more than 20 cities worldwide, including four in the United States. Its New York members are WeWork employees, N.Y.U. musical theater majors, social media mavens, life coaches and Netflix actors.The show went quickly. The three kings reached Joseph and Mary, both played by black actors, within the initial minutes. Mr. Finochio and the other performers interspersed dialogue and sermon, performing versions of \u201cBlackbird\u201d and \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love,\u201d during which Mary handed Baby Jesus to a responsible reindeer so she could cut a rug with Joseph.As George Harrison\u2019s \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d played to celebrate Jesus\u2019s return from Egypt, the crowd on the second-floor balcony turned on their cellphone flashlights to mimic candles and waved their arms in devotion.The band\u2019s lyrics and arrangements were largely left alone; the Beatles may have talked a big old atheist game, but it\u2019s not difficult to see the religiosity in their songs. (At least, apparently, the ones Ringo didn\u2019t have a hand in.)Mr. Finochio\u2019s final monologue was his most heartfelt. He started from the premise that God was better than Santa Claus, because He answers to need while Papa No\u00ebl is purely a people-pleaser, before offering a prayer over the congregation, asking that Jesus deliver a supernatural breakthrough in 2018, as well as plenty of jobs and promotions.Backstage after the show, Mr. Finochio, who has Christ-length hair and a deadpan sense of humor, admitted that he had been so nervous that he verged on panic. His production came together with many happy accidents, including a notably diverse cast that reflected Hillsong\u2019s membership. Had he meant to imply that baby Jesus \u2014 swaddled in blankets and barely perceptible \u2014 was black, too?\u201cThe Holy Spirit is technically his biological father so he would be mixed-race,\u201d Mr. Finochio said.He was thoughtful when asked why he thought that millennials, who are stereotypically averse to institutions, religious or otherwise, were attracted to Hillsong. He quoted something often attributed to St. Augustine \u2014 \u201cthe church is a whore, but she is my mother\u201d \u2014 and said that skepticism for the church was health. He seemed less able to explain the attraction.But he said that the joy displayed in the show was a fitting example of Hillsong\u2019s appeal.\u201cSometimes Christians suck at partying,\u201d he said, pointing out that a group of people who feel assured that they are going to heaven should have less trouble lightening up. \u201cChristians should be known as the biggest partyers in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
