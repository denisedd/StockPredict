{"Headline": "Inside China\u2019s Big Tech Conference, New Ways to Track Citizens", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWUZHEN, China \u2014 An artificial intelligence company touted a robot that could help doctors with diagnoses. A start-up displayed a drone designed to carry a single passenger 60 miles per hour.And in a demonstration worthy of both wonder and worry, a Chinese facial recognition company showed how its technology could quickly identify and describe people.If there were any doubts about China\u2019s technological prowess, the presentations made this week at the country\u2019s largest tech conference should put them to rest. The event, once a setting for local tech executives and leaders of impoverished states, this year attracted top American executives like Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google, as well as executives of Chinese giants like Jack Ma of Alibaba and Pony Ma of Tencent.The tracking was apparent both in the design of the event, which ended on Tuesday, and in the technology on display. Tight security checkpoints made use of facial recognition. Chinese armed police patrolled. And in the dark corners of the whitewashed walls of the convention hall, the red lights of closed-circuit cameras glowed.A fast-growing facial recognition company, Face++, turned its technology on conferencegoers. On a large screen in its booth, the software identified their gender, described their hair length and color and characterized the clothes they wore.Other Chinese companies showed what could be done with such data. A state-run telecom company, China Unicom, featured a display with graphics breaking down the huge amounts of data the company has on its subscribers.One map broke down the population of Beijing based on the changing layout of the city\u2019s population as people commuted to and from work. Another showed where foreign visitors roamed on its network.The people overseeing China Unicom\u2019s booth openly discussed the data, a sign of how widely accepted such surveillance and data collection have become in China.At Unicom\u2019s two other state-run rivals, a similar penchant for measurements and surveillance was also on display. China Mobile floated a camera on the prow of one of the many boats that drift through Wuzhen\u2019s canals, sending the images over its latest and faster cellular technology. China Telecom showed off its ability to measure the amount of trash in several garbage cans and detect malfunctioning fire hydrants.Investors and analysts say China\u2019s unabashed fervor for collecting such data, combined with its huge population, could eventually give its artificial intelligence companies an edge over American ones. If Silicon Valley is marked by a libertarian streak, China\u2019s vision offers something of an antithesis, one where tech is meant to reinforce and be guided by the steady hand of the state.Such developments underscore a nascent back-and-forth between China and the United States that will determine much about technology\u2019s future development and application.Speaking at a panel on terrorism, Mei Jianming, described as a chief expert on antiterrorism for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an intergovernmental group that includes China and Russia among other countries, labeled groups that speak out for the human rights of China\u2019s Islamic minority Uighurs as terrorists. He then said Beijing should do more to use its influence to push Twitter to change its terms of service and push back against such groups.\u201cWe should strengthen the capability of our propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the Chinese official side, our China Daily and Xinhua News have their own Twitter presence, but the effectiveness of their propaganda is not enough. It\u2019s clearly not enough.\u201dThe contradictions of using sites like Twitter to change opinions abroad, while blocking them domestically, were often evident but almost as often unremarked upon.One of the most clear discussions of censorship came not from a speaker at the conference, but from an official watching the conference\u2019s entry gate on the first day. A representative of the Wenzhou city government, he queried journalists about how they got around China\u2019s internet filters. It was not clear whether he was genuinely curious, or wanted to find out which tools were most effective so they could be later targeted.Follow Paul Mozur on Twitter: @paulmozurCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Wuzhen.Advertisement"}

The police in Yushu were especially angry at Mr. Tashi over his interviews for the Times video on the Tibetan language, Mr. Liang said in an earlier interview. Yet Mr. Tashi told Times journalists that he did not support Tibetan independence or separatism and was instead merely pushing for the Tibetan language to be properly taught in local schools, which prioritize Chinese language education, and for Tibetan to be used in government offices.Mr. Tashi had insisted on doing on-the-record interviews, saying that only those would be meaningful for viewers and readers. The Times video, produced by Jonah M. Kessel, showed Mr. Tashi traveling to Beijing to try to bring a lawsuit against Yushu officials to compel them to expand Tibetan language education. The video also showed Mr. Tashi trying to get Chinese state news organizations to report on his mission.One year later, the court appears ready to hold the trial. Mr. Lin said that he planned to fly to Yushu on Tuesday.Many Tibetans resent rule by the Communist Party. In 2008, Chinese security forces suppressed a widespread Tibetan uprising. Since 2009, at least 160 Tibetans have self-immolated in what appear to be acts of protest against the party.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Says It\u2019s Open for Business. Foreign Firms Find It\u2019s Not That Simple.", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Wednesday welcomed dozens of corporate leaders and foreign dignitaries with one overriding message: China is open for business.The reality on the ground was more complex.That message was echoed at the Guangzhou conference, which was attended by the leaders of companies like Apple, Ford Motor, Philips and Walmart and foreign leaders like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.\u201cChina\u2019s door will not close to the world but open wider,\u201d Mr. Xi said in a letter addressed to the gathering, which was organized by Fortune magazine. China\u2019s president was to attend the conference until changing his plans at the last minute, according to local media reports. Wang Yang, China\u2019s vice premier, spoke of the country\u2019s commitment to a \u201cnondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies.\u201d Another senior Chinese official promised a level playing field for foreign businesses.But the messages of openness contrasted sharply with actions taken in Beijing and elsewhere in the country. China wants its giant national companies to be world leaders in sectors like electric cars, robotics and drones, but the authorities are accused of curtailing foreign firms\u2019 access to Chinese consumers.A government-led effort to help Chinese companies at home and abroad has set up a potential trade battle with the United States, as a growing number of American businesses complain that Chinese trade practices like forced technology transfer are putting them at a disadvantage.Surveys of China business leaders by the American Chamber of Commerce in recent years have shown that many American companies do not think the playing field is even.\u201cChinese government statements reaffirming China\u2019s commitment to providing a nondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies are always welcome, but need to be accompanied by real progress,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.\u201cThe challenges of China\u2019s regulatory environment \u2014 its opaqueness, unpredictability and basic problems of market access \u2014 make it difficult for U.S. companies to realize their full potential,\u201d he added.Others were more blunt in their assessments.\u201cWe are hopeful that we can still continue to make progress, but there are still basic areas of concern,\u201d Mr. Branstad added, referring to the growing frustration that China is demanding too many concessions from companies that want to compete in the country.\u201cWhen you go into a country and participate in the market, you are subject to the laws and regulation of that country,\u201d Mr. Cook said, underscoring the notion that some American business leaders are willing to play by China\u2019s rules. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring the laws and regulations that you wish were there,\u201d he added.Mr. Cook, responding to those concerns, said, \u201cMy view is that you show up and you participate because nothing ever changes from the sidelines.\u201d He also said he hoped that some of the apps the company had made unavailable in China would one day be available there again.Against this backdrop, Chinese companies are beginning to claim some of the dominant positions that their foreign counterparts once had around the world. One of the many statistics that officials here cited to support China\u2019s growing strength on the global stage was this one: The Fortune 500 list now includes 115 Chinese companies, nearly equal to the number of American companies.One thing is clear: The days when foreign companies thought they could come to China and make a quick profit are over.\u201cYou cannot just be in the market to make money,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at venture capital firm GGV Capital. \u201cI think that if you can help the Chinese government to achieve its objective of being a model of growth, you\u2019ll have achieved your own objective as well.\u201dNot everyone every business leader here was quite as diplomatic.\u201cPeople complain too much,\u201d said Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba. Mr. Ma\u2019s company plays a dominant role in the lives of most Chinese consumers, and it has become a darling of United States investors and almost as valuable as Amazon.\u201cIf you cannot survive in China, I barely think you can survive in other countries,\u201d Mr. Ma added, citing the success in China of American companies like IBM, Starbucks and Walmart.His advice for foreign companies was simple: \u201cHave patience and respect the rule of law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Southeast Asia\u2019s Ride-Hailing War Is Being Waged on Motorbikes", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 On a recent morning driving his motorbike for one of Asia\u2019s fastest-growing tech start-ups, Nasrun picked up and dropped off four schoolchildren, an office worker, medicine from a pharmacy, some dumplings with peanut sauce, a few documents and an order of Japanese food, the last of which he took to a woman at the Indonesia Stock Exchange.For his colleague Irawan, the workday started at midnight. He ferried someone home, then delivered an order of KFC. Around 4 a.m., he picked up a clubgoer so wobbly with drink that Mr. Irawan had to use one hand to steer and the other to keep the woman from falling off the back of his motorbike.The two men work for Go-Jek, a $3 billion Indonesian start-up whose maximalist approach to the ride-hailing business has put rivals like Uber on notice, and gotten the attention of American investors and Chinese internet titans alike.The company\u2019s main app lets you summon a car or motorbike driver who could just give you a lift, sure \u2014 but who could also bring you takeout, shop for groceries or deliver a present to someone across town.With another Go-Jek app, Go-Life, you can hail someone to come cut your hair, give you a massage, clean your bathroom or change your car\u2019s oil. And with the money you keep in Go-Jek\u2019s digital wallet, you can pay your electricity bill, buy mobile data and book movie tickets \u2014 all within the app.Go-Jek, which started its main app in 2015 and is in only Indonesia at the moment, is counting on people coming back to its services again and again as it competes against both Uber and Grab, a Singapore-based ride-hailing company operating in seven Southeast Asian countries.\u201cWe have huge respect for Uber as a technology company,\u201d said Nadiem Makarim, Go-Jek\u2019s 33-year-old founder and chief executive. \u201cBut we just out-innovate them. We just move that much faster.\u201dChina\u2019s biggest tech companies, spying opportunity in the region, have contributed to those challenges.\u201cWe all looked to China\u201d to learn to develop e-commerce, said Nick Nash, Sea\u2019s president. \u201cThe playbook was clear.\u201dIt is no accident that Jakarta has attracted so many companies that help people get around \u2014 or that help them avoid having to get around in the first place.\u201cIn Southeast Asia, there\u2019s little public transport, many dense cities and low car ownership,\u201d said Ming Maa, Grab\u2019s president. \u201cIt makes ride-sharing a much more compelling product than in India or even, frankly, China.\u201dBefore ride-hailing apps came along, motorcycle taxis, or \u201cojek\u201d in Indonesian, plied Jakarta\u2019s clogged streets. But getting a good price required haggling. And safety was a concern, particularly for women.Go-Jek is a \u201clifesaver,\u201d said Hera Diani, a magazine editor in Jakarta. She orders food on the app, and booked a pedicure through Go-Life when she was pregnant and couldn\u2019t walk easily. \u201cThe traffic jams are getting worse and worse,\u201d she said.It is unproven, though, that people will stick with a payment app just because they use it for rides. China\u2019s dominant mobile payment services, AliPay and WeChat Pay, grew big because they could easily be used to buy stuff online and transfer money to friends, respectively.\u201cTransport is a very, very large marketplace \u2014 I would argue, larger than e-commerce,\u201d said Mr. Maa of Grab. \u201cWe think that creates the right ground for an amazing payments company.\u201dGrab and Go-Jek\u2019s breakneck growth has set off many of the frictions with regulators and drivers that Uber has encountered in wealthier countries. But one reason ride-hailing has expanded so rapidly in Southeast Asia is that the region has had a gig economy long before anyone called it that. In countries like Indonesia, work for many people has never been anything but grueling and unregulated.Several Go-Jek and Grab drivers in Jakarta described driving both before and after a full day\u2019s work in a factory or warehouse. Others said they saw their children only between the end of a night shift and the start of the school day. Some said they drove seven days a week.Their earnings can be inconsistent, too. The ride-hailing companies have repeatedly slashed fares in Indonesia to defend market share. At a recent protest in Jakarta, hundreds of drivers demanded a government-mandated price floor for motorbike rides.Mr. Makarim said that he supported a minimum fare, but that Go-Jek wouldn\u2019t be able to employ as many people as it does \u2014 900,000 registered car and motorbike drivers \u2014 without \u201cflexibility\u201d around labor standards. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that the formal economy simply cannot contain that number of people,\u201d he said.Still, many drivers in Jakarta described their work as a step up from what they were doing before. Mr. Nasrun \u2014 who, like many Indonesians, uses a single name \u2014 used to clean rooms at a hotel. Mr. Irawan parked cars at a nightclub.Maharani, 29, was a stay-at-home mother. She now makes around $200 a month driving for Go-Jek.That is less than the average income nationwide. But \u201cit\u2019s the freedom of the job that I really like,\u201d she said on a recent evening, sipping iced coffee and waiting near a mall for orders. \u201cI don\u2019t have a boss behind me always watching what I do.\u201dBeing a female driver in Jakarta isn\u2019t easy. Sometimes, customers see her name, then cancel their orders. Others ask whether they can drive her motorbike while she sits in the back.Suddenly, Ms. Maharani\u2019s smartphone sounded. Someone at the mall wanted a ride. She slipped her helmet over her black head scarf, fired up her motorbike and joined the dense swarm of vehicles advancing into the fading daylight.Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Inter Ikea, through a Dutch subsidiary, receives franchise fees equal to 3 percent of the revenue from Ikea stores worldwide, according to regulators. Although Ikea was founded in Sweden in 1943, the parent company is based in the Netherlands.European regulators are concerned in particular about a 2006 Dutch ruling that allowed Inter Ikea to send a significant part of its franchise profits, in the form of an annual license fee, to a company in Luxembourg, where it was not taxed.Over the years, Ikea has argued that its business structure was perfectly legal.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedIncreasing optimism that the Republican tax overhaul will be signed into law this week has pushed shares of bank stocks to levels not hit since before the financial crisis.Goldman Sachs in a note Monday said lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 percent could lead to a 14 percent increase in earnings per share on average for banks.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Top Ideologue Calls for Tight Control of Internet", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWUZHEN, China \u2014 Little heard from but hugely influential, the professor-turned-Communist theoretician who has been a major adviser to three Chinese leaders finally stepped out of the shadows on Sunday.Known as the brain behind President Xi Jinping, Wang Huning made his first major speech since joining the Politburo Standing Committee, the seven-member group that rules China, at a conference created to show off the country\u2019s technological strengths to the world.Well known for his icy remove and support of authoritarianism, Mr. Wang called for security and order on the internet as part of five proposals he made to guide the future of cyberspace. He also emphasized China\u2019s technological prowess, and said more should be done by the government to guide the development of new industries like artificial intelligence and quantum computing.Mr. Wang stepped onto the world stage before an audience that included Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, along with an all-star cast of Chinese tech entrepreneurs, such as Jack Ma of Alibaba.Mr. Wang, 62, had emerged as the ideological counselor to Chinese leaders and the wordsmith of Mr. Xi\u2019s more authoritarian style before being tapped to join the Standing Committee at a Communist Party congress in Beijing two months ago. A close confidant of Mr. Xi and the two previous Chinese presidents, Mr. Wang was promoted despite never having governed a province or run a state ministry.On Sunday, Mr. Wang praised China\u2019s president for his \u201cdeep understanding\u201d of internet governance. He said the international community had \u201cwarmly received\u201d Mr. Xi\u2019s ideas about the internet, including the concept of cybersovereignty \u2014 a Chinese policy term used to argue that countries should be free to control the internet within their borders, even if it means censoring.\u201cGlobal cyberspace governance has no onlookers \u2014 we are all participants,\u201d he said, adding that \u201call parties\u201d should have a say over how the internet is managed across the world.The speech echoed arguments that Mr. Wang has made before. In the 1990s, as a professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, he wrote that because China was so large and poor, it needed a stronger hand from the government to push through economic development. He said that such authoritarian rule was necessary for China to restore its national greatness after what the Communist Party has often described as a century of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers.This has made Mr. Wang a longtime skeptic of calls for China to allow greater democracy despite his extensive experience abroad, including in the United States. And while he has said he admires the strength of the United States, Mr. Wang has also been deeply wary of American power.His speech on Sunday showed how China\u2019s vision of the internet attempts to wrestle with such tension. Chinese leaders have long lauded the economic power of the internet, while being deeply cautious about its democratizing and internationalizing influence.In his speech, Mr. Wang highlighted China\u2019s openness and the need for equal access to the internet. Yet China has led the way in cutting its internet off from the world with filters and blocks known as the Great Firewall of China. It has also blocked internet access in areas where members of minority groups live, to limit the potential for unrest.While many major foreign websites are blocked in China, the wireless connections at the conference allowed open access to the global internet. A promotional video that was shown before Mr. Wang\u2019s speech showed the web connecting China to the world, ignoring the existence of the Great Firewall.For the format of his talk, Mr. Wang followed the lead of Mr. Xi. His offering of five proposals appeared to have been inspired by a speech by Mr. Xi at the second World Internet Conference, when the president offered five ideas for developing the internet.Mr. Lu\u2019s successor, Xu Lin, was present at the conference, which also included more prominent foreign chief executives than in the past, including Sundar Pichai of Google and Mr. Cook of Apple. Analysts say Mr. Xu has been ordered to consolidate the administration\u2019s power, and also turn the conference into a higher-profile event.In his speech, Mr. Cook highlighted Apple\u2019s contribution to China\u2019s economy, saying that Chinese developers have earned more than 112 billion renminbi, or $16.9 billion, by selling apps to Apple users, more than developers from any other country.An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Wang Huning, the Standing Committee member. He is 62, not 63.Carolyn Zhang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Campaign to Drive Out Migrants Slams Beijing\u2019s Best and Brightest", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 With coding skills, a foreign degree, fluent English and an apartment barely big enough for his espresso maker and two cats, Si Ruomu thought he was the kind of go-getting young tech worker that Beijing needs to thrive in the 21st century.That was before the police arrived at his apartment building and ordered him and hundreds of others to vacate within 48 hours. Like most of his fellow tenants, Mr. Si had come from elsewhere in China to find work in the capital, which often treats migrants virtually as second-class citizens.\u201cOne minute you\u2019re drinking espressos, the next you\u2019re being evicted,\u201d said Mr. Si, 28, a bespectacled programmer who grew up in northern China and studied computer science in New Zealand. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think whether people like me have a future in Beijing.\u201dBeijing is a cultural, technological and commercial capital as well as a political one, and the tenements on its outskirts are home to tens of thousands of hopeful young college graduates who have moved here seeking better jobs and better lives.These job seekers are treated as migrants in their own capital, because China\u2019s biggest cities are fortresses of official privilege, especially Beijing. The government gives inhabitants who hold permanent residence papers, called hukou, more generous access to housing, schools and health care. But migrants must pay more for many services, and many live on the edges of Beijing, where rents are lower.Now whole swaths of these neighborhoods have been emptied out and in many cases reduced to rubble as the authorities condemn buildings as unsafe or illegal and order migrants to leave.That has ignited debate about how Beijing can function without the blue-collar migrants who serve as its cooks, cleaners and vendors, but there are also worries the campaign might harm the city\u2019s fast-growing tech sector, which employs armies of migrants who work for relatively low pay.When the authorities arrive with eviction orders, many migrants search for newer, safer homes even further from the city center. Others say they may abandon Beijing to find work elsewhere.\u201cThis will certainly change my impression of this city. I don\u2019t really want to stay in Beijing,\u201d said Zhang Mi, 25, a web application developer from Hebei, the province surrounding the capital, as he crammed his bags into a van after being evicted.\u201cTo young tech workers like me, there\u2019s really no option \u2014 only the big cities like Beijing have more opportunities,\u201d said Hu Xianyu, 22, an intern at Baidu, the internet search giant, who moved to Beijing from the northern province of Shanxi and was forced out of his apartment last month.\u201cTech workers for the bigger companies can get help from them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for those working for small companies or start-ups, the evictions can be disastrous.\u201dMigrant workers have often reacted to the eviction orders with angry resignation. But small confrontations have flared up, and the largest and most organized protest broke out on Sunday, when hundreds of people in a neighborhood in northeast Beijing scheduled for clearance gathered and chanted \u201cviolent evictions violate human rights.\u201dLast month, five delivery companies warned of delivery delays following the expulsions.Gan Wei, secretary-general of the China Electronic Commerce Logistics Industry Alliance, said the companies represented by her group would have to raise delivery prices in Beijing by about 20 percent.\u201cWhy is takeout food so cheap in Beijing? Because of all the cheap labor from the countryside,\u201d said Jia Dayong, 43, a stringy courier from the northwestern province of Shaanxi who was being expelled from Banjieta Village, a migrant neighborhood in northern Beijing.\u201cNobody cares whether we have a place to live,\u201d he said.\u201cIf they keep clearing out like this, Beijing will suffer a drought of employees next year,\u201d said Wang Le, 29, a hotel manager from the eastern province of Jiangsu.She was one of about 100 tenants \u2014 most of whom worked in finance, technology and hospitality \u2014 living in steel shipping containers that had been converted into small, brightly painted apartments. They were being torn down on government orders.In an attempt to slow the influx of job seekers, Beijing has cut the numbers of university graduates from other parts of China receiving the hukou permits that confer privileged status and benefits. But they have kept coming.Without permanent residency, they are forced to live precariously. Trying to save money, many find cheap apartments in the same run-down neighborhoods as migrants working menial jobs.\u201cEven if the industry I\u2019m in is very high-level, as far as the government is concerned, I\u2019m also a peasant worker, a migrant worker,\u201d said Zhang Xingwang, 24, who studied automation in college and came to Beijing from Hebei Province seeking work as a software programmer.He had to find new housing after his old apartment near where the deadly fire broke out last month was demolished. \u201cI thought Beijing would be relatively fair and tolerant, and the government would behave better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after this happened \u2026\u201dChina\u2019s big tech firms have refrained from criticizing the migrant crackdown, perhaps out of fear of angering the government. Alibaba, the online commerce giant, said the overall impact on its business \u201chasn\u2019t been significant.\u201dBut some experts have warned that by choking off the flow of migrants, Beijing risks losing entrepreneurial energy.Even before the recent expulsions, Yin Deting, a demographer who advises the Beijing city government, warned that heavy-handed clearances of migrants would accelerate the aging of the city\u2019s work force.\u201cIf we place our hopes for reducing the population just in demolishing illegal buildings and low-grade markets, the actual outcomes may well be contrary to what is hoped for,\u201d Mr. Yin wrote earlier this year.Mr. Si, the programmer who studied in New Zealand, eventually found a place to stay on the eastern edge of Beijing where he could keep his cats. He said he was weighing whether to move to a more tolerant Chinese city, or leave the country again to resume his studies.\u201cI don\u2019t think this will ever work,\u201d Mr. Si said of the crackdown. \u201cThere are job opportunities in Beijing, and government policies can\u2019t stop people moving to get jobs. If you do, the city pays a heavy price.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Lenders Collect Invasive Data and Offer Billions. Beijing Is Worried.", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Bai Shichao has a debt problem that is bigger than his paycheck \u2014 and that\u2019s a problem for the rest of China, too.Mr. Bai, a 30-year-old Beijing deliveryman, has borrowed heavily from China\u2019s growing ranks of online cash lenders. In a country that lacks reliable ways to tell who might be a good borrower, these lenders use artificial intelligence and oddly personal data \u2014 like tracking how fast prospective borrowers type on their phones \u2014 to determine who will pay them back.With Mr. Bai, they have failed. First he borrowed to start a business. When that went bust, he borrowed to bet on coal, rapeseed oil and sugar on China\u2019s futures markets. Soon Mr. Bai began borrowing from one lender to pay another.Today, Mr. Bai is more than $5,000 in debt, on a paycheck of less than $600 a month.\u201cIt\u2019s like gambling,\u201d said Mr. Bai, a university dropout who has cycled through a series of menial jobs like security guard and waiter. \u201cYou start to gamble. Soon you get addicted to it.\u201dWith more than $100 billion worth of loans and rising worries among Chinese consumers about privacy, Beijing is moving to rein in a freewheeling, well-funded boom in online personal loans.In November, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, stopped companies and people from starting new online cash lending platforms. In early December, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said it would crack down on unlicensed cash loan companies and put a lid on high-interest loans.China\u2019s small loans are piling up. More than 8,600 companies offer some form of small loan, and about $145 billion of those debts remain unpaid, according to the People\u2019s Bank of China. Other estimates run as high as $392 billion, according to the Boston Consulting Group. The government does not track default rates among online lenders, which disclose little on their own.\u201cWe are worried that in an environment where there is no effective credit system, people tend to overborrow, especially when capital comes in,\u201d said Bai Chengyu, an executive at the China Association of Microfinance, who is no relation to Bai Shichao.These lenders originally emerged as a solution to that problem: how to lend to people with no credit history. By most estimates, that could total about one billion people.China turned to the fast-moving technology sector. Today, thousands of Chinese apps offer cash or financing, often within seconds, based on a wide array of sometimes deeply personal information. China\u2019s biggest internet companies and financial names are funding the effort.Two years ago the central bank asked China\u2019s most successful internet companies \u2014 including affiliates of the sophisticated online giants Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group \u2014 to create their own credit ratings systems. Since then, it has declined to issue licenses that would formalize those systems, and officials have indicated in local news reports that the plan has fallen short of expectations.Last month, an internet financial association affiliated with the People\u2019s Bank of China announced plans to start a system that would crunch data from China\u2019s big tech firms. Few details were provided.The new online lending platforms also raise issues of privacy, a new but growing area of public concern in China. Many platforms that track smartphone use have access to data like location services, phone contact lists and call logs that can be used to track and harass delinquent borrowers.\u201cThe government has struggled a lot because they realize that consumers\u2019 personal information is everywhere,\u201d said Liu Yue, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group in Beijing. \u201cBut they don\u2019t really know how to change that because the data is already being used.\u201dMr. Bai of the China Association of Microfinance added that \u201csome cash loan companies use all kinds of soft violence to press customers to pay their loans back.\u201dLast month, Guangdong Province in southern China warned that more than a dozen apps had security loopholes that allowed companies to steal user information. Some of this information was then used to harass borrowers and their friends and families.One of those was an app called Paipaidai. Its parent company, PPDAI Group, recently listed its shares in New York. The Guangdong authorities said the app sends out users\u2019 contacts without permission. The practice \u201cseriously exposed users\u2019 privacy,\u201d the authorities said.One Paipaidai borrower, a man named Lin in a small town in Fujian Province called Quanzhou, said he had racked up about $75,000 in loans from 30 different platforms for living expenses and an investment in a shoe store. Mr. Lin, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of reprisal from debt collectors, said he received multiple calls a day from them.Mr. Lin showed images of text messages from one called Yongsheng Outsourcing that threatened to \u201cuse whatever method to deal\u201d with debt that he owed to Paipaidai. When contacted by The New York Times, a person at that number declined to say whether he worked for Yongsheng or Paipaidai.Paipaidai did not respond to requests for comment.Bai Shichao, the food deliveryman with the growing debt problem, tapped some of China\u2019s most closely watched and best-funded online lending services during his borrowing spree.One of those was a company named Smart Finance. Its app \u2014 Yongqianbao, or \u201cuse wallet\u201d in Chinese \u2014 helps it build a credit rating system based on 1,200 data points related to user behavior. Yongqianbao then connects potential borrowers with lenders. Backed by the venture capital vehicle of Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google China and a prominent start-up investor in China, it has approved 1.5 million loans a month.Its algorithms look for correlations between behavior and repayment history \u2014 and some of those are unusual. Yongqianbao considers how quickly people type on their phones, how often they eat takeout or how much power is left on their smartphone batteries when they apply for the loan. It also evaluates whether the borrower took the time to read the Yongqianbao user agreement. Approval can come in eight seconds or less.\u201cIt is hard to determine how the machine knows,\u201d said Jiao Ke, a former Baidu product manager who created Smart Finance, \u201cbut it is much more accurate\u201d than a traditional loan officer.Even borrowers like Mr. Bai who don\u2019t pay back \u2014 what Mr. Jiao calls a \u201ccontrolled delinquency\u201d \u2014 help the company by providing data, the company says.Smart Finance uses repayment behavior data to help strengthen its credit rating system, \u201cbut there is still a long way to go,\u201d said Carrie Fang, a spokeswoman for Smart Finance.Mr. Bai said he received a $270 loan from Yongqianbao in September. Thanks to the high interest rate, the balance had grown to more than $330 by mid-November.In exchange for loans, he has given lending platforms considerable personal information \u2014 and they are now using it. First they called the people he listed as emergency contacts, he said. Then they started calling other people on his phone contacts.Some debt collectors sent him texts saying they could trace his location through his phone. \u201cIt is meant to threaten you,\u201d Mr. Bai said. That ability could not be independently verified. In addition to the thousands that he owes to cash lenders, Mr. Bai owes more than $2,000 for rent and other personal debts.Mr. Bai said he now realized that it was not worth trading his privacy for quick cash. \u201cBut at that time, whenever I saw a cash loan service,\u201d he said, \u201cI wanted to borrow.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Missed Out on China. Can It Flourish in India?", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJODHPUR, India \u2014 Every month, about four million more Indians get online. They include people like Manju, a 35-year-old seamstress in this city of ancient palaces, who got her first internet phone last week.\u201cIt\u2019s all finished,\u201d she complained on Monday when a Google researcher came to visit to ask about her online habits.Google, which missed out on the rise of the internet in China, is determined not to make the same mistake in India. It has marshaled some of its best developers, designers and researchers to figure out how to adapt or completely rethink products like YouTube to serve the needs of mobile internet users with smaller budgets but big aspirations.\u201cWe have to figure out how to build the right products for them,\u201d said Caesar Sengupta, the Google vice president who oversees Next Billion Users, its unit dedicated to creating products for emerging markets like India, Brazil and Indonesia. \u201cThis is a very high priority for Google.\u201dMany of the new Indian users have basic phones, which make it difficult for them to run certain apps or to store big files like videos. Data plans are limited, and despite a telecom price war that has cut the price of a megabyte of data by as much as 97 percent, some customers are unable to afford more data when they run out.Google\u2019s Android software and apps like the Chrome browser, Maps and YouTube are often included with smartphones. But Facebook also makes products that vie for the attention of Indian consumers and advertisers.In fact, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram \u2014 all Facebook products \u2014 occupied three of the top six spots this year when the research firm App Annie measured how Indians spent their time online.Arjun Vishwanathan, associate director of emerging technologies at IDC India, said that search, Google\u2019s core expertise, was \u201cculturally not that important to Indians.\u201d\u201cWhere Google scores is its ability to keep it simple and keep it convenient while letting the consumer decide what she wants to do without being in her face,\u201d he said. Google also has vast amounts of data about its users that can be valuable in developing new products and targeting ads, he said.All of the work is backed by an extensive research effort by Google in India and other developing countries to examine how people really use their phones, what needs are unmet and how the company\u2019s apps are received.Datally was a product of such research. When a user opens it, a big screen pops up and shows how much mobile data the person has used, measurable by day, week or month. It also shows which apps are using the data and allows users to block some or all of them. A recent tweak added a feature for finding nearby Wi-Fi hot spots.Ted McCarthy, a Google user experience researcher, was in Jodhpur on Sunday and Monday to gather feedback on Datally and another app, a voice-controlled virtual assistant that is made to work on a $23 feature phone. He quizzed Indians about their internet use, their habits, even how they commuted to work, collecting information to take back to the team.One of the interview subjects, Deepika Panwar, 22, works in a bookkeeping job while trying to start a clothing and jewelry business. Most of her salary, Ms. Panwar said, goes to her parents to help support her younger brother and sister. She spends 179 rupees a month, or about $2.77, for a cellphone line with one gigabyte of data.She said her monthly data pack was often gone in 15 days as she browsed YouTube for fashion videos, used WhatsApp or surfed the web.When Mr. McCarthy showed her Datally, Ms. Panwar quickly grasped what it was about. \u201cIt is showing me what each application is doing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be a great help to me.\u201dThe interviews confirmed to Mr. McCarthy that Datally\u2019s fundamental premise was sound: The tool would be useful to people with data constraints. But they also revealed a couple of problems. The app\u2019s Wi-Fi finder had few public hot spots to suggest. And the technical language on the sign-up screen \u2014 with a warning that the app was creating a virtual private network to monitor network traffic \u2014 stymied potential users.On Monday, Mr. McCarthy visited Manju and showed her the Google Assistant on her new Reliance Jio feature phone. The app allows her to speak commands to the phone in Hindi or English.Language has been a particular barrier for internet adoption in India. The voice-driven assistant has been very popular in India, with 28 percent of all Google searches conducted by voice.At first, the app had trouble understanding her. But before long, she had it answering her questions.\u201cI just say it, and it\u2019s there,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
