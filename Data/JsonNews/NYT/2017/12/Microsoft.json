Microsoft, IBM and other Western and domestic stalwarts are busy hiring Chinese staff members in a field with a wide variety of potential applications.The new Google A.I. center could deepen the company\u2019s fraught but complicated relationship with China, now home to the world\u2019s biggest population of online users.Still, Google never left China entirely.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How does the Disney deal affect Fox\u2019s efforts to buy control of Sky?\u2022 The media world is gossiping over whether someone might try to top Disney.\u2022 Meet the advisers who helped put the transaction together.\u2022 Tim Cook and Charles Koch wrote a joint op-ed urging protection of Dreamers.As the Trump administration moves to block one media deal, it appears more supportive of today\u2019s big transaction.President Donald Trump called Rupert Murdoch on Thursday and congratulated him ahead of a deal for Walt Disney Co. to buy some of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox Inc., White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.\u201cI know that the president spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal,\u201d Sanders said.But then there\u2019s the jobs angle There\u2019s a problem. Here\u2019s what Disney\u2019s C.F.O., Christine McCarthy, told analysts this morning:We expect to fully realize roughly $2 billion of cost synergies by 2021.As Andrew reminded earlier this week, \u201csynergies\u201d is a code word for \u201clayoffs.\u201d And Disney executives said that the company expects to start realizing synergies within the first year after the deal closes.It isn\u2019t clear yet how many jobs would be cut if the transaction succeeds, but this would be a rare deal if it actually generated new positions on balance.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedFox has a bit of unfinished business before it can go forward with its deal with Disney.It\u2019s in the process of seeking regulatory approval in Britain to take full control of the British satellite television giant Sky in a deal worth about $15 billion. The two companies said on Thursday that Fox plans to proceed with the acquisition and hopes to complete the acquisition of the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn\u2019t own by the end of June.Sky would then be wholly owned by Disney, following the closing of the Fox deal.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company had previously said that its existing stake in Sky was \u201cnot a natural end position.\u201d\u2014 Chad BrayAs part of his company\u2019s $52.4 billion deal for Fox, Bob Iger of Disney agreed to renew his contract through 2021 to help complete the merger and integrate the new businesses.That would seem to mean a 2020 presidential run is off the table for Mr. Iger.The publication added:Iger told THR in June that \u201ca lot of people \u2014 a lot \u2014 have urged me to seek political office\u201d but denied he would consider a run for California governor or senator, positions that historically have served as stepping stones to the White House. However, Iger didn\u2019t specifically address the prospect of a White House run at the time.Here are a few other notable business people that are on the list:\u2022 Howard Schultz of Starbucks\u2022 Mark Cuban\u2022 Oprah Winfrey\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook\u2014 Stephen GrocerThat\u2019s the question that media executives and Wall Street bankers have been asking this morning.Could a digital company like Amazon, Google or Apple emerge with a higher bid? Or Verizon or Comcast?Or could some of them team up to buy the assets and split them among themselves? For example, Comcast has always wanted Fox\u2019s international assets, while any of the digital players would love to own Fox\u2019s content business.The Fox-Disney deal has about a $1.5 billion breakup fee if a higher bid were to emerge. If regulators block the deal, Disney would have to pay about $2.5 billion.The Murdochs\u2019 voting control is worth 39 percent of 21st Century Fox in most situations, except for this: If the company were up for sale, they can only vote their economic stake, which is about 17 percent. And of course, even if the deal is completed as presented today, the next chess piece that will become a point of focus is Hulu given its ownership: Disney would control 60 percent of the service, but Comcast would still own 30 percent and Time Warner owns another 10 percent.It gets complicated quickly.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinAnd, more important, how some of them will split an estimated fee bounty of up to $154 million.For Disney:\u2022 Guggenheim Partners\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2022 Cravath Swaine & MooreFor Fox:\u2022 Goldman Sachs\u2022 Centerview Partners\u2022 Deutsche Bank\u2022 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom\u2022 Hogan Lovells\u2022 Simpson Thacher & BartlettHere\u2019s how much each set of advisers could collectAccording to estimates from Freeman & Company:\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s Paul Pendergrass\u2019s take:One is a tech C.E.O. who has publicly espoused socially liberal initiatives.

The sooner that Congress resolves this situation \u2014 on a permanent basis \u2014 the sooner dreamers can seize the opportunity to plan their lives and develop their talents.This extraordinary set of circumstances has brought the two of us together as co-authors. We are business leaders who sometimes differ on the issues of the day. Yet, on a question as straightforward as this one, we are firmly aligned.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2022 The Murdochs, who own about 17 percent of existing shares in Fox, will own less than 5 percent of Disney and won\u2019t have any board seats there.What Robert Iger of Disney has to say We\u2019re honored and grateful that Rupert Murdoch has entrusted us with the future of businesses he spent a lifetime building, and we\u2019re excited about this extraordinary opportunity to significantly increase our portfolio of well-loved franchises and branded content to greatly enhance our growing direct-to-consumer offerings.\u2022 The corporate tax rate going down to 21 percent,instead of 20 percent\u2022 The top tax rate going down to 37 percent\u2022 A $10,000 deduction that can be split between mortgage payments and state and local taxes\u2022 A repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, but not the individual A.M.T.\u2022 The repeal of the individual insurance mandate\u2022 A preservation of tax breaks for medical expenses and tuition stipends for graduate students\u2022 A tax deduction for pass-through businesses that largely mirrors the Senate bill\u2019s treatmentThe tax flyaroundWhen told that the president thinks the Republican tax plan could lead to growth of more than 4 percent, here\u2019s what Ms. Yellen said:\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to rule anything out.

Advances Help Its Tech Industry, and State Security", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 During President Trump\u2019s visit to Beijing, he appeared on screen for a special address at a tech conference.First he spoke in English. Then he switched to Mandarin Chinese.Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t speak Chinese. The video was a publicity stunt, designed to show off the voice capabilities of iFlyTek, a Chinese artificial intelligence company with both innovative technology and troubling ties to Chinese state security. IFlyTek has said its technology can monitor a car full of people or a crowded room, identify a targeted individual\u2019s voice and record everything that person says.\u201cIFlyTek,\u201d the image of Mr. Trump said in Chinese, \u201cis really fantastic.\u201dAs China tests the frontiers of artificial intelligence, iFlyTek serves as a compelling example of both the country\u2019s sci-fi ambitions and the technology\u2019s darker dystopian possibilities.The Chinese company uses sophisticated A.I. to power image and voice recognition systems that can help doctors with their diagnoses, aid teachers in grading tests and let drivers control their cars with their voices. Even some global companies are impressed: Delphi, a major American auto supplier, offers iFlyTek\u2019s technology to carmakers in China, while Volkswagen plans to build the Chinese company\u2019s speech recognition technology into many of its cars in China next year.At the same time, iFlyTek hosts a laboratory to develop voice surveillance capabilities for China\u2019s domestic security forces. In an October report, a human rights group said the company was helping the authorities compile a biometric voice database of Chinese citizens that could be used to track activists and others.Those tight ties with the government could give iFlyTek and other Chinese companies an edge in an emerging new field. China\u2019s financial support and its loosely enforced and untested privacy laws give Chinese companies considerable resources and access to voices, faces and other biometric data in vast quantities, which could help them develop their technologies, experts say.China \u201cdoes not have the stringent privacy laws that Western companies have, nor are Chinese citizens against having their data collected, as (arguably speaking) government monitoring is a fact of China,\u201d analysts with the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein wrote in a report in November.IFlyTek and other Chinese companies say they follow China\u2019s laws and protect user data. But they agree that the sheer number of users in China, plus the government\u2019s single-minded drive to dominate the new technology, puts them at an advantage.\u201cChina has entered the artificial intelligence age together with the U.S.,\u201d said Liu Qingfeng, iFlyTek\u2019s chairman, at the Beijing conference. \u201cBut due to the advantage of a huge amount of users and China\u2019s social governance, A.I. will develop faster and spread from China to the world.\u201dAn iFlyTek spokeswoman said the company had yet to receive required permission from officials in Anhui, the Chinese province where it is based, to speak with the foreign news media.IFlyTek is portrayed in the Chinese media both as a technology innovator and as an ally of the government. Last year iFlyTek helped prevent the loss of about $75 million in telecommunications fraud by helping the police target scammers, according to The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the Communist Party. Its article quotes a Chinese security official as saying collecting voice patterns is like taking fingerprints or recording people with closed-circuit television cameras, meaning the practice does not violate their privacy.\u201cWe work with the Ministry of Public Security to pin down the criminals,\u201d said Liu Junfeng, the general manager of the company\u2019s automotive business, at a conference in September.Where iFlyTek gets its data is not clear. But one of its owners is China Mobile, the state-controlled cellular network giant, which has more than 800 million subscribers. IFlyTek preloads its products on millions of China Mobile phones and runs the hotline service for China Mobile, which did not respond to a request for comment.\u201cData is gold,\u201d said Anil Jain, a professor who studies biometrics at Michigan State University. \u201cThese days you cannot design an accurate and robust recognition system for anything\u201d without data.Cars could be another major market, iFlyTek believes. China is pioneering a push into self-driving cars, which could heavily depend on voice technology. In September, iFlyTek introduced a new product, a glowing ellipsoid that mounts on a dashboard and listens for questions that it can check online, like a car-mounted Siri.\u201cWe have to understand if the car is our friend, if there is an emotional connection,\u201d Mr. Liu said.Through a third-party supplier, a few hundred thousand of the four million cars that the Volkswagen Group sells in China annually will be equipped next year with iFlyTek voice recognition technology, said Christoph Ludewig, a spokesman for the German automaker. Volkswagen said it requires that any data gathered from drivers is kept anonymous.\u201cVolkswagen will protect customers from the misuse of their data,\u201d Mr. Ludewig said.Delphi, the American auto parts giant, said it had a relationship with iFlyTek to offer its services in China but declined to disclose details.Mr. Liu, the head of iFlyTek\u2019s automotive business, said that the company\u2019s systems would be installed next year in some Jeeps sold in China and that it was developing automotive voice systems with Daimler, which owns the Mercedes-Benz brand. FiatChrysler, Jeep\u2019s parent, said it had not found any of its suppliers using iFlytek. A Daimler spokeswoman said that the company was regularly in discussions with potential suppliers but declined to say if iFlyTek was one of them.In its home province of Anhui, iFlyTek has assembled a database of 70,000 voice patterns, according to the report, which also said that the police had begun collecting records of voice patterns as they would fingerprints. The report cited as one example three women suspected of being sex workers whose voices were registered in a database, it said, in part because they had been arrested in Anhui.IFlyTek did not respond to requests for comment on the Human Rights Watch report but has said its data-gathering efforts will not stop, particularly as it participates in China\u2019s push to develop self-driving cars.\u201cWe are always talking about big data \u2014 the vehicle produces many images every day,\u201d said Mr. Liu, the iFlyTek automotive executive.Paul Mozur reported from Beijing and Keith Bradsher from Tianjin and Guangzhou, China.

{"Headline": "How Big Tech Is Going After Your Health Care", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Daniel Poston, a second-year medical student in Manhattan, opened the App Store on his iPhone a couple of weeks ago, he was astonished to see an app for a new heart study prominently featured.People often learn about new research studies through in-person conversations with their doctors. But not only did this study, run by Stanford University, use a smartphone to recruit consumers, it was financed by Apple. And it involved using an app on the Apple Watch to try to identify irregular heart rhythms.\u201cIt\u2019s not inconceivable, by the time I graduate from medical school,\u201d Mr. Poston said, \u201cthat the entire practice of medicine can be revolutionized by technology.\u201dThe companies are accelerating their efforts to remake health care by developing or collaborating on new tools for consumers, patients, doctors, insurers and medical researchers. And they are increasingly investing in health start-ups.In the first 11 months of this year, 10 of the largest tech companies in the United States were involved in health care equity deals worth $2.7 billion, up from just $277 million for all of 2012, according to data from CB Insights, a research firm that tracks venture capital and start-ups.Each tech company is taking its own approach, betting that its core business strengths could ultimately improve people\u2019s health \u2014 or at least make health care more efficient. Apple, for example, has focused on its consumer products, Microsoft on online storage and analytics services, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, on data.Physicians and researchers caution that it is too soon to tell whether novel continuous-monitoring tools, like apps for watches and smartphones, will help reduce disease and prolong lives \u2014 or just send more people to doctors for unnecessary tests.But now they, and other companies, are more visibly focused on creating, or investing in, new kinds of technologies for doctors, patients and consumers.\u201cWe are creating devices that collect information, new molecular assays \u2014 and all of that is just to try to understand health at a deeper level,\u201d said Dr. Jessica L. Mega, Verily\u2019s chief medical officer.Apple is taking a different approach \u2014 using its popular iPhone and Apple Watch to help consumers better track and manage their health.\u201cApple is trying to drag medicine from where it currently takes place \u2014 in hospitals and clinics \u2014 and move it to the consumer side, to your phone,\u201d said Malay Gandhi, an executive in residence at Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm.In 2015, Apple introduced new software, called Apple ResearchKit, for health researchers. Stanford used it to develop an app to enroll volunteers in a heart study and track their physical activities, sleeping hours and fitness.Dr. Lloyd B. Minor, dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, said the app enabled researchers to smoothly enroll more than 54,000 patients \u2014 a large number for a study conducted by one medical center \u2014 and collect much more data than they could have otherwise.\u201cFor us, it was an eye-opener,\u201d he said.Stanford is also conducting the Apple Heart Study. It is intended to determine whether an app for the Apple Watch can accurately detect irregular heart rhythms \u2014 particularly those associated with atrial fibrillation, a condition that can lead to blood clots and strokes.If the app detects irregular heart rhythms, it will send participants a notification and offer them a free video consultation with a doctor. The study is not designed to assess whether people who used the watch app had a reduced incidence of stroke and cardiac death compared with people who did not use the app.Microsoft, already a major supplier of software and cloud services to medical centers, is also ramping up its health business.This year, the company announced an initiative, Healthcare NeXT, to create products for medical providers and patients using artificial intelligence and cloud services like speech recognition.\u201cWe\u2019re really focusing on what people in the health care world are doing today and how we can make it better,\u201d said Peter Lee, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for artificial intelligence and research.Facebook, too, has been expanding its business and research efforts in the health sector.And this year, Oculus, the virtual reality gear maker owned by Facebook, teamed up with Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles to develop V.R. simulations for doctors and medical students to practice handling high-risk pediatric medical emergencies.Dr. Topol of Scripps said tech companies had an opportunity to remake longstanding, cumbersome systems \u2014 like hospital alarms at a patient\u2019s bedside that go off dozens of times every day \u2014 and re-envision how health care is delivered.\u201cThere\u2019s not one tech company that isn\u2019t involved one way or another,\u201d Dr. Topol said. \u201cMany of the companies see this as somewhere between rescue and a great business opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Congratulations!But don\u2019t settle in to your throne quite yet. A potential catastrophe looms on the horizon. A huge tsunami is coming your way.Fortunately, there\u2019s hope. Yours is a wealthy island. You can\u2019t prevent the tsunami, but you can prepare your people for the onslaught, and perhaps even mitigate its worst effects. So you make an executive decision \u2014 the island will use a huge share of future income to equip each resident with the best-known defense against tsunamis: Every islander gets a parachute.Wait, how would that work?The above situation exactly describes the puzzlement among some people in Silicon Valley at the $1.5 trillion Republican tax bill that was approved by the House and Senate this week.To those who study how tech is altering society and the economy, the bill looks like the wrong fix for the wrong problem. The bill (the parachute) does little to address the tech-abetted wave of economic displacement (the tsunami) that may be looming just off the horizon. And it also seems to intensify some of the structural problems in the tech business, including its increasing domination by five giants \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 which own some of the world\u2019s most important economic platforms.But Gabriel Zucman, who studies taxes and inequality at the University of California, Berkeley, pointed out that the 10.5 percent rate would still be much lower than the rate paid by potential start-up rivals that mostly make their money in the United States (the corporate tax rate on domestic earnings in the new bill is 21 percent). This difference, Mr. Zucman said, \u201ccreates an uneven playing field, where big monopolies will pay lower taxes than new entrants, which could reduce innovation.\u201dApple, Google and Microsoft declined to discuss the effects of the bill.But some in Silicon Valley think the giants misplayed their hand in the legislation. In pursuing short-term tax advantages, they missed a chance to advocate policies that might have more broadly benefited many of their customers \u2014 and improved their images, too.\u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s failure to engage in the tax reform debate was a serious failing of long-term strategy,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a writer and researcher who studies economic and social issues related to the tech business. \u201cThey had a real opportunity to use tax reform as a way to address inequality \u2014 and as a result of this bill, inequality may increase, and public backlash against the tech industry may increase.\u201dThis gets back to that looming tsunami. Though many of the economy\u2019s structural problems predate the last decade\u2019s rise of the tech behemoths, the innovations that Silicon Valley has been working on \u2014 things like e-commerce, cloud storage, artificial intelligence and the general digitization of everything and everyone around you \u2014 are some of the central protagonists in the economic story of our age.Among other economic concerns, these innovations are implicated in the rise of inequality; the expanding premium on education and skills; the decimation and dislocation of retail jobs; the rising urban-rural divide, and spiking housing costs in cities; and the rise of the \u201cgig\u201d economy of contract workers who drive Ubers and rent out their spare bedrooms on Airbnb.In the long run, there\u2019s also the question of whether there will be enough work for everyone \u2014 or whether, as some have speculated, automation may replace large numbers of workers altogether.It\u2019s true that many of the policy ideas to address the economic effects brought about by tech would be expensive. Mr. Khanna\u2019s plan, for instance, is projected to cost $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion over a decade.In other words, it would cost as much as much as the Republican tax bill. But unlike that one, this plan might actually address the tsunami.An earlier version of this article misstated that Apple, Google and Microsoft had expanded their lobbying efforts to push for tax reform. The companies increased spending on their overall lobbying work, not only on tax issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great American Single-Family Home Problem", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "Building more housing, more densely, could help address a widespread economic challenge. A fight over one lot in Berkeley, Calif., shows how tough that could be.Supported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 The house at 1310 Haskell Street does not look worthy of a bitter neighborhood war. The roof is rotting, the paint is chipping, and while the lot is long and spacious, the backyard has little beyond overgrown weeds and a garage sprouting moss.The owner was known for hoarding junk and feeding cats, and when she died three years ago the neighbors assumed that whoever bought the house would be doing a lot of work. But when the buyer turned out to be a developer, and when that developer floated a proposal to raze the building and replace it with a trio of small homes, the neighborhood erupted in protest.Most of the complaints were what you might hear about any development. People thought the homes would be too tall and fretted that more residents would mean fewer parking spots.Other objections were particular to Berkeley \u2014 like a zoning board member\u2019s complaint that shadows from the homes might hurt the supply of locally grown food.Whatever the specifics, what is happening in Berkeley may be coming soon to a neighborhood near you. Around the country, many fast-growing metropolitan areas are facing a brutal shortage of affordable places to live, leading to gentrification, homelessness, even disease. As cities struggle to keep up with demand, they have remade their skylines with condominium and apartment towers \u2014 but single-family neighborhoods, where low-density living is treated as sacrosanct, have rarely been part of the equation.If cities are going to tackle their affordable housing problems, economists say, that is going to have to change. But how do you build up when neighbors want down?\u201cIt\u2019s an enormous problem, and it impacts the very course of America\u2019s future,\u201d said Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard who studies cities.Even though the Haskell Street project required no alterations to Berkeley\u2019s zoning code, it took the developer two years and as many lawsuits to get approval. He plans to start building next year. The odyssey has become a case study in how California dug itself into a vast housing shortage \u2014 a downside, in part, of a thriving economy \u2014 and why the State Legislature is taking power from local governments to solve it.Mary Trew, a retired graphic designer who fought the project, drew the same conclusion with a different spin: \u201cMunicipalities are losing their authority.\u201dThe affordable-housing crunch is a nationwide problem, but California is the superlative. The state\u2019s median home price, at just over $500,000, is more than twice the national level and up about 60 percent from five years ago, according to Zillow. It affects the poor, the rich and everyone in between.The problem is that smaller and generally more affordable quarters like duplexes and small apartment buildings, where young families get their start, are being built at a slower rate. Such projects hold vast potential to provide lots of housing \u2014 and reduce sprawl \u2014 by adding density to the rings of neighborhoods that sit close to job centers but remain dominated by larger lots and single-family homes.Neighborhoods in which single-family homes make up 90 percent of the housing stock account for a little over half the land mass in both the Bay Area and Los Angeles metropolitan areas, according to Issi Romem, BuildZoom\u2019s chief economist. There are similar or higher percentages in virtually every American city, making these neighborhoods an obvious place to tackle the affordable-housing problem.\u201cSingle-family neighborhoods are where the opportunity is, but building there is taboo,\u201d Mr. Romem said. As long as single-family-homeowners are loath to add more housing on their blocks, he said, the economic logic will always be undone by local politics.California is trying to change that. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a sweeping package with 15 new bills designed to tame rental costs and speed construction.\u201cWe can\u2019t just plan for growth, we have to actually build,\u201d said Ben Metcalf, director of the California Department of Housing and Community Development.But the bigger, thornier question is where all these new residences will go, and how hard neighbors will try to prevent them. The Haskell Street fight shows why passing laws is one thing and building is another, but also gives a glimpse of what the denser neighborhoods of the future might look like \u2014 and why lots of little buildings are more important than a few skyscrapers.The 1300 block of Haskell Street sits in a kind of transition zone between the taller buildings in downtown Berkeley and the low-rise homes scattered through the eastern hills. The neighborhood has a number of single-family homes, and the street is quiet and quasi-suburban, but there are also apartment buildings and backyard cottages that nod to the city\u2019s denser core.A little under three years ago, a contractor named Christian Szilagy bought the property and presented the city with a proposal to demolish the house and replace it with three skinny and rectangular homes that would extend through the lot. Each would have one parking spot, a garden and about 1,500 square feet of living space.On paper, at least, there was nothing wrong with the proposal. The city\u2019s zoning code designates the area as \u201cR2-A,\u201d or a mixed-density area with apartments as well as houses.Berkeley\u2019s planning staff recommended approval. But as neighbors wrote letters, called the city and showed up at meetings holding signs that said \u201cProtect Our Community\u201d and \u201cReject 1310 Haskell Permit!,\u201d the project quickly became politicized.One focal point was Kurt Caudle\u2019s garden. Mr. Caudle is a brewpub manager who lives in a small house on the back side of Ms. Trew\u2019s property (that lot has two homes, or one fewer than was proposed next door). Just outside his back door sits an oasis from the city: a quiet garden where he has a small Buddha statue and grows tomatoes, squash and greens in raised beds that he built.\u201cWhen you completely shadow all of the open space,\u201d Ms. Hahn said during a hearing, \u201cyou really impact the ability for anybody to possibly grow food in this community.\u201dHome prices in the ZIP code surrounding the 1300 block of Haskell Street have just about doubled over the past five years, to an average of about $900,000, according to Zillow. Those numbers are terrifying to people like L.C. Stephens, 67, who is retired from the state corrections department.Mr. Stephens pays $1,600 to live in a modest apartment complex that was built in 1963 and sits just a few lots down from the project site. His building was recently purchased by investors and is being painted and renovated. The rehabilitated units go for $2,400 and up.\u201cPeople are getting priced out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about \u2018We need more housing.\u2019 Yeah, we can use it, but it needs to be affordable.\u201dThe proposed homes are not that. They are estimated to sell for around $1 million. But this is an illustration of the economist\u2019s argument that more housing will lower prices. The cost of a rehabilitated single-family home in the area \u2014 which is what many of the neighbors preferred to see on the lot \u2014 runs to $1.4 million or more.\u201cThis issue is bigger than Haskell Street,\u201d Mr. Arreguin said. \u201cThis project sets a precedent for what I believe is out-of-scale development that will compromise the quality of life and character of our neighborhoods throughout the city of Berkeley.\u201dThe city\u2019s denial won applause from the crowd. It also drew a lawsuit.Not-in-my-backyard activism has been a fixture of California for long enough that the state already has a law about it. In 1982, Mr. Brown, during his first run as governor, signed the Housing Accountability Act, colloquially known as the \u201canti-Nimby law.\u201dThe law bars cities from stopping developments that meet local zoning codes. In other words, it\u2019s illegal for cities to ignore their own housing laws. The act is rarely invoked, however, because developers don\u2019t want to sue cities for fear it will anger city councils and make it harder for them to gain approval for other developments.Shortly after Berkeley denied the Haskell Street permit, Ms. Trauss sued the city \u2014 and won.Berkeley agreed to give the project a new hearing and consider the Housing Accountability Act when reviewing future development. Neighbors, still incensed, continued to put pressure on the city to deny it. And the city did, this time refusing a demolition permit.Ms. Trauss sued again, and in July a Superior Court judge for Alameda County ordered the city to issue the permit.\u201cOrganizing alone doesn\u2019t get us out of the crisis,\u201d said Ryan J. Patterson, Ms. Trauss\u2019s lawyer and a partner at Zacks, Freedman & Patterson in San Francisco. \u201cYou have to have a fist people fear.\u201dNat Friedman, a serial entrepreneur who became a vice president at Microsoft after selling his company to the software giant last year, has helped California Yimby raise close to $1 million for its efforts to lobby the state on housing issues.\u201cThe smaller the unit of government, the harder it is to solve this problem,\u201d Mr. Friedman said.\u201cWhat\u2019s frustrating for anybody trying to build housing is that they try to play by the rules and they still get told \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Ms. Skinner said.Ms. Skinner\u2019s law takes effect next year, so the long-term impact is unclear. But just a few weeks before it was signed, the Zoning Adjustments Board had another contentious housing project.Neighbors had familiar complaints: The homes were too tall, had long shadows, and more residents would make it harder to find parking. The board\u2019s chairman responded that he understood the concerns but couldn\u2019t risk another lawsuit.California isn\u2019t going to solve its housing problem in the courts. But the basic idea \u2014 big-footing local government so that cities have a harder time blocking development \u2014 is central to the solutions that the state is pursuing.This is a state of great ambition. It wants to lead the country on actions to reduce carbon emissions, and has enacted legislation mandating a $15 minimum wage by 2022. But housing is undermining all of it.In a brief speech before signing the recent package of housing bills, Mr. Brown talked about how yesterday\u2019s best intentions become today\u2019s problems. California cities have some of the nation\u2019s strictest building regulations, and measures to do things like encourage energy efficiency and enhance neighborhood aesthetics eventually become regulatory overreach.\u201cCity and state people did all this good stuff,\u201d Mr. Brown said to a crowd of legislators. \u201cBut, as I always say, too many goods create a bad.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Protests Move Online, Yet Big Tech Is Quiet", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReddit, Etsy and Kickstarter were among the sites warning that the proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to roll back so-called net neutrality rules would fundamentally change the way the internet is experienced. Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site, cleared its entire home screen for a sparse white screen reading \u201cDefend Net Neutrality\u201d in large letters. Reddit, the popular online message board, pushed in multiple ways on its site for keeping the rules, including a pop-up box on its home screen.But the online protests also highlighted how the biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, have taken a back seat in the debate about protecting net neutrality, rules that prohibit internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing sites or for charging people or companies for faster speeds of particular sites. For the most part, the large tech companies did not engage in the protest on Tuesday. In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules.\u201cFirst, the major tech companies are very aware that Washington has turned hostile,\u201d Mr. Feld said. \u201cIn this environment, the big tech companies try to keep a low profile and play defense rather than take positions that draw attention.\u201cSo with the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations,\u201d he said.There also does not appear to be much chance of their winning the debate right now. The three Republican members of the F.C.C., who make up a majority of commissioners at the agency, have committed to roll back the landmark broadband rules created during the Obama administration.But consumers and the start-ups that participated in protests on Tuesday say they are gearing up for a long fight. They expect lawsuits to challenge the change, and plan to push Congress to pass a law ensuring an open internet.Here is how several of the biggest companies have handled the issue in recent months.It\u2019s a restrained approach compared with Google\u2019s aggressive lobbying campaign in 2006 when Sergey Brin, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, went to Capitol Hill to argue for the importance of net neutrality. In 2010, Google teamed up with Verizon to lay out a vision for how net neutrality could work, advocating against allowing internet service providers to provide fast lanes to people who pay more. However, the proposal was criticized by advocates of an open internet because it excluded wireless connectivity and new services from broadband providers.Apple is a newcomer to the net neutrality debate. It made its first filing to the F.C.C. on the issue in August. It espoused a position largely in line with other internet giants, arguing against the creation of fast lanes and emphasizing the importance of an open internet.Apple\u2019s public opposition to the proposed changes also reflects the growing network of services on offer from the company including Apple Music, a streaming music service that also offers video content, and potentially an internet video service to rival Netflix.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that all internet service providers should treat all data on the internet equally.\u201cEqual treatment is critical to innovation in a digital economy and to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the F.C.C. doesn\u2019t provide this basic protection, we urge Congress to intervene.\u201dDuring the last day of online protest in support of the rules this past summer, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s leaders, posted defiant statements to their personal Facebook pages.But the executives have been pretty quiet on the issue in recent months. The company\u2019s focus in Washington has been more concentrated on fallout from its handling of Russian-linked propaganda used during the 2016 presidential election.This week, Facebook offered a statement from Erin Egan, a policy spokeswoman, about the F.C.C. plans:\u201cFacebook has always supported the kind of strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Ms. Egan said. \u201cWe are disappointed by the F.C.C.\u2019s decision to remove these protections, and we stand ready to work with policymakers on a framework that will protect a free and open internet.\u201dAmazon representatives have been lobbying F.C.C. commissioners and staff in person, with visits on Nov. 29 and last Wednesday. The latter included a meeting between Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, and Darren Achord, an Amazon senior public policy manager.\u201cDuring the meetings, we stated that Amazon has long supported net neutrality protections to ensure our customers can enjoy an open internet, and we emphasized that the company remains committed to that position,\u201d Gerard Waldron, a lawyer who represents Amazon and participated in the meeting, wrote in an account filed with the F.C.C.\u201cWe stressed the need for enforceable, bright-line rules to protect the open internet and guard against anti-consumer and anti-competitive activities,\u201d he wrote, adding that Amazon opposed the commission\u2019s proposed change.Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Netflix, said this week that the company did not have anything to add to its earlier statements opposing the F.C.C.\u2019s actions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Accuses North Korea of Mounting WannaCry Cyberattack", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration formally accused North Korea on Monday night of creating the WannaCry cyberattack that briefly paralyzed the British health system and placed ransomware on computers in dozens of countries around the world.Still, the assertion by the administration, which officials said would be supported at a White House news conference on Tuesday, was notable for three reasons.It is the same intelligence agencies \u2014 and some of the government\u2019s same experts \u2014 that built the case against North Korea, according to members of the intelligence community who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation.Once it was clear the code had been stolen, the National Security Agency rushed to contain the damage, asking Microsoft to build a \u201cpatch\u201d in its operating systems to prevent the attacks. But the agency has never talked about the group that stole the computer code, called the Shadow Brokers, which many officials believe is operating on behalf of the Russian government. But Mr. Bossert and his deputy, Rob Joyce, who formerly ran the Tailored Access Operations, have argued that it is the perpetrator of the attacks, not the United States government, that must take all of the responsibility for the damage it has wreaked.\u201cThe consequences and repercussions of WannaCry were beyond economic,\u201d Mr. Bossert wrote. \u201cThe malicious software hit computers in the U.K.\u2019s health care sector particularly hard, compromising systems that perform critical work. These disruptions put lives at risk.\u201dMr. Bossert seems determined to change that, and he wrote about elements of a new digital strategy that suggests that the Trump administration will be more aggressive in alerting manufacturers to flaws found in their software. But he has been vague about what kind of actions might be taken against those who initiate cyberattacks.Robert Hannigan, the former director of Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters, said last month that in the realm of digital breaches, North Korea had benefited from being underestimated.\u201cBecause they are such a mix of the weird and absurd and medieval and highly sophisticated, people didn\u2019t take it seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can such an isolated, backward country have this capability?

They did not find it. But when they compared the images with historical drawings and records of where the Ward went down, the similarities were enough.\u201cThese ships are war graves,\u201d said Paul Mayer, the pilot of the submersible vehicles on the Petrel, who was in the co-pilot seat and watched with the team as the first new images of the Ward in decades appeared in front of them. The data and images retrieved from the ship will be turned over to Filipino and American naval historians and researchers. The survey was part of a broader mission by the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul G. Allen to search for and document the relics of World War II. Mr. Allen, who owns the 250-foot Petrel, has embarked on similar projects, inspired by his father\u2019s service in the war.In November, the Petrel, which has equipment that can explore and retrieve data 20,000 feet underwater, captured footage of five Japanese battle ships that were lost during the Battle of Surigao Strait in the Philippines on Oct. 25, 1944, one of the largest naval battles in history, with more than 4,000 men killed.\u201cAnd that was a starting point,\u201d Mr. Mayer said.A robotic subaquatic vehicle that uses sound waves to detect objects and transmits its discoveries back to the surface was deployed. Then the other vehicle was sent down, replete with cameras. It found and circled the ship for about an hour.The Ward appeared to have gone down stern first. It settled on the bottom, leaning slightly to one side. About two-thirds of it was detectable; either the stern had broken off or it had become overwhelmed by marine growth and completely disintegrated, Mr. Mayer said.\u201cWe approached the wheelhouse, and you could see the wheel, and that is unusual to be able to see that,\u201d Mr. Mayer said. \u201cThe bridge was still in place. Most of the wrecks we see, you are not able to see that level of detail.\u201d \u201cWe had a pretty good idea of where it was in a confined area, and it did not take long to find it,\u201d Mr. Mayer said. \u201cBut you are approaching a historic shipwreck, and there is always a bit of anxiety and elation when you come to it, when the R.V. is closer and it comes into view.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The Winklevoss Twins\u2019 unorthodox path to fame and Bitcoin fortune\u2022 There is a paucity of women in corporate America\u2019s c-suites.\u2022 Not every analyst is in love with Apple\u2019s stock price.\u2022 A four-year-old Bitcoin investment fund has posted a 25,004 percent lifetime return.\u2022 Apollo\u2019s low-priced deal to buy Qdoba.Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss made a risky bet five years ago: They took $65-million settlement with Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and loaded up on Bitcoin.That wager has paid off. Their Bitcoin stockpile was worth around $1.3 billion on Tuesday. The question now is whether their bitcoin fortune will prove fleeting.\u2022 They took their settlement with Mr. Zuckerberg in Facebook shares. The value of their stake grew to $300 million when Facebook went public in 2012.\u2022 They began buying Bitcoin in late 2012 when the price of an individual coin was below $10.\u2022 They have collected an additional $350 million or so of other virtual currencies, most of it in the Bitcoin alternative called Ethereum.\u2022 The brothers are also majority owners of the virtual currency exchange they founded, Gemini, which likely takes their joint holdings to a value well over $2 billion, or enough to make them each of them billionaires.And that\u2019s getting worse. Women hold only 23 percent of senior executive posts with a title that includes the word chief, down from 24 percent in 2016, according to an analysis by Korn Ferry of the top 1,000 American companies by revenue.Here is Breakingviews\u2019s take:A detailed breakdown presents an even bleaker picture. Women make up just 6 percent of the blue-chip group\u2019s chief executive officers, and 11 percent of its chief financial officers. Parity comes, perhaps predictably, in that most social of C-level jobs, chief human resource officers, where females hold 55 percent of positions.The overall decline is even more glaring in the wake of the #metoo movement afflicting media, technology, entertainment and political circles. More women in the higher echelons of the corporate ranks could help change a culture that turns a blind eye to, if not condones, bad behavior.The financial industry might be a test case. The sector outranked all others in the analysis with nearly 30 percent of C-suite jobs held by women. That\u2019s a better track record than more female-friendly industries like retail and consumer at 24 percent, yet even in finance women are largely kept out of the most senior roles. Only 5 percent of the industry\u2019s CEOs and 8 percent of its CFOs are female, among the lowest levels in the survey.What catalyst will propel Apple\u2019s market value above $1 trillion? The Republican tax cuts? The iPhone X? Growth in Apple\u2019s services business?While that question has been a favorite question of market watchers for years, it has become more relevant recently as Apple\u2019s market capitalization has crossed the $900 billion mark.But Nomura Instinet\u2019s Jeffrey Kvaal on Tuesday threw some cold water on those bets. In a report, the analyst lowered his rating on Apple\u2019s stock to neutral. Mr. Kvaal wrote:\u201cWe argue that the stock\u2019s gains for the iPhone X supercycle are in the late innings. We believe unit growth, if not quite [Average Selling Price] growth, is well anticipated by consensus and a historically full multiple.\u201dApple\u2019s stock has gained 55 percent this year and is up nearly 10 percent since it unveiled the iPhone X.\u201cBefore today, two cuts to neutral or the equivalent in June were the last ones, according to data collected by Bloomberg. One of those firms has since upgraded the shares. Analysts are still overwhelmingly positive on the stock, which has been the largest contributor to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s gains this year, with 36 firms rating it a buy, eight advising hold and 0 sell recommendations.\u201d\u2014 Stephen Grocer\u201cWhile Tuesday\u2019s findings won\u2019t lead to fines, they pave the way for Germany to order changes in the way Facebook does business when it issues a final decision as early as summer 2018. If upheld in European Union court, this new line of attack could eventually expand the boundaries of competition law across the bloc to encompass questions of online privacy.\u201cGermany\u2019s case turns privacy into a competition issue by arguing that Facebook is the only major social network in Germany, with more than 90% market share, leaving users no choice but to accept its take-it-or-leave-it terms of service\u2014which include consent for the collection of third-party data.\u201dThe investigation is the most recent example of European authorities going after big American tech companies. Here are a few:So far European regulators have been more aggressive than the counterparts in the United States. But the increasing size and power of these tech giants are raising concerns. Facebook, Google, and Twitter have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers this year over the manipulation of social media during the 2016 election by Russian operatives.At a hearing on Russia\u2019s involvement in the election this fall, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California told the executives of the three companies: \u201cYou have to be the ones to do something about this.

{"Headline": "\u2018Intelligent\u2019 Policing and My Innocent Children", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Last month I spoke at a gathering of African-American technology professionals. I\u2019m a transactional lawyer at a tech company and my husband is an engineer, so the industry is at the center of our lives. We have careers that allow us to help create products and tools our grandparents would never have thought were possible and to provide the kind of life for our family that they couldn\u2019t have imagined. And it\u2019s important to us to ensure that other people of color have a chance to contribute to the field and reap its benefits. With all those things on my mind, I left the conference energized and inspired by the ways in which tech is changing the world and the possibilities it holds for our community.At the same time, I\u2019m terrified for what these advances mean for my two young children. The same technology that\u2019s the source of so much excitement in my career is being used in law enforcement in ways that could mean that in the coming years, my son, who is 7 now, is more likely to be profiled or arrested \u2014 or worse \u2014 for no reason other than his race and where we live.Of course I\u2019m not alone in feeling that technology is both a gift and a curse. This tension exists for anyone who enjoys the real-time conversations on Twitter but loathes the trolls, loves Facebook but abhors fake news, or depends on the convenience Alexa offers but frets about violations of privacy.Yet in my life, because of the way artificial intelligence and machine learning are being increasingly used by law enforcement \u2014 the technology is seemingly growing up alongside my kids \u2014 it\u2019s especially acute.Unjust racial profiling and resulting racial disparities in the criminal justice system certainly don\u2019t depend on artificial intelligence. But when you add it \u2014 as many law enforcement agencies across the country, including those in major cities like Miami, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Atlanta and New York, have over the past couple of years \u2014 things get even scarier for black families.These downsides of A.I. are no secret. Despite this, state and local law enforcement agencies have begun to use predictive policing applications fueled by A.I. like HunchLab, which combines historical crime data, moon phases, location, census data and even professional sports team schedules to predict when and where crime will occur and even who\u2019s likely to commit or be a victim of certain crimes.The problem with historical crime data is that it\u2019s based upon policing practices that already disproportionately home in on blacks, Latinos, and those who live in low-income areas.It\u2019s no wonder criminologists have raised red flags about the self-fulfilling nature of using historical crime data.This hits close to home. An October 2016 study by the Human Rights Data Analysis Group concluded that if the Oakland Police Department used its 2010 record of drug-crimes information as the basis of an algorithm to guide policing, the department \u201cwould have dispatched officers almost exclusively to lower-income, minority neighborhoods,\u201d despite the fact that public-health-based estimates suggest that drug use is much more widespread, taking place in many other parts of the city where my family and I live.Those \u201clower-income, minority neighborhoods\u201d contain the barbershop where I take my son for his monthly haircut and our favorite hoagie shop. Would I let him run ahead of me if I knew that simply setting foot on those sidewalks would make him more likely to be seen as a criminal in the eyes of the law?The risks are even more acute (and unavoidable) for those who can afford to live only in the neighborhoods that A.I. would most likely lead officers to focus on.Without a commitment to ensure that the data being used to fuel A.I. doesn\u2019t replicate historical racism, biases will be built into the foundation of many \u201cintelligent\u201d systems shaping how we live. It\u2019s not that I want this technology to be rejected. There are ways to make A.I. work. But before it is used in law enforcement, it must be thoroughly tested and proven not to disproportionately harm communities of color.Until then my excitement about advances in tech will always be cautious. Innovation is at the core of the careers that allow me and my husband to provide a good life for our family. The same innovation, if not used properly, could take it all away.B\u00e4r\u00ed A.

Extended-cab pickup trucks. For Democratic districts? Sedans.Those conclusions may not be particularly surprising.

In that sense, he said, \u201ccomputers don\u2019t have one hand tied behind their backs anymore.\u201dText has been easier for A.I. to handle, because words have discrete characters \u2014 26 letters, in the case of English. That makes it much closer to the natural language of computers than the freehand chaos of imagery. But image recognition technology, much of it developed by major technology companies, has improved greatly in recent years.The Stanford project gives a glimpse at the potential. By pulling the vehicles\u2019 makes, models and years from the images, and then linking that information with other data sources, the project was able to predict factors like pollution and voting patterns at the neighborhood level.In the end, the car-image project involved 50 million images of street scenes gathered from Google Street View. In them, 22 million cars were identified, and then classified into more than 2,600 categories like their make and model, located in more than 3,000 ZIP codes and 39,000 voting districts.But first, a database curated by humans had to train the A.I. software to understand the images.The researchers recruited hundreds of people to pick out and classify cars in a sample of millions of pictures. Some of the online contractors did simple tasks like identifying the cars in images. Others were car experts who knew nuances like the subtle difference in the taillights on the 2007 and 2008 Honda Accords.\u201cCollecting and labeling a large data set is the most painful thing you can do in our field,\u201d said Ms. Gebru, who received her Ph.D. from Stanford in September and now works for Microsoft Research.But without experiencing that data-wrangling work, she added, \u201cyou don\u2019t understand what is impeding progress in A.I. in the real world.\u201dOnce the car-image engine was built, its speed and predictive accuracy was impressive. It successfully classified the cars in the 50 million images in two weeks. That task would take a human expert, spending 10 seconds per image, more than 15 years.Identifying so many car images in such detail was a technical feat. But it was linking that new data set to public collections of socioeconomic and environmental information, and then tweaking the software to spot patterns and correlations, that makes the Stanford project part of what computer scientists see as the broader application of image data.\u201cThere has been an explosion of computer vision research, but so far the societal impact has been largely absent,\u201d said Serge Belongie, a computer scientist at Cornell Tech. \u201cBeing able to identify what is in a photo is not science that advances our understanding of the world.\u201d\u25a0 The system was able to accurately predict income, race, education and voting patterns at the ZIP code and precinct level in cities across the country.\u25a0 Car attributes (including miles-per-gallon ratings) found that the greenest city in America is Burlington, Vt., while Casper, Wyo., has the largest per-capita carbon footprint.\u25a0 Chicago is the city with the highest level of income segregation, with large clusters of expensive and cheap cars in different neighborhoods; Jacksonville, Fla., is the least segregated by income.\u25a0 New York is the city with the most expensive cars. El Paso has the highest percentage of Hummers. San Francisco has the highest percentage of foreign cars.Other researchers have used Google Street View data for visual clues for factors that influence urban development, ethnic shifts in local communities and public health. But the Stanford project appears to have used the most Street View images in the most detailed analysis so far.The significance of the project, experts say, is a proof of concept \u2014 that new information can be gleaned from visual data with artificial intelligence software and plenty of human help.The role of such research, they say, will be mainly to supplement traditional information sources like the government\u2019s American Community Survey, the household surveys conducted by the Census Bureau.This kind of research, if it expands, will raise issues of data access and privacy. The Stanford project only made predictions about neighborhoods, not about individuals. But privacy concerns about Street View pictures have been raised in Germany and elsewhere. Google says it handles research requests for access to large amounts of its image data on a case-by-case basis.Onboard cameras in cars are just beginning, as auto companies seek to develop self-driving cars. Will some of the vast amounts of image data they collect be available for research or kept proprietary?Kenneth Wachter, a professor of demography at the University of California, Berkeley, said image-based studies could be a big help now that public response rates to sample surveys are declining. An A.I.-assisted visual census, he said, could fill in gaps in the current data, but also provide more timely insights than the traditional census, conducted every 10 years, on hot topics in public policy like \u201cthe geography and evolution of disadvantage and opportunity.\u201d\u201cFor the first time in history, we have the technology to extract insights from very large amounts of visual data,\u201d Mr. Naik said. \u201cBut while the technology is exciting, computer scientists need to work closely with social scientists and others to make sure it\u2019s useful.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 New Year\u2019s Resolutions to Protect Your Technology", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech fixThe cybersecurity nightmares of 2017 highlight the need to protect yourself. Here are some resolutions for living a safer digital life this new year.If 2017 taught you anything about personal technology, it\u2019s that the onus is on you to protect your personal data and devices.Amid Uber\u2019s laundry list of scandals, which included sexual harassment accusations and an undisclosed security breach, there was an important revelation that everyone can learn from. It involved Unroll.me, a free service that unsubscribes you from junk mail.The Unroll.me episode also raised awareness of the sheer number of third-party apps that may be leeching off your personal information. There are probably apps and web services you don\u2019t remember downloading or subscribing to, and they could still have access to your data.At least once a year, it\u2019s worthwhile to do an audit on your third-party apps. On your smartphone, delete apps that you have not touched in several months. For a clean break, in some cases you will also have to visit the company\u2019s website and request that your account be deleted entirely.Also check your primary online accounts, like Facebook, Twitter or Google, to see which apps are hooked into them. Chances are you have used those accounts to quickly sign up for a web tool or app. The ones you never use may still be leeching off your personal data, so you should disable them.On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to the account. On your Google account page, you can find a similar apps list labeled \u201cConnected apps & sites.\u201d And on Twitter, go to the Apps page under \u201cSettings and privacy.\u201d On my neglected Facebook account, for example, I had 82 connected apps. After removing many unused or defunct apps, like LivingSocial, Words With Friends and Draw Something, I had 32 left.When you browse the web, a broadband provider helps route your device\u2019s internet traffic to each destination website. Every device you use has an identifier consisting of a string of numbers, also known as an IP address. When you are on the internet, a service provider can see which devices you use and which sites you visit.VPNs help cloak your browsing information from your internet provider. When you use VPN software, your device connects to a VPN provider\u2019s servers. That way, all your web traffic passes through the VPN provider\u2019s internet connection. So if your internet provider was trying to listen in on your web traffic, all it would see is the VPN server\u2019s IP address connected to the VPN service.The trend with these fancy new smartphones is to make the display take up as much of the face as possible. That means that a larger part of the body is composed of glass, which is susceptible to shattering. (The iPhone X even has a glass back so it can be charged wirelessly.) This trend is likely to continue, because people love having more screen.Advertisement"}

Microsoft\u2019s highest closing value in 1999, when translated into today\u2019s dollars, was roughly $901 billion.Apple\u2019s value has been rising for quite some time. Earlier in this decade, Apple passed Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company in the contemporary stock market.To put its current size in context, Apple is worth more than the entire G.D.P. of Turkey.But Apple\u2019s dominance is not just a question of inflation. Using another metric \u2014 Apple\u2019s weight in the current stock market \u2014 IBM and AT&T, in their halcyon days, were far more dominant than Apple is today.No surprise: When the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, Apple is the largest company on the list by a large margin, followed by Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Microsoft. In this list, all three hit their high point in November. Apple has been moving above and below its pinnacle since then, and its value was just above $895 billion at the close of trading Wednesday.The list is basically split between the hot markets of the last 25 years: the current one, which started in March 2009, and the stock market surge associated with the dot-com era and its aftermath. General Electric was in fourth place over all, based on its $594 billion market cap in August 2000.

That would have been enough to place it in third place, without taking inflation into account.But over extended periods, the compounding effects of inflation are powerful. That $647 billion translates into a nearly 40 percent increase in value in November 2017 dollars. It has probably gained slightly more since November, because inflation has remained positive.General Electric has been shrinking lately as it restructures. But in inflation-adjusted terms, its August 2000 market cap is still growing and it moved up one spot on the list, to third place. Cisco and Intel moved into fourth and fifth place, based on their soaring shares during the dot-com boom.Even more than the first list, the inflation-adjusted ranking provides a reminder of the stock market highs during these two exuberant periods \u2014 the dot-com era in 1999 and 2000, and the bull market that is still underway.Seven of the all-time biggest companies reached their peaks in October or November, the most current data in this ranking, and 12 of the companies did so from late 1999 to early 2001.Exxon Mobil is the only company to have achieved a top-20 market cap unaided by the momentum of one of these rising stock market eras. In inflation-adjusted terms, Exxon\u2019s peak occurred in July 2007, several months before its pinnacle in nominal 2007 dollars.Share of the total market since 1980 NO.

Using this metric, Apple in late 2017 does not tower over the rest of the stock market as much as many other companies did in previous eras.In fact, although Apple\u2019s market cap is far higher today than it was five years ago, Apple shares represented a larger share of the total stock market in September 2012 than they do now.The Apple of 2017 does not show up at all in either of the two Top 20 lists that Mr. Poukchanski produced, one starting in 1980 and one going all the way back to 1925.In December 1985, IBM\u2019s shares constituted 4.4 percent of the entire stock market, a higher percentage than any other company since 1980.That is a very high figure, given the enormous expanse of the universe covered by the Center for Research database, which included 6,225 stocks for December 1985. (By contrast, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has, as you might imagine, 500 stocks; the Dow Jones industrial average has 30.)In November, Apple\u2019s shares constituted only 2.5 percent of the overall stock market. In September 2012, they reached 3.2 percent of the total market, far more than today.In other words, many other stocks have become giants in the 2017 market: Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook and more.  Apple does not tower over them as much as IBM once did over its contemporaries.Share of the total market since 1925NO.

In March 1928, General Motors accounted for 8 percent of the stock market. And in 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8 percent of the market of that day.One explanation for the outsize status of these companies in earlier times is that the stock market itself was much smaller: 6,715 listings in November compared with only 704 in May 1932 and 584 in March 1928. It was easier to be a big fish in those smaller ponds.That said, at the end of 1985, when IBM\u2019s market cap was far larger than any other company\u2019s, there were 6,225 publicly traded stocks in the market, nearly as many as today. So the size of the stock market isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation:  Companies like IBM and AT&T simply were more dominant than Apple is now.For example, the old AT&T was so big that Standard & Poor\u2019s excluded it from a predecessor to the S.&P. 500-stock index \u201cbecause S.&P. did not want to let the performance of such a large firm dominate the index,\u201d as Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in his book, \u201cStocks for the Long Run.\u201dConsidered a monopoly, the old AT&T was forcibly broken up in 1984. (A descendent of the company is embroiled in antitrust issues of its own, arising from its proposed merger with Time Warner).But a 1935 law during President Roosevelt\u2019s administration called for the abolition of such holding companies. After a lengthy court fight, U.G.I. transformed itself into a much smaller entity. On the list of the most dominant companies, it is an artifact of a bygone era.These questions may seem strange today, and those who are so inclined may celebrate as Apple sets new stock market records. But it is worth recalling that other companies played monumental roles in the stock market, until their day was done.Notes: All data as of Nov. 30, 2017.

{"Headline": "Months After Storm, Puerto Rico Stares Down Another Blow: The Tax Bill", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is really a devastating blow for Puerto Rico, in our greatest time of need,\u201d Gov. Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3 said on Friday.The tax bill\u2019s effect on Puerto Rico could have been worse: Had Republicans opted for the House version of the bill, American companies that import goods from their affiliates abroad would have been charged a 20 percent excise tax. That tax, intended to keep American profits from being shifted overseas, would have threatened much of Puerto Rico\u2019s pharmaceutical and medical industry. It ultimately did not make the compromise plan.Though Puerto Rico is home to 3.4 million United States citizens, the tax code treats the island as both a foreign and domestic entity. American affiliates in Puerto Rico get tax breaks like the ones granted to foreign companies, while the goods they produce are sold as made in America.The tax on intellectual property, which includes patents and design rights, would make Puerto Rico less attractive for business, compared with foreign countries that offer lower tax rates for manufacturers, said Ram\u00f3n Ponte, president of the Puerto Rico C.P.A. society.\u201cA lot of companies are going to look at the numbers and decide that, under the circumstances, it\u2019s better to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue is not Puerto Rico versus the mainland: It\u2019s really Puerto Rico versus its competitiveness with other foreign jurisdictions.\u201dIf Republicans want to protect American jobs, as President Trump has pledged, then Congress should consider Puerto Rico a domestic entity, said Mr. Rossell\u00f3, who spent last Wednesday on Capitol Hill, making one last push for support. The governor predicted the tax plan would renew debate on the island about its commonwealth status. A vote on the tax bill could come as early as Monday or Tuesday.Mr. Rossell\u00f3 accused Republican leaders \u2014 several of whom made highly publicized trips to Puerto Rico after Maria \u2014 of reneging on Congress\u2019s commitment to help the island regain its financial footing.\u201cCongress essentially turned its back on Puerto Rico, and essentially failed in its mission,\u201d said Mr. Rossell\u00f3, a member of the island\u2019s pro-statehood New Progressive Party who also identifies as a Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s just penalizing Puerto Rico. It\u2019s putting Puerto Rico in a worse-off position than it was yesterday.\u201d\u201cThe Task Force believes that Puerto Rico is too often relegated to an afterthought in congressional deliberations over federal business tax reform legislation,\u201d lawmakers wrote.Among the task force\u2019s recommendations that the final tax bill ignored: allowing lower-income Puerto Rican families with one or two children to qualify for an additional child-tax credit that currently kicks in only after a third child.Last month, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said lawmakers would address Puerto Rico\u2019s tax concerns in negotiations with the Senate.\u201cIt is our intention to make improvements to our tax reform legislation as it relates to Puerto Rico when we go to conference,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a Nov. 16 statement issued jointly with Representative Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, Puerto Rico\u2019s nonvoting member of Congress.Now, however, it appears Puerto Rico\u2019s requests will have to wait until next year, when Congress could draft bills to extend tax credits or make technical corrections to the law. One of Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n\u2019s suggestions, to create \u201copportunity zones\u201d offering tax incentives for manufacturing, remains a possibility, said Representative Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\u201cI think more can be done as well, but I think this is important,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just absolutely committed to helping that island rebuild.\u201dPuerto Rico is sensitive to tax decisions made in Washington. In 1996, President Bill Clinton authorized the repeal of a 1976 provision that gave American companies significant tax incentives to establish their subsidiaries on the island. Those perks helped turn the island into a biotech manufacturing hub, but critics countered that most of the benefit went to wealthy investors, not local workers.Once the incentives were fully phased out in 2006, at a time when manufacturing was declining across the nation, Puerto Rico plunged into a recession that has lasted for more than a decade.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How 2017 Became a Turning Point for Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThis was a terrible year for the tech industry.Yet underneath this apparent success was a momentous shift in how the tech business deals with the world. Five or 10 years from now, we will come to regard 2017 as a turning point.Why? Because this year, for the first time, tech giants began to grudgingly accept that they have some responsibility to the offline world. The scope of that responsibility, though, is another matter entirely.Let me explain how this is all playing out.Think of these platforms as the roads, railroads and waterways of the information economy \u2014 an essentially inescapable part of life for any business or regular person who doesn\u2019t live in a secluded cabin in the woods.For years, despite their growing power, tech platforms rarely garnered much scrutiny, and they were often loath to accept how much their systems affected the real world. Indeed, the online ethos has been that platforms aren\u2019t really responsible for how people use them. It might as well be the slogan of Silicon Valley: We just make the tech, how people use it is another story.In 2017, that changed. At first grudgingly and then with apparent enthusiasm, platform companies like Facebook began accepting some responsibility for how they are affecting the real world. They did not go as far as some critics would have liked \u2014 but in many significant ways they offered a shift in tone and tactics that suggested they were rethinking their positions.Many tech titans were obviously unprepared for the serious questions that began coming their way a year ago. When the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked about his site\u2019s role in the 2016 election just days after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory, he responded with a line from tech\u2019s old playbook: It was a \u201cpretty crazy idea,\u201d he said, that misinformation on Facebook had \u201cinfluenced the election in any way.\u201dNow that tone is gone. Mr. Zuckerberg has apologized for his glibness. And during Facebook\u2019s last earnings report to investors, he put the company\u2019s social mission at the top of his agenda. \u201cProtecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d he said.Sure, all this could just be marketing. But I\u2019m inclined to believe the shift represents a new way of navigating the world, for a few reasons.First, employees are demanding a new way. The highly paid workers of Silicon Valley were lured on the promise of changing the world, and in the past year many became demoralized about their companies\u2019 apparent impact. In some cases they\u2019re pushing their bosses to change.Not this time.If the big shift of 2017 is that tech companies now accept some responsibility for how their platforms impact the world, the big mystery of 2018 and beyond is what, exactly, that responsibility will look like.Mr. Zuckerberg said he was willing to risk the company\u2019s profitability to improve its community. Facebook has been testing new ideas for making its News Feed less divisive and less prone to misinformation, and for promoting what the company calls \u201cmeaningful\u201d social connections. Facebook is also testing systems that it said would more stringently police advertising, in the hope of preventing foreign actors from using its ad network to influence an election.But what if these early efforts don\u2019t mitigate the problems? What if Facebook finds that offering people a less polarized News Feed dramatically reduces engagement on its site, affecting its bottom line? Or what if the changes disproportionately affect one political ideology over another \u2014 would Facebook stick with a kind of responsibility that risks calling into question its impartiality?I don\u2019t mean to offer a barrage of hypotheticals just for the fun of it. My point is that these issues would probably be pretty hard to solve.\u201cJust as the packaged food industry did in the 1950s, Facebook and Google have lured users with convenience, while feeding them a diet certain to cause lasting harm,\u201d Roger McNamee, the musician and venture capitalist, told me. \u201cThe problem cannot be addressed by hiring; it can only be fixed by changing the algorithms in ways that will materially reduce profitability.\u201d\u201cI would give tech a C grade,\u201d Ms. Pao, who is now the chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, wrote in an email. \u201cLeaders are doing the bare minimum to address problems and are far from doing all that is necessary to solve the problem.\u201dShe said she hoped for a far more vigorous effort that ushered in a complete overhaul of the culture of tech companies, and that held leaders accountable.\u201cIt means firing all the people involved in the failures, from the C.E.O. to the H.R. leaders to the board members in some cases,\u201d she wrote.Ms. Pao\u2019s and Mr. McNamee\u2019s comments underline the real problem for the industry. Once you accept that you\u2019re on the hook for fixing problems caused by the thing you built, people will start to expect that you really will fix them \u2014 even if the solutions are expensive or otherwise conflict with your business interests.So, yeah, 2017 was a terrible year for the tech industry. If the fixing does not actually happen, 2018 might well be worse.Advertisement"}

Then they worked lawmakers.More from Tory Newmyer of the WaPo:Long before congressional tax writers began detailing their proposals, the industry groups helped recruit 22 House Republicans to write to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.).

Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), urged the panel not to \u201carbitrarily punish investors in real estate, venture capital, private equity and other partnerships.\u201d The tax package, they wrote, needed to bolster \u201clong-term investment in American companies.\u201dTwenty-two lawmakers in the House \u2014 and the support of Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, who was a primary writer of the House legislation, was enough to potentially block that chamber\u2019s bill.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedIn a surely coincidental series of announcements, several companies \u2014 including AT&T, Comcast, Wells Fargo, Fifth Third Bancorp and Boeing \u2014 announced that they were giving their employees bonuses or higher wages, and increasing investment in light of the passage of the Republican tax bill.\u201cThe really hard question a year from now is going to be is how much of the miniboom we see is just an acceleration of stuff that was going to happen anyway or additional investment that is really going to spur the economy,\u201d said Mihir A.

Not acquisitions.\u2022 Is Broadcom making a jobs promise it can\u2019t fulfill?\u2022 Republicans have a two-seat majority in the Senate. Alabama hasn\u2019t had a Democratic senator in 25 years, but the controversy around Roy Moore has made a once-safe seat potentially up for grabs.\u2022 Even if the tax legislation is signed into law this year \u2014 we\u2019ll get to the state of play in a moment, though there\u2019s a chance things don\u2019t get wrapped up before the holidays \u2014 Republicans still have plenty of other issues, from health care to infrastructure spending, that will have to get through the Senate.Having Doug Jones, Mr. Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, in the Senate would make that effort more difficult. (So could having a Republican senator who feuds with Mitch McConnell and other G.O.P. leaders.)That point was one of six observations that Goldman\u2019s economic team put out Tuesday. Here are a few others:The answer? Not very, especially for a company with more than $250 billion in cash on its balance sheet and a market value within spitting distance of $1 trillion.Apple has disclosed only 11 acquisitions valued at $4.5 billion in its history, according to Thomson Reuters.To put that into perspective, we asked Thomson Reuters to pull some numbers. (One note on the data below, deal values include completed acquisitions and ones that are currently pending.)\u2022 The most acquisitive company? General Electric, which has made 1,206 acquisitions valued at $311 billion. Of course, G.E. has been around for more than a century, while Apple went public in 1980. So how does Apple compare with other tech companies?\u2022 Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, HP and Intel each have made acquisitions valued at more than $50 billion.\u2022 Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which was founded in 1998, has done 223 deals valued at $29 billion. Facebook? The social media giant, which has been around since 2004, has pulled the trigger on 65 deals with a value of $23 billion.\u2022 Apple, in fact, doesn\u2019t even rank in the top 100 most acquisitive tech companies.More from Andrew\u2019s column:Mr. Tan of Broadcom has boasted that he plans to spend $3 billion \u201cin research and engineering.\u201d Mr. Tan has been given high marks for managing the portfolio of Broadcom assets effectively, but he has never been known for industry-changing innovations.Qualcomm has its own headacheWhile some analysts and investors think Qualcomm might raise its bid for NXP as a way to deter Broadcom \u2014 which doesn\u2019t want the NXP deal to become any more expensive \u2014 Qualcomm says that for now it\u2019s sticking by its $110-a-share offer.Under the terms, Interstate will become the exclusive supplier of car batteries to Advance, one of the biggest auto parts sellers in the United States starting this spring.Interstate believes that the partnership could bolster its sales significantly, while Advance is hoping that a product alliance with a well-regarded parts maker would help stanch a 43 percent drop in its stock price over the past year.From a statement by Scott Miller, Interstate\u2019s C.E.O.:This alliance places us where our professional and retail customers are making purchasing decisions, allowing Advance Auto Parts and independent Carquest stores to serve as convenient, one-stop shops to meet our customers\u2019 needs.The department\u2019s long-awaited study of the Senate Republicans\u2019 proposed overhaul runs to about 489 words in length (including the title and footnotes) and, in the reckoning of even conservative commentators, does not actually detail the legislation\u2019s economic effects.The reaction from analysts\u2022 It\u2019s \u201can odd way to analyze a tax bill,\u201d said Scott Greenberg at the Tax Foundation.\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t believe in magic,\u201d said David Brockway, a staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation during the Reagan administration.The tax flyaroundThat clears the path for Disney to buy the Fox television and movie studios, stakes in the international broadcasters Sky and Star and other significant divisions. As we said yesterday, a deal could be struck this week, though it\u2019s unclear whether an announcement would specify a role at Disney for James Murdoch. (If he does get one, it probably would involve overseeing the international broadcast businesses.)A lighter takeThe short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse. No cooperation. Misinformation. Mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem. So we are in a really bad state of affairs right now, in my opinion.Regulators have already tightened the reins on at least one digital currency matter: The food review app Munchee canceled its initial coin offering yesterday after the S.E.C. issued a warning about the forthcoming deal.The Bitcoin flyaround\u201cThose who bought bonds in the hopes of windfall profits should not be protected at the expense of the island, its economy and its future.

{"Headline": "Video Game Creators Seek Out Hollywood for Robust Narratives", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Pete Samuels, a founder and the chief executive of Supermassive Games, began working on a survival horror adventure video game called Until Dawn in 2015, he knew he wanted the story to unfold like that of a horror film.\u201cThe gaming audience is growing, and tastes are broadening,\u201d Mr. Samuels said. \u201cGreat films and great television that tell good stories are more widely available to many more people than ever before, and there\u2019s definitely an increasing population of the gaming audience that are enthusiastic for games with a thoughtfully constructed narrative.\u201dIn an era of prestige television, high-quality streaming services and indie films that sometimes haul in blockbuster box office receipts, video games are facing stiff narrative competition. So video game creators are increasingly turning to film and television writers to help craft their stories.Last December, Naughty Dog, the studio behind blockbuster action-adventure franchises like Uncharted and The Last of Us, announced that Halley Gross, a writer and story editor on HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld,\u201d would help write the studio\u2019s coming game, The Last of Us Part II. The game will follow its two protagonists, Ellie and Joel, as they make their way across post-apocalyptic America fighting off zombielike monsters.But writing for a video game can present hurdles for television and film writers. That\u2019s because unlike film and TV audiences, gaming audiences are not passive spectators. With a story-based game, you expect to be able to exercise some agency over how the story unfolds \u2014 or at least to experience the story in a way that feels more intimate and personal than a film or television show. Writers have to take that interactivity into account.With The Last of Us Part II, Ms. Gross approached that challenge together with Neil Druckmann, Naughty Dog\u2019s creative director. Ms. Gross, who is a gamer, said she signed on for the project because it was an opportunity to learn more about making games while working with characters she was already familiar with.\u201cI believe storytelling in games has the opportunity to create an unmatched level of empathy,\u201d Ms. Gross said. \u201cYou\u2019re not just a spectator. You\u2019re experiencing someone\u2019s journey firsthand.\u201dAt the outset, they approached the game similar to the way they would a season of television, said Ms. Gross, with the two brainstorming the entire story line and figuring out major milestones for the narrative. Once those were in place, the similarities between writing for television and games fell away.\u201cIn television, you\u2019re collaborating with other writers,\u201d Ms. Gross said, and \u201conly once the script is in a fairly locked form do other departments get involved,\u201d she explained. \u201cAt Naughty Dog, each narrative beat is infused with not just the ideas of the writers, but also by design, art, and more.\u201dOver time, Mr. Whitta said, he figured that his skills would be less needed in the video game industry. That\u2019s because he expected storytelling to become more developed in the industry itself. \u201cAs the skill sets become more mature, developers will devote more internal resources to it, developing their own story talent,\u201d he said.For now, building robust and dynamic stories can still be difficult, especially in games that have several outcomes depending on what each player decides. When developing the story for Until Dawn, for example, Mr. Fessenden worked with a collaborator, the writer and director Graham Reznick, whose credits include the 2008 experimental horror feature film \u201cI Can See You.\u201d Together, they crafted a creepy cabin-in-the-woods story focused on a group of teenagers.The game was conceived as a first-person game, which Mr. Reznick said felt \u201cmuch less cinematic.\u201d Supermassive Games then decided to switch to a third-person perspective, and began employing techniques usually reserved for films, like fixed camera angles, editing between shots, and high resolution facial capture for the actors.\u201cThis let us actually write dialogue and express ideas closer to how we would in film \u2014 a loaded glance in a cutaway could be much more powerful than a line of dialogue shouted from offscreen,\u201d Mr. Reznick said.In the game\u2019s final version, players can alternate among characters during the game, making decisions that affect the outcome. The game, which features the voices and likeness of the actors Rami Malek and Hayden Panettiere, was released on the PlayStation 4 in 2015. It later won a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for its originality.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Moves to End Secrecy in Sexual Harassment Claims", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMicrosoft, one of the world\u2019s biggest software makers, said on Tuesday that it had eliminated forced arbitration agreements with employees who make sexual harassment claims and was also supporting a proposed federal law that would widely ban such agreements.The moves make Microsoft an early company \u2014 and certainly the most prominent \u2014 to take such steps to end legal agreements that have been criticized for helping to perpetuate sexual abuse in the workplace. Forced arbitration lets companies keep harassment and discrimination claims out of court, effectively cloaking them from public view and, in some cases, allowing serial harassers to continue their conduct for years.\u201cThe silencing of people\u2019s voices has clearly had an impact in perpetuating sexual harassment,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said in a phone interview.Microsoft\u2019s action shows how the flood of harassment accusations has gone beyond individual cases to an examination of policy changes for ending the misconduct. That includes greater scrutiny of legal settlements that have silenced victims of abuse.In one prominent case, an arbitration clause nearly prevented Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News anchor, from bringing her lawsuit over sexual harassment against Roger Ailes, the former chairman and chief executive of Fox News. Ms. Carlson found a legal maneuver allowing her into court, but many employees are not as lucky.Mr. Smith of Microsoft said he first became aware of the Senate bill after meeting with Mr. Graham in Washington to discuss cybersecurity and immigration. Mr. Graham urged Microsoft to support the bill, Mr. Smith said.\u201cWhat this legislation does is ensure that peoples\u2019 voices can always be heard by going to court, if that\u2019s what it takes for those voices to be heard,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of step that can make a difference.\u201dHe said eliminating the arbitration requirement for harassment claims by its own employees represented an immediate step the company could take while the Senate bill was being considered. The move is largely symbolic because only a minority of Microsoft workers \u2014 numbering in the hundreds in its senior ranks, according to Mr. Smith \u2014 have been subject to the requirement. Microsoft will still require those employees to take claims unrelated to harassment and gender discrimination to arbitration. In total, Microsoft has about 125,000 employees around the world.In a statement, Microsoft said it did not tolerate sexual harassment or assault. \u201cWe work hard to create a safe work environment for every employee,\u201d the company said, adding that it encouraged the former intern to take her complaint to law enforcement.Ms. Gillibrand said that getting rid of the arbitration agreements would benefit employers in the long run. \u201cWithout the secrecy of mandatory arbitration agreements, serial predators will be less likely to continue climbing the corporate ladder and employees won\u2019t be forced to stay quiet about the harassment they have faced at work, which is good for employees and good for business,\u201d she said in a statement.By using the arbitration clauses to bar people from joining together as a group, employers \u2014 both large and small \u2014 have effectively taken away one of the few tools that workers have to fight harassment or discrimination.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has found that forced arbitration \u201ccan prevent employees from learning about similar concerns shared by others in their workplace.\u201d Given the proliferation of the clauses, some regulators and civil rights experts also worry that arbitration clauses can obscure patterns of wrongdoing.Strict confidentiality can turn up in a variety of contexts, from payday-lending outfits, which sometimes rely on them to conceal the true identity of lenders that operate through shell companies, to personal relationships. Employment contracts are among the most problematic, lawyers said.The more often companies head to arbitration, the better their chances of winning the case, according to the conclusion of a 2011 analysis by Alexander J. S. Colvin, a professor at Cornell University\u2019s School of Industrial and Labor Relations.Of 3,945 employment cases decided by arbitrators from one of the nation\u2019s biggest arbitration firms, plaintiffs prevailed in about 31 percent of them when employers had only one case before the arbitrator, according to Mr. Colvin\u2019s study. The rate of victory for employees plummeted by more than half when companies had multiple cases before the same arbitrator.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Jessica Silver-Greenberg from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jerry Richardson, Facing Misconduct Allegations, Will Sell Panthers", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe N.F.L.\u2019s 32 teams are some of the most valuable assets in sports, and they rarely change hands.Then on Friday, the Panthers said they had hired lawyers to look into accusations against Richardson, the team\u2019s founding owner. On Sunday, the N.F.L. said it would take over the investigation. Hours later, Richardson announced he would sell the team in yet another scandal for the league amid an already tumultuous season that has included a nationwide debate over players protesting during the national anthem.\u201cI believe that it is time to turn the franchise over to new ownership,\u201d Richardson said.An N.F.L. spokesman, Joe Lockhart said the league had not decided whether it would drop its investigation.Still, Richardson\u2019s decision represented a swift fall for a man who at times has been among the N.F.L.\u2019s most powerful owners. At 81, he has controlled the team for nearly a quarter-century, having bought the franchise when it was created in 1993. For years, Richardson held sway over many important committees, and was an influential player in the league\u2019s latest labor deal, which came after the owners locked out the players for several months in 2011. He was also the co-chair of the search committee for a new commissioner, which wound up being Roger Goodell. On Sunday, Richardson spoke with Goodell.Though he has stepped back from the league\u2019s affairs in recent years, partly because of a series of health issues, Richardson continues to have many allies among his fellow owners, and he is the only current owner who also played in the N.F.L. He spent the 1959 and 1960 seasons with the Baltimore Colts.The allegations against Richardson came as the league, like so many other businesses, has faced accusations of sexual harassment in its midst. Five former N.F.L. players were among those named in the lawsuit against NFL Network.Richardson\u2019s departure was startling because he is the face of the Panthers organization, and because N.F.L. teams are the ultimate buy-and-hold asset in sports. He had previously said that the team would be sold when he died. Now, he will oversee that sale once the season ends.\u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s a passing of the torch,\u201d said Marc Ganis, a sports consultant and a longtime adviser to Richardson. \u201cThere\u2019s an inevitability to some of it. But this is not a happy way for it to happen.\u201dSeveral of Richardson\u2019s employees came to his defense on Sunday. The Panthers\u2019 interim general manager, Marty Hurney, who returned to the team in July after a five-year absence, said he had never seen Richardson commit any sexual or racial misconduct in the office.Panthers quarterback Cam Newton said that Richardson had been a father figure to him during his years in Charlotte.\u201cFor me, I hope things don\u2019t alter my thinking of Mr. Richardson,\u201d Newton said after the Panthers beat the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. \u201cBut I do know that he has given me some things that I will forever be appreciative of.\u201dThe sale of the Panthers will be the first of an N.F.L. team since 2014. The Buffalo Bills were the last team to be sold, after their founding owner, Ralph Wilson died. The team went for a $1.4 billion, a record at the time for an N.F.L. team.By offering to sell the team, Richardson has saved the N.F.L. from a potential confrontation and an investigation that could have damaged the league\u2019s image at a time of heightened anger over sexual harassment. Under the league\u2019s constitution, owners can lose their clubs for acts \u201cdetrimental to the league.\u201d Still, it\u2019s somewhat surprising that the N.F.L. \u2014 known for its deliberate approach to any major change \u2014 and Richardson reacted so quickly and so dramatically to allegations of workplace misconduct.Just three years ago, the league strengthened its personal conduct policy to include not just players, but all league personnel. That decision was made after several star players were charged with domestic violence.Richardson\u2019s impending sale brings to mind the furor over the Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was recorded on tape making racist remarks.Other owners have given up their teams amid controversy. Nearly 20 years ago, the San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo pleaded guilty to felony charges stemming from a corruption case involving Edwin Edwards, the former Louisiana governor.The N.F.L. fined DeBartolo, who was also barred from actively controlling the 49ers for a year. Rather than return to the league, DeBartolo ceded control of the team to his sister, Denise York.DeBartolo was inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the relationship between NFL Network and the six men who were suspended from their jobs after a former wardrobe stylist for the network leveled accusations of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Three were current employees of the network, not all six. (The other three were former employees of the network and were suspended by their current employers.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Net Neutrality Was Repealed and How It Affects You", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to repeal Obama-era net neutrality rules, which required internet service providers to offer equal access to all web content without charging consumers for higher-quality delivery or giving preferential treatment to certain websites.Many consumer advocates have argued that if the rules get scrapped, broadband providers will begin selling the internet in bundles, not unlike how cable television is sold today. Want to access Facebook and Twitter? Under a bundling system, getting on those sites could require paying for a premium social media package.\u201cThe internet, the speed of it, our entire business revolves around that,\u201d David Callicott, who sells paraffin-free candles on his website, GoodLight, said last month.\u201cIt\u2019s basic economics,\u201d Mr. Pai said in a speech at the Newseum in April. \u201cThe more heavily you regulate something, the less of it you\u2019re likely to get.\u201d\u201cDid these fast lanes and slow lanes exist?

{"Headline": "Nintendo\u2019s Switch Brings Some Magic Back", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJake Kazdal, an American video game developer who lives in Kyoto, Japan, spent a night in early March refreshing the website of GameStop, the video game retail chain in the United States. He wanted to buy Nintendo\u2019s just-released console, the Switch. But the device had already sold out in Japan, forcing him to look elsewhere.While Mr. Kazdal had bought Nintendo\u2019s previous console, the Wii U, a few years earlier, he soon had buyer\u2019s remorse. \u201cAfter a few short games at my folks\u2019 place, everyone was done,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Uh-oh.\u2019\u201dThe announcement of the Switch, however \u2014 a sort of two-in-one device that can be played at home or on the go \u2014 lowered his skepticism about Nintendo. Nine months later, his support is full-throated.\u201cIt\u2019s what the Wii U should have been,\u201d he said.Mr. Kazdal\u2019s changing view on Nintendo is widely shared. This time last year, the company that made Mario and Donkey Kong household names seemed to have lost both its audience and its enchanted touch. Players were moving elsewhere. Losses were piling up.But thanks largely to the arrival of the Switch in March, Nintendo has had a startling turnaround year.Nintendo\u2019s internal target for its first-year sales of the Switch has risen to 16 million from 10 million. In the company\u2019s most recent quarterly report, released in October, it announced profit of $209 million, after regularly reporting losses in previous quarters. Its stock is up more than 75 percent this year.\u201cNeither analysts nor investors predicted the strength of adoption for the Switch,\u201d says Piers Harding-Rolls, who leads a group of game industry analysts at IHS Markit, a research firm.After years of resistance, Nintendo has also embraced the widespread move to mobile gaming that has reshaped the industry. Late last year, it introduced Super Mario Run, bringing the mustachioed plumber to the iPhone for the first time. Introducing new versions of some classic consoles, like the Super Nintendo, has also provided a revenue lift.But the major reason for the company\u2019s recent success has been its ability to identify and correct several problems with the Wii U, a console it released in 2012.Third-party publishers made few games for the system, and Nintendo\u2019s games, while lauded, were released infrequently, then not at all.The problems started with branding, however. The device\u2019s name implied an iterative upgrade to the Wii, an earlier hit that popularized motion-sensing controllers, but the Wii U was a much different console.The Wii U\u2019s controller, which included an iPad-like screen that allowed for new game possibilities but also defied easy explanation, compounded the problem.\u201cIt was a bit difficult for consumers to understand what the system was about,\u201d said Shigeru Miyamoto, a top executive at the company and the creator of many of Nintendo\u2019s most celebrated games during the past three decades.Satoru Iwata, the company\u2019s president when the Wii U was released, recognized these issues. Before his death in 2015, from complications related to cancer, he set in motion changes that have helped the company since.Much of the marketing has focused on that versatility, an easy concept to convey. The console, Mr. Miyamoto said, combines \u201call of the different play styles we\u2019ve explored through our products in the past.\u201dThe system features novelties of its own too: the detachable controllers allow two players to compete or collaborate without the need for additional hardware.\u201cI became particularly interested in the Switch because of the controllers,\u201d said Nele Steenput, a 30-year-old artist from Oxford, England. \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun with a lot of people.\u201dMr. Iwata also planned a steady schedule of game releases, to help ensure that the console\u2019s momentum continued in the months after its release.Breath of the Wild took the 30-year-old Zelda series into more open worlds. Other inventive games have followed, like ARMS, a boxing game in which characters pummel one another with elastic limbs that can be given different deadly appendages.In October, the company released Super Mario Odyssey, a game that, for the first time in the series\u2019 history, took Mario to destinations that looked like real-world locations, like New York City.\u201cWe have deliberately maintained a pace of content that we were unable to achieve with the Wii U,\u201d said Reginald Fils-Aim\u00e9, president of Nintendo of America.This output is being led by a new generation of young game designers overseen by Shinya Takahashi, a little-known executive who has recently taken over Nintendo\u2019s hardware and software divisions.\u201cWhile we were truly saddened by Iwata\u2019s passing, it came at a time when new leaders were rising in the company,\u201d Mr. Takahashi, 54, said.Even people like Mr. Miyamoto, 65, a leading figure at Nintendo since the 1980s, is ceding control at the company\u2019s Japanese headquarters.\u201cMore and more I am trying to let the younger generation fully take the reins,\u201d Mr. Miyamoto said.This younger generation has been carefully chosen; Mr. Miyamoto says he wants people who are more likely to create new kinds of play, rather than merely aim to perfect current ones.\u201cI always look for designers who aren\u2019t super-passionate game fans,\u201d Mr. Miyamoto said. \u201cI make it a point to ensure they\u2019re not just a gamer, but that they have a lot of different interests and skill sets.\u201d Some of the company\u2019s current stars had no experience playing video games when they were hired.Kosuke Yabuki, a 37-year-old mentee of Mr. Miyamoto, said the company has not changed how products are made. \u201cOur mission remains the same: to find unique ways to explore play,\u201d he said. \u201cThe difference is that, perhaps, now is our time.\u201dMaintaining this newfound momentum through 2018 presents a significant challenge, however. As the majority of Nintendo\u2019s staunchest fans now own the console, the company must focus on attracting new believers, a difficulty when the company has announced no major releases from its own Mario and Zelda franchises to persuade buyers.That means Nintendo will need outside developers to provide critical support. Those developers have typically been cautious about supporting Nintendo\u2019s machines, because the technology inside them is relatively distinct compared with those made by Microsoft and Sony, two main rivals. That makes it more expensive to build a game that works for all three brands.But with the Switch, Nintendo has worked hard to court support of major publishers such as Ubisoft, EA and Bethesda. In November, the Japanese game studio Square-Enix told investors that, in addition to researching which of its games could be brought to Nintendo\u2019s system, it will also be \u201caggressively making games for Switch.\u201dNintendo has also been courting smaller game makers, referring to independent developers who bring their games to the Switch as \u201cNindies.\u201d Some have already enjoyed success. Lizardcube, the Paris-based developer of Wonder Boy, has reported that the Switch version of its game outsold all other platform versions combined.Still, many players worry about the Switch\u2019s prospects in the coming year and beyond.\u201cI am worried about the longevity of the system over Nintendo\u2019s penchant for abandoning things,\u201d one Twitter user wrote this week, while canvassing views as to whether he should invest in the product.But Phil Harrison, a former vice president for the video game divisions at both Microsoft and Sony, said the last year reinforced an old and important lesson.\u201cNever underestimate Nintendo,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
